Many of those amendments may \nbe worked out or perhaps not even offered. Therefore, we expect we can \nfinish the Foreign Operations appropriations bill at an early hour \ntoday. We will have rollcall votes throughout the day until final \npassage of that measure.\n  As a reminder to my colleagues, we filed a cloture motion on the Dorr \nnomination. That nomination is to be Under Secretary of Agriculture for \nRural Development. That cloture vote will occur on Thursday morning.\n  There are a number of other important issues we have mentioned over \nthe course of the last couple days, including last night, that we will \ncontinue to work toward agreements on. I will keep all of our \ncolleagues apprised as the schedule changes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/20/senate-section/article/S8503-8", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8503-S8504]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             SUPREME COURT NOMINATION OF JOHN ROBERTS, JR.\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, today in the Senate we will undertake one \nof our most significant and historic constitutional responsibilities. \nThe eyes of all Americans and of history will be focused upon us. The \nAmerican people, through their votes, have entrusted us with the \nconstitutional responsibility to provide advice and consent on Supreme \nCourt nominations. They have entrusted us to govern as their elected \nrepresentatives. We must ask ourselves: How will the American people \nview us--how will history judge us--for the deliberations we begin \ntoday?\n  It is my goal the American people will say, and history will record, \nthat we were fair and thorough, that we treated our Supreme Court \nnominee, Judge Roberts, with dignity and respect, and that we worked \nexpeditiously to confirm Judge Roberts before the Supreme Court began \nits new term in October.\n  Leading up to his announcement last night, the President engaged in a \nselection and a consultation process that can be characterized with a \nfew words: ``bipartisan,'' ``inclusive,'' and ``unprecedented.''\n  The President and his White House reached out to both Republicans and \nDemocrats. He listened thoughtfully to our views and he thoughtfully \nwelcomed our suggestions on potential nominees and on the nominations \nprocess. In all, the White House contacted more than 70 Senators, \nincluding more than two-thirds of the Democratic Caucus and, of course, \nevery single member of the Judiciary Committee.\n  The President was not required by the Constitution to reach out or \nconsult. He was not required to take any time at all. He could have \nrushed through his choice. He could have nominated someone on the same \nday Justice O'Connor announced her retirement without consulting \nanyone, but he did not. The President sought input because he believed \nit was the right thing to do. I commend him for this inclusive \napproach, which I believe has strengthened the overall integrity of \nthis process.\n  Now we move to the next stage. Last night the President announced the \nnomination of Judge John Roberts, Jr., to be an Associate Justice of \nthe Supreme Court.\n  Most Americans are getting their very first glimpse of the nominee.\n\n[[Page S8504]]\n\nWhat do we know about him? Born in Buffalo, NY, in 1955, Judge Roberts \nwas raised in Indiana with his three sisters. He ventured off to \nMassachusetts for college at Harvard and graduated summa cum laude with \na bachelor's degree in, as we have heard, only 3 years. During the \nsummers, he worked at a steel mill to help pay for college.\n  But his academic journey did not stop here. He then enrolled in \nHarvard Law School, where he once again excelled. He earned the coveted \nposition of editor of one of the most well-respected law journals in \nthe country, the Harvard Law Review.\n\n  After graduating from law school with high honors, Judge Roberts \nserved as a law clerk to Judge Henry Friendly on the Second Circuit, \nand then to William Rehnquist, who was then an Associate Justice on the \nSupreme Court.\n  In 1981, he continued his legal career at the Department of Justice \nas the Special Assistant to the U.S. Attorney General, and then as \nAssociate Counsel to President Reagan.\n  In 1986, Judge Roberts entered private practice, joining the law firm \nof Hogan & Hartson, where he specialized in civil litigation. Three \nyears later, he returned to public service as the Principal Deputy \nSolicitor General of the United States.\n  During his legal career, he has argued an impressive 39 cases before \nthe Supreme Court--39 cases. To put that in perspective, only a few of \nthe 180,000 members of the Supreme Court bar have ever argued a single \ncase before the high Court.\n  In January 2003, President Bush nominated Judge Roberts to serve on \nthe DC Circuit Court of Appeals, often referred to as the second \nhighest court in the land.\n  Upon his nomination to the appellate court, more than 150 members of \nthe DC Bar--including both Republicans and Democrats--expressed support \nfor Judge Roberts. In a letter to the Senate Judiciary Committee, they \nwrote that Judge Roberts is ``one of the very best and most highly \nrespected appellate lawyers in the nation, with a deserved reputation \nas a brilliant writer and oral advocate.''\n  Judge Roberts' nomination was well received by the Judiciary \nCommittee and was favorably reported out of the committee by an \noverwhelming, bipartisan vote of 16 to 3, and on May 8, 2003, he was \nunanimously confirmed by the Senate.\n  I believe Judge Roberts is exactly the kind of Justice America \nexpects on the Supreme Court. He is among the best of the best legal \nminds in America. He is a mainstream conservative, someone who \nunderstands that the role of a judge is to interpret the law and the \nConstitution and not to legislate from the bench.\n  He is someone who will be fair, openminded, and impartial--not \nsomeone who will prejudge cases, predetermine outcomes, or advance a \npersonal political agenda.\n  In short, he is a Supreme Court nominee who will make America proud. \nThroughout his life, Judge Roberts has worn many hats: a devoted \nhusband and father of two, a skilled litigator, and a superb jurist. I \nam confident Judge Roberts will be an asset to the Supreme Court and \nthat he will serve with honor and distinction, just as he has on the DC \nCircuit Court.\n  As we look ahead, I do encourage my colleagues to remain focused on \nour three goals: first, conducting a fair and thorough confirmation \nprocess; second, treating Judge Roberts with dignity and respect; and, \nthird, having an up-or-down vote on Judge Roberts before the Supreme \nCourt starts its new term on October 3.\n  These goals are reasonable. These goals are achievable. There are 75 \ndays from today until October 3. It took an average of 62 days from \nnomination to confirmation for all the current Supreme Court Justices. \nIt only took an average of 58 days to confirm President Clinton's \nnominees, Justices Breyer and Ginsburg. And even though some Senators \nheld different philosophical views from these Justices--in many cases \nvastly different philosophical views--they both received up-or-down \nvotes and were confirmed by wide margins. These nominations serve as \nuseful models for us today.\n  Ultimately, I hope this process is marked by cooperation, and not \nconfrontation, and by steady progress, not delay and obstruction.\n  This morning, less than 12 hours after the President's announcement, \nsome extreme special interest groups already are mobilizing to oppose \nJudge Roberts. They are not even giving him the courtesy of reserving \njudgment until the Judiciary Committee hearings. Together, as Senators, \nwe can rise above the partisan rhetoric and obstruction that has \ngripped the judicial nominations process in the past.\n  A thorough investigation and debate on Judge Roberts does not require \ndelay or personal attacks or obstruction. A fair and dignified process \nis in the best interests of the Senate, the Supreme Court, the \nConstitution, and the American people.\n  I look forward to welcoming Judge Roberts to the Senate a bit later \ntoday. I urge my colleagues to join me in congratulating him on his \nnomination to the Supreme Court.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/20/senate-section/article/S8504-1", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8504]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, as we all know now, last night the President \nannounced he will nominate John G. Roberts of the District of Columbia \nCourt of Appeals to the U.S. Supreme Court. I congratulate Judge \nRoberts on this most high honor.\n  Now the Senate begins the process of deciding whether to confirm \nJudge Roberts to a lifetime seat on the Supreme Court. The Supreme \nCourt is the final guardian of the rights and liberties of all \nAmericans. Serving on the Court is an awesome responsibility, and the \nConstitution gives the Senate the final say in whether a nominee \ndeserves that trust. We should perform our constitutional role with \ngreat care.\n  Under the leadership of Chairman Specter and Ranking Member Leahy, I \nam convinced the Judiciary Committee is in good hands. Two of our most \nrespected, experienced lawyers in the Senate are going to operate this \nhearing process. They are exemplary of how we should work on a \nbipartisan basis. Since they have taken over the responsibilities of \nthe Judiciary Committee, there has been real congeniality. Members of \nthe committee seem to be more productive. I am very happy with both \nSenator Specter and Senator Leahy.\n  It goes without saying, as we have heard from the distinguished \nmajority leader, that John Roberts has a distinguished legal career. It \nis very impressive. Both in Government and in private practice, he has \nbeen a zealous and often successful advocate for his clients. As we \nhave learned, he has argued 39 cases before the Supreme Court. For \nthose of us who are lawyers, that is what we would say is a big deal. \nBy all accounts, he is a very nice man. I have not met him. I look \nforward to doing that this afternoon.\n  While these are important qualities, they do not automatically \nqualify John Roberts to serve on the highest court in the land. Nor \ndoes the fact that he was confirmed to serve on the Court of Appeals \nmean he is entitled to be automatically promoted.\n  The standard for confirmation to the Supreme Court is very high. A \nnominee must demonstrate a commitment to the core American values of \nfreedom, equality, and fairness. Senators must be convinced that the \nnominee, John G. Roberts, will respect constitutional principles and \nprotect the constitutional rights of all Americans.\n  So the expectations for Judge Roberts are especially high because he \nhas such large shoes to fill, and I do not mean that literally--large \njudicial shoes.\n  Justice Sandra Day O'Connor has been a voice of reason and moderation \non the Court for 24 years. She has been the deciding vote in some of \nthe most important questions in our society: Questions of civil rights, \ncivil liberties, the right to privacy, and the first amendment freedoms \nof speech and religion.\n  I don't know very much about John Roberts. But one of the things I am \ngoing to look for as a lawyer, as someone who has practiced in the \ntrial bar and, to a more limited extent, the appellate level--I argued \ncases before the\n\n[[Page S8505]]\n\nNevada Supreme Court and the Ninth Circuit, but I certainly don't hold \nmyself out to be an expert in appellate law; I consider myself to be an \nexpert on the trial bar--I believe it is important that we have a \nperson on the Court who believes in precedent, stare decisis, something \nwe learned about in law school. I am hopeful that John Roberts will \nfollow along the same line he took up when he appeared before the \nJudiciary Committee last time, indicating that he believed in \nprecedent. Justice O'Connor, therefore, should be replaced by someone \nlike her in the constitutional mainstream.\n  To gather the information it needs to make this decision, the Senate \nturns, first and ultimately for our ability to get information, to the \nJudiciary Committee. As I have indicated, I have confidence that the \nJudiciary Committee will garner information that is important to the \nAmerican people and allow us to have a better picture of this man with \nhis impressive legal resume. Clearly, a judicial nominee should not \ncomment on pending cases--we all understand that--but there are many \nother questions a nominee must answer. I encourage Judge Roberts to be \nforthcoming in responding to the committee's questions and providing \nwritten materials requested by the Senate.\n  In the end, Judge Roberts must demonstrate to the Senate that he is a \nworthy successor to Justice O'Connor. To do that, he must win the \nconfidence of the American people that he will be a reliable defender \nof their constitutional rights. Judge Roberts has argued many cases in \nhis career, but this is his most important by far.\n  Since Justice O'Connor announced her retirement, I have called on the \nPresident to choose a nominee who can unite the country, not divide it. \nIt remains to be seen whether John Roberts fits that description. I \nhope that he does. I look forward to giving him the opportunity to make \nhis case to the American people.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority whip is recognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise to address the Senate on the \nissue brought to the fore last night by the nomination of John Roberts \nto be Associate Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court.\n  Judge Roberts, as we are all beginning to learn, has an impressive \nrecord. He has keen intellect, sterling integrity, and a judicious \ntemperament. Most importantly, Judge Roberts will faithfully interpret \nthe Constitution, not legislate from the bench. He has earned the \nrespect of his colleagues, and I am confident he will make a fine \naddition to the U.S. Supreme Court.\n  He was raised in middle America in Indiana, a neighboring State to my \nown State of Kentucky. Judge Roberts is a son of the Midwest who went \non to argue a remarkable 39 cases before the Supreme Court, more than \nvirtually any other member of the Supreme Court bar. He graduated summa \ncum laude from Harvard and then graduated with high honors from Harvard \nLaw School where he served as an editor of the Harvard Law Review. If \nthat were not enough, he then went on to clerk for Chief Justice \nWilliam Rehnquist, actually during the Chief Justice's period as \nAssociate Justice, and served in various positions in the Justice \nDepartment. Now he serves with distinction on the DC Circuit Court of \nAppeals, often referred to as the second highest court in the land, \nand, of course, the Senate unanimously confirmed him to that position \nin 2003.\n  The President of the United States has discharged his constitutional \nobligation under article II, section 2 to nominate justices of the \nSupreme Court. He has chosen a truly outstanding nominee. It is now our \njob to provide advice and consent. In doing so, we should follow \nbasically three principles. No. 1, we should treat Judge Roberts with \ndignity and with respect. No. 2, we should have a fair process. And No. \n3, we should complete that process with either an up-or-down vote in \ntime for the Court to be at full strength for its new term beginning \nOctober 3 of this year. These principles are simple and they are sound. \nUnfortunately, the Senate has not always followed them.\n  As to the first principle, the Senate has not always treated judicial \nnominees of Republican Presidents with respect. Last Friday, for \nexample, I recounted how some of our colleagues spoke harshly about \nJustice Souter's fitness for office. Our colleagues' harsh criticism of \nJustice Souter was hardly unique. President George Herbert Walker \nBush's other Supreme Court nominee, Justice Clarence Thomas, suffered \nfar worse attacks. By engaging in an unprecedented level of \nconsultation, the President has respected the views of Senators. Now \nSenators ought to reciprocate and treat Judge Roberts with the same \ndignity and respect that we afforded President Clinton's Supreme Court \nnominees over the last 10 years.\n  The Senate did not defeat Justice Ginsburg's nomination, even though \nshe had argued in her capacity as a private lawyer for such provocative \npositions as abolishing Mother's Day and Father's Day in favor of a \nunisex parents day, and for other even more colorful positions. Those \narguably unusual positions were not held against her during her \nconfirmation process. I can recall voting for Justice Ginsburg myself. \nSimilarly, we should not caricature Judge Roberts' beliefs or views. We \nshould not attribute to him the actions of clients he has represented. \nWe certainly should not criticize Judge Roberts because his position in \na particular case did not mirror a Senator's personal policy \npreferences, nor when it comes to a fair process should we require \nJudge Roberts to prejudge cases or to precommit to deciding certain \nissues in a certain way. We should respect the fact that he may place \nhimself in a compromising position by doing so, just as we did with \nJustice O'Connor, Justice Ginsburg, and other nominees who have come \nbefore us in the past. The inquiry should be thorough but at the same \ntime fair.\n\n  Slow walking the process beyond historical norms and engaging in a \npaper chase simply to delay a timely up-or-down vote are not hallmarks \nof a fair process. The Supreme Court begins its new term on October 3. \nAs Senator Frist has pointed out, the average time for a nomination to \nconfirmation for the current justices was 62 days. The average time \nfrom nomination to confirmation for President Clinton was 58 days. \nJustice Ginsburg was confirmed in only 42 days. The Senate has 72 days \nto complete action on Judge Roberts' nomination, in time for him to \njoin the Court by the start of its new term, October 3. By any \nstandard, that is a fair goal. What is not fair and what is, quite \nfrankly, a little curious is for some of our colleagues who, before \neven having heard a single word of testimony, have already come up with \nexcuses as to why we should depart from this historical standard. It is \ndisturbing that they seek to justify so far in advance why the Court \nshould begin its proceedings at less than full strength.\n  We, on this side of the aisle, are not asking the Senate to change \nits practices or standards. We are not asking that this President be \ntreated better than his immediate predecessor. We are asking for equal \ntreatment. Let's treat President Bush's nominees as we treated \nPresident Clinton's nominees. I am hopeful that the respect the \nPresident has shown the Senate will be reciprocated and that our \nhandling of Judge Roberts' nomination will bring credit to the Senate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I join my colleagues in making brief \ncomments about the selection of Judge John Roberts from the DC Circuit \nCourt of Appeals to serve as Associate Justice of the U.S. Supreme \nCourt, and I follow my colleague from Kentucky in noting how Ruth Bader \nGinsburg was treated--appropriately, properly, with due diligence, and \nspeed so that the nomination went through in an orderly process. She \ntook the seat of Justice Byron White who was one of the dissenters in \nRoe. A number of my colleagues are saying we need to have somebody in \nthis position that is exactly the same as Sandra Day O'Connor in her \nposition. Yet that wasn't the standard that was applied in the most \nrecent case with Ruth Bader Ginsburg, the replacement for Justice Byron \nWhite.\n  The process is as it is. The President nominates. The President \ncampaigned vigorously about the role of the Supreme Court and the role \nof the courts in society today. He has made a noteworthy choice, a \nperson of outstanding\n\n[[Page S8506]]\n\nacademic credentials. I have heard a colleague of mine say: I don't \nknow yet how I will vote, but I would certainly hate to argue a case \nagainst him. Somebody who has argued 39 cases in front of the Supreme \nCourt is very impressive indeed. But I also would like to note that the \nprocess is for the President to nominate and us to vote by a majority. \nThat has been the historical setting, and that is what we should \ncontinued to do in this case.\n  My colleagues have already outlined some of Judge Roberts' excellent \nlegal credentials. He graduated magna cum laude from Harvard Law \nSchool. He clerked for then-Associate Justice Rehnquist.\n  He served as Principal Deputy Solicitor General at the Department of \nJustice. He amassed a strong record as a Supreme Court advocate in \nprivate practice and has distinguished himself as a judge on the court \nof appeals. As one of my colleagues said last night, Senator Schumer, \nJudge Roberts has the ``appropriate legal temperament and demeanor.'' \nWe would call that, from my part of the country, ``midwestern calm.'' \nHe has a great deal of calm demeanor about him that is quite good for \njudicial temperament.\n  I was particularly struck by Judge Roberts' statement at the White \nHouse yesterday evening, speaking extemporaneously and with all the \nskill of a practiced lawyer and as a person of not only a well-trained \nmind but a deep heart. He said he had a ``profound appreciation for the \nrole of the Court in our constitutional democracy.'' The role of the \nCourt in American life and Government is of great concern to the \ncountry today. That statement means a lot--rule of law rather than the \nrule of man. We are a country of laws, ruled by laws and not by the \nwhim of any person or any five people. It is a set of laws. It is a \nConstitution. That is what rules in this country.\n  It is my hope that Judge Roberts and any nominee to the Supreme Court \nwould be faithful to the role originally intended for the courts by the \nFramers of the Constitution. In our system of government, the \nConstitution contemplates that Federal courts will exercise--this is \nvery clear within the Founders--limited jurisdiction. The Federal court \nis to be a limited jurisdiction court. They should neither write nor \nexecute the laws but simply ``say what the law is,'' as former Chief \nJustice Marshall stated in Marbury v. Madison.\n  As Alexander Hamilton explained, this limitation on judicial powers \nis what would make the Federal judiciary the ``least dangerous \nbranch.'' In his view, judges could be trusted with power because they \nwould not resolve divisive social issues, short circuit the political \nprocess, or invent rights which have no basis in the text of the \nConstitution. That was simply not the role of the courts. They were \nsimply to say what the law is, not to write it, not to execute it.\n  The expanded role assumed by the Supreme Court in recent years--and \nin Federal courts generally--makes it all the more important that Judge \nRoberts exhibit proper respect for the restrained role of the Federal \ncourts in American Government. I hope the confirmation process \ndemonstrates that he will live up to the President's ideal of \nnominating individuals who will refrain from making law on the bench.\n  This is a big issue in society today. People want to have \nlegislatures to make laws. That is what we do. They want to have \nexecutive branch to execute. That is what they do. And the Court simply \nsays what the law is. It does not write it.\n\n  Speaking of the confirmation process, I will say a few words about \nwhat to expect in the days ahead. Judge Roberts hardly had a chance to \nstep before the cameras last night before interest groups had attacked \nhim. MoveOn.Org attacked Roberts as a ``right-wing corporate lawyer and \nideologue.'' NARAL Pro-Choice America blasted Roberts immediately as an \n``anti choice extremist,'' urging him to ``help save the Supreme Court \nfrom President Bush.''\n  Even though Judge Roberts was approved as a DC Circuit Court judge in \n2003, 2 years ago, without objection, and received the vote of Ranking \nMember Leahy in the Judiciary Committee at that time as well, the \ninterest groups immediately came out, before a word was said, even \nbefore the President presented him to the public, and made these sorts \nof characterizations of Judge Roberts. It is not right. It is not the \nprocess we should follow. We should look to the record of the \nindividual and we should hold open and in-depth hearings. But there \nshould not be these sorts of characterizations. These statements smack \nof personal attacks and litmus tests and are not becoming of a serious, \nopenminded debate on the nominee.\n  I hope my colleagues resist the demands from these outside groups for \nknee-jerk opposition to Judge Roberts. We should instead live up to the \ntradition of careful, considered debate, which is the heritage of this \ngreat institution. Our deliberation on this nomination should be \nrespectful and it should focus on substance.\n  It would be a tragedy for this body, and for the Republic, if the \nconfirmation process for Judge Roberts reflects the treatment some of \nPresident Bush's nominees to this point, including Roberts himself in \nlooking to be a circuit court nominee, have received. Judge Roberts' \npleasant demeanor should be matched by civil treatment in the Judiciary \nCommittee and on the Senate floor.\n  Finally, neither filibusters nor supermajority requirements have any \nplace in the confirmation process. Those tactics of obstruction should \nbecome the historical relics they deserve to be. The country deserves, \nand the Constitution demands, a prompt, thorough debate, and a fair up-\nor-down vote on Judge Roberts' nomination to the Supreme Court. I look \nforward to being an active participant in that process and also to \nhaving this debate about the role of the courts in American society and \nAmerican Government today. I think it is important that we have those \ndebates. This is an eminently qualified nominee. He deserves fair \ntreatment and a fair up-or-down vote.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Talent). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, the nomination of a Justice to the \nSupreme Court of the United States is a solemn and momentous occasion. \nOur Constitution is the rarest of political documents in human history. \nThose individuals who are appointed for life to be its stewards and \ninterpreters are extremely important to our future.\n  Each Court is made up of nominees from different political eras, \nshaped by unique forces and ideas. It is the dialog among the senior \nJustices and the new ones, those nominated by Democrats and \nRepublicans, and all the backgrounds represented, that gives the Court \nits legitimacy and dynamism.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time designated for the majority has \nexpired, unless the Senator gets unanimous consent for additional time.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, how much \ntime would the Senator be seeking? The only reason I ask is we are \nhaving a major hearing in Judiciary right now and we are trying to work \nit out based on the time that had been allotted.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. No more than 7 minutes. I can probably do it in 5.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am worried about that hearing. Let's do \nthis. I want to accommodate my colleague. I ask unanimous consent that \nhe be allowed to continue for 5 minutes, but that the time not come \nfrom the time reserved for the Democratic side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for that opportunity.\n  When the Court begins its term in October, we will include nominees \nspanning seven administrations and people shaped by events from \nWatergate to September 11 and beyond.\n  The Founders invested the President with the power to make \nnominations to the Federal judiciary and gave the Senate the role of \nproviding advice and consent with respect to any nominee.\n  I am pleased that after extensive and unprecedented consultation with \nthe Senate, President Bush announced Judge John Roberts as his nominee \nto\n\n[[Page S8507]]\n\nbe the next Associate Justice of the Supreme Court, filling the vacancy \nleft by Justice O'Connor.\n  Judge Roberts has a distinguished record and extensive experience. \nJudge Roberts graduated summa cum laude from Harvard University and \nHarvard Law School.\n\n       Judge Roberts clerked for Judge Henry Friendly on the \n     Second Circuit and later for Justice William Rehnquist at the \n     Supreme Court. After his clerkships, he served in the \n     Department of Justice as associate counsel to President \n     Ronald Reagan before going into private practice.\n\n  After 3 years in private practice, Judge Roberts returned to the \nDepartment of Justice as Principal Deputy Solicitor General, a position \nin which he briefed and argued a variety of cases before the Supreme \nCourt.\n\n  Judge Roberts reported favorably out of the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee by a vote of 16 to 3, and he was confirmed by the Senate for \nthe DC Circuit Court of Appeals by a voice vote. The Presiding Officer \nand myself were there at that time. By unanimous consent this judge was \nconfirmed.\n  I look forward to learning more about the nominee's views on the \nproper role of the judiciary at his confirmation hearings, as well as a \nthorough floor debate in which all are heard.\n  Again, and above all, Judge Roberts' nomination should be handled \nwith the utmost dignity and respect, which the position he has been \nnominated to deserves. The fact that the nominee is a person of \ncharacter and integrity will add to the tenor of the proceedings.\n  The nominations process needs to be fair, including a fair hearing, a \nfloor debate in which all views are heard, and then an up-or-down vote \non confirmation, so he can be sitting on the Supreme Court when the \nterm begins in October of this year.\n  Judges are like umpires. They should be neutral. We trust them not to \npick sides before the game begins but to fairly apply the rules. We \nshould measure our nominees on whether they will give all parties a \nfair shake and consider the merits of every dispute, not based on \nwhether we like particular results.\n  In carrying out my part in the Senate's role, I have always believed \nour Founding Fathers intended judges to interpret the Constitution \nrather than make law from the bench. The law needs to be stable and \ndependable, for the good of the whole society. I will continue to \nevaluate nominees based on whether they demonstrate competence, \nappropriate judicial temperament, and a commitment to the fair \nconstruction of our Constitution and our laws.\n  It is important that the Senate act promptly so we have a nine-member \nSupreme Court in October when the new term begins. There is no reason \nwhy that should not happen.\n  I commend the President for both his selection and the process he \nwent through to make it. Sandra Day O'Connor has been a historic and \nwise figure on the Court. I hope her legacy of grace and class will \nextend to the process by which her seat on the Court will be filled. \nWhen Ronald Reagan appointed her, it changed our Nation for the better, \nand she has been a remarkably strong and influential figure even \noutside the confines of the Court.\n  I am honored by the opportunity the people of Minnesota have given me \nto examine the President's nominee. I will render a judgment on the \nPresident's choice with the values and expectations of Minnesotans in \nmind. It is an exciting time for this country to reexamine our \nconstitutional processes and democratic institutions and come together. \nI think that is important. We have a unique opportunity to come \ntogether and have a dignified process, not to be pulled by special \ninterest groups that will try to dictate what we should do based on \ntheir beliefs rather than what is good for the country. What is good \nfor the country is to have a process in which we examine the character \nand integrity and judicial temperament of a candidate, not their \nposition on a particular case. If you look at the history of Judge \nRoberts, who was in the Solicitor General's Office, he argued cases \nthere; he did his job. Folks will say he argued that the Supreme Court \ndoesn't require taxpayers to pay for abortions. They will point to a \ncase where he defended U.S. law to protect the American flag. He was \ndoing his job and he did it well. We should be looking at whether he \ndid it well.\n  I commend the President on his choice and look forward to a \nconfirmation process of dignity, respect, and commitment to the best \ninterests of our Nation a generation into the future.\n  We pride ourselves on being the greatest deliberative body in the \nworld. This is our moment to show that to the country and the world. \nLet us do it right.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that, in light of \nthe additional 5 minutes on the other side, 5 minutes also be added to \nthe time on this side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I thank the distinguished Presiding Officer.\n  Mr. President, capping days of public speculation that maybe the \nPresident would appoint Judge Edith Clement or Attorney General Alberto \nGonzalez or any number of other people, the President made a dramatic \nevening announcement of his intention to nominate Judge John Roberts to \nsucceed Justice Sandra Day O'Connor on the U.S. Supreme Court.\n  The President called Senator Frist, Senator Reid, Senator Specter, \nand myself last night before this announcement to discuss it. I \nappreciated his call and the reasons he gave for the nomination. As I \nsaid to him last night, he has done his part of the equation, a very \nimportant part as President. He nominates the Justice. It is \ninteresting that, in a nation of 280 million Americans, only 101 of us \nget a chance to actually have a say in who is going to serve on the \nSupreme Court, a person who is there to protect the rights of all \nAmericans on the one body that is to be the ultimate check and balance \nin our Government. Of the 101, first, of course, is the President \nmaking the nomination. But then the 100 men and women in the Senate \nhave an awesome responsibility to the rest of the Nation in how we \nvote. That is our job. The Senate has to fulfill its constitutionally \nmandated duty to ensure those who receive lifetime appointments to our \nhighest Court will protect the rights and liberties of all Americans--\nnot those of just one political party or the other but of all \nAmericans--that they will uphold our Constitution and our laws and that \nthey will be impartial in their judicial approach.\n  As I said, the President has announced his choice. Now we in the \nSenate have to rise to the challenge and get to work. To fulfill our \nconstitutional duties, we need to consider this nomination as \nthoroughly and carefully as the American people expect and deserve. \nThat is going to take time. It will take the cooperation of the nominee \nand the administration. It will require Republicans, as well as \nDemocrats, to take seriously our constitutional obligations on behalf \nof all the American people, not just a select few. I will say similar \nthings to Judge Roberts when I meet with him later today.\n  Justice O'Connor serves as a model Justice. She is widely respected \nby America as a jurist with common sense and practical values who \nbrought no agenda from the far left or the far right. She did not \nprejudge cases. She cast the critical deciding vote in a number of \nsignificant cases. Her legacy of fairness is one that all Americans \nshould want to see preserved. For 24 years on the Supreme Court, she \nhas tried to decide cases fairly and with an open mind. I thank her for \nher service to the country and her graciousness in agreeing to serve \nuntil her successor is considered and confirmed by the Senate and \nappointed by the President.\n  I regret that some on the extreme right have been so critical of her \nand so adamantly opposed to a successor who shares her judicial \nphilosophy and qualities. Their criticism reflects their own \nnarrowmindedness and biased agenda. I regret that they have taken out \nads and gone on the news trying to tarnish her record. Frankly, the \nAmerican people know better, and nothing will tarnish the record of the \nfirst woman Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court.\n  I have noted that our neighbor to the north, Canada, a country that \nis only an hour's drive from my home in\n\n[[Page S8508]]\n\nVermont, also has a supreme court with nine members, but four of them \nare women, including the Canadian chief justice. I look forward to the \ntime when the membership of the U.S. Supreme Court is more reflective \nof America as Canada's supreme court is more reflective of that \ncountry.\n  I know Hispanics across the country are disappointed the President \nhas missed this extraordinary historic opportunity to pick a candidate \nwho will make the Court more diverse. I hope he will consider that in \nfuture nominations.\n  There was no dearth of highly qualified individuals who could have \nserved as unifying nominees while adding to the diversity of the \nSupreme Court. Reports last week mentioned Judge Sonia Sotomayor of the \nSecond Circuit and Judge Edward Prado of the Fifth Circuit. Certainly \nthese are the kind of candidates worthy of consideration.\n  Judge Sotomayor was first appointed to the Federal court by President \nGeorge H.W. Bush, the President's father. Judge Prado was first \nappointed by President Reagan and elevated to the circuit by the \ncurrent President Bush. They are among the people who should be \nconsidered. There are many outstanding Hispanic judges and African-\nAmerican judges who could have added to the diversity of the Supreme \nCourt and made it more representative of all Americans.\n  Last week, Chairman Specter and I spoke about our interests in having \nthe President consider nominees from outside what I call the ``judicial \nmonastery.'' I believe their life experience is important and that the \nSupreme Court could have benefited from someone with experiences that \nwere not limited to those of a circuit judge. Certainly, this is a \nconsideration the President should make if he has further nominees. I \nwish he had done so with this nomination.\n  So now, however, the nomination has been made. The President has \nspent several weeks in determining who he wants. He has made his \nselection. Now it is the Senate's turn to decide what we will do. Above \nall, we in the Senate need to ensure that the Supreme Court remains \nprotective of all Americans' rights and liberties from government \nintrusion and that the Supreme Court understands the role of Congress \nin passing legislation to protect ordinary Americans from abuse by \npowerful special interests.\n  No one is entitled to a free pass to a lifetime appointment to the \nSupreme Court, whether nominated by a Democrat or by a Republican. And \nthere are far different considerations for the Supreme Court than there \nare for circuit courts. How the nominee views precedent, what the \nnominee regards as settled law, how the nominee will exercise the \nincredible power of a Supreme Court Justice to be the final arbiter of \nthe meaning of the Constitution--all of these raise very different \nconsiderations than those for a lower court nominee. In addition, a \nnominee coming from the appellate bench will have a record there in \nvotes and opinions and performance that will provide important \nadditional insights into his likely tenure as a Supreme Court Justice.\n\n  We have to take the time to evaluate this nominee for a lifetime \nposition on the Supreme Court. After all, if confirmed, Judge Roberts \ncould be expected to serve to the year 2030 or 2040. So we have to have \ntime to perform due diligence on Judge Roberts' record and judicial \nphilosophy. The Senators on the committee have to have time to prepare \nfor fair and thorough hearings. I ask all Senators to be mindful of the \nSenate's fundamental role in this process. The Americans put us all \nhere to do an important job, and it is critical that we treat that \nresponsibility with the seriousness and respect it deserves.\n  I start, as I always have, from the premise that the Supreme Court \nshould not be a wing of the Republican Party or a wing of the \nDemocratic Party. It has that responsibility not only to all 280 \nmillion Americans but also to millions and millions of future \nAmericans. The independence of the Federal judiciary is critical to our \nAmerican concept of justice for all. The Supreme Court provides a \nfundamental check in our system of government. We have to ensure that \nit serves as a bulwark of individual liberty against incursions or \nexpansions of power by the executive branch. We also have to ensure \nthat the Supreme Court respects the role of Congress when it acts to \nprotect Americans from those with great power, to improve their lives \nwith environmental laws, and by reining in powerful special interests.\n  We know that the current Supreme Court is the most activist Supreme \nCourt in my lifetime. Time and time again, they have set aside \ncongressional laws, some of long standing, and basically written new \nlaws of their own. There was a time when my friends on the other side \nof the aisle were very opposed to the idea of an activist Supreme \nCourt. Now we find that two of the heroes of the right are the most \nactivist members of the current Supreme Court, Justice Thomas and \nJustice Scalia.\n  Ours is a nation based on the rule of law. The test of a good judge \nis his or her ability to apply the law fairly. As I evaluate candidates \nfor lifetime appointments that often span not merely years but decades, \nI want to make sure that everybody who comes before the Court can look \nat that Justice and say: I can be treated fairly no matter who I am, no \nmatter what political party I belong to, no matter what my station in \nlife.\n  They are going to be there a long time. Justice O'Connor served for \n24 years. Chief Justice Rehnquist has served for 34 years. Since 1970, \nthe average term has been 25 years. So we are considering a nomination \nnot just for the period remaining in the Bush administration, which is \ngoing to end in 2008, but for our children's and grandchildren's \nfutures, 2030 and beyond.\n  This nomination fills the seat that Justice O'Connor occupied while \nserving as the ``swing'' or decisive vote in so many cases, and if her \nsuccessor does not share her judicial philosophy, that replacement \ncould radically change the Court in the way our Constitution is \ninterpreted.\n  It is critical we not prejudge a nominee and that the Judiciary \nCommittee be accorded the time to develop a full record on which \nSenators can base an informed judgment. I was disappointed to hear \nsomebody say last night: Why can't we move immediately to the hearings? \nCome on, the American people would justly feel on something such as \nthis that their rights have been shortchanged.\n  I look forward to working out agreements with Chairman Specter on \nprocedures to allow the kind of thorough consideration that a nominee \nto a lifetime appointment to the Supreme Court deserves, and I know \nChairman Specter feels the same way.\n  A preliminary review of Judge Roberts' record suggests areas of \nsignificant concern that need exploration. We have to consider his \nservice on the circuit court, even though that is quite limited. We \nneed to understand how he will exercise judicial power.\n  An independent study--and I referred to this earlier--demonstrated \nthat the Rehnquist Court has been the most activist Court in my \nlifetime in overturning congressional enactments and restricting \nlegislative authority--actually the most activist since before the New \nDeal. The most activist members, of course, as I said earlier, are \nJudge Thomas and Judge Scalia. We need to know what kind of Supreme \nCourt Justice John Roberts would be.\n  When I talked with the President, I said I hoped that they would \ncooperate so that all relevant matters can be constructively explored \nas we begin this important process. When I meet with Judge Roberts \ntoday, I will ask for his cooperation. After all, the Constitution \nspeaks of advise and consent. It does not speak about nominate and \nrubberstamp. That, incidentally, is a position I have taken whether it \nhas been a Democrat or a Republican on the Supreme Court.\n  I look forward to hearings that will inform the Senate and the \nAmerican people in making the Senate's confirmation decision. I have \nbeen here for hearings and to vote on all nine members of the Supreme \nCourt and for one other who did not make it. Presidents come and go. \nSenators come and go. The Supreme Court Justices tend to be there a lot \nlonger than all of us. I want to make sure we do our job the right way.\n  Mr. President, I know there are other members of the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee who wish to speak. In fact, I see the member of the committee \nwho has either presided over or been present for\n\n[[Page S8509]]\n\nmore Supreme Court nominations than any Member now serving in the \nSenate. I yield to the distinguished senior Senator from Massachusetts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I thank my friend and colleague from \nVermont. Listening to Senator Leahy reminded us that the Judiciary \nCommittee is in good hands, with Senator Specter and Senator Leahy \nensuring we are going to have a fair, open, transparent, and timely \nhearing, the way the American people deserve. We thank him for his \ncontinued service on the Judiciary Committee and for how he is \ndeveloping this whole process. It is going to be done with great \ndignity. I thank Senator Leahy.\n  Mr. President, the nomination of John Roberts to the Supreme Court \ncomes at a time of heated debate and great division in America--a \ndebate that is reflected in the deliberations of a Supreme Court in \nwhich his vote--just like Justice O'Connor's--will affect the freedoms \nand liberties of Americans on vital questions before the country.\n  I will not prejudge the President's nominee. And I will not decide \nwhether to support or oppose him based on any single issue.\n  What all Americans deserve to know is whether Judge Roberts respects \nthe core values of the Constitution and falls within the conservative \nmainstream of America, along the lines of Justice Sandra Day O'Connor.\n  That is the issue, and I look forward to asking the important \nquestions that are on the minds of Americans as they consider his \nnomination to our Nation's highest court.\n  Supreme Court nominations involve far more than the hotly-debated \nsocial issues so often discussed in the media. Presidents have 4-year \nterm. Senators serve for 6 years. But Supreme Court Justices serve for \nlife, without ever having to face the electorate. Our decision whether \nto confirm a Supreme Court nominee affects the rights and freedoms not \nonly of our generation, but those of our children and grandchildren as \nwell.\n  The Court's decisions affect whether employees' rights will be \nprotected in the workplace. They affect whether families will be able \nto obtain needed medical care under their health insurance policies. \nThey affect whether people will actually receive the retirement \nbenefits that they were promised. They affect whether people will be \nfree from discrimination in their daily lives. They affect whether \nstudents will be given fair consideration when they apply to college. \nThey affect whether persons with disabilities will have access to \npublic facilities and programs. They affect whether we will have \nreasonable environmental laws that keep our air and water clean. And \nthey affect whether large corporations are held accountable when they \ninjure workers and consumers.\n  Each of these issues--and many others--has been addressed by the \nSupreme Court in recent years. In many of these cases, the Court was \nnarrowly divided, and these issues are likely to be the subject of \nfuture Court decisions in the years to come.\n  Because so much hangs in the balance, Supreme Court nominees have a \nheavy burden to show that they will uphold justice for all. They must \ndemonstrate a core commitment to preserving equal protection of the \nlaws, free speech, workers' rights, and other individual rights. \nAmericans deserve to know if nominees will be on the side of justice \nand individual liberties, or if they will side with powerful special \ninterests.\n  The Senate's role will be to establish clearly whose side John \nRoberts would be on if confirmed to the most powerful court in the \nland. Because Judge Roberts has written relatively few opinions in his \nbrief tenure as a judge, his views on a wide variety of vital issues \nare still unknown. What little we know about his views and values lends \neven greater importance and urgency to his responsibility to provide \nthe Senate and the American people with clear answers.\n  The key question is whether he will uphold core constitutional and \nstatutory principles.\n  For instance, in a case involving the ability of Congress to protect \nthe environment, he issued an opinion with sweeping implications not \njust for the environment, but for a host of other important \nprotections. In it, Judge Roberts questioned the settled interpretation \nof the commerce clause--the constitutional provision that is the \nfoundation for not only the environmental laws that protect our natural \nheritage and ensure that we have clean air and clean water in our \ncommunities, but also for Social Security, Medicare, the minimum wage, \nand many other important national protections. I can imagine few things \nworse for our seniors, for the disabled, for workers, and for families \nthan to place someone on the highest court in the land who would put \nthese protections at risk.\n  If applied in other cases, Judge Roberts' view could severely \nundercut the ability of Congress to respond to real challenges facing \nour nation. His decision raises questions about whether he would roll \nback a host of other laws protecting civil rights, workers' rights, \ncivil rights, and even many of our federal criminal statutes.\n  I believe that most Americans would agree that we should not re-fight \nthe civil rights battles of the past. The spirit of America is to move \nforward to greater opportunity--not return to the days of second class \ncitizenship for many. Too many of our fellow citizens over many \ngenerations have sacrificed everything--including their lives--so that \nothers can fully enjoy the fruits of our liberties and freedoms. They \nhave given their all for the rights of people of color, of women, of \nthe disabled, of immigrants, of workers, of senior citizens, and so \nmany who make up the vibrant American fabric that makes our nation the \nenvy of the world.\n  So it is important to know where Judge Roberts stands on this great \nquestion of opportunity and justice for all.\n  The significance of the constitutional principles at issue is clear \nfrom the comments of other judges who serve in the same court as Judge \nRoberts. They noted that the constitutional provision he questioned not \nonly is the basis of many of our civil rights laws, but also underlies \nimportant product safety laws and environmental legislation.\n  Judge Roberts urged the full court to review the panel decision to \nreconsider the established interpretation of the commerce clause in the \nRancho Viejo v. Norton case.\n  Let me be clear. I do not prejudge Judge Roberts's nomination based \non his decision in this case or any other. Nor should anyone else. But \nwe must not fail in our duty to the American people to responsibly \nexamine Judge Roberts' legal views.\n  Other aspects of Judge Roberts's record also raise important \nquestions about his commitment to individual rights. He has opposed \nprograms to guarantee equal opportunity. He opposed the right to \nprivacy and argued to overturn Roe v. Wade, saying the case is \n``wrongly decided'' and ``finds no support in the text, structure or \nhistory of the Constitution.'' As a private attorney, he represented \ncoal companies against workers' rights. He sought to limit every \nAmerican's right to a lawyer by arguing to narrow the Supreme Court's \ncore precedent in Miranda v. Arizona.\n  Judge Roberts represented clients in each of these cases, but we have \na duty to ask where he stands on these issues. I don't prejudge them, \nbut the American people deserve to know more.\n  I join my colleagues in the hope that the process will proceed with \ndignity. But the nominee will be expected to answer fully, so that the \nAmerican people will know whether Judge Roberts will uphold their \nrights. Anything less would make the Senate a mere rubberstamp in \nSupreme Court nominations.\n  In recent days, some have suggested that the Senate should not ask \nfull questions about the nominee's legal views and judicial philosophy. \nThe President made clear that he would consider judicial philosophy in \nchoosing a nominee, and the Senate should not turn a blind eye to that \nissue.\n  When Justice Thurgood Marshall was nominated to the Supreme Court in \n1967, I said that Senators should not vote against him just because \nthey don't agree with him on every issue. But that is different from \nsaying we should not consider judicial philosophy at all. Particularly \ntoday, when philosophy is important to the White House in choosing \nnominees, Senators should consider it as well.\n\n[[Page S8510]]\n\n  To be clear, here is what I said in 1967:\n\n       I believe it's recognized by most Senators that we are not \n     charged with the responsibility of approving [justices] if \n     [their] views always coincide with our own . . . We are \n     really interested in knowing whether the nominee has the \n     background, experience, qualifications, temperament, and \n     integrity to handle this most sensitive, important, and \n     responsible job.\n\n  But if someone would clearly fail to uphold basic rights, that should \nbe considered and the Senate is entitled to know.\n  There are few debates more important than this one, and I look \nforward to considering this important nomination.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Isakson). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

And I hope my \nfriend and colleague Senator Leahy is trying to narrow down amendments \nlikewise on the Democratic side.\n  In the meantime, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nLugar be added as cosponsor to amendment 1299, which the Senate adopted \nlast night.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1293\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I call up amendment No. 1293 and ask for its immediate \nconsideration. It has been cleared on both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Kentucky [Mr. McConnell], for Mr. Lugar, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 1293.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To promote reform of the multilateral development banks)\n\n       On page 326, between lines 9 and 10, insert the following:\n\n            TITLE VII--MULTILATERAL DEVELOPMENT BANK REFORM\n\n     SEC. 7001. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       In this title:\n       (1) Appropriate congressional committees.--The term \n     ``appropriate congressional committees'' means the Committee \n     on Foreign Relations of the Senate and the Committee on \n     Financial Services of the House of Representatives.\n       (2) Multilateral development bank.--The term ``multilateral \n     development bank'' has the meaning given that term in section \n     1622 of the International Financial Institutions Act (22 \n     U.S.C. 262p-5).\n\n     SEC. 7002. ANTICORRUPTION PROPOSALS AND REPORT.\n\n       (a) Proposals.--Not later than September 1, 2006, the \n     Secretary of the Treasury shall develop proposals, including \n     establishing one or more trusts and a set-aside of loans or \n     grants, to establish a mechanism to assist poor countries in \n     investigations, prosecutions, prevention of fraud and \n     corruption, and other actions regarding fraud and corruption \n     related to a project or program funded by a multilateral \n     development bank.\n       (b) Report.--Not later than September 1, 2006, the \n     Secretary shall submit to the appropriate congressional \n     committees a report on the proposals required by subsection \n     (a).\n\n     SEC. 7003.

This amendment has been cleared on both sides of the \naisle.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no debate, without objection, the \namendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 1293) was agreed to.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I move to reconsider and table that motion.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The journal clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Graham). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, today, we will be voting on final passage \non the Foreign Operations appropriations bill. I want to take this \nopportunity to thank my colleagues for their tremendous work and, in \nparticular, Senator McConnell for his stewardship of this bill.\n  Diplomacy and foreign policy are the essential pillars of our \nnational security. They reflect the values, principles, views, and \ninterests of the people we represent, the American people. They are \ncentral to advancing the U.S. role and our place, our stature, in the \nworld.\n  America's national security depends on our ability to integrate and \ncoordinate all of the elements of our national power. It includes \ndiplomacy, intelligence, economic strength, and military might.\n  The Foreign Operations bill advances those efforts and demonstrates \nour generosity and our priorities. The legislation provides $9.7 \nbillion to ensure that the Department of State and other related \nagencies and our personnel serving overseas have the tools, the \nequipment they need to advance America's security.\n  In the past year, freedom movements have swept the globe--in Ukraine, \nin Georgia, the elections in Afghanistan and Iraq, Lebanon, and the \nPalestinian territories--and have inspired literally millions around \nthe world. Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and Egypt have also taken demonstrable \nsteps toward democracy. Having visited most of those countries, and \nhaving had the opportunity to speak directly to senior officials in \neach, I have seen real changes, impressive changes.\n  The spread of democracy unifies our values, unifies our national \ninterests. As Americans, we believe every person has the right to live \nin a free society where they can choose their own leaders, have a hand \nin their own destiny, and secure a bright future for their children. \nAnd democracy, along with all the hope and progress it brings, creates \npeace and stability between the United States and our friends and \nallies.\n  The Foreign Operations bill provides $120 million for the Middle East \nPartnership Initiative to help spread democracy among the Arab people. \nBy promoting economic, educational, and political reform in the Middle \nEast, we marginalize our terrorist enemies. They lose their state-\nsponsored safe havens, they lose potential recruits, and they lose the \nability to exploit political grievances for terrorist gain.\n  Democracy provides an engine for the people, not the terrorists, to \nwin, to take responsible and peaceful action to better their lives, \ntheir countries, and hold their leaders accountable. The United States \nmust continue to provide support to the activists and reformers in the \nMiddle East. These heroes make great sacrifices for the cause of \nfreedom, and they are critical allies in our fight against terrorism.\n  We must also continue to support our work providing aid and \nhumanitarian relief. America leads the world in providing international \naid. But too often international aid money never reaches the very \npeople it is intended to help. It is stolen or wasted by corrupt or \ninefficient governments. That is why this bill strengthens \naccountability requirements. The Millennium Challenge Corporation \nrequires recipient governments to take clear steps, verifiable steps, \nto govern justly in an open, transparent democratic way, to invest in \npeople by improving education and health care, to promote economic \nfreedom so their economies can grow and provide jobs. Against this \nbackdrop, aid money can do the most good.\n  Today, many throughout the developing world--particularly in Africa, \nwhere I was 2 weeks ago--suffer from devastating diseases. We know \nthem: HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria. These deadly diseases have the \npotential to decimate entire populations and to prevent those nations \nfrom ever becoming modern, prosperous countries.\n  The legislation before us allocates $2.9 billion for the President's \ninitiative against HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria. Two billion of \nthat total is directed to the Global HIV/AIDS Initiative, $400 million \ncovers our contribution to the Global Fund to fight AIDS, tuberculosis, \nand malaria. In total, the bill allocates $203 million above the budget \nrequest for this coming fiscal year. These funds are targeted to help \nwhere it is needed most. They zero in on the 15 countries in Africa, \nAsia, and the Caribbean.\n  I again thank my colleagues and the President of the United States \nand the American people for their generosity and for their leadership \nin this great humanitarian effort.\n  A number of other health-related programs are also incorporated into \nthe foreign operations bill--$1.6 billion has been allocated for the \nChild Survival and Health Programs Fund. This includes $375 million for \nchild survival and maternal health, which is an increase of $49 million \nabove last year's level. In addition, this funding includes $30 million \nfor vulnerable children and an additional $285 million for infectious \ndiseases.\n  Today, around the world, there are more than 600,000 pregnancy-\nrelated deaths and more than 4 million deaths among newborn babies per \nyear. Most of these tragedies are preventable. The Foreign Operations \nbill provides $375 million to prevent these deaths.\n  Many of these problems we see around the world stem from the lack of \navailable clean drinking water and proper sanitation in many regions of \nthe world. Water-related illnesses pose fatal threats to vulnerable \npopulations, especially children.\n  Every 15 seconds a child dies from a disease contracted from unclean \nwater. According to the World Health Organization, approximately 1.1 \nbillion around the world lack access to clean, safe water sources; 2.6 \nbillion people lack access to basic sanitation.\n  As a result, approximately 1.8 million people die very year from \ndiarrheal disease. Ninety percent of those deaths occur in children \nunder the age of 5.\n  And if we do nothing, with an increasing world population and further \nconstraints on our world's water resources, the problem is only \nexpected to get worse.\n  I commend the assistant majority leader, Senator McConnell, the \nchairman of the Foreign Operations Appropriations Subcommittee, for \nproviding $200 million to the U.S. Agency for International Development \nfor safe water programs in his bill. Fifty million dollars of that \namount is targeted to programs in Africa where the need is great.\n  Private, nonprofit sector programs are also working hard, including \nthe Millennium Water Alliance, Water for People, Water Leaders \nFoundation, and Living Water International. These groups are dedicated \nto delivering comprehensive, safe water technologies throughout the \nglobe.\n  Some are building major infrastructures. Some are digging wells and \nproviding hand pumps to villages. Others are developing lightweight, \nlow-cost, low-energy water purification systems that could be available \nto distribute to communities, schools, and orphanages for combating \nwater-related diseases in Africa.\n  I commend all of these organizations for their dedication and \ncompassion. Together we are working to make this an International \nDecade for Action known. In 10 years, we intend to cut in half the \nnumber of people around the globe who lack access to safe, clean water.\n  Another demonstration of America's compassion is our work with the \neffects of civil strife, especially war and\n\n[[Page S8512]]\n\nviolence. This appropriations bill will provide $74 million for the \nConflict Response Fund to assist in stabilizing and reconstructing \ncountries impacted by conflict or civil strife.\n  In addition, $900 million is allocated for Migration and Refugee \nAssistance and $40 million for the Emergency Refugee and Migration \nAssistance Fund.\n  Unlike many donor countries, the United States strives to ensure that \nforeign assistance is effective, that it is distributed to those who \nneed it the most, and that it gets measurable results.\n  In addition to foreign aid, the foreign operations bill also \naddresses the most dangerous threats we face today--the spread of \nweapons of mass destruction and the global war on terrorism. This bill \nprovides $440 million for nonproliferation, anti-terrorism, and other \nrelated programs.\n  We are working closely with our friends and allies to secure \nstockpiles of WMD-related materials and technology, and make sure that \nthey have the capability to protect these sensitive materials.\n  The bill also provides funding and assistance for our coalition \npartners in the global war terrorism. The legislation includes $4.6 \nbillion for foreign military financing.\n  This funding, along with other national resources committed by our \ncoalition partners, is essential for improving the capabilities of our \ncoalition allies so that they can continue to make their vital \ncontributions to this global effort.\n  The $86 million allotted for the international military education and \ntraining programs will ensure that our allies maintain the ability to \nwork closely with American forces on the battlefield and take \nindependent initiative to the fight against terrorism.\n  The United Nations also has an important role to play in the advance \nof democracy and the fight against terror. The world organization \nprovides a medium for nations to discuss and resolve differences \npeacefully through dialogue and diplomacy.\n  It also monitors particular international agreements to ensure that \nnations are fulfilling their obligations and commitments. The U.N. is \nalso critical to organizing and providing humanitarian and other \nassistance to the world's most desperate regions.\n  In order to carry out these functions effectively, however, the U.N. \nmust undergo serious reform.\n  The United Nations needs to take action against its officials who are \nguilty of waste, fraud, and abuse. And it must also take steps to make \nthe organization as a whole ore accountable, transparent, and \nefficient.\n  The United Nations has many positive contributions yet to make. But, \nin order to fulfill its mission, it must do more to clean house.\n  America's foreign policy reflects the values, beliefs and culture of \nthe American people and the history of our great Nation. By advancing \nour values abroad, the United States not only makes the world a better \nplace, it makes it a safer place, too.\n  As a free people, we are duty bound to share the blessings of liberty \nwith citizens around the globe.\n  Our generation, no less than the one before, is compelled to confront \nthe challenges of our times--and to fulfill America's destiny, in the \nwords of the Great Emancipator, as mankind's last, best hope.\n\n\n                                 sudan\n\n  Last night, the Senate passed a resolution to support the fragile \npeace process between the government in Khartoum and the southern \nSudanese. I applaud my colleagues for their compassion and concern for \nthis troubled region of the world.\n  The resolution calls upon the U.S. Government to closely monitor the \npeace process now underway. It also focuses our attention to the \ncontinuing crisis in Darfur, and calls for continued pressure on \nKhartoum to end its genocidal campaign and bring justice to the \ncriminals who have ravaged the people and the land of Darfur.\n  Eleven days ago, the leaders of Sudan took an historic step.\n  John Garang, leader of the Sudanese Liberation Army, returned to the \ncapitol of Khartoum for the first time in 21 years to be sworn in as \nSudan's vice president. Dr. Garang told the cheering crowd over a \nmillion strong, ``My presence here today in Khartoum is a true signal \nthat the war is over.''\n  Together, he and President Bashir signed a new interim constitution \nofficially forming the National Unity Government of Sudan. Under this \nagreement, Sudan will enter a 6-year interim period. At the 4-year \nmark, nationwide elections will be held at the provincial level, as \nwell as for the national legislature. The interim period will culminate \nwith a vote by the people of southern Sudan deciding their political \nfuture.\n  After two decades of brutal civil war that has killed 2 million \npeople and displaced over 4 million more, north and south are finally \non the verge of genuine peace.\n  It is a fragile moment, but one for celebration.\n  Last month, I had the opportunity to meet with Dr. Garang in my \noffice here in Washington. During our meeting, he emphasized to me that \nfor the peace to hold, both parties must fulfill their obligations \nunder the peace agreement signed last January.\n  He also stressed that pressure from the United States is critical. \nThe civil war and its aftermath have created a staggering humanitarian \ncrisis. And he is not confident the government in Khartoum will fulfill \nall of its obligations under the Comprehensive Peace Agreement. Dr. \nGarang firmly believes that U.S. and international sanctions are \nnecessary to keep the process moving forward.\n  During our meeting, he also told me that we can help him sell the \npeace to the Sudanese people. Our assistance in education, health care, \nand roads, for example, can help show a traumatized Nation the benefits \nof peace over continued violence.\n  The road forward will not be easy. Millions have lost their lives in \n20 years of struggle. But the days, weeks and months ahead hold great \npromise not only for the north and south, but for the entire country.\n  Nowhere is that hope more needed than in the western region of Darfur\n  For 2 years, the Sudanese Government has waged a brutal genocide \nagainst the Darfur people. Despite United Nations Security Council \nresolutions, and pressure from the international community and \nneighboring countries, the Government of Khartoum continues to kill and \nmaim.\n  Up to 180,000 innocent victims have died as a result of the \ngovernment-sponsored violence. Two million more have been displaced. \nEntire villages have been burned to the ground.\n  Last November, the Khartoum Government agreed to halt the attacks. \nBut within hours of the agreement, Sudanese police raided a camp in \nsouthern Darfur, destroying homes and driving out civilians.\n  I have visited the region and have heard the stories first hand.\n  Last August, I visited a refugee camp called Touloum in Chad. \nThousands of refugees are housed in dust-covered tents. Many more live \nin make-shift shelters of gathered wood and plastic sheeting.\n  I met with refugees and community leaders. Their testimonials were \nsearing.\n  I heard the story of a mentally disabled 15-year-old boy being thrown \ninto a burning house, and of an old, paralyzed man burned alive in his \nhut.\n  I heard stories of women raped in front of their own children, and \nmale villagers being summarily executed.\n  I asked one refugee in Touloum what it would take for him to go home. \nHe said, ``I'll go if you come with me and stay with me.''\n  Last week, the Government of Sudan and the rebels in Darfur signed a \nDeclaration of Principles for the Resolution of the Sudanese Conflict \nin Darfur. This agreement provides a framework for negotiations.\n  In order for it to work, however, all parties must stop the violence \nnow. The conflict will only be resolved through peaceful negotiations \nand dialogue.\n  The United Nations has taken limited steps to punish those \nresponsible for the atrocities. In March, the U.N. Security Council \nvoted to freeze the assets of individuals deemed guilty of committing \nwar crimes or breaking cease-fire agreements. It also voted to ban \nthese individuals from traveling.\n  In addition, the Security Council voted to forbid the Sudanese \nGovernment from carrying out offensive military flights over Darfur, \nand from sending military equipment into the\n\n[[Page S8513]]\n\nregion without first notifying the Council.\n  The introduction of troops into Darfur from the African Union is a \npositive development. There are currently 2,400 African Union troops in \nDarfur. By August, that number should go up to 7,700 and by next spring \n12,300. NATO has also agreed to provide logistical support to the \nAfrican Union peacekeepers in Darfur.\n  These are hopeful and helpful measures. But more must be done. The \nviolence will continue to escalate and the death toll will rise unless, \nand until, the international community takes stronger action against \nKhartoum.\n  The world's leaders need to impose more comprehensive sanctions on \nthe Sudanese Government, including on its oil industry. Tough and \nintense pressure must be brought to bear.\n  The progress between the south of Sudan and Khartoum is promising and \nshould guide the way forward in Darfur.\n  But time is running out. We cannot ``wait and see.'' The Darfur \npeople need our help. They are crying out for support. We must act, \nnow, before it is too late and their voices fade to silence.\n\n\n                                  cuba\n\n  Today, we have an opportunity to assist the Cuban people in their \nstruggle for liberty. The Foreign Operations bill under consideration \nprovides funding for an airplane to transmit Radio Marti, around the \nclock, providing constant support to those on the island fighting for \nfreedom.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this effort. Radio Marti has been \ncritical in promoting the cause of Cuban liberty.\n  Since its inception 20 years ago, Radio Marti has brought news to and \nfrom the isolated country in defiance of Castro's censors.\n  On May 20, 1985, at 5:30 in the morning, Radio Marti launched its \nfirst broadcast to the Cuban people. Fourteen and a half hours of \nuncensored news reached Cuba from a studio here in Washington, DC, via \ntransmitters in Marathon Key.\n  Named after the Cuban intellectual and patriot, Jose Marti, the \nstation broke through Castro's propaganda machine and offered the Cuban \npeople news, entertainment and discussion with Cuban journalists, \nthinkers, writers and entertainers.\n  In just a few short years, Radio Marti became the most listened to \nstation in Cuba.\n  Many Cuban reporters now send their stories to the U.S.-based station \nto bypass the government and beam directly into Cuban homes. Over the \nyears, dissidents and human rights advocates have come to rely on these \ntransmissions for strength and hope.\n  As President Reagan told an audience back in 1983 while Congress was \ndebating the Radio Broadcasting to Cuba Act, ``there is no more \nimportant foreign policy initiative in this administration, and none \nthat frightens our adversaries more, than our attempts through our \ninternational radios to build constituencies for peace in nations \ndominated by totalitarian, militaristic regimes.''\n  In 1990, TV Marti was launched, bringing in a new wave of free media. \nWithin 23 minutes of its first broadcast, Castro jammed the airwaves, \nbut his success was only temporary.\n  Like its radio companion, TV Marti offers political news and debate. \nIt also airs soap operas and sports.\n  Whether as news or entertainment, these broadcasts help to spark the \nimaginations and aspirations of the Cuban people. They pierce the \nregime's imposed isolation and bring the Cuban people into the world \ncommunity, and the world community to the Cuban people.\n  To this day, the Communist party controls all formal means of mass \ncommunication on the island. It has constructed a complicated apparatus \nof censors and technology to air its propaganda and smother divergent \nviews. All print and electronic media are considered state property \nunder the control of the party. Foreign magazines and newspapers are \noutlawed as subversive material.\n  That is why Radio and TV Marti are so critical. And that is why I \nurge my colleagues to amplify our efforts now.\n  Jose Marti once said that, ``Others looked at radio and saw a gadget; \nhis genius lay in his capacity to look at the same thing, but to see \nfar more.''\n  I urge my colleagues to share the vision held by our former president \nRonald Reagan when he first proposed Radio Marti. The Wall had not yet \nfallen, and millions of people still lived under the boot of the brutal \nCommunist empire.\n  But he knew that Radio Free Europe was reaching and inspiring \nmillions of men and women trapped behind the Iron Curtain, in bleak \nCommunist towns and in dark Communist prisons. And like Radio Free \nEurope, he knew that Radio Marti would reach and lift up those living \nin the Communist island just 90 miles from our southern shores.\n  So, today, I urge my colleagues to continue our support for the \naspirations of the Cuban people.\n  With just one plane and one radio station, we can broadcast the call \nof freedom to millions.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1245\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 1245. I \nunderstand there will be a request to set the vote at 2 o'clock on the \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is pending.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, amendment 1245 is offered on behalf of \nmyself, Senator Craig, and others to focus some time and discussion on \nthe issue of family, of stability, of permanency for children around \nthe world. I couldn't agree more with the Senator from Tennessee when \nhe says this underlying bill, the bill that funds all of our foreign \noperations, assistance to many countries throughout the world, \ncountries that are developing, countries that are well established, \nthat share our values, that one of the most critical components of this \nunderlying bill is to advance American values around the world.\n  We know not every action we take is perfect. We know not every \nthought we have is exactly right. But Americans believe we work hard at \nestablishing good values. We know we are not perfect, but we try to get \nbetter and better each decade and each century. I could not agree more \nwith the Senator from Tennessee when he says this bill in particular is \na bill that helps us to advance our values around the world.\n  One of the values all Americans believe in is the value of family, \nthe importance of family, the importance of the principle that children \nshould in fact be raised in families. Children don't raise themselves. \nGovernments don't raise children; parents raise children. And sometimes \none responsible parent raises a child. That is the way it has been. \nThat is the way we like to see it. It is the way we want to promote it \nhere at home and abroad.\n  Senator Craig and I offer this amendment with others to express the \nsense of Congress regarding the use of the funds in this bill, which \nare substantial in section 3, for orphans and displaced and abandoned \nchildren. This amendment simply says our money in this bill should be \nlaid down by USAID. We are not earmarking any money. We are not adding \nany money. We are not spending any additional money, just the money \nthat is in this bill, that Members have said we want to send out to \ncountries, should recognize the principles of The Hague Convention on \nProtection of Children and Co-Operation in Respect of Intercountry \nAdoption, should recognize the principle that children should stay with \nthe families to which they are born. Our aid, whether it is for \neconomic development or for education or health, should recognize the \ndignity and respect of each individual family unit. Try to keep \nchildren who are born to a family connected to that family.\n  Sometimes we know that doesn't happen or, unfortunately, it can't \nhappen. War, disease, famine, violence separate children from their \nnatural parents. When that happens, it is the principles of the United \nStates, the values of the United States that we proudly share with the \nworld to say that child who is orphaned should not be left alone to \nraise themselves. That child should be placed with a loving, caring, \nresponsible relative as quickly as possible, someone in the extended \nfamily.\n\n[[Page S8514]]\n\nIt could be the grandmother, grandfather, responsible aunt or uncle, \nperhaps an older sibling, not 12 years old, not 13 years old, but a 20-\nyear-old or a 30-year-old, to raise that child and then that family \nunit continues.\n  When there is no a responsible adult in that family, then our \nprinciples say we should then look for some other family, perhaps a \nneighbor, another family in the community, a friend of the family to \ntake that child or those children in and raise them and try to instill \ngood values and security and happiness for that child's harmonious \ndevelopment.\n  If there is no family to be found within the neighborhood, the \nvillage, the community, then we should, as a human family, find some \nfamily in the world to take in that child. It is the miracle of \nadoption that is occurring all over this country and all over the \nworld.\n  My husband and I have adopted children. We are very proud of our \nwonderful children. Many Members of Congress have added to their \nfamilies or created their families through adoption. It is becoming \nsomething that Americans understand and believe to be important. There \nshould not be any orphaned children, any waiting children. They are \njust unfound families, and we need to do a better job of connecting \nchildren who need homes with loving parents who will give them that \nsupport.\n  I come to this issue not just from a personal perspective but even \nbefore we went through this miracle of adoption ourselves, I understood \nthis to be the truth. Children can't raise themselves. I was raised in \na home, the eldest of nine children, with two loving parents. Many of \nus had wonderful experiences as we were growing up. We understand the \nvalue of keeping children protected and nurtured in the family setting. \nWe come to this floor all the time trying to stop child trafficking, \nstop child abuse, mental illness, promote special education. The best \nway to stop some of that is to connect children with responsible adults \nwho will raise them. It saves the taxpayers a lot of money, saves a lot \nof pain, saves a lot of anguish. That is what Americans, whether they \nare Republican, Independent, or Democrat, believe in. That is one thing \nI am confident of and need no poll to tell me.\n  I am a little surprised that when we laid down this amendment, we \nthought it would be accepted without any discussion, but there \nevidently is some hesitation. There is some sense that USAID doesn't \nagree with that. I am interested. If some Senator would like to explain \nUSAID's position that they don't think families are important, I think \nthe Congress would love to hear that. It would be quite a surprise to \nthose of us who are appropriators who fund USAID and actually believe \nin so much of what they are doing, that they have a problem with an \namendment that simply says children belong in families. That is all \nthis amendment says.\n  Last year Americans adopted 120,000 children. Twenty thousand \nchildren came from many countries around the world to find a happy home \nhere in America. One hundred thousand children were adopted, half of \nthem out of our own foster care system which we recognize has some \nstrengths but some weaknesses. We are working on that. We admit our \nlong-term foster care has kept children in limbo for far too long. It \nhas been a barrier, sometimes, to appropriate reunification. It most \ncertainly has been a barrier to adoption.\n  Senators such as Senators Rockefeller, DeWine, Clinton, and others \nhave spent many years working to reform that system. We are making a \nlot of headway. We are proud of it. But we had over 50,000 children \nadopted out of foster care.\n  Two children visited my office yesterday. They were 12 and 10, \nprecious little boys from Louisiana. They said: Senator, we want you to \nmeet our new mom. We were just adopted.\n  I asked the mom: Could I please speak to the children privately for a \nfew moments?\n  She said: Fine.\n  So I had the little children in my office. I said: You don't have to \ntell me any of the details. I know it has been difficult. I just want \nto know, are you OK, are you happy?\n  They said: Senator, we are very happy with our new mom. She was our \nfoster mom for a number of years. She is doing her best. Our parents \njust haven't been around.\n  I didn't want to go into too much detail with the children. But their \nlittle eyes were so hopeful. I walked out and I said: Congratulations. \nThese two children now have a loving adult mother who is going to raise \nthem and give them a future that they didn't have in the first years of \ntheir life.\n  I thank the Senators for all of their work and what they have done in \nthat regard. We are making a lot of progress in our Nation. So this \namendment basically recognizes that and says that we believe we should \ndo everything we can to keep children in the family to which they are \nborn. But when that separation happens, through all the things that I \nsaid about what can cause it, we need then to establish a permanent \nplan for children that tries to place them in another family as quickly \nas possible. Domestic adoption first. But if there are no families \nwilling to adopt in that community or country, then intercountry \nadoption into the human family becomes very important before \norphanages, institutions, et cetera.\n  So that is what this amendment does. It lifts our values that the \nSenator from Tennessee spoke about, lifts language from laws we have \nalready passed in overwhelming numbers on this Senate floor, and it \nsays in this amendment that all of the money in section 3 should \nrecognize these principles.\n  There are over 54 countries in the world that have basically signed \nand ratified and are in the process of implementing these principles \nthat are in the Landrieu-Craig amendment. This amendment says that \nsometimes temporary refugee camps are necessary, where children are \ntemporarily separated because of war. But when the permanency plans \nbegin to be made, let's make sure we put domestic adoption and \nintercountry adoption before long-term institutional care or, for that \nmatter, letting children out on the streets to raise themselves. It is \nvery clear.\n  So I say, again, that I hope we can get a strong, bipartisan vote on \nthis amendment. I am sorry that there has been any difficulty. It was \nnot meant to be that way. But I felt this issue had to be clarified in \nthe bill because I was hearing too much at hearings, seeing too many \nthings in letters that were passed on some of these issues that it gave \nme pause to think, I wonder if the USAID position is truly reflecting \nthe position of the Congress, of the current Bush administration, of \nthe State Department, which is the stated policy in support of the idea \nthat children belong in families.\n  So I am hoping that with the cosponsors we have on this amendment we \nwill get a strong vote affirming that intercountry adoption may offer \nadvantages of a permanent family to a child or children for whom a \nfamily cannot be found in the child's home country. Let me state again:\n\n       Affirms that intercountry adoption may offer advantages of \n     a permanent family to a child for whom a family cannot be \n     found in the child's state of origin.\n\n  That seems to be controversial language. I cannot see it.\n  No. 4:\n\n       Affirms that long-term foster care or institutionalization \n     are not permanent options and should, therefore, only be used \n     when no other permanent option is available.\n\n  That is clear. We want to try to find a child a home, a real family. \nAnd there are 40 million orphans in the world, so this is not an easy \ntask. But it is doable if we all work at it. If we cannot find children \na home, if we have worked hard to look for a home for somebody that \nwould take them in their own country, and we look internationally and \ntry to find a family that would take them in, and we cannot find that, \nthen, of course, we can have long-term institutions and foster care as \nthe last and final option.\n  Please, let's give children a chance. In New Orleans right now--I had \npictures sent to me--14 little orphans from Russia, between the ages of \n5 and 12, through a program that many of us support, came over to the \nUnited States and spent 6 weeks in New Orleans. You know what the great \nnews is? Yesterday, 12 of those 14 children are going to find permanent \nhomes here. These children are older, but they are not damaged goods. \nJust because they are not little 3-month-old infants or 6-\n\n[[Page S8515]]\n\nmonth-old infants, they have a bright future. God gave them a lot of \ntalent. They are stuck in an orphanage, where they have very little \nhope and opportunity. At the age of 15, they will be turned out on the \nstreet to fend for themselves.\n  If you want to talk about child prostitution or trafficking or what \nhappens to children when they leave an orphanage at age 15, with no \nparents, no means of support, and no education--this amendment cuts \ndown on child trafficking. This amendment cuts down on child \nexploitation. This amendment cuts down on child prostitution. If you \ncan connect a child to an adult that will protect a child, that is the \nparents' primary job, protecting our children, and most parents do that \nvery well.\n  For me to stand on the Senate floor and have to argue this to the \nagency that is sending out money around the world because they think \nthis is not what other cultures are about--I am not an expert. I am a \nsociology major, but I never read where a family is not the primary \nbuilding block of the community. If anybody knows of any other culture \nthat doesn't recognize the family, let me know because in all of my \nreading, I have never read that anywhere. In every culture, family is \nimportant. We might describe it a little differently, and we may have \ndifferent views about what a family looks like, which is not the \nsubject of this amendment, but I don't know any culture anywhere in the \nworld that doesn't think family is important.\n  So when USAID stands there and tells me something such as, it is not \nreally in other cultures that this is important, I say, hogwash. \nFamilies are important. We define them differently. We respect the \ndifferent views of how families come together. But in every culture \nadults raise children, and that is all this amendment says. It says, as \na last resort, when you cannot find a family for a child--when you have \ntried and cannot find a family--then go ahead and build your \norphanages, your institutions, and I hope that they will build them in \na way and staff them in a way that these children know that, despite \nthe fact they don't have a mother, father or someone to love them, they \ncan be raised with a skill so that they can find their way. It is \ndifficult when you are on your own. Children have done it before, and \nthey will do it again. But for heaven's sake, can we try to find them a \nfamily?\n  Senator Craig and I offered this amendment. We cochair the commission \non adoption. We have 180 Members of Congress who feel very strongly \nabout this issue. I don't think we should be debating it, but for some \nreason we are. Our Members are Republicans and Democrats. None of our \nMembers can understand why we are having this discussion, but here we \nare.\n\n  So this amendment simply, again, reaffirms its commitment to the \nfounding principles of the Hague convention on the protection of \nchildren, recognizing that each country should take, as a matter of \npriority, every appropriate measure to enable a child to remain in the \ncare of the child's family of origin. But when that is not possible, \nthey should strive to place the child in a permanent and loving home \nthrough adoption. It affirms that intercountry adoption may offer the \nadvantage of a permanent family to a child for whom a family cannot be \nfound in the child's country. It affirms that long-term foster care or \ninstitutionalization are not permanent options and should, therefore, \nonly be used when no other permanent option is available. It recognizes \nthat programs that protect and support families can reduce the \nabandonment and exploitation of children.\n  I congratulate President Bush and his administration for agreeing to \na breakthrough amendment with the country of Vietnam recently to open \nup again international adoption. There were some corruption issues. \nThere was some lack of transparency in the process. There was some \nconcern that this was not operating as smoothly as it should. So it was \ntemporarily suspended. But because of the good work of the President \nand the President's administration, that was basically recreated. I \nhave a copy of the agreement.\n  When an agency such as USAID tells me; ``We like what you are saying, \nbut it is not our policy,'' I am confused because the President of the \nUnited States signed an agreement with Vietnam that has the same \nlanguage of The Hague, in the first paragraph of this document: \nAgreement between the United States and the Socialist Republic of \nVietnam. Clause 1, clause 2, and clause 3 are exactly this amendment. \nForty-one Members of the Senate and the Congress signed a letter to the \nPresident of Romania outlining this exact principle. So the 41 Members \nwho signed this letter, and myself, are very confused as to why this \namendment is a problem. Again, I offered it to clarify.\n  This will be a great clarification to USAID that, unequivocally, the \nMembers of this body and the House of Representatives, when this is \npassed, say that we value families; we think children should be in \nfamilies; we want to do everything we can to connect children to \nfamilies; we think they should stay in the families to which they are \nwere born but, if not, find one close to home and, if not, someplace in \nthe human family for them. End of story.\n  If that all fails, go ahead and build your orphanages and \ninstitutions. I don't know of anybody who grew up in an orphanage that \nliked it--not one person. I don't know anybody alive that ever told me \nthat they had a happy time growing up in an orphanage. That is not a \nvalue that Americans believe in. I have had lots of people tell me they \nwere so happy to grow up in a loving family. I have had people cry to \nme and say: I spent time in an orphanage my whole life. Nobody ever \ncame for me, Senator. I have had people tell me that. I have never had \nanybody say to me how happy they were to grow up in a refugee camp or \nan orphanage.\n  I am not spending a penny in this bill to promote the idea that \nchildren could be happy being raised in an orphanage when one caregiver \ncomes in for 300 children. I have been in a lot of these orphanages. \nSome of our other members have been also. I have traveled all over the \nworld to some of these orphanage. I cannot describe the horrors of what \nI have seen. I cannot sit here on the floor of the Senate and let this \ngo through being a little unclear. This is very clear to me, and it \nshould be very clear to the Members of this body.\n  I know we are going to vote at 2 o'clock. I appreciate my colleagues \ngiving me this time to express myself. I obviously feel strongly about \nit. Many Senators and House Members feel strongly about this. We are \ndoing this here in the United States. This is our policy. So we need to \npromote, as Senator Frist said, our values--not force them, but promote \nthem. Nothing is being forced here. We are promoting and saying, these \nare our values. We believe family is important. We are giving plenty of \nroom in this amendment. We understand that there might be some \ncontingency plans that have to be made, but let's try to connect \nchildren to families. I think it is the least we can do. I wanted to \nclarify that this is a value of the people of the United States of \nAmerica.\n  I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of my time.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to \nadd just a few more items for the record on the subject about which I \nwas just speaking, which is the Landrieu-Craig amendment on \ninternational adoption, domestic adoption, and family preservation.\n  One of the items that got my attention which prompted the offering of \nthis amendment was a National Public Radio commentary, which I want to \nsubmit for the Record, after the tsunami disaster. I had the \nopportunity to visit the region affected with the Senator from \nTennessee. I spent 3 days on the ground reviewing the damage in Sri \nLanka and all over the devastated area.\n  This is what prompted this amendment, when we were focused on the \nissue of these children having been displaced. Of course, we remember \nthe devastation that occurred. Children were tragically separated from \ntheir families. There was great interest in the children who might have \nbeen orphaned in that disaster and whether they could find a home \nelsewhere.\n\n[[Page S8516]]\n\n  There was a great coalition of people in the United States and around \nthe world who felt strongly about that. We began working on it and \nencouraging that children who had been orphaned, whose parents had been \nswept out to sea, the children who survived, of trying to place them \nwith relatives, along the lines of what I have been speaking.\n  Then there was this NPR commentary, and I would like to read a \nparagraph of it into the Record:\n\n       Jaco spends his days--\n\nThis is a UNICEF worker funded in part by USAID--\n\n     walking through refugee camps, trying to find orphans. He's \n     not from Aceh; he's a social worker from nearby Medan who \n     came here as part of--\n\n  The Government's efforts at a child welfare program that is working \nwith UNICEF to care for children who have lost their parents.\n  This worker is walking through this refugee camp, and he finds an \norphan, according to NPR, and he finds the orphan's aunt. He says to \nthe aunt: We would like to take this child to one of the Islamic \nboarding schools.\n  The aunt says: No, I would like to help raise this child.\n  The worker then is in a discussion trying to convince the aunt to let \nthe orphan be raised in a boarding school.\n  This is what started this whole amendment. I know one cannot believe \neverything one reads in the newspapers, and one cannot believe \neverything one hears on the radio, but when we investigated this and \nlooked into it, we found that this, in fact, was a pattern that was \noccurring; that our money was being used to fund workers who, instead \nof being so happy that they found an aunt for this child and saying, \n``We have a program that can help; we know it is difficult; you are \nprobably raising three or four other children; we are appreciative that \nyou are taking in this orphan,'' our money was being used to promote \nsomething completely contrary to our views and policies, which is: Oh, \ndon't worry, let the government take this child and raise it in a \nboarding school.\n  Whether it was a Christian boarding school, Islamic boarding school, \nMuslim boarding school, the Christian, Muslim, or Islamic boarding \nschools are not the same as being raised in a Christian, Muslim, \nIslamic family. That is the point.\n  What happens is, if we don't make this clear, it will end up that \nmoney is going to support orphanages and discouraging the reunification \nof orphans with their families.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record this commentary by \nNational Public Radio which has prompted this whole initiative, if \nanyone has questions about it.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n   Analysis: Indonesian Government Bans Adoptions of Tsunami Orphans\n\n       Steve Inskeep, host: Indonesian authorities are trying to \n     provide security to some of the most vulnerable victims of \n     last month's tsunami. In the province of Aceh, an estimated \n     35,000 children were orphaned or separated from their \n     parents. The government has temporarily outlawed adoption in \n     that province. Its plan is to send the orphans to Islamic \n     boarding schools instead, but the schools are not ready and \n     it's hard just to identify the kids who need help. NPR's Adam \n     Davidson reports from Banda Aceh.\n       Adam Davidson, reporting: Jaco(ph) spends his days walking \n     through refugee camps, trying to find orphans. He's not from \n     Aceh; he's a social worker from nearby Medan who came here as \n     part of Pusaka Indonesia, a child welfare group that is \n     working with UNICEF to care for children who have lost their \n     parents.\n       Jaco (Social Worker): (Foreign language spoken)\n       Davidson: Today he's in Berwang Hitan(ph), an Indonesian \n     army base that has been transformed into a refugee camp. It's \n     right under the flight path of US Navy helicopters. He \n     lifts the flap of a thick canvas tent, walks in and asks \n     the dozen or so people sitting on mats if there are any \n     orphans here. At the first tent, they say no. There was \n     one, but some cousins came by the other day and took her \n     away.\n       Davidson: At the second tent, he finds Suryani(ph), a five-\n     year-old girl, standing in a pretty green dress. She's been \n     watched over by a cousin, Harati(ph), who is also caring for \n     her own infant son.\n       Harati (Tsunami Survivor): (Through Translator) I found her \n     when we were running from the tsunami.\n       Davidson: Harati says she watched Suryani's parents drown \n     when the tsunami struck their village, Lampung. She grabbed \n     the little girl and now considers her her own daughter. Jaco \n     writes down Suryani's information--name, age, parents' name, \n     home village--and then tells Harati that it will be very \n     difficult for her to care for Suryani, since they no longer \n     have a house or any possessions.\n       Jaco: (Foreign language spoken)\n       Davidson: He says she should send Suryani to one of the new \n     Islamic boarding schools that will open soon. The girl will \n     be well cared for, and the family can visit on weekends. \n     Harati thanks Jaco and smiles. When Jaco leaves, she says \n     that she's not sending Suryani anywhere. She'll take care of \n     the girl on her own. Jaco is sympathetic, but thinks Harati \n     is wrong.\n       Jaco: (Through Translator) If we think psychologically it's \n     normal if their family would like to take the orphans then, \n     but if we think logically, right now they don't need only \n     being with the family but they need food, they need \n     education, they need therapy from the psychologists to make \n     their life normal again.\n       Davidson: Jaco and his small team have identified 56 \n     orphans so far, 20 in this camp alone. There are dozens of \n     children here, most of them with their parents. Pusaka \n     Indonesia, the child advocacy group, has set up a special \n     children's area in the corner of the camp. There's a host of \n     teachers and social workers who watch over the kids. Vivi \n     Sofianti is a child psychologist. She leads them in games and \n     songs.\n       Davidson: She says they stop being depressed when they \n     sing.\n       Ms. Vivi Sofianti (Child Psychologist): (Through \n     Translator) What I've learned from them right now, they \n     really need entertainment to forget their--what will happen \n     to them.\n       Lucman(ph) (Tsunami Survivor): (Foreign language spoken)\n       Davidson: Lucman, 45, walks up to a table under a canopy \n     next to the children's area. He's looking for his 15-year-old \n     son, Maludin(ph), and his nine-year-old daughter, \n     Safrida(ph). He hasn't seen them since the tsunami destroyed \n     their neighborhood, Pulanga Han(ph), in downtown Banda Aceh. \n     Lucman spent the last two weeks searching for them in dozens \n     of refugee camps. A Pusaka Indonesia worker takes down the \n     children's information. All the data is entered into a \n     database in two computers next to the desk. There's a list of \n     hundreds of parents and dozens of children. The goal is to \n     link the children Jaco and his team find with the parents who \n     are searching for their own. Deni Purba runs the operation.\n       Mr. Deni Purba (Aid Worker): I believe half of them will \n     find their relatives. That's why we are here.\n       Davidson: There are similar programs all over Aceh \n     province. But in the end, Purba believes, thousands of \n     children will be left with no relatives at all. He says it \n     will be up to the Indonesian government to decide what to do \n     with those who are alone. But, Purba says, the best solution \n     is the one the government is planning, to send all the \n     orphans to boarding schools.\n       Davidson: Adoption wouldn't work.\n       Mr. Purba: No, we don't support adoption, because is not \n     Acehenese culture.\n       Davidson: There are rumors of child sex traffickers \n     prowling for orphans. There are stories of foreigners buying \n     Acehenese children. Purba says the children have suffered \n     enough trauma and should be kept here, where people speak \n     their language and know their culture, and where the orphans \n     can help each other adjust to a new kind of life.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1242\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, yesterday, there were several amendments \nvoted on and, unfortunately, I was not here yesterday. I was attending \na funeral of one of our State officials who unexpectedly passed away. \nHad I been here, I would have voted with my colleagues in rejecting the \nCoburn-Boxer amendment to the fiscal year 2006 State and Foreign \nOperations appropriations bill, which is the bill about which I am \nspeaking.\n  Mr. President, while the vote on this amendment was taking place, as \nI said, I was returning from the funeral of my dear friend and \nLouisiana Secretary of State, the Honorable Fox McKeithen. Had I been \nhere, I would have voted with my colleagues in rejecting the Coburn-\nBoxer amendment to the fiscal year 2006 State and Foreign Operations \nappropriations bill.\n  In preparation for this vote, I cosigned a letter, along with my \ncolleagues Senators Feinstein, Santorum, and Specter requesting that \nSenators vote against the amendment. I have concluded this amendment \nwould derail something that would benefit both China and the United \nStates at a critical time in our two nations' history.\n  In this, the most important bilateral relationship of the 21st \ncentury, it is crucial that both countries continue to work in \ncooperation with one another.\n  The Shaw Group-Westinghouse consortium is the only American team \nbidding on a contract to construct four advanced-designed nuclear \npowerplants in China.\n  This deal has the full support of the U.S. Department of Energy which \nhas authorized that the Shaw Group and Westinghouse Consortium work in \nthe\n\n[[Page S8517]]\n\nPeople's Republic of China, PRC. The National Nuclear Security \nAdministration, NNSA, has thoroughly reviewed the proposal and \ndetermined that concerns over national security are negligible.\n  Nuclear safety and technology transfer are key national security \nissues that nobody takes lightly. After much deliberation and \nconsideration of these sensitive issues, it is clear that this deal is \ngood for both the United States and China.\n  The AP1000 advanced design nuclear reactor is one of the safest \nnuclear reactors in the world and is on the cutting edge of nuclear \ntechnological innovation. This innovation will yield significant \neconomic and environmental benefits.\n  This proposal would support a significant number of high value U.S. \nexport oriented jobs in the manufacturing and engineering services \nareas.\n  At a time when Americans are concerned about their jobs, we should \ndemonstrate through initiatives such as this that we have their \neconomic best interests at heart.\n  The Shaw-Westinghouse Consortium benefits small businesses by virtue \nof the many U.S. subcontractors that will be used during the \nimplementation phase of this contract.\n  The Consortium's bid would create or sustain more than 5,000 high-\ntech U.S. jobs, and provide ongoing jobs for many years to come, not \njust for the China project, but for sales in the United States and \nother global markets\n  This proposal seeks to address not only jobs, but the tremendous \ntrade imbalance between the United States and China.\n  The U.S. Export-Import Bank exists to provide financing of last \nresort to assist exporters in order to create jobs and export growth \nfor the U.S. economy.\n  This deal would be consistent with the 1985 Agreement for Cooperation \nBetween the Government of the United States of America and the \nGovernment of the People's Republic of China Concerning Peaceful Uses \nof Nuclear Energy.\n  To limit the purchasing of U.S. civilian nuclear energy technology to \nthe Chinese would be disastrous to our bilateral relations at a time \nwhen we must engage the Chinese and to cloak this proposal in anti-\nChinese rhetoric is doing a disservice to the American people.\n  These exports to China will most assuredly yield significant benefits \nto companies and workers in the United States and assist in the \npromotion of the safe, reliable, and efficient growth of nuclear power \nin China, something which will be essential to both countries.\n  The chief competitor is AREVA, a French company. AREVA will have the \nfull support of the French equivalent of the Export-Import Bank, \nCOFACE.\n  If this amendment is passed it will not punish China, but reward the \nFrench and other European economies and exporters who will clearly \nprevail should the Shaw/Westinghouse consortium be denied competitive \nfinancing.\n  This is precisely the sort of investment our country should make to \nensure that we continue to create and sustain high-tech industrial jobs \nin the United States and the continued growth of the nuclear power \nindustry, which will assist as we seek more self-reliance in the energy \nsector of the economy.\n  In no way will the taxpayers be fleeced by this project. The loans \nassociated with the Chinese nuclear power project are made to Chinese \ncustomers and are guaranteed by the Government of China.\n  The taxpayers are not subsidizing these loans and are not at risk \naccording to major credit agencies who evaluate sovereign risk. In \naddition, the Export-Import Bank of the United States charges an \nexposure fee commensurate to the credit risk being taken. For over a \nhalf century the Ex-Im Bank has supported equipment and services for \nnuclear power projects in China.\n  If we do not proceed with caution, the threats of anti-Chinese \nsentiment will tarnish a productive bilateral dialog for every issue \nthat emerges with China.\n  The Shaw Group-Westinghouse Consortium has a sterling reputation and \na distinct advantage with its cutting edge technology. If this deal \nwould have been thwarted in the Senate, it is the United States that \nwould have been punished, not the Chinese.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Murkowski). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, while Senator Landrieu is still on \nthe Senate floor, Senator Leahy and I were just discussing the \nfollowing unanimous-consent request which will get her vote at 2:30 \np.m. Let me say before propounding this unanimous-consent request, \nSenator Leahy and I are working on trying to get all the remaining \namendments and final passage dealt with at the same time around 2:30 \np.m. We are not there yet. But I will start by asking unanimous consent \nthat the Senate proceed to a vote in relation to the Landrieu amendment \nNo. 1245 regarding orphans at 2:30 p.m. today, with no second-degree \namendments in order to the amendment prior to the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I am just wondering if perhaps the \nSenator from Kentucky, who has dual responsibilities as chairman of \nthis subcommittee and as the Republican whip--maybe we should talk in \nour respective cloakrooms--we have a number of people we know who want \nto offer amendments--that we get perhaps a unanimous consent agreement, \nand the time we can work out, sequencing each of those amendments. I \ndon't know about time at the moment. I am trying to think of some way--\nwe have been on this bill since Friday. A lot of us have other matters \nto attend to, including meetings with the President's nominee to the \nSupreme Court. Senator McConnell and I have sat here through hours of \nquorum calls. I think it is time to fish or cut bait. I say this to our \ncloakrooms, this may soon turn into a unanimous consent agreement and \nwill require each of these amendments to come up and either be voted on \nor withdrawn.\n  I don't know how else we get it done. We have been several hours in \nquorum calls so far, and some of us have other things to do. I have no \nproblem with somebody getting a vote. Vote for it or against it, but \nlet's get it done.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I am checking right now on the \npossibility of adding to the 2:30 p.m. vote the one amendment left on \nthis side that might require a vote. I will know shortly. We should be \nable to add that to the queue at 2:30 p.m. That will give us two votes \nat 2:30. Senator Leahy indicated he is working on trying to get \nadditional votes so we can wrap this bill up later this afternoon.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 1245, as Modified\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Madam President, I have a modification to my amendment. \nIt is at the desk. It is a technical modification.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is so \nmodified.\n  The amendment (No. 1245), as modified, is as follows:\n\n       On page 326, between lines 10 and 11, insert the following:\n\n\n               ORPHANS, DISPLACED AND ABANDONED CHILDREN\n\n       Sec. 6113. (a) The Senate--\n       (1) reaffirms its commitment to the founding principle of \n     the Hague Convention on Protection of Children and Co-\n     Operation in Respect of Intercountry Adoption, that a child, \n     for the full and harmonious development of the child's \n     personality, should grow up in a family environment, in an \n     atmosphere of happiness, love, and understanding;\n       (2) recognizes that each State should take, as a matter of \n     priority, every appropriate measure to enable a child to \n     remain in the care of the child's family of origin, but when \n     not possible should strive to place the child in a permanent \n     and loving home through adoption;\n       (3) affirms that intercountry adoption may offer the \n     advantage of a permanent family to a child for whom a family \n     cannot be found in the child's State of origin;\n       (4) affirms that long-term foster care or \n     institutionalization are not permanent options and should \n     therefore only be used when no other permanent options are \n     available; and\n\n[[Page S8518]]\n\n       (5) recognizes that programs that protect and support \n     families can reduce the abandonment and exploitation of \n     children.\n       (b) The funds appropriated under title III of this Act \n     shall be made available in a manner consistent with the \n     principles described in subsection (a).\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                       Nomination of John Roberts\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, as we all know, last night the President \nof the United States announced the nomination of Judge John Roberts to \nthe U.S. Supreme Court. The President noted in his remarks that one of \nthe most consequential decisions a President makes is his nomination of \na Justice to our Nation's highest Court. By nominating Judge Roberts, I \nbelieve the President has met the challenge. I commend him for choosing \na thoroughly accomplished jurist and attorney to rise to this country's \nhighest Court.\n  I point out that the selection process the White House and the \nPresident went through was thorough and, indeed, viewed as \nsatisfactory--in fact, praised significantly by Members on both sides \nof the aisle. The President and his staff consulted with more than 70 \nMembers of the Senate. The President reviewed the credentials of many \nwell-qualified candidates, and the President also met with a number of \npotential nominees.\n  I believe the consultation part of the advise and consent process we \ngo through was more than met by the President and his staff. The \nprocess has resulted in a nominee who truly stands on his achievement.\n  Presidents can and sometimes have nominated Justices for political \nreasons alone. However, this President has done something truly \npraiseworthy in nominating Judge Roberts. He focused on the merits and \npicked a distinguished attorney with a keen legal mind and an \nimpressive record of accomplishment.\n  I think all of us are aware of Judge Roberts' academic background. We \nare aware of his clerking for Justice William Rehnquist, his service in \nthe Department of Justice and, very importantly, being a member of the \nsmall group of lawyers who have practiced before the Supreme Court. In \nfact, Judge Roberts has appeared before and argued cases before the \nU.S. Supreme Court some 39 times. The process has been followed and has \nresulted in an outstanding nominee.\n  There are questions about whether Judge Roberts will answer questions \nconcerning specific issues. I think that issue was put to rest in the \nBreyer and Ginsburg nominations where, appropriately, they did not \nanswer questions that would relate to cases that would be argued before \nthe U.S. Supreme Court.\n  There may be some question about whether Judge Roberts is \nconservative. I think the President of the United States made it very \nclear in the last campaign, and I personally heard him state on \nnumerous occasions, that he would appoint as a Supreme Court Justice, \nin the event of a vacancy, a person who strictly interpreted the \nConstitution of the United States. So just as in the previous \nadministration President Clinton appointed judges such as Justices \nBreyer and Ginsburg who would be viewed by some as liberal, so I think \nit is entirely appropriate that Justice Roberts be viewed as \n``conservative,'' if conservative means someone who strictly interprets \nthe Constitution of the United States in making these incredibly \nimportant decisions that are made by the U.S. Supreme Court.\n  As is well known, I am a card-carrying member of the Gang of 14. One \nof the criteria of the Gang of 14 is that we would not filibuster a \nnominee to a court or the Supreme Court unless it was under \n``extraordinary circumstances.'' I do not speak for the other Members. \nEach of those Members speaks for himself or herself. I do believe--at \nleast in my opinion, I am convinced--that even though various Members \nof the Senate on the other side of the aisle may oppose and vote \nagainst Justice Roberts' nomination, and perhaps for well-founded \nreasons, that by no means, by any stretch of the imagination, would \nJustice Roberts, because of his credentials, because of his service, \nbecause of his extraordinary qualifications, meet the extraordinary \ncircumstances criteria.\n  Again, I only speak for myself, but having been in on those \nnegotiations about extraordinary circumstances for hundreds of hours, I \nbelieve Judge Roberts deserves an up-or-down vote, and I hope the other \nmembers of that group would also agree with me.\n  So I think this is a good day for America. We start a process which \nwe should complete by the first week in October so that Justice Roberts \ncan sit in the fall session of the U.S. Supreme Court. I think many of \nus watching him on television last night as he stated his profound \nappreciation for the role of the U.S. Supreme Court in our \nconstitutional democracy, as well as his deep regard for the Court as \nan institution--this is without a doubt a man who is not only fit to \nface the magnitude of the task before him but who has the temperament \nand the judgment to understand the seriousness of his possible service \nas a member of our Nation's highest Court.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nSenate proceed to a vote in relation to the Chambliss amendment No. \n1271 following the vote in relation to the Landrieu amendment with no \nsecond-degree amendments in order to the amendment prior to the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. What that means is that at the moment, there are two \nstacked votes at 2:30, the Landrieu amendment and the Chambliss \namendment.\n  I see that the Senator from Texas is in the Chamber and would like to \naddress the Senate, I believe as in morning business, on another issue.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to proceed as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I add my voice of support to the \nPresident's decision to nominate Judge John G. Roberts to the U.S. \nSupreme Court. The process of selecting the next Associate Justice \nshould reflect the best of the American judiciary and not the worst of \nAmerican politics. From the President, the American people deserve a \nSupreme Court nominee who reveres the law. From the Senate, the \nAmerican people deserve a confirmation process that is civil, \ndignified, respectful, and one that does its dead level best to keep \npolitics out of the process.\n  Yesterday, President Bush did his part by announcing the nomination \nof Judge Roberts, and now it is up to us in the Senate to do our part \nto ensure that the process for confirming this nomination does honor to \nthe Supreme Court, to the Senate, and to the Nation.\n  The Supreme Court of the United States is one of our Nation's most \ncherished institutions. It is also our Nation's most powerful symbol of \nour commitment to constitutional democracy and the rule of law. We need \nmen and women who serve on that Court who meet the highest standards of \nintegrity, intellect, and character. Most important, we need men and \nwomen who are committed to the principle that the duty of unelected \njudges in a democracy is to apply the law as written by the people's \nrepresentatives and not to make the law up as they go along.\n  By every indication, Judge Roberts fits this description of what I \nwould consider to be an ideal nominee. Judge Roberts was educated at \nHarvard College and Harvard Law School. Before he became a judge on the \nDistrict of Columbia Court of Appeals in 2003, he was widely regarded \nas one of the most outstanding advocates practicing before the U.S. \nSupreme Court. He has argued dozens of cases before the Court, both as \na lawyer in private practice in Washington and as a public servant.\n\n[[Page S8519]]\n\n  Over the years, he has held a wide variety of positions with the \nDepartment of Justice, including Principal Deputy Solicitor General, \nthe Federal Government's second highest ranking lawyer before the U.S. \nSupreme Court. With these credentials, it is not surprising that we \nconfirmed this nominee to the Court of Appeals by unanimous consent \njust 2 years ago.\n  Although Judge Roberts has been on the bench only since 2003, his \ndistinguished legal career leaves no doubt that he is extraordinarily \nwell qualified for the Supreme Court. It bears remembering that Chief \nJustice Rehnquist had never served as a judge before he was nominated \nto the Court. Similarly, Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, who Justice \nRoberts will be succeeding if confirmed, had served only briefly as a \nState court judge before she was elevated to the Supreme Court. As \nSenator Leahy, the ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, \nsaid at her confirmation hearing, although:\n\n      . . . her tenure on the appellate bench has not been long in \n     years . . . we should realize that only 60 of the 101 \n     Justices sitting now or in the past have had any prior \n     judicial experience. Only 41 of these have had more than 5 \n     years of service when confirmed, and among those who had no \n     prior experience when confirmed to the United States Supreme \n     Court were included John Marshall and Joseph Story.\n\n  As you know, Justices Marshall and Story were two of the most \ndistinguished Justices who ever served on the Supreme Court and, \nindeed, in our Nation's history. Although the number cited by Senator \nLeahy has changed some over the years since Justice O'Connor was \nconfirmed, his point still stands. One does not need to be a career \njurist to serve this Nation with distinction as a Justice of the U.S. \nSupreme Court.\n  I believe the President has made a commendable decision, nominating \nJudge Roberts. As I stated earlier, the American people deserve from \nthe President a Supreme Court nominee who reveres the law. From all \nreports, that is exactly what the American people received yesterday. \nFrom the Senate, the American people deserve a confirmation process \nthat is civil, dignified, and respectful, and one that keeps politics \nout of the judiciary as much as is humanly possible.\n  One of the challenges we face when considering a nominee, and \nparticularly one such as Judge Roberts who has had such a long and \ndistinguished career serving clients, is to understand that his work on \nbehalf of his clients does not necessarily reflect his personal views \nthat may appear on a variety of legal documents likely to come before \nthe Senate. As all of us who have practiced law know, the duty of the \nlawyer is to make sure to make the very best possible argument on \nbehalf of his or her client, regardless of whether the lawyer would \nagree with those arguments in the first instance. Litigants in our \nadversarial system of justice are supposed to be judged by a jury of \ntheir peers, not by their lawyers.\n  I think it very important that we keep this in mind. Just as we would \nnot judge Judge Roberts nor should we judge Judge Roberts by the \npositions he has taken on behalf of clients he has represented, we \nwould not judge a prospective nominee should he or she have practiced, \nlet's say, in the area of criminal law, and have defended people who \nhave been accused of crimes. We would not impute those crimes or that \nposition to the lawyer who is representing them, providing them the \nlegal defense to which they are entitled under our constitutional \nsystem. My argument is we should simply apply that same standard to \nJudge Roberts and any other nominee as well.\n  I think it is also important that we remain aware there are those \noutside of this Chamber who will try to taint this process. Already we \nhave seen those who seem to have had a ``fill in the blank'' press \nreleases, waiting only for the name of the prospective nominee before \nthey send them out into cyberspace and across America and indeed around \nthe world. We know there are those outside these Chambers who will try \nto vilify any nominee in order to exploit this process for political \ngain, including raising money. I can only hope we will not, in this \nbody, the 100 Senators who work here and represent our constituents, be \ntempted by the outside interest groups to engage in the same sort of \nirresponsible rhetoric that is used by too many of them.\n  Let us behave as Senators. Let us do our human best to uphold the \ndignity of this great body. And let us try to uphold the dignity of the \nU.S. Supreme Court and conduct ourselves in a manner worthy of the \nAmerican people. History affords some benchmarks to the Senate for \ndetermining whether the Senate has undertaken a confirmation process \nworthy of the Court and of the American people. There is a right way \nand, unfortunately, a wrong way to debate the merits of a Supreme Court \nnominee.\n  In 1993, as I have observed previously on this floor, President \nClinton nominated Ruth Bader Ginsburg, a distinguished jurist but one \nwith an extensive record of activism in a variety of liberal causes \noutside of the judiciary. The Senate looked past all of that and voted \nto confirm Justice Ginsburg by an overwhelming bipartisan vote. The \nSenate did so because we understood our proper role in the confirmation \nprocess should embody three principles: First, that we should focus our \nattention on judicial qualifications, not personal political \npreferences; second, we should engage in respectful and honest inquiry, \nnot partisan personal attacks; and third, we should apply the same fair \nprocess, confirmation or rejection by majority vote, that has existed \nfor more than 214 years of our Nation's history.\n  Yes, this is an important moment for our country. The nomination of \nany person to the U.S. Supreme Court is a celebration of our \nConstitution and our Nation's commitment to the rule of law. The \nPresident has nominated an impressive individual to serve on our \nNation's highest Court and I look forward, as just one Member of this \nbody, to a dignified, civil, and respectful confirmation process in the \nSenate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask to be recognized to speak as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I am glad I am following the comments of \nmy colleague Senator Cornyn because we are both privileged to serve on \nthe Senate Judiciary Committee, which will be the first line of inquiry \nin relation to Judge John Roberts, who has been nominated by President \nBush to serve on the U.S. Supreme Court.\n  I have been in public life for over 20 years and cast over 10,000 \nvotes on so many different topics. If you had asked me what is the most \nimportant vote you have ever cast, it is easy; the most important vote \nyou are ever called on to cast is whether America goes to war, because \nyou know as a result of that vote, if the answer is affirmative, that \nAmericans will lose their lives. You will ask families to give up their \nsons and daughters, husbands and wives, brothers and sisters, in the \nname of defending America. So there is nothing more important than that \nvote. It is one of the few times--and I faced it three or four times in \nmy congressional career--when you really do lose sleep. You toss in bed \nat night thinking, What is the right thing to do?\n  I would say that after a vote on war, the second most challenging \nvote is the one we will face in a few weeks right here in the Senate, \nthe selection of an individual to serve on the Supreme Court. Why is it \nso important? I think it is important because we know, America knows, \nthe Supreme Court is a very special institution in our democratic form \nof Government. It may be--in fact I would argue that it is--the single \nmost important institution when it comes to protecting our rights and \nliberties. Across that street--we can see it through the glass door \nhere--is the Supreme Court, with nine individuals who will make \ndecisions on a regular basis that will change the face of America, \nchange the lives of American people. Think about the power you give to \nthat person who serves in the Supreme Court: a lifetime appointment to \nstand in judgment not only of individuals and their causes, but to \nstand in judgment of laws that have been written by past generations \nand to stand in judgment of new laws that come before them with \nconstitutional questions and policy questions. It is a momentous \nresponsibility.\n  Rarely does the Senate have an opportunity to consider a vacancy on \nthe Supreme Court. I have served now for 9\n\n[[Page S8520]]\n\nyears in the Senate and never cast a vote on a Supreme Court nominee. \nThis is the longest period of time since 1823 when we have not had a \nvacancy on the Supreme Court. Now we do. With the retirement of Justice \nSandra Day O'Connor we have an opportunity to fill this vacancy with a \nperson of quality, someone who will serve our Nation.\n  President Bush has nominated Judge John Roberts of the District Court \nof Appeals. I am familiar with him to a limited extent because he came \nbefore our Senate Judiciary Committee several years ago. I think I \nwould concede, and most would concede, the obvious: He is a very well \nqualified person. This man was summa cum laude at Harvard, editor of \nthe Harvard Law Review, and has had some of the most important \nresponsibilities as Principal Deputy Solicitor General speaking on \nbehalf of the Government of the United States of America. He has worked \nat one of the most prestigious law firms in our country. There is no \nquestion about this man's legal skill--none at all.\n  Nor has there been any serious question of any kind raised about his \nintegrity, his honesty. I have not heard a single word suggesting he \ndoes not have the temperament to be a Federal judge. After all, it is a \nlifetime appointment and those of us who practiced law before Federal \njudges know that sometimes lifetime appointments can go to their heads \nand they become somewhat imperial. That has never been suggested when \nit comes to Judge Roberts.\n  So you say: Senator, if his legal skills are accepted, if he is an \nhonest man, if his temperament is good, why not approve him and get on \nwith it? Because this is the Supreme Court. And because the American \npeople expect us to go through the regular process of asking important \nquestions. What are those questions? I think they come down to these: \nWe need to know whether a nominee such as Judge Roberts is in the \nmainstream of American values; whether he is coming to this position on \nthe Supreme Court with a balanced view, an open mind, the kind of \njudicial outlook on the challenges he faces which will do the Court \nproud and do the Nation proud.\n  What kinds of issues will we talk about? When we come to the \nJudiciary Committee I am sure there will be questions of civil rights. \nIn my lifetime, America has changed dramatically in the field of civil \nrights. I can recall as a youngster seeing evidence of segregation, \neven growing up in East St. Louis, IL--segregated schools, segregated \nswimming pools--in my lifetime. But that changed in the 1960s and we \ndecided as a Nation that it diminished us to discriminate against \npeople because of their race.\n  We have decided since that the same rules should apply in many ways \nto questions of gender equity, whether women should have the same \nopportunity as men. So this whole body of law, this whole movement in \nthe United States on civil rights is a movement we have come to accept \nas part of America. There are some who still resist it, but most \nAmericans believe we are a stronger and better nation when we celebrate \nour diversity. The Supreme Court is the place where key decisions on \ncivil rights will be decided. The rights of minorities, the rights of \nwomen, the rights of those with minority religious beliefs, the rights \nof the disabled--that Court will make those decisions.\n  Isn't it important to know whether Judge Roberts stands in the \nmainstream of values when it comes to our civil rights? I think it is \nessential. It is one of the most important questions.\n  What about the rights of women? They have been debated quite a bit on \nthe floor of the Senate and the House, certainly before the Supreme \nCourt. People point to the case of Roe v. Wade. That is the litmus test \ncase for so many people. But I think it goes much deeper. It isn't just \nthe question of abortion--which is controversial, and many people in \ngood faith feel strongly for and against a woman's right to make that \ndecision. But at the heart of that debate is something even more \nfundamental, the right of privacy. What is it that I should expect as \nan American citizen, that I should guard as my individual right of \nprivacy? What right of privacy does my family have? Where can I draw \nthe line and say the Government cannot cross this line?\n  There have been cases before the Supreme Court that decided that, \nmade those decisions and decided where that line would be drawn. Let me \ntell you of one, because when I tell youngsters--I just had a group of \ncollege students I spoke to here on the Hill. When I tell them the \nstory, I can see they are absolutely amazed, but this is something that \nhappened in recent memory for some. Just a few weeks ago was the 40th \nanniversary of a Supreme Court decision called Griswold v. Connecticut. \nIt was a landmark decision. The nine Justices found in our \nConstitution--which I keep in my desk and Senator Byrd carries with him \nat every waking moment--a concept that is not written in the \nConstitution. Search this Constitution with Robert C. Byrd at your side \nand you will never find the word privacy, but the Supreme Court found \nthe concept of privacy in this Constitution when they considered the \ncase of Griswold v. Connecticut.\n\n  What was that case all about? A little history is worth repeating. At \nthe turn of the last century, the 19th century, there was a man named \nAnthony Comstock. Mr. Comstock came from the State of New York. He had \npassionate convictions when it came to morality. He believed it was \nwrong to have any form of pornography, any form of abortion, and any \nform of birth control. After passing a State law in New York, he was \nelected to Congress, which enacted the Comstock law that said basically \nwe prohibit the dissemination of information even about birth control, \nand then Congress did something more. They gave Anthony Comstock of New \nYork extraordinary powers that no American has today. They made him an \nagent of the U.S. Post Office and gave him the power to investigate and \narrest people who violated the law that was passed in his name.\n  He spent his adult life traveling across the United States trying to \nfind those who were giving people counseling on birth control or \nabortions, and so forth, and prosecuting them under the law in his \nname. Before he died, he said he had filled up 61 different passenger \ntrain cars with all the people he had arrested in the name of his law, \nand it was in that Anthony Comstock tradition that States such as \nConnecticut enacted laws which said no married person can legally go to \na pharmacy and have a prescription filled for birth control pills. In \n1965, no doctor in Connecticut could legally prescribe birth control \npills, and no pharmacist could legally fill the prescription for a \nmarried person. This was the law in Connecticut in 1965. When I tell \nthat to young people today, they say: you have to be kidding. No. That \nwas the law in Connecticut and other States.\n  When the law was challenged, the Supreme Court across the street \nsaid: that is wrong. That is such an intimate, personal, private \ndecision, the Government should stay away from it. And in this \nConstitution, without the express words, they found the concept of \nprivacy, and that concept of privacy 8 years later was part of the \nrationale for Roe v. Wade, that that decision on terminating a \npregnancy was a personal, private family decision and that except under \nextraordinary circumstances the Government should not get involved.\n  So when Judge Roberts comes before us, some have argued that it is \nout of line for us to ask him: what is your position when it comes to \nthe Government and the right of privacy? I think it is fundamental. I \nwant to know what is in his heart and what is in his mind.\n  Does he believe in this concept we have seen enshrined in Supreme \nCourt decisions, or does he believe the Government should infringe on \nprivacy rights?\n  You say, well, Senator, you are pointing to cases that are 40 years \nold, 30 years old. How is that relevant today? Consider the matter of \nTerri Schiavo, the tragedy involving this poor young woman who for 15 \nyears was in this--I do not know if vegetative state is the proper \nword, or comatose state, kept alive by a feeding tube, case after case \nin court as to whether her husband, who said he expressed her will that \nshe didn't want to live under these circumstances, had the right to end \nthis feeding tube, case after case, court after court, squabbles and \narguments within the family--good faith, genuine arguments. And then \nfinally\n\n[[Page S8521]]\n\nthe day came when all these legal appeals had been exhausted. There was \na movement in Congress to step in, to have the Federal courts and the \nFederal Government step into that hospital room, the room where that \ntragic story of Terri Schiavo was taking place. The argument was made \nin this Chamber and on the floor of the House that the privacy of that \nfamily, this intimate personal decision, should take a back seat to the \nright of the Federal court to insert itself into that room.\n  Think about it. Hundreds and thousands of American families every \nsingle day make that hard decision. They do it hoping they have done \nthe right thing for the poor person who is suffering and for the family \nthat survives. And some argued at that moment, when that doctor and \nthat family has to sit down and make that heart-breaking decision, it \nis time for the Federal court to step in. The right of privacy, a right \nstill unresolved and that will be resolved many times over by the \nperson we put on the Supreme Court.\n  Workers' rights, the right to work in a safe workplace, the right to \nbe paid a fair wage, the right to make certain that if you have paid a \nlifetime into a retirement system and someone tries to take it away, \nyou have a moment in court to stand up for what you have worked for. \nThose decisions course through the Federal courts all the way to the \nSupreme Court, and this nominee and others who are the deciding votes \nmake those decisions.\n  I could go on with all of the agenda the new Supreme Court Justice \nmight face, but I hope in these few moments that I have spoken, you \nunderstand the gravity of this decision.\n  Judge Roberts is 50 years old. If he is a healthy person with a good \nlifespan, he may sit on that Court for a quarter of a century. He may \nbe there 25 or 30 years. We have one chance, only one, to ask questions \nof him, to ask what is in his heart, what are his values, does he \nreflect the mainstream of America.\n\n  Sandra Day O'Connor, when she came to the Court, was befriended and \nsponsored by one of the greats who served in the Senate, Barry \nGoldwater of Arizona. I can remember as a college student, Barry \nGoldwater's race for President of the United States in 1964. He was \nrunning as a genuine conservative and he lost. LBJ beat him handily. \nBut he came back to the Senate, retired, and always maintained his \ndignity and interest in public service. When you look back at his \ncareer, he was more a libertarian than conservative, but he surely \ninspired a lot of people. He wanted Sandra Day O'Connor to serve on the \nSupreme Court. He liked the fact she was so talented. She graduated No. \n3 in her class at Stanford Law School, had a tough time finding a job \nbecause she was a woman, and was elected to the State senate. Senator \nBarry Goldwater thought running for public office was a good thing. I \ndo, too. I think running for public office humbles the exalted and it \nis a good thing when people have that experience. And she became the \nfirst woman to serve on the Supreme Court. Most people said she would \nfollow in the Barry Goldwater conservative tradition, and she did, but \nit was mainstream conservatism. It was the kind of conservatism that \nmany in the Republican Party and even some in the Democratic Party are \nvery comfortable with.\n  Later in her career of 24 years of service you saw the libertarian \nstreak coming out in her opinions. She started standing up for a \nwoman's right to choose. She did not want to eliminate Roe v. Wade. She \nstood up when it came to affirmative action at the University of \nMichigan. She stood up when it came to the rights of prisoners and \ndetainees even in this war on terrorism--sort of unpredictable, but \nclearly demonstrating that she had an open mind even as a mainstream \nconservative.\n  Now, I am resigned to the fact that when President Bush nominates \nsomeone to the Supreme Court, it won't be my choice. I am resigned to \nthe fact that person will be a conservative. But what I am looking for \nand many Democrats are looking for is someone who is a mainstream \nconservative. I want them to hold the basic conservative values but not \ncome to the Court with some movement on their mind, some political \nagenda on their mind. I want them to look at things honestly, with an \nopen mind.\n  I sincerely hope Judge Roberts ends up being one of those people as \nwe consider his nomination. We need to find out basic things about him, \nquestions that were not answered when he stood for confirmation to the \nU.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. He has the \nintelligence for the job. We will ask him whether he has the \nindependence for the job. He has the credentials for the job. But we \nneed to ask questions about his commitment to the basic freedoms and \nliberties in America. The Senate must determine through this \nconfirmation process whether Judge Roberts is entitled to a lifetime \nposition on the highest Court of the land. I know he avoided some \nanswers in an earlier hearing. I hope he will be open and candid and \nhonest at his next hearing. I do not insist that he agree with me on \nevery issue, but I insist that he be open and honest in his answers so \nwe can understand where he is coming from. The Senate and the American \npeople have a right to know where he stands.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, will the distinguished Senator yield? I \nask unanimous consent that I can follow the Senator from Texas and seek \nrecognition.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Madam President, I think President Bush has hit a \nhome run. Because I was with the Baylor Lady Bears this morning \ncongratulating them on winning the national NCAA women's basketball \nchampionship, I would say he hit a three-pointer from midcourt. I think \nJohn Roberts is exactly what our country expects in quality and \ndemeanor for a person to be elevated to the highest court in our land. \nThe Supreme Court is such an important part of our Constitution, \nunique, really, in the world, that we have a judicial branch with such \nstature as the coequal branch of government along with the President \nand the Congress. For someone to be able to sit on the Supreme Court, \nyou look for a John Roberts, someone who has integrity, temperament for \nthe Court, and you have to have judicial temperament because you are an \narbiter who is going to affect people's lives.\n  Academic achievement. We want our Supreme Court Justices to have the \nfinest legal mind possible, and John Roberts fits that description--\nHarvard, summa cum laude graduate; Harvard Law School, graduated with \nhonors, and respect of his peers. When you have someone such as Walter \nDellinger, who served as Solicitor General under President Bill \nClinton, who told the Judiciary Committee at one point, ``In my view, \nthere is no better appellate advocate than John Roberts,'' I think that \nshows the range of support and respect from his peers John Roberts has. \nHe has experience in a variety of legal fields including, of course, \nserving on the Circuit Court of Appeals, second only to the Supreme \nCourt. But he is also young enough that he will be able to make a \nlasting impression on the Supreme Court. At the age of 50, we know he \nhas many years to serve.\n  Some people have asked me, well, didn't you want a woman? Well, yes, \nof course, I did. Of course, I think diversity is important on the \nSupreme Court. I would like to see another woman. I would like to see a \nHispanic American on the Supreme Court. But I believe first and \nforemost what we want is the very best person, and for this time the \nPresident has chosen John Roberts. I think we should give him our full \nsupport.\n  Yes, the Senate is going to do its due diligence. Yes, we are going \nto meet our responsibilities. We are going to ask questions. We are \ngoing to examine his background. Of course, we are going to look at his \nrecord as an attorney, as a judge. But we also are going to do it with \nintegrity and with a respect for the process. I think Justice \nGinsburg's confirmation process is an example. In fact, President \nClinton's two nominees for the Court took an average of 58 days from \nnomination to confirmation. I think 2 months is an acceptable amount of \ntime to be able to delve into someone's background and career, to be \nable to ask the questions you would expect from the Senate, and I \nthought\n\n[[Page S8522]]\n\nthat in President Clinton's nominations we gave him deference. As \nSenator Durbin said, just before me, President Bush is not going to \nappoint someone Dick Durbin would appoint. Well, certainly President \nClinton isn't going to appoint someone that I would also nominate. But \nthat wasn't the question. The people of America elected President \nClinton, just as they elected President Bush. So we now need to look at \ntheir nominee, knowing that perhaps the philosophy may not be the same \non the other side of the aisle as it is going to be for President \nBush's nominee. But I want the same deference given to John Roberts I \ngave to Ruth Bader Ginsburg. I looked at her record of integrity, I \nlistened to the people who were for her and against her, and I \ndetermined that for President Clinton this was a nominee who should be \nsupported. She would not meet my litmus test of issues, but she is an \nacademically qualified person of integrity with judicial temperament.\n\n  I hope Judge Roberts receives the same level of support and respect \nthat has been given to Justice Ginsburg by this Senate.\n  President Bush and the White House staff have demonstrated an \nunprecedented level of consultation with Senators. I don't think any \nPresident and his staff have consulted with as many Senators as \nPresident Bush has on this, his first nominee. I was very pleased to be \ncalled and to be able to give names.\n  I admit that John Roberts was one of the names I mentioned in my \nconsultation call as the example of the very great legal mind and \nopportunity he would bring to the Court. He is the kind of person we \nexpect to be appointed to the U.S. Supreme Court.\n  Everything I have heard so far, both from Democrats and Republicans--\nRepublicans being supportive, Democrats being wait and see, let's look \nat the record, but not negative--is a good thing. John Roberts is going \nto meet every test. He showed when he was at his Senate confirmation \nhearing for his circuit court of appeals appointment that he is really \ngood. He had tough questions. You could see the intelligence coming \nthrough.\n  I know he is a family man. He was with his wife and two precious \nchildren at the hearing he had a couple of years ago and then again \nlast night. He is a family man who will be a role model for children, \nfor our country, and a patriot, a person who wants to be a public \nservant, someone who believes in our country and the role of the \nSupreme Court in our country.\n  This is a man who is going to be confirmed very easily. I hope that \nis the case. I hope the Senate will show how the Senate ought to \noperate with due diligence and, yes, asking questions in a respectful \nway for this very esteemed judge who is being proposed for the Supreme \nCourt by our President.\n  I am proud of our President. He has done a terrific job of looking at \nall of the options and saying he wants one of his legacies to be the \nselection of a great Supreme Court Justice who will serve for a long \ntime. He has made the right choice.\n  I support this nomination. I support the right of the Senate to do \nour responsibility under the Constitution for advice and consent. That \nis going to happen from the early indications I have seen, in the talk \nshows, in the questioning by the media, and also in the Senate. I look \nforward to the next 2 months and seeing this institution do what we \nought to be doing in the right way.\n  I am very proud today to support the nomination of John Roberts to \nthe Supreme Court of the United States.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chafee). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be set aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1304\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I send to the desk an amendment that has \nnot yet been filed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New York [Mr. Schumer] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1304.\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To require a report to Congress on mergers of certain United \n                     States and foreign companies)\n\n       On page 326, between lines 10 and 11, insert the following:\n\n\n                         REPORT ON RECIPROCITY\n\n       Sec. 6113. (a) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, \n     no agency or department of the United States may approve a \n     merger between a United States company and a foreign-owned \n     company or an acquisition of a United State company by a \n     foreign-owned company prior to 30 days after the date on \n     which the Secretary of State submits to Congress the report \n     required by subsection (c).\n       (b) In this section:\n       (1) The term ``appropriate congressional committees'' means \n     the Committee on Appropriations, the Committee on Armed \n     Services, the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban \n     Affairs, and the Select Committee on Intelligence of the \n     Senate and the Committee on Appropriations, the Committee on \n     Armed Services, the Committee on Financial Services, and the \n     Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence of the House of \n     Representatives.\n       (2) The term ``foreign-owned company'' means an entity that \n     is owned or controlled by the government of a foreign \n     country.\n       (3) The term ``entity'' means a partnership, association, \n     trust, joint venture, corporation, or other organization.\n       (4) The term ``owned or controlled'' means--\n       (A) in the case of a corporation, the holding of at least \n     50 percent (by vote or value) of the capital structure of the \n     corporation; and\n       (B) in the case of any other kind of legal entity, the \n     holding of interests representing at least 50 percent of the \n     capital structure of the entity.\n       (5) The term ``United States company'' means an entity that \n     has its primary place of business in the United States and \n     that is publicly traded on a United States based stock \n     exchange.\n       (c) The report referred to in subsection (a) is a report \n     submitted to the appropriate congressional committees by the \n     Secretary of State, in consultation with the Secretary of \n     Commerce, on a proposed merger between a United States \n     company and a foreign-owned company or an acquisition of a \n     United State company by a foreign-owned company. Such report \n     shall include an assessment of whether the law and \n     regulations of the government that owns or controls the \n     foreign-owned company would generally permit a United States \n     company in the same industry as the foreign-owned company to \n     purchase, acquire, merge, or otherwise establish a joint \n     relationship with an entity whose primary place of business \n     is located in such foreign country.\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, we have had some discussion floating \naround this Foreign Operations appropriations bill about the proposed \nCNOOC-Unocal merger. As I understand it, amendments that directly \naffect that merger have been withdrawn. That is not a problem, as far \nas I am concerned, if the sponsors of those amendments on both sides of \nthe aisle wish to delay offering the amendments, to do it on a \ndifferent appropriations bill.\n  My amendment is different. Let me explain.\n  My basic problem with the CNOOC-Unocal merger is not the same as that \nof many of my colleagues.\n  I am not sure it meets the strategic test, and I am willing to leave \nthat to the body that judges that strategic test. I have a different \nproblem. It is a problem that the Senator from South Carolina and I \nhave talked about in terms of currency and other issues; that is, China \ndoesn't play fair. What China thinks is good for China, they don't \nthink is good for American companies. That is true here in terms of \nmergers. CNOOC wishes to buy Unocal, an important company in the United \nStates dealing with a very important commodity--oil--whether it meets \nthe strategic test or not. But if you look at the ability of American \ncompanies to buy Chinese companies in industries that China considers \nstrategic, you will find barriers along the way. At least that is what \nI have found.\n  What is good for the goose is good for the gander. We ought to have \nsome degree of reciprocity. If the Chinese--in this case, the Chinese \nGovernment, since they own 70 percent of CNOOC--wish to buy an American \ncompany, why should they be allowed to block\n\n[[Page S8523]]\n\nAmerican companies that wish to buy similarly situated Chinese \ncompanies, the American automobile industry, the American construction \nindustry, the American financial services industry? I will be issuing a \nreport shortly which shows that in these strategic industries, American \nfirms have barriers placed in their way. All of them meet approval. Yet \nin instance after instance, the American company cannot buy a majority \nshare. The barriers are different for different industries, but they \nexist. In fact, foreign investment in China is divided into four \ncategories--encouraged, permitted, restricted, and prohibited. Even in \nthe nonprohibited categories, all foreign investment must be approved \nby the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation called MFTEC.\n  The United States has a policy of being open to foreign direct \ninvestment in nearly every case, and strict levels of Government \napproval are only reserved for the most sensitive transactions \ninvolving national security. Of the 1,525 cases that have been filed \nwith the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States since \n1988, only 25 have warranted investigation; 12 have been reported to \nthe President, and only one has been denied. In the converse situation, \nwhere American firms seek to buy Chinese companies, the devil is often \nin the details. The Chinese Government creates de facto barriers that \nalmost always require Western companies to give up some degree of \ncontrol over its enterprise that would be highly irregular in any truly \nfree market.\n  What is more, it is nearly impossible to gain an accurate picture of \nwhich investments, mergers, and joint ventures are rejected by the \nChinese Government because companies' investors don't publicly want to \nadmit it. The Chinese will say to General Motors or General Electric or \nscores of smaller companies: We will let you do it, but only under \nthese circumstances. And the company, not wanting to offend the \nChinese, doesn't fight the circumstances. All too often these large \ncompanies have an interest to their shareholders--they are supposed \nto--but not to the United States. If it serves their interest to send \nthe technology to China, even though it will create many jobs in China \nand hurt jobs here in the United States, so be it. It is good for \nGeneral Motors. So it is hard to figure this out. As I said, we have \nbegun to do it, and we will be issuing a report shortly about it.\n  There are additional complications when a U.S. company wants to merge \nor acquire a Chinese state-owned enterprise such as a CNOOC, which is a \nstate-owned enterprise, because any merger with an SOE requires \nadditional approval of many state agencies, and so in instance after \ninstance, which we will highlight in our report, the Chinese do not \nplay the same way with our companies that they want us to play with \ntheir companies.\n  What our amendment does is very simple. It does not prohibit a merger \nfrom taking place. It simply requires a report be submitted to the \nSecretary of State, in consultation with the Secretary of Commerce, to \nassess whether that country will allow a similar transaction to occur \nin the opposite direction. The aim is not building barriers but simple \nreciprocity--fair, part of free trade, and better for everybody.\n  I hope my colleagues will accept this amendment. It doesn't go to the \nheart of this merger--that is a different issue which we will delay and \ndo on a different bill--but, rather, goes to the point that the Chinese \nshould treat our companies the way they want us to treat theirs.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                       Nomination of John Roberts\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise to speak on behalf of the \nprospective member of the Supreme Court. The nomination of Judge John \nRoberts has been transmitted to the Senate by President Bush. I express \nmy very strong support, based on the facts as we now know them, for \nthis outstanding individual.\n  I wish to commend the President of the United States on his \nselection, and particularly commend him with regard to the procedures \nhe followed pursuant to the constitutional clause of advice and \nconsent. He consulted a number of the Members of the Senate in the \ncontext of this nomination of Judge Roberts and, indeed, the process \nthat will soon be undertaken by the Senate.\n  Also, I wish to speak to the Gang of 14, a bipartisan group of 14 \nindividuals, 7 Republicans and 7 Democrats, of which I have been \nprivileged to have been a member of from the very beginning, and I wish \nto speak to the work the group performed on behalf of the leadership \nand the Members of this body.\n  In the course of drawing up the memorandum of understanding between \nmembers of the Gang of 14, I was privileged to work with my good friend \nof so many years and, indeed, a former leader of the Senate, Robert \nByrd of West Virginia. We devised the portion of our memorandum of \nunderstanding as it relates to advice and consent. Speaking for myself, \nI believe the President lived up to, in every respect, what our \nexpectations and desires were in putting in that clause. I thank my \nfriend from West Virginia, as I have often done on the floor of the \nSenate, for his advice, and sometimes consent, to my own views.\n  Mr. President, that group of 14 did provide the foundation for our \nleaders--Republican and Democrat--to bring forth the nominations of six \nFederal circuit judges, each of whom received the advice and consent of \nthe Senate, and now serve as federal judges. I think that is an \nimportant point that should be brought up in the context of this \nnomination.\n  Also, the question is sometimes asked about another clause of our \nmemorandum of understanding, extraordinary circumstances. I feel as \nfollows:\n  By way of background, I was privileged to introduce the then-lawyer \nJohn Roberts to the Senate Judiciary Committee on two occasions. The \nJudiciary Committee had two hearings and asked him to appear in both \ninstances.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the remarks I \nmade at those hearings, which detail extensively his biography and the \nlike.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n   Statement and Submitted Remarks of Senator John Warner Before the \n              Senate Judiciary Committee on Jan. 29, 2003\n\n       Mr. WARNER. Chairman Hatch, Senator Leahy, and members of \n     the committee, I will ask to submit my statement for the \n     record----\n       The Chairman. Without objection, all statements will be put \n     in the record.\n       Senator Warner [continuing]. For 3 reasons: First, as a \n     courtesy to the committee and to our guests who have been \n     very patient; secondly, this nominee, John Roberts, is indeed \n     one of the most outstanding that I have ever had the \n     privilege of presenting on behalf of a President in my 25 \n     years in the U.S. Senate. His record needs no enhancement by \n     this humble Senator, I assure you.\n       So I ask that the committee receive this nomination. He is \n     accompanied by his wife Jane, his children Josephine and \n     John, who have been unusually quiet, and we thank you very \n     much and patient, his parents and his sisters.\n       If I may indulge a personal observation, Mr. Roberts is \n     designated to serve on the Circuit Court of Appeals for the \n     District of Columbia.\n       Exactly one-half century ago, 50 years, I was a clerk on \n     that court, and so I take a particular interest in presenting \n     this nominee.\n       Also, the nominee is a member of the firm of Hogan & \n     Hartson, one of the leading firms in the Nation's capital. \n     Fifty years ago, I was a member of that firm. And I just \n     reminisced with the nominee. I was the 34th lawyer in that \n     firm, which was one of the largest in the Nation's capital. \n     Today, there are 1,000 members of that law firm, to show you \n     the change in the practice of law in the half-century that I \n     have been a witness to this.\n       Mr. Chairman, you covered in your opening remarks every \n     single fact that I had hopefully desired to inform the \n     committee. So, again, for that reason you have, most \n     courteously, Mr. Chairman, stated all of the pertinent facts \n     about this extraordinary man, having graduated from Harvard, \n     summa cum laude, in 1976. Three years later, he graduated \n     from Harvard Law School, magna cum laude, where he served as \n     managing editor of the Harvard Law Review. Those of us who \n     have pursued the practice of law know that few of us could \n     have ever attained that status. Even if I went back and \n     started all over again, I could not do it. He served as law \n     clerk to Judge Friendly on the U.S. Court of\n\n[[Page S8524]]\n\n     Appeals for the Second Circuit and worked as a law clerk to \n     the current Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, Judge \n     Rehnquist--Justice Rehnquist.\n       So I commend the President, I commend this nominee. I am \n     hopeful that the committee will judiciously and fairly \n     consider this nomination and that the Senate will give its \n     advice and consent for this distinguished American to serve \n     as a part of our Judicial Branch.\n                                  ____\n\n\nStatement to the Judiciary Committee on the Nomination of John Roberts \n  To Serve as a Judge for the United States Court of Appeals for the \n             District of Columbia Circuit, January 29, 2003\n\n       Chairman Hatch, Senator Leahy, and my other distinguished \n     colleagues on the Senate's Judiciary Committee, I am pleased \n     to be here today to introduce Mr. John Roberts, an imminently \n     qualified nominee for a federal judgeship.\n       While Mr. Roberts now lives in Maryland, he is a former \n     resident of the Commonwealth of Virginia and a member of \n     Hogan & Hartson, a firm that I had the pleasure of being \n     affiliated with some years ago.\n       Joining Mr. Roberts today are many members of his family: \n     his wife Jane, his children Josephine and John, his parents, \n     and his sisters.\n       Mr. Roberts has been nominated for a judgeship on the \n     United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia \n     Circuit. This is a court that I am most familiar with.\n       Following my graduation from the University of Virginia Law \n     School in 1953, I was privileged to serve as a law clerk to \n     Judge E. Barrett Prettyman, on the United States Court of \n     Appeals for the D.C. Circuit. Judge Prettyman later became \n     Chief Judge of this important court.\n       As a result of the profound respect so many people, \n     including myself, had for Judge Prettyman, I had the honor \n     several years ago of sponsoring, and with the help of others, \n     passing legislation to name the federal courthouse in DC \n     after Judge Prettyman.\n       Now, almost 48 years after having served as a law clerk for \n     Judge Prettyman on this federal appeals court, I am pleased \n     to be here today to support the nomination of John Roberts to \n     the same court on which Judge Prettyman once served.\n       John Roberts has had a distinguished legal career. And, in \n     my view, his record indicates that he will serve as an \n     excellent jurist.\n       Mr. Roberts' resume is an impressive one. He graduated from \n     Harvard College, Summa Cum Laude, in 1976. Three years later, \n     he graduated from Harvard Law School, Magna Cum Laude, where \n     he served as managing editor of the Harvard Law Review.\n       He has served as a law clerk to Judge Friendly on the \n     United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit and \n     worked as a law clerk to the current chief justice of the \n     Supreme Court of the United States--Judge Rehnquist.\n       Mr. Roberts has also practiced law for over twenty years in \n     the public and private sectors. He has served as Associate \n     Counsel to President Reagan, worked as the Principal Deputy \n     Solicitor General of the United States, and worked as a civil \n     litigator at Hogan & Hartson, where he currently serves as \n     head of the firm's Appellate Practice Group.\n       Mr. Roberts has presented oral argument before the U.S. \n     Supreme Court in 39 cases covering an expansive list of legal \n     issues.\n       Without a doubt, Mr. Roberts' legal credentials make him \n     well qualified for the position to which he has been \n     nominated. I am thankful for his willingness to resume his \n     public service, and I am confident that he would serve as an \n     excellent jurist.\n       I urge my colleagues on the Committee to support his \n     nomination.\n                                  ____\n\n\n   Statement and Submitted Remarks of Senator John Warner Before the \nSenate Judiciary Commitee on April 30, 2003, During the Presentation of \n   William Emil Moschella, Nominee to Be Assistant Attorney General, \nOffice of Legislative Affairs, U.S. Department of Justice, and John G. \n Roberts, Jr., Nominee to Be Circuit Judge for the District of Columbia\n\n       Senator Warner. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\n       Now, Mr. Chairman, I should like to say a few words on \n     behalf of Mr. Roberts. This is my second appearance on behalf \n     of this distinguished individual, and I must say in my 25 \n     years in the Senate, I do not believe I have ever done this \n     before. But at the invitation of the Chair, I will appear \n     over and over again, be it necessary, on behalf of this \n     individual because I personally and, if I may say, \n     professionally feel very strongly about this nominee.\n       He has been nominated for a position on the United States \n     Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. If I \n     may say, following my graduation from the University of \n     Virginia Law School in 1953, I return this weekend for my \n     50th reunion, where I am privileged to address my class. But \n     following that, I was privileged to be a law clerk to Judge \n     E. Barrett Prettyman on the United States Circuit Court of \n     Appeals, the very circuit to which this nominee has been \n     appointed by the President of the United States.\n       I have a strong knowledge of this circuit, having started \n     my career there 48 years ago, and I feel that this candidate \n     will measure up in every respect to the distinguished members \n     of the circuit that have served in the past and who are \n     serving today. And I urge in the strongest of terms that he \n     be given fair consideration by this Committee and that he \n     will be voted out favorably.\n       Mr. Chairman and Senator Leahy, we start with he graduated \n     from Harvard College summa cum laude in 1976. Three years \n     later, he graduated from Harvard Law School magna cum laude, \n     where he served as managing editor of the Harvard Law Review. \n     He served as law clerk to Judge Friendly on the United States \n     Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit and worked as law \n     clerk to the current Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of \n     the United States, the Honorable Judge Rehnquist.\n       Also, he has practiced law for over 20 years. He served as \n     associate counsel to President Ronald Reagan, worked as the \n     Principal Deputy Solicitor General of the United States, and \n     has worked as a civil litigator in the firm of Hogan and \n     Hartson, which, I must say, I also served in following my \n     clerkship with Judge Prettyman.\n       So I do urge upon this Committee, Mr. Chairman, and all \n     members, that the fair consideration that is the duty of the \n     United States Senate under the Constitution under the advise \n     and consent provisions be exercised on behalf of this \n     distinguished nominee.\n       I thank you for the attention of the Committee, and I wish \n     you well.\n                                  ____\n\n\nStatement to the Judiciary Committee on the Nomination of John Roberts \n  To Serve as a Judge for the United States Court of Appeals for the \n              District of Columbia Circuit, April 30, 2003\n\n       Chairman Hatch, Senator Leahy, and my other distinguished \n     colleagues on the Senate's Judiciary Committee, I am pleased \n     to be here for a second time to introduce Mr. John Roberts, \n     an imminently qualified nominee for a federal judgeship. It \n     is my hope that after a second hearing on this important \n     nominee, this committee will recognize that this nominee is \n     eminently qualified for this judgeship.\n       While Mr. Roberts now lives in Maryland, he is a former \n     resident of the Commonwealth of Virginia and a member of \n     Hogan & Hartson, a firm that I had the pleasure of being \n     affiliated with some years ago.\n       Mr. Roberts has been nominated for a judgeship on the \n     United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia \n     Circuit. This is a court that I am most familiar with.\n       Following my graduation from the University of Virginia Law \n     School in 1953, I was privileged to serve as a law clerk to \n     Judge E. Barrett Prettyman, on the United States Court of \n     Appeals for the D.C. Circuit. Judge Prettyman later became \n     Chief Judge of this important court.\n       As a result of the profound respect so many people, \n     including myself, had for Judge Prettyman, I had the honor \n     several years ago of sponsoring, and with the help of others, \n     passing legislation to name the federal courthouse in DC \n     after Judge Prettyman.\n       Now, almost 48 years after having served as a law clerk for \n     Judge Prettyman on this federal appeals court, I am pleased \n     to be here today to support the nomination of John Roberts to \n     the same court on which Judge Prettyman once served.\n       John Roberts has had a distinguished legal career. And, in \n     my view, his record indicates that he will serve as an \n     excellent jurist.\n       Mr. Roberts' resume is an impressive one. He graduated from \n     Harvard College, Summa Cum Laude, in 1976. Three years later, \n     he graduated from Harvard Law School, Magna Cum Laude, where \n     he served as managing editor of the Harvard Law Review.\n       He has served as a law clerk to Judge Friendly on the \n     United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit and \n     worked as a law clerk to the current chief justice of the \n     Supreme Court of the United States--Judge Rehnquist.\n       Mr. Roberts has also practiced law for over twenty years in \n     the public and private sectors. He has served as Associate \n     Counsel to President Reagan, worked as the Principal Deputy \n     Solicitor General of the United States, and worked as a civil \n     litigator at Hogan & Hartson, where he currently serves as \n     head of the firm's Appellate Practice Group.\n       Mr. Roberts has presented oral argument before the U.S. \n     Supreme Court in 39 cases covering an expansive list of legal \n     issues.\n       Without a doubt, Mr. Roberts' legal credentials make him \n     well qualified for the position to which he has been \n     nominated. I am thankful for his willingness to resume his \n     public service, and I am confident that he would serve as an \n     excellent jurist.\n       I urge my colleagues on the Committee to support his \n     nomination.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. So I was privileged to have that opportunity. In the \ncontext of performing that task before the Judiciary Committee, I made \nan independent assessment for myself of his credentials to be a Federal \njudge. Indeed, I talked to a number of friends who knew him very well.\n  I point out that I was privileged to serve as a law clerk on the \nFederal Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, where he \nis currently serving. In addition, I had the great opportunity to be \nassociated with the law firm of Hogan & Hartson, eventually becoming a \npartner. Justice Roberts, of\n\n[[Page S8525]]\n\ncourse, in his distinguished career, likewise was a member of the firm \nof Hogan & Hartson before going into various responsible positions in \nthe executive branch, which are enumerated in my detailed biographical \nsketch of him.\n  I bring that up because I have a very strong feeling about the firm \nof Hogan & Hartson. I had the opportunity while there to be closely \naffiliated with senior partner Nelson T. Hartson. I was a junior lawyer \nand he was then general counsel to Riggs National Bank and other \nfinancial institutions here in the Nation's Capital. I had the \nprivilege of carrying his briefcase, as a young lawyer often did, and \npreparing his memorandum and briefs and the like during my own work for \nthose clients. He was a magnificent man of the old school and of the \nlaw firms of this Nation.\n  Hogan & Hartson stands out second to none as a law firm in this \nNation. I remember so well that Nelson T. Hartson had ethical standards \nsecond to none. His leadership permeated down through that firm, \ncertainly in those early days when I was privileged to be there. The \nfirm is much larger now, but it still has a profound reverence for its \nfounder, its leader and former senior partner Hartson, and the \nprinciples for which he stood, primarily in the area of ethics.\n  As to my independent examination, I certainly believe John Roberts \nbrings to this Senate a clear record of extraordinary public service \nand achievements. But the question is sometimes asked about the issue \nof extraordinary circumstances in reference to the memorandum of \nunderstanding among the Gang of 14. I can only express my own opinion, \nbut I do so very carefully.\n  I am respectful of the process by which the chairman and ranking \nmember of the Senate's Judiciary committee will examine this nominee. \nThey both are dear and valued friends whom I have known over the course \nof the 27 years I have served in the Senate. They have an important \nfunction to perform in the Judiciary Committee. In no way do I want to \nget out ahead of their examination of the record. Therefore, based on \nwhat I know today regarding John Roberts and my own independent \ninvestigation at the time I was privileged to introduce him, I can only \nopine as this process evolves that there will not be, in my judgment, a \nbody of fact that would give rise in any way to invoking the \nextraordinary circumstances provision of the Gang of 14's memorandum of \nunderstanding.\n  Again, I carefully couch that, reserving my respect, as we all do, \nfor the work to be done by the Judiciary Committee. But in the end, I \nrepeat, I do not think there will be any body of fact that will give \nrise to invoking the extraordinary circumstances clause.\n  I had the pleasure this morning to call quite a few friends all \nacross the Commonwealth of Virginia, on both sides of the spectrum, to \nlisten to their views about this nominee. I regard those conversations \nas private, certainly in terms of the names of the individuals. But I \nwas given the liberty to say two individuals, whom I have known for my \nentire 27 years plus--I will add 1 year, 28 years, 1 year campaigning \nfor the Senate when I knew them both--two of the most extraordinary and \nnationally and internationally known religious leaders shared with me \ntheir strong approval and appreciation to the President for the \nnomination of this distinguished gentleman.\n  Likewise, I talked with a number of friends on the other side of the \nspectrum, two of whom are acknowledged liberals whom I have known for \ndecades and whose opinions I value from time to time. These individuals \nwith whom I spoke this morning have known Judge Roberts, and they \nlikewise recognize the extraordinary credentials of this fine \nindividual, and I think in their own ways expressed strong support.\n  I mention that because I think it is important for all of us to reach \nout and seek the views of those who feel, as I do, that this nomination \nis one of the most important contemporary chapters of American history.\n  Also, this morning, in response to several press inquiries about the \nSenate, I have stated that I unequivocally believe that this \ninstitution will proceed with its responsibilities under the \nConstitution, under the advice and consent clause, in a manner that \nreflects credit on the Senate itself and in a manner that reflects \nfairness and dignity towards the nominee. I believe that the Senate \nwill proceed in the finest traditions of its over 200 years of \nexperience in terms of its duties of advice and consent, and I think \nour Nation, and indeed, much of the world, will concur when the process \nis finally complete.\n  I conclude by moving into that terrain that is always a bit \ndangerous--listening to good friends who have known John Roberts for \nmany years talk about him. I met with him briefly this morning. We \njoked together about this. He said: Now, I am a little apprehensive, \nJohn, about some of the persons with whom you talked. But in any event, \njust the warmest accolades were extended by old friends who mentioned \nthe fact that John Roberts had been very active in what we call pro \nbono cases.\n  When I was an assistant U.S. attorney in the District for years, I \nsaw the abuses of the system where those apprehended under the law for \nalleged criminal violations did not receive the quality of legal \nrepresentation to which they were entitled. I participated with a \nnumber of my friends in establishing at Georgetown University the \nPrettyman Institute, which trains young lawyers in how to deal with pro \nbono cases. I remember Judge Oliver Gasch, now the late Judge Gasch, \nwho was very active in working with me, as we worked with the \nGeorgetown University Law School and established that institute. It has \nbeen very successful.\n  I mention that because John Roberts has had quite a record, as has \nHogan & Hartson, in pro bono representation of those whose economic \ncircumstances are so much less fortunate than ours, but nevertheless \nare entitled to first-class representation, and this fine lawyer and \njurist has given that in years past.\n  In addition, in the firm of Hogan & Hartson, John Roberts was also \noften sought out by the young lawyers to counsel with them on how best \nto do his expertise, that is appellate court work. That is always \nmagnificent in a firm when there is an individual to whom the young \nlawyers can go, perhaps those outside of the firm too, and get advice.\n  Also, there is a small lunchroom in the firm now and there is a table \nthere. It is interesting, the table is dedicated to William Fulbright, \na distinguished Member of the Senate who later worked with Hogan & \nHartson. Around that table some great conversations occurred. Often, \nwhen John Roberts was at the table with his other partners and fellow \nlawyers in the firm, they recognized that he could be engaged in almost \nany subject and have a serious contribution. For example, he loves \nsports. Like so many of us, given the opportunity, when he gets up in \nthe morning, he kind of looks at the sports page before he goes to all \nof the news on the other pages. Certainly I do, and I think a lot of \nAmericans do that. He can give you statistics about the Redskins and \nthe baseball teams and others. It is extraordinary.\n  When I look at the entirety of this individual and look at the \nAmerican public--I am not talking just about the interest groups who \nwill take a role in this one way or another, as they should and are \nentitled to, but I am talking about those citizens who watch our \ngovernment perform its duties--I believe the American public will judge \nthis individual as the facts come out. For those who will follow it, it \nwill be quite an education with regard to not only the institution of \nthe Senate and its constitutional responsibilities of advice and \nconsent, but the law of the land and the very large number of issues \nthat face this Nation today, issues that may well come before the \nSupreme Court someday.\n  So there is an educational process for all of us to be had. But I \nthink in the final analysis, the American public will say to itself: \nThis man has the right stuff and will do the right thing for America \nand for us as individuals.\n  Mr. President, I have already placed in the Record my introduction of \nthen-lawyer Roberts, now Judge Roberts, at two previous hearings. I \nhave an extraordinary letter written by, I think, about 150 lawyers, \nmany of whom I know because so many of them I have had associations \nwith through the\n\n[[Page S8526]]\n\nyears. It is addressed to the leadership of the Judiciary Committee. It \nsays:\n\n       The undersigned are all members of the Bar of the District \n     of Columbia and we are writing in support of the nomination \n     of John G. Roberts, Jr., to serve as a federal court of \n     appeals judge. . . .\n\n  It is extraordinary. It is Democrats on one side, Republicans on the \nright, and a mixture in the center. I cannot recall in my years here \never seeing a document of such import as this in the context of a \njudicial nomination.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                                December 18, 2002.\n     Re Judicial nomination of John G. Roberts, Jr., to the United \n         States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia \n         Circuit\n\n     Hon. Tom Daschle,\n     Hon. Orrin Hatch,\n     Hon. Patrick Leahy,\n     Hon. Trent Lott,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Daschle, Hatch, Leahy, and Lott: The \n     undersigned are all members of the Bar of the District of \n     Columbia and are writing in support of the nomination of John \n     G. Roberts, Jr., to serve as a federal court of appeals judge \n     on the United States Court of Appeals for the District of \n     Columbia Circuit. Although, as individuals, we reflect a wide \n     spectrum of political party affiliation and ideology, we are \n     united in our belief that John Roberts will be an outstanding \n     federal court of appeals judge and should be confirmed by the \n     United States Senate. He is one of the very best and most \n     highly respected appellate lawyers in the nation, with a \n     deserved reputation as a brilliant writer and oral advocate. \n     He is also a wonderful professional colleague both because of \n     his enormous skills and because of his unquestioned integrity \n     and fair-mindedness. In short, John Roberts represents the \n     best of the bar and, we have no doubt, would be a superb \n     federal court of appeals judge.\n       Thank you.\n           Sincerely,\n         Donald B.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be laid aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1305\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk on behalf of \nmyself, Senator Nelson of Florida, and Senator Reed of Rhode Island.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n\n[[Page S8527]]\n\n\n       The Senator from Connecticut [Mr. Dodd], for himself, Mr. \n     Nelson of Florida, and Mr. Reed, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 1305.\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To Require the Secretary of State to Report to Congress on a \n         Plan for Holding Elections in Haiti in 2005 and 2006)\n\n       On page 259, at the end of the page add the following new \n     paragraph:\n       ``(c) Funds made available for assistance for Haiti shall \n     be made available to support elections in Haiti after the \n     Secretary of State submits a written report to the Committees \n     on Appropriations, the House International Relations \n     Committee and the Senate Foreign Relations Committee setting \n     forth a detailed plan, in consultation with the Haitian \n     Transitional Government and the United Nations Stabilization \n     Mission (MINUSTAH), which includes an integrated public \n     security strategy to strengthen the rule of law, ensure that \n     acceptable security conditions exist to permit an electoral \n     process with broad based participation by all the political \n     parties, and provide a timetable for the demobilization, \n     disarmament and reintegration of armed groups: Provided, That \n     following the receipt of such report, up to $3,000,000 of the \n     funds made available under subsection (a)(3) should be made \n     available for the demobilization, disarmament, and \n     reintegration of armed groups in Haiti.\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, let me inform my colleagues that this \namendment is acceptable to the managers of the underlying bill, Senator \nMcConnell and Senator Leahy. I thank them for their work on behalf of \nthis particular effort.\n  At the conclusion of my remarks, I will not ask that the amendment be \nadopted at this juncture. Senator McConnell and Senator Leahy prefer \nthat occur at a later time. I wish to take the opportunity to address \nthe amendment and the rationale for it.\n  I again thank my colleagues, the chairman and ranking member, for \naccepting the amendment to the Foreign Operations bill.\n  The amendment I am offering on behalf of myself, Senator Nelson of \nFlorida, and Senator Reed, relates to the situation in the Republic of \nHaiti. The island nation shares the island of Hispaniola with the \nDominican Republic in the Caribbean. The situation there cries out, as \nany other place in the world, to this body. I have spoken about my \nconcerns with respect to the ongoing crisis in Haiti many times on this \nfloor, as have some of my colleagues.\n  I commend particularly Senator DeWine of Ohio who has not only spoken \nabout this issue on numerous occasions but, as a result of the efforts \nhe and his family have made, has a very direct involvement in trying to \nimprove the lives of the people in Haiti and has visited the country \nmany times. Those concerns, unfortunately, no matter how often \nexpressed by myself, Senator DeWine, and others, have fallen on deaf \nears, unfortunately, in the Bush administration. Apparently, no one in \nthe current administration has made Haiti a priority, and it shows.\n  I support providing assistance to Haiti, but I do not believe in \nthrowing good money after bad in that situation. Frankly, moneys in \nthis appropriations bill in support of the current election schedule in \nHaiti are moneys that, in my view, will be totally wasted unless and \nuntil the Bush administration gets serious about addressing the \nfoundations of that insecurity--the absence of the rule of law and the \npresence of armed groups who today terrorize Haiti's cities and towns.\n  That is why I offer this amendment today to insist that prior to one \npenny of this money being spent on the election process in Haiti that \nwe in Congress be informed about the administration's game plan for \nHaiti, if it has one; and if one does not exist, that they develop such \na plan so that the U.S. taxpayers' dollars are not wasted on elections \nthat would be deemed illegitimate at best.\n  I don't think that elections are the be-all and end-all for solving \nHaiti's problems. Frankly, I am increasingly of the view that more \ninternational involvement is needed in Haiti over an extended period of \ntime before any Haitian government has a chance of successfully \ngoverning a country which at this juncture is virtually ungovernable. \nIncreased international involvement is unthinkable without U.S. \nleadership.\n\n  The political, economic, and social chaos that exists in Haiti today \nhas created one of the most serious humanitarian crises confronting the \ninternational community. More than a year after the ouster of former \nPresident Aristide, most Haitians today have abysmal living conditions \nand they are getting worse by the day.\n  According to U.S. officials in Haiti, most Haitians, most of the 8 \nmillion people on the one-third of that island of Hispaniola, live on a \ndollar or less a day. More than 40 percent of the children are \nmalnourished, and childbirth is the second leading cause of death among \nwomen.\n  Haiti's AIDS infection rate is the highest outside of sub-Saharan \nAfrica, and an estimated 4,000 to 6,000 Haitian children are born with \nthe virus each year. The average Haitian has a life expectancy of 51 \nyears. That is 20 years short of the Latin American/Caribbean average \nof 71 years.\n  Haiti's economy is also in a total shambles. Gross domestic product \nhas been negative in that country for two decades running. Profits from \ntraditional exports of coffee, rice, rum, and other agricultural \nproducts of the formal economy are less than half of what they were 20 \nyears ago. Now, remittances from Haitians living abroad are one of the \nmain sources of income. In fact, these remittances account for almost \none-third of Haiti's gross domestic product.\n  What has been the Bush administration's response to the Haitian \ncrisis? Frankly, the administration has been AWOL on Haiti. While they \nwere quick to seize the opportunity to facilitate the removal of the \ndemocratically elected President from office, since then there has been \na decided disinterest on the part of the administration with respect to \nthe fate of the Haitian people.\n  Last July, the United States pledged approximately $230 million in \naid for fiscal year 2004-2005. This past April, the Senate passed the \nDeWine-Bingaman amendment, of which I was a cosponsor, providing $20 \nmillion for election assistance, employment, and public works. But all \nof the assistance in the world is not going to solve Haiti's problems \nuntil we begin to address the levels of insecurity that exist in that \ncountry.\n  Haiti borders on being a completely failed state if it is not one \nalready. Yet, this administration continues to suggest that elections \nshould go forward later this year so the Haitian people can replace the \ninterim government. Last month, Assistant Secretary of State Roger \nNoriega and special envoys from France, Canada, and Brazil visited \nPort-au-Prince and said that Haiti's political transition was on \ntarget. They said the date for the Presidential and legislative \nelections, November 13, should remain fixed. I wonder how anyone could \nvisit Haiti and come to that conclusion.\n  Last December, Senator DeWine and I were told we could not visit \nPort-au-Prince because the security situation was far too dangerous. In \nlate May of this year, the State Department issued the following travel \nwarning on Haiti:\n\n       Due to the volatile security situation, the Department has \n     ordered the departure of nonemergency personnel and all \n     family members of U.S. Embassy personnel. The Department of \n     State warns U.S. citizens to defer travel to Haiti and urges \n     American citizens to depart the country if they can do so \n     safely.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that the entire travel warning issued by the \nDepartment of State be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                             Travel Warning\n\n   (Department of State, Bureau of Consular Affairs, Washington, DC)\n\n       May 26, 2005.--This Travel Warning is being issued to warn \n     American citizens of the continued dangers of travel to \n     Haiti. Due to the volatile security situation, the Department \n     has ordered the departure of non-emergency personnel and all \n     family members of U.S. Embassy personnel. The Department of \n     State warns U.S. citizens to defer travel to Haiti and urges \n     American citizens to depart the country if they can do so \n     safely. This Travel Warning supersedes the Travel Warning \n     issued March 11, 2005.\n       Americans are reminded of the potential for spontaneous \n     demonstrations and violent confrontations between armed \n     groups. Visitors and residents must remain vigilant due to \n     the absence of an effective force in much of Haiti; the \n     potential for looting; the presence of intermittent \n     roadblocks set by\n\n[[Page S8528]]\n\n     armed gangs or by the police; and the possibility of random \n     violent crime, including kidnapping, carjacking, and assault. \n     Due to concerns for the safety of its personnel, the \n     Department has ordered the departure from Haiti of all U.S. \n     Embassy non-emergency employees and all family members of \n     American embassy personnel. American citizens who remain in \n     Haiti despite this warning are urged to consider departing.\n       Travel can be hazardous within Port-au-Prince. Some areas \n     are off-limits to embassy staff, including downtown Port-au-\n     Prince after dark. The embassy has imposed a curfew from 9:00 \n     p.m. to 5:00 a.m., which could change periodically. Staff \n     members must remain in their homes or in U.S. government \n     facilities during the hours covered by the curfew. The \n     embassy has limited travel by its staff outside of Port-au-\n     Prince and the ability to provide emergency services to U.S. \n     citizens outside of Port-au-Prince remains extremely limited. \n     U.S. businesses continue to operate in Haiti, but take \n     special precautions to protect their facilities and \n     personnel. The U.N. stabilization force (MINUSTAH) is fully \n     deployed and is assisting the government of Haiti in \n     providing security. They have challenged violent gangs and \n     have moved into some gang enclaves.\n       U.S. citizens who travel to or remain in Haiti despite this \n     Travel Warning must remain vigilant with regard to their \n     personal security and are strongly advised to\n     register either online at https://\ntravelregistration.state.gov/ibrs/ or contact the Consular \n     Section of the U.S. Embassy in Port-au-Prince and enroll in \n     the warden system (emergency alert network) to obtain updated \n     information on travel and security in Haiti. The Consular \n     Section of the U.S. Embassy can be reached at (509) 223-7011, \n     the fax number is (509) 223-9665 and the e-mail address is \n     acspap@state.gov. Travelers should also consult the \n     Department of State's latest Consular Information Sheet for \n     Haiti and Worldwide Caution Public Announcement at http://\ntravel.state.gov. American citizens may also obtain up-to-\n     date information on security conditions by calling 1-888-407-\n     4747 toll free in the United States or Canada or 1-202-501-\n     4444 from overseas. In Haiti citizens can call 509/222-0200, \n     ext. 2000.\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, that travel warning remains in effect today. \nYet, the administration would have us believe that things are on track \nfor holding elections as currently scheduled. Unless there is dramatic \naction, the likelihood of fair elections in Haiti with widespread voter \nparticipation in the near future is remote, at best, and I would argue \nvirtually impossible.\n  Currently, fewer than 100,000 of the 4 million potential voters have \nbeen registered and fewer than a quarter of the necessary registration \ncenters are even open at all. As important, the role of all parties in \nthe elections needs to be protected.\n  All parties must have a fair and equal chance if these elections are \nto be legitimate. Ultimately, what should matter most to the United \nStates is that institutionally these elections are legitimate and fair. \nWhoever wins must make reforms, purge corrupt officials, and work to \nimprove security.\n  In my view, United States engagement on the security situation is \njust the first step in what will be a very long, uphill battle if we \nare going to get the situation right in Haiti. Holding elections for \nthe sake of holding elections on some rigid schedule makes no sense at \nall. Elections, particularly elections with little or no credibility, \nare not going to solve Haiti's problems. It is simply going to compound \nthem.\n  Haiti is in a humanitarian crisis. For that reason alone, the United \nStates should be far more engaged than we are. Frankly, after sending \ntroops to Haiti 4 times in the past 90 years, it is also in our \neconomic interest to address the problem resolutely. We should start by \nreviving Senator DeWine's HERO Act, as it is called, which would help \nreinvigorate the Haitian economy by granting preferential trade \nagreements to certain Haitian textile products.\n  A year ago, the Senate passed the HERO bill, offered by Senator \nDeWine, unanimously in this body. There was not a single vote in \nopposition to Senator DeWine's proposal. The other body, the House of \nRepresentatives, unfortunately would not even consider the legislation. \nIf the HERO Act were passed, as it should be, it could help to \nstrengthen Haiti's economy and jump-start real employment in that \nlittle island nation. Especially now that the Senate has passed and the \nHouse will soon act on the Dominican Republic-Central American Free \nTrade Agreement, this is doubly important. After all, it simply does \nnot make any sense to help the Dominican Republic on two-thirds of the \nisland and leave Haiti a completely failed state on the other one-third \nof that island.\n  As it stands now, the options for honest employment are slim to none \nin the Haitian city centers, particularly the slums of the capital, \nPort-au-Prince. The major employers in that country are warring gangs, \nmany of them involved in trafficking cocaine.\n  Indeed, Haiti today is the major transit point for cocaine coming in \nfrom South American countries such as Colombia. From the year 2000 to \n2004, approximately 8 percent of all the cocaine coming to the United \nStates passed through Haiti. Entire neighborhoods of that country are \nunder the control of these criminal gangs which are responsible for \nkillings, robberies and, increasingly, kidnappings. Authorities in the \ninterim government estimate that each day there are 6 to 12 kidnappings \nin Port-au-Prince alone.\n  In total, more than 700 people, including 7 peacekeepers for the \nUnited Nations, have been killed in Haiti in the last 8 months. The \nU.N. forces have tried to respond to the security threats, but frankly \nthe U.N. force is not in a position to quell the violence in Haiti's \nmajor cities or to secure many of Haiti's major roads, both of which \nare now under the control of these criminal gangs.\n  For one, they are trying to protect a population roughly equal to \nthat of New York City, roughly 8 million people. New York City has \n40,000 well-trained and equipped police officers. Haiti has a tiny \nfraction of that number of U.N. peacekeepers. I would hope the recent \nU.N. Security Council authorization for an additional 1,000 troops and \npolice will help the U.N. force wrest control from these criminals, but \nI doubt it.\n  Secondly, and perhaps even more important than sheer numbers, the \nUnited Nations mandate does not give the U.N. forces real authority \nover the Haitian national police, a force that is in severe disarray.\n  The national police are good people in many cases, but there are many \nbad ones indeed who need to be removed. If the U.N. force wants the \ntrust of civilians, they need to make sure the Haitian national police \ndo not ignore human rights or violations in the face of high \ninsecurity, which only fuels the cycle of violence.\n  Simply put, the credibility of the U.N. force is directly tied to its \nability to bring some calm and to prevent abuses. To that end, \ncivilians should be able to contact U.N. forces directly about the \nabuses by the national police. That does not happen.\n  I am also troubled by the interim government, led by President \nBoniface Alexandre and Prime Minister Gerard Latortue. They have \ndelayed justice for thousands of prisoners. Roughly 20 of the more than \n7,000 prisoners at the federal penitentiary have been convicted of \ncrimes. Many of them have spent years awaiting trial.\n  I am particularly concerned about the treatment of former Prime \nMinister Yvon Neptune who has been held without formal charges for over \na year and is near death after a series of off-and-on hunger strikes \nwhich he began in February. Now in the sixth month of his protest, I am \ntold his rib cage is sticking out of his skin and he is maybe near \ndeath.\n  On May 25, Prime Minister Neptune was carried to his first hearing on \na stretcher where he testified for several hours. He denied the \naccusations that he masterminded the killings of 25 Haitians in the \ntown of St. Marc and has refused to leave Haiti, despite that offer, \nuntil his name is cleared.\n  The basic point is when it comes to legal issues, it is imperative \nthat the interim government set the tone that the rule of law matters. \nIf they do not set the example at the top, lawlessness will not improve \nat the bottom. The amendment I am offering is meant to serve as a small \nwake-up call to the administration and to the Congress that we are \nwatching what is happening. It is meant to send the message that Haiti \nis only going to have a future if we are prepared to extend a helping \nhand. What we need now is resolve and a serious commitment from the \nhighest levels of our Government to bring peace, security, and \nstability to the people of this small island nation.\n  We have lost interest before. The result is clear. We cannot afford \nto do it again. The United States should help the Haitian people create \nan honest government committed to justice, committed to combating \npoverty, committed to democracy, and to a better\n\n[[Page S8529]]\n\nHaiti. I hope the Bush administration will make that commitment. I hope \nforcing them to take a serious look at conditions on the ground and \nresponding accordingly will produce results.\n\n  Again, one does not need to have a Ph.D. in political science to know \nwhat the net effect will be if we do not get more serious about Haiti. \nHaitians will do what they have done, as other peoples have done in \nother nations who have been confronted by similar fact situations. \nHaiti is only a few miles off our coast, roughly about 110, 120 miles. \nHaitians will do what they have done historically. They will leave in \ndroves and they will seek safe refuge wherever they can achieve it. \nObviously we do not want that situation to occur again.\n  So the modest proposal to try and inject some sanity into our policy \nwe hope will stem that tide. I think even more serious measures need to \nbe taken by the international community such as a protectorate of some \nkind to create some stability there over the coming 10 or 15 years to \ngive any hope to the Haitian people to regain control of their own \nsociety.\n  Words that I can't even conjure up cannot describe the situation in \nthis country. It is getting worse by the hour. Every day we delay, \nevery time we refuse to do what needs to be done, we contribute in our \nown way to neglect, to a deteriorating situation in that country.\n  I again want to thank my colleagues Senator McConnell, Senator Leahy, \nSenator Nelson of Florida, and Senator Reed, for their support of this \namendment. Again, it is not going to solve all the problems, but it may \nserve to get some attention.\n  I understand the focus on Iraq and the focus on Afghanistan. We \ncannot neglect the Caribbean. We cannot neglect Haiti. This amendment \nis designed to try and reawaken some attention to this problem.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sununu). The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I commend Senator Dodd for his leadership on \nthis issue, not just today but for many days, along with Senator DeWine \nand others, and to say how precisely, accurately, and eloquently he has \ncharacterized the terrible situation in Haiti. It is one that requires \na plan, requires purpose, and requires commitment by the United States. \nI hope we can carry this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1301\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be set aside and I call up amendment No. 1301.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Delaware [Mr. Biden], for himself and Mr. \n     Lugar, proposes an amendment numbered 1301.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To provide support to the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban \n        Treaty Preparatory Commission and to provide an offset)\n\n       On page 169, line 4, strike ``$3,036,375,000'' and insert \n     ``$3,031,375,000''.\n       On page 190, line 5, strike ``$440,100,000'' and insert \n     ``$445,100,000''.\n       On page 190, line 19, insert ``that should be not less than \n     $19,350,000'' after ``Commission''.\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I know we are about to vote at 2:30 on two \namendments. I wanted this to be the pending business. I will lay this \naside until after the successive votes we are about to have. I thank \nthe Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Leahy \nof Vermont and Senator Biden be added as cosponsors to my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Louisiana.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 1245, as Modified\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, under the previous order, we are now \nabout ready to have the vote on the Landrieu amendment. I ask unanimous \nconsent for 2 minutes to close.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, 2 minutes will be allocated \nto each side prior to the vote in relation to the Landrieu amendment.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I offered this amendment on behalf of \nmyself, Senator Clinton, Senator DeWine, Senator Inhofe, and Senator \nCraig. It is an amendment we feel very strongly about and are proud to \noffer to the Senate this afternoon to clarify a very important \nprinciple as we give out billions of dollars in aid to other countries. \nThat principal is very simple and straightforward: Families matter; \nfamilies should be respected; children belong in families.\n  As we give out billions of dollars that would hopefully reflect our \nvalues, as the Senator from Tennessee, the majority leader said, that \nwould reflect and advance our values, this amendment becomes very clear \nand very important, and I hope it will receive an overwhelming vote.\n  To clear up some misperceptions that are out there about this issue, \nagain the Landrieu amendment is not a sense-of-the-Senate amendment. It \nis a directive. It is a directive to USAID to say that as you are \ngiving out this money, keep in mind that children belong in families. \nTry to allocate money in a way that keeps them with the families to \nwhich they were born, their families of origin. But if they become \norphaned, let's work as hard as possible to reconnect those children to \nother families, preferably to relatives through domestic adoption, \nlong-term permanency, long-term care; not long-term foster care, but \nthrough the permanency of a real new family. If that family is not \navailable in that country, then to look within the human family to \nplace those children, keeping sibling groups together as much as \npossible.\n  That is our policy in the United States. It is what our law is. It is \na value that Americans hold dear. That is what this amendment does, and \nI offer it in a bipartisan spirit of cooperation.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?

Obviously, Senator Chambliss will \nspeak in support of his amendment.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, my amendment is very straightforward. \nIt simply says that none of the funds made available under this act may \nbe used to provide assistance to any country whose government has \nnotified the Department of State of its refusal to extradict to the \nUnited States an individual who is charged with a crime in the United \nStates of America, where the penalty is life in prison without parole \nor less.\n  A young man from Georgia was killed on the streets of Washington,\n\n[[Page S8530]]\n\nDC, in 2002. He was a young Marine Corps officer. He was a member of \nthe White House guard. A Nicaraguan, after he was charged with the \noffense, went back to Nicaragua. The Nicaraguan Government now refuses \nto extradict this individual to the United States to be charged with \nthis crime he committed while he was here.\n  What we are doing today is taking tax funds from the mother and the \nfather of this young man who was killed and sending them to Nicaragua. \nThat is wrong.\n  This amendment will not allow that to happen. It is a great \namendment. I urge agreement of the amendment.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I certainly want to extradict or bring back \nto America people who have committed crimes here. But I understand and \nI agree with the Bush administration, which is strongly opposed to this \namendment. The administration letter says, in part, for example, \nIsrael, in some cases, has refused to extradict its nationals. Jordan, \nwith whom we have a treaty, has a court ruling that the treaty is not \nin force. The amendment does not take into account that the Government \ndoes not have treaties in Africa, Asia, the Middle East, the former \nSoviet Union, and elsewhere.\n  Under this amendment, for example, a few years ago when a young man \ncommitted a heinous murder in Maryland--he had dual citizenship with \nIsrael and fled to Israel--Israel would not send him back; in that \ncase, we would have had to cut off all aid to Israel.\n  That may be what Senators want to do. I point that out. That is why \nthe administration so strongly opposes the amendment.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be laid aside and that my amendment be called up.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I know we have agreement to accept this \namendment, so I will not speak for very long. I know people want to \nvote on final passage.\n  Two quick points: This amendment does not block or change in any way \nthe CNOOC-Unocal merger. It simply says, after any merger where a \ncorporation that is owned by a foreign government seeks to buy an \nAmerican company, that our Government, particularly MFTEC in the \nTreasury Department, issue a report that shows whether that country is \ntreating our companies reciprocally and fairly. In other words, would \nan American company that wished to buy a Chinese company in a similar \nposition be allowed to do so? I would argue that the Chinese do not. If \nyou believe in free trade, it has to be a two-way street.\n  This amendment at least gives us a report and some knowledge of that \ncondition. That is all I am asking.\n  With that, I yield the floor to the Senator from Kentucky.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. REED addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n\n\n               Liability Protections To The Gun Industry\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I note the majority leader indicated we will \nmove to the Defense authorization bill. I think that is an appropriate \nlegislative initiative to take up. We are in war. We have troops who \nare being threatened every day. We have the need to move to this bill. \nWe concluded the committee deliberations weeks ago, and we are ready to \nmove to the bill.\n  But I am concerned because there has been a suggestion that in the \nmiddle of that process, we might take up a bill to grant liability \nprotections to the gun industry. Stopping the Defense authorization \nbill to take up a special interest bill would be inappropriate. Moving \nfrom the national interest to a very special interest is the wrong \nthing to do.\n  If we do proceed to a bill to give liability protection to the gun \nindustry, it would require full and intensive debate within the \nconfines of the rules of the Senate. I would hope that we could offer \namendments, which we didn't last time, because there are important \nissues that touch upon the issue of guns in this society that should be \ndebated also. I would hope, once we get on to the Defense authorization \nbill, we would be able to pursue that until we conclude it. We owe it \nto the troops in the field who are defending us today. We owe them much \nmore than the special interest lobbies in this country.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1304\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority whip.\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

(a) Subsection (o) of section 3001 of the \n     Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act for Defense and for \n     the Reconstruction of Iraq and Afghanistan, 2004 (Public Law \n     108-106; 117 Stat. 1234; 5 U.S.C.

Con. Res. 95 (109th \n     Congress).\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I am happy to join with my colleague, \nSenator Feingold, in offering an amendment extending the mandate of the \nSpecial Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction, SIGIR. The Special \nInspector General serves as a watchdog over the billions of U.S. \ntaxpayer dollars allocated for Iraq reconstruction. It has been \neffective in its role, uncovering and exposing a wide range of problems \nwith the use of taxpayer funds in Iraq. For example, in reports \nreleased on May 4, the SIGIR documented instances of files that could \nnot be located by contract managers, contract funds that no one could \naccount for, and failures by U.S. officials to live up to commitments \nmade to Iraqi authorities regarding the management of funds slated to \nrebuild Iraq. The SIGIR also found indications of potential criminal \nactivity in the case of the South-Central Iraq audit, where managers \ncould not account for what happened to $96.6 million of $119.9 million \nthat was disbursed in South-Central Iraq.\n  The SIGIR's tenure is currently 10 months after 80 percent of Iraqi \nrelief and reconstruction funds are obligated, rather than expended. As \na result, his term could expire well before all of the work that has \nbeen contracted has been performed and payments have been made. Current \nestimates are that Iraq reconstruction fund obligations could meet the \n80 percent threshold very soon. The Feingold-Collins amendment would \nextend the SIGIR's tenure by changing the termination date to 10 months \nafter 80 percent of the funds are expended.\n  As chairman of the Senate Homeland Security Committee and \nGovernmental Affairs Committee, which oversees government contracting, \nI meet with and receive briefings regularly from the Inspector General \non the office's ongoing work and findings. He conducts needed, on-the-\nground oversight of contracts in Iraq. His audit and investigative work \nprovides much needed transparency of these operations and demonstrates \nto the new Iraqi government the importance of openness and oversight to \na democratic society.\n  Despite its effectiveness, the SIGIR office is set to begin closing \ndown before the majority of reconstruction funds for Iraq have even \nbeen expended. We need to extend the mandate of this office to help \nmake sure that American tax dollars are being used effectively and \nefficiently, and to help our reconstruction effort succeed.\n  Without the SIGIR's experienced oversight, I fear that we may \nencounter an increase in fraud, waste, and abuse in the management and \nadministration of Iraq reconstruction contracts.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, this amendment has been agreed to on \nboth sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment? If \nnot, without objection, the amendment, as modified, is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 1255), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. LEAHY.

The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Kentucky [Mr. McConnell], for Mr. Biden, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 1252, as modified.\n\n  The amendment, as modified, is as follows:\n\n       On page 326, between lines 10 and 11, insert the following:\n\n\n     REPORT ON ASSISTANCE TO VICTIMS OF CRIMES IN FOREIGN COUNTRIES\n\n       Sec. 6113. (a) Not later than 90 days after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Secretary of State shall submit to \n     the appropriate congressional committees a report on the \n     services provided to United States citizens who are victims \n     of violent crime while outside the United States. The report \n     shall include--\n       (1) the total number of United States citizens who reported \n     to a United States embassy or consulate that such citizen was \n     a victim of violent crime during fiscal year 2005;\n       (2) a summary of the funding available during fiscal year \n     2006 through the Department of State to assist United States \n     citizens who are victims of violent crime while outside the \n     United States;\n       (3) the expenditures made during fiscal year 2005 by the \n     United States to assist such United States citizens;\n       (4) a proposal for providing services to such United States \n     citizens who have no other source of funds to obtain such \n     services, including any necessary organizational changes \n     needed to provide such services; and\n       (5) proposals for funding and administering emergency \n     assistance to such United States citizens who have no other \n     source of funds.\n       (b) In this section:\n       (1) The term ``appropriate congressional committees'' means \n     the Committee on Appropriations and the Committee on Foreign \n     Relations of the Senate and the Committees on Appropriations \n     and the Committee on International Relations of the House of \n     Representatives.\n       (2) The term ``violent crime'' means murder, non-negligent \n     manslaughter, forcible rape, robbery, or aggravated assault.\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, an important part of U.S. nuclear \nnonproliferation policy is the continuing effort to deter other \ncountries from testing a nuclear weapon. It is often said that a \ncountry could build a relatively simple nuclear weapon, like the bomb \nexploded at Hiroshima, and use it with confidence even though it has \nnot tested the device. That does not hold true, however, for more \ncomplex designs; and military commanders are loath to rely upon any \nweapon that has not been tested.\n  One major way to deter countries from conducting nuclear weapons \ntests is to ensure that such a test would be detected. That's because \nmost countries, as signers of the Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban \nTreaty, the CTBT, are bound to refrain from acts that would undermine \nthe object and purpose of that treaty, even though it has yet to enter \ninto force. In addition, nearly all nuclear weapons states, including \nsome that are not parties to the CTBT, have proclaimed unilateral \nmoratoria on nuclear weapons tests.\n\n[[Page S8532]]\n\nThus, there are both legal and political barriers to openly testing \nnuclear weapons.\n  How can we make it more likely that a covert nuclear weapons test \nwould be detected and identified? One way is through U.S. and allied \ndata collection, including the fine seismic network put together by the \nAir Force Technical Applications Center, or AFTAC. I support and \napplaud the work of AFTAC, which is truly a center of excellence. But \nAFTAC cannot and does not do everything; not every country will \ncooperate with the United States in the nuclear detection mission; and \nwhen we use AFTAC, we pay the full bill.\n  AFTAC's work is supplemented importantly by the International \nMonitoring System, or IMS, that is being set up by the Preparatory \nCommission for the CTBT Organization, the CTBTO PrepCom. The worldwide \nseismic network of the IMS will include sites in Russia, China, Iran \nand elsewhere that cannot be duplicated through U.S. or bilateral \narrangements. It will also combine long-distance, low-frequency, or \nteleseismic, coverage with high-frequency, regional seismic data that \nmany experts believe will do a better job of detecting a ``decoupled'' \nexplosion that uses an existing cavity to resist detection.\n  The IMS will marshal four different types of data--not only seismic, \nbut also hydroacoustic, infrasound, and airborne radionuclide \nemissions--collected at 321 sites, mostly seismic arrays. The use of \nmultiple methodologies will make it more difficult for a country to \nevade detection, as it gets very difficult to design a test that avoids \ndetection by all four means. And the rest of the world is paying more \nthan three quarters of the cost of this robust monitoring system.\n  Finally, while national technical means may include very sensitive \nintelligence information, the IMS will provide data that can be used \nopenly for diplomatic or enforcement purposes. That will greatly ease \nthe pressure on U.S. intelligence to expose sensitive sources or \nmethods in order to further U.S. foreign policy objectives.\n  The administration rightly supports the IMS and has funded the U.S. \nshare of IMS expenses for several years. Secretary of State Rice \nconfirmed the administration's support for this program earlier this \nyear, in response to a question for the record that I asked after she \ntestified on the foreign affairs budget.\n  In addition, the Under Secretary of State for Arms Control and \nInternational Security, Mr. Joseph, has assured the Foreign Relations \nCommittee that funding the IMS is fully consistent with the \nadministration's position on the CTBT, which it has said that the \nUnited States will not join, even though it is a signatory to the \ntreaty. While I wish that the administration were of a different mind \non the CTBT itself, I think they are absolutely correct in their view \nthat the IMS serves our national security interests even if this \ncountry never ratifies the CTBT.\n  Unfortunately, the Office of Management and Budget imposed a severe \ncut on this budget item, reducing the State Department's request from \n$22,000,000 to $14,350,000. The Secretary of State assured the Foreign \nRelations Committee that the State Department is committed to finding \nthe extra funds, even if they have to be obtained in the fiscal year \n2007 budget. That's no way to run a railroad, however, and it could be \ndifficult to get over $30 million next year to make up for the \nshortfall. It would be far better to find some of that extra money now \nand not put the United States so far in arrears.\n  I propose, therefore, that an extra $5 million be made available for \nthe U.S. contribution to the CTBTO PrepCom. I am joined in this \namendment by the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, my good \nfriend Senator Lugar of Indiana, which I very much appreciate. The \nadditional funds will make it much more likely that the United States \nwill find the money to pay its full assessment for IMS and will help \nkeep the world from becoming a much more dangerous place.\n  Staff to Senators McConnell and Leahy have kindly worked with us on \nthis amendment and identified the budget for economic support funds as \nan area in which a $5 million cut could be absorbed with less harm to \nour national security than we would risk by failing to fund the IMS in \na timely manner. I understand that the managers of this bill are \nprepared to accept our amendment and can cover the difference in first-\nyear outlays that will result. I am most grateful for their \ncooperation.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record the following question \nand answer.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n Questions for the Record Submitted to Secretary of State Condoleezza \nRice by Senator Joseph Biden (No. 12), Committee on Foreign Relations, \n                           February 16, 2005.\n\n       Question: Why is the Administration proposing a cut in the \n     U.S. contribution to the International Monitoring System \n     being established by the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty \n     Organization Preparatory Commission?\n       Answer: The $7.65 million cut in funding for the \n     International Monitoring System (IMS) does not signal a \n     change in U.S. policy toward the Comprehensive Nuclear Test \n     Ban Treaty (CTBT). The U.S. continues to support and \n     participate in those activities of the Preparatory Commission \n     for the CTBT Organization (CTBTO PrepCom) in Vienna that \n     pertain to the IMS, and the U.S. has no plans to press the \n     PrepCom to lower its budget to a level commensurate with the \n     $14.35 million that the Administration has allocated for it \n     in FY06.\n       Unfortunately, budgets are very tight and cuts had to be \n     made, even among programs supported by the Administration. A \n     number of other cuts were made in the Department's program \n     requests, including in the areas of non-proliferation and \n     counter-terrorism. The level of funding for a program in any \n     given year's budget does not necessarily have a bearing on \n     the funding level for that program in the succeeding years.\n       It is important to note that the U.S. continues to observe \n     a nuclear testing moratorium and encourages other states not \n     to test. While the U.S. does not support the CTBT and will \n     not become a party to it, the U.S. has gone to great expense \n     to develop a Stockpile Stewardship Program to help ensure the \n     safety and reliability of our nuclear weapons stockpile \n     without testing.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate? If not, without \nobjection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 1252), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n               Amendments Nos. 1306 through 1308, En Bloc\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I send to the desk a managers' package \non behalf of Senator Byrd, regarding the United States-China Economic \nand Security Review Commission; on behalf of Senators Leahy, Chafee, \nMikulski, and Corzine regarding women's health; and Senator Frist \nregarding the use of funds for nonproliferation purposes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Kentucky [Mr. McConnell] proposes \n     amendments numbered 1306 through 1308 en bloc.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendments? If \nnot, without objection, the amendments are agreed to.\n  The amendments were agreed to, as follows:\n\n\n                           amendment no. 1306\n\n(Purpose: To modify the responsibilities and authorities applicable to \n    the United States-China Economic and Security Review Commission)\n\n       On page 326, between lines 10 and 11, insert the following:\n\n\n RESPONSIBILITIES AND AUTHORITIES OF UNITED STATES-CHINA ECONOMIC AND \n                       SECURITY REVIEW COMMISSION\n\n       Sec.   .

I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                                Romania\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, my colleague from New Hampshire, \nCongressman Jeb Bradley, successfully offered an amendment in the House \nof Representatives to this year's Foreign Operations appropriations \nbill as part of an effort to encourage the Romanian Government to act \non an extremely important issue. I had originally intended to offer the \nsame amendment here in the Senate, however, the Senator from Kentucky, \nthe chairman of the subcommittee, has graciously offered to work with \nme on the issue.\n  While the amendment would have specifically limited assistance to \nRomania provided under the Assistance for Eastern Europe and the Baltic \nStates, SEED, account, the real problem we are trying to address is the \nplight of over 100 American families and almost 200 Romanian orphans \nthese families have agreed to adopt. Despite the fact that the \nadoptions have been approved by Romania, these young orphans and their \nnew American families have been waiting in limbo--for years in some \ninstances.\n  After approving these adoptions, Romania changed its adoption laws in \norder to comply with the European Union's legal standards as a \ncondition of admittance into the European Union. However, since \nchanging their law, Romanian officials have yet to clarify the status \nof these adoptions or act in any manner to fulfill the commitments that \nwere made to these caring and compassionate Americans--or to fulfill \nthe hopes of their own orphans.\n  This past March, Romanian President Basescu indicated to Members of \nCongress, representatives from the State Department, and several of the \naffected families that as soon as the European Union voted to admit \nRomania, his government would then move expeditiously to resolve the \npreviously approved adoption cases. While the European Union voted to \nadmit Romania in April, Mr. Basescu's pledge has yet to be honored by \nhis government.\n  Romania became a good ally of the United States almost immediately \nafter the breakup of the Soviet Union and indeed played a pivotal role \nleading to the breakup. It is out of respect for the generally good \nrelations between our countries--and with the hope that Romania will \nreciprocate in equal good faith--that I have decided not to offer the \namendment in the Senate as I originally planned to do. Instead, I will \nwork during the conference on the bill to come up with a solution to \nthis issue which is in the best interests not only of our two \ncountries, but those of the families and orphans who have unnecessarily \nbeen kept apart too long as well.\n  I hope that the Romanian Government will seize this opportunity \nafforded to them and take appropriate and expeditious action--\nposthaste--to allow these children to join their new families here in \nAmerica.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I appreciate the comments made by the senior Senator \nfrom New Hampshire and I strongly encourage the Romanian Government--\nand the State Department--to address this important issue \nexpeditiously. The committee recommends $20 million for assistance for \nRomania under the SEED account, which is equivalent to the budget \nrequest. It is my hope and expectation that this matter be successfully \nresolved prior to the conferencing of this bill.\n\n\n                    Afghan Medical Relief Foundation\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I would like to bring to your \nattention the important work of the Afghan Medical Relief Foundation, \nAMRF, which was formed in 2004 to promote the prevention, awareness, \ntraining, and treatment of life-threatening diseases. They are focused \nin particular on diabetes, delivering insulin and providing treatment \nfor 15,000 to 20,000 diabetic children, young people, and adults in \nAfghanistan. This organization opened four new centers in Kabul in \nApril and May 2005. Nearly 2,000 new diabetic patients a month are \nvisiting the centers.\n  Mrs. DOLE. Mr. President, I thank my colleague Senator Lautenberg for \nbringing this project to the attention of the chairman and ranking \nmember of the Foreign Operations Appropriations Subcommittee. \nApproximately 900,000 Afghans suffer from diabetes and the subsequent \ncomplications that forever change an individual's life. Through the \ngood work of the AMRF, the Ministry of Public Health has improved the \nquality of life for thousands of Afghanis by making diabetes education, \nprevention, and treatment a national priority.\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, I also thank my colleagues for bringing the\n\n[[Page S8534]]\n\nimportant work of the Afghan Medical Relief Foundation to the attention \nof the chairman. The AMRF has successfully trained 16 health care \nprofessionals to diagnose and treat diabetes, developed a uniform \npatient management model, and increased knowledge of diabetes among the \ndiabetic and general population.\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues for \nbringing this project to the attention of the chairman and ranking \nmember as well. AMRF has worked closely with the Afghan Minister of \nHealth and has made sure that diabetes is included in the basic \nnational health care package in Afghanistan. As the people of \nAfghanistan continue the hard work of building a strong democracy, it \nis important they have access to essential resources, such as medicines \nand care, which are vital in creating a peaceful and secure society.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from the State of New \nJersey, the Senators from the State of North Carolina, and the Senator \nfrom Nebraska. This program sounds important. Unfortunately, the \nsubcommittee does not earmark funds for specific organizations.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, It is unfortunate that the \nsubcommittee is not able to support the work of the Afghan Medical \nRelief Foundation, but it is understandable why the subcommittee cannot \ndo so.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues from New Jersey, \nNorth Carolina, and Nebraska, and I thank them for bringing this \nproject to my attention. This sounds like a worthwhile project for \nUSAID to consider.\n\n\n                        Rwanda HIV/AIDS Program\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, as my colleague, Senator Coleman knows, \nhalting the spread of HIV/AIDS in Africa is an issue of paramount \nimportance. The international community is at a crucial crossroads in \nthe effort to treat and more importantly, stop the spread of this \ndisease.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, yes, the distinguished Senator from \nAlaska is correct in his statement that this is an issue at a crisis \npoint in Africa, and one that the United States has rightly committed \nourselves to fighting. I have a particular interest in an innovative \nproposal by the University of Minnesota to partner with the government \nof Rwanda to institute a comprehensive training and support program \nthat would provide HIV care to every HIV-infected Rwandan eligible for \ntreatment within 18 months of implementation.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Senator Coleman recently brought the University of \nMinnesota's program to my attention. It is of particular interest to me \nbecause it provides for training and development of nurses and HIV care \npractitioners, as part of a program that will be self sustaining within \n5 years of implementation.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Yes, as my colleague mentions, this program seeks to \naddress the health care infrastructure by training nurse practitioners \nthrough the University of Minnesota's excellent distance learning \nprogram for nurse practitioners. This program will dramatically \nincrease the capacity of Rwandan medical and nursing schools, creating \nnew physicians and nurses with a high standard of training for a \npermanent, skilled, and sustainable force of health care professionals \nin Rwanda.\n  Mr. STEVENS. The success of this program could eventually be a \ntemplate to spread out into the rest of Africa. I hope to work with my \ndistinguished colleague and the State Department on implementation of \nthis important program.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Yes, I will work with my colleague to gain funding for \nthis important program.\n\n\n                          Safe Drinking Water\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, safe drinking water is one of the biggest \nhealth challenges facing the developing world. According to the World \nHealth Organization, approximately 1.1 billion people around the world \nlack access to clean water sources and 2.6 billion lack access to basic \nsanitation. As a result, approximately 1.8 million people die every \nyear from diarrheal disease, and sadly, 90 percent of those deaths \noccur in children under the age of 5.\n  With an increasing world population and further constraints on our \nworld's water resources, the problem is expected to worsen \nsignificantly before it begins to improve.\n  I commend the assistant majority leader, Senator McConnell, the \nchairman of the foreign operations appropriations subcommittee, for \nproviding $200 million to the U.S. Agency for International Development \nfor safe water programs in his bill. Further, the chairman has \nallocated not less than $50 million of that amount for programs in \nAfrica, where the need is significant.\n  In addition to Government aid, there is a growing effort in the \nprivate, nonprofit sector to address this problem as well. \nOrganizations such as Millennium Water Alliance, Water Missions \nInternational, Living Water International, Water for People, The Nature \nConservancy, Winrock International, The Aspen Institute, and many \nothers are working to address global water issues. Also, the \nWaterLeaders Foundation is an organization dedicated to delivering \ncomprehensive, safe water technologies throughout the globe, one \nvillage at a time. They are developing lightweight, low-cost, low-\nenergy water purification systems that will soon be available to \ndistribute to communities, schools, and orphanages to help turn back \nthe tide on water-related diseases in Africa.\n  I would like to ask Senator McConnell, the chairman of this \nsubcommittee, if anything in this bill precludes any portion of USAID \nfunds from matching private donations to assist these types of \norganizations from helping to provide safe drinking water for these \ntypes of activities?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I appreciate the comments from my colleague, and \ncommend him for his leadership on the issue of safe water. I am proud \nof the commitment we have made in this bill to safe water programs, \nparticularly with regard to Africa, and I agree that nothing in this \nbill would preclude USAID funds from matching the good work of these \ndedicated private, nonprofit organizations. In fact, it is my \nunderstanding that USAID has provided $1.1 billion these last 2 years \nto leverage over $3.7 billion in private funds for a variety of \nprojects including safe water.\n  (At the request of Mr. Reid, the following statement was ordered to \nbe printed in the Record.)\n Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, earlier today I had to miss a \nrollcall vote on the Landrieu-Craig amendment because of a family \ncommitment. I would have voted for the sense-of-the-Senate amendment to \nurge USAID to follow the principles of the Hague Convention on the \nProtection of Children and Cooperation in Respect of Intercountry \nAdoption.\n  Senators Landrieu and Craig have been extraordinary leaders on the \nissue of adoption, and their work on the Congressional Adoption Caucus \nhas been very important in our country and throughout the world in \npromoting the fundamental concept that every child deserves a safe, \npermanent home. This is a basic goal that we should strive for at every \nopportunity.\n  Mr. SUNUNU. Mr. President, I offered an amendment to H.R. 3057 \nyesterday, which was accepted as part of a managers' package to \nincrease economic support fund monies for Lebanon from $35 million to \n$40 million, and to increase the support of the American educational \ninstitutions in Lebanon out of those monies from $4 million to $6 \nmillion. I very much appreciate the assistance of Senator McConnell and \nSenator Leahy in that regard.\n  The Cedar Revolution, in which the people of Lebanon have expressed \ntheir frustration with outside interference in their internal affairs \nand with a sectarian brand of politics that has produced corruption, \nundemocratic practices, and a faltering economy, has inspired hope for \nmajor political transformation not only in Lebanon, but in other \ncountries of the Middle East as well. It is important to express our \nsupport for the people of Lebanon, both symbolically and in concrete \nterms that will assist them in reviving their economy and in carrying \nforward a process of reform that still requires much effort and \ndetermination.\n  Fortunately, the Agency for International development has for some \nyears run a small but effective assistance program in the country, \nrelying largely on American nongovernmental organizations and education \ninstitutions which operate in Lebanon. USAID therefore has the \nexperience and the partners to efficiently put additional assistance to \ngood use. The\n\n[[Page S8535]]\n\npriorities should continue to be fostering fundamental democratic \nprinciples and economic recovery.\n  My amendment recognizes, as has the Appropriations Committee in its \nbill, the special role of the American educational institutions in \nachieving these goals. The American schools in Lebanon, through \nscholarships that these funds make possible, prepare the next \ngeneration of leaders by graduating young men and women who have a \nsolid understanding of the forces of globalization, are committed to \ndemocratic values, and have the skills to reform their societies and \nbridge the differences between those societies and the West. Young \nleaders such as these will assure the future not just of Lebanon, but \nof the region as a whole. Lebanon benefits when such men and women from \nthroughout the Middle East are educated at the renowned American \nschools in the country, as does the United States. It is therefore my \nintention that scholarship funds made available for these schools can \nbe provided for students from any country within the region.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, 30 years ago, Egypt and the United States \ndeveloped what has become a strong partnership, dedicated to a stable \nand peaceful Middle East.\n  Egypt is a strong ally to the United States and is actively \nsupporting the peace process in Israel and Palestine, Iraq, and the \nSudan.\n  It has also made many democratic reforms in recent years. Women now \nhold a number of important political positions such as cabinet \nministers, members of parliament, ambassadors, and judges.\n  The amended Egyptian constitution allows for multi-candidate \npresidential elections, and provides for equal access to publically \nowned media.\n  And a number of privately owned and managed television networks have \nbeen established.\n  It is important that we continue to support the positive changes \ntaking place in Egypt, and encourage further democratic and human \nrights reforms.\n  I am concerned that conditions and limitations placed on the \ngovernment of Egypt's ability to receive and spend funds will send a \nnegative message to the people of Egypt.\n  The administration has expressed concerns about these legislative \nrestrictions, which it believes could harm the relationship between our \nrespective governments.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, a significant amount of time and effort \ngoes into preparing this bill every year. I want to take a moment to \nrecognize some of the dedicated staff involved in putting it together.\n  First, I thank my good friend from Vermont, with whom I have enjoyed \nworking on this issue over the last decade, who is ably served by Tim \nRieser and Kate Eltrich. Over the past few months, they have worked \nalongside my staff helping to draft a bill and report. They have my \nspecial thanks for a job well done.\n  Recognition also goes to LaShawnda Smith, Tom Hawkins, Harry Christy, \nand Paul Grove of my staff. I thank LaShawnda for keeping the \nsubcommittee running. She does a terrific job.\n  Since coming to State-Foreign Operations 9 months ago, Tom has proven \nan invaluable member of our team. His oversight of the security and \ncounternarcotics programs is outstanding. Thank you, Tom.\n  Instead of protecting the President, Harry, a detailee from the \nSecret Service, has assumed his temporary duties as an appropriator in \na professional manner. His work on State Department accounts has been \ninvaluable, particularly given the most recent expansion of the \nsubcommittee's jurisdiction.\n  Finally, I certainly want to thank Paul Grove, staff director, for \nhis many years of great service with me on this assignment and other \nassignments in the past. There are many other people without whose help \nwe would literally have no bill to report at all. I thank Bob Putnam, \nJack Conway and, of course, Keith Kennedy. They should know that our \nstaff greatly appreciates their patience, guidance and, when required, \ngood humor.\n  For words, the editorial and printing shop is top-notch. Richard \nLarson is a consummate professional, nothing less than a committee \ntreasure. He has my thanks, as do Wayne Hosier, Doris Jackson, and \nHeather Crowell.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I would concur completely with the Senator \nfrom Kentucky on the people he has praised. He has left out one, \nhimself. I praise the work he has done. We worked very closely together \non this. I know that Tim Rieser on my side worked so closely with Paul \nGrove, and I appreciate the bipartisan nature of that. I thank Kate \nEltrich; the newest member on our side, Jennifer Park; of course, Paul \nGrove, Tom Hawkins, Harry Christy, and LaShawnda Smith on the \nchairman's side. It has been very good. I think we could probably go on \nto final passage.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Let me reiterate what a pleasure it is to work with \nSenator Leahy. I have enjoyed our relationship over the years.\n  There is a request for a vote on final passage. I believe we are \nready for that. I assume the yeas and nays need to be required.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on engrossment of the \namendments and third reading of the bill.\n  The amendments were ordered to be engrossed and the bill to be read a \nthird time.\n  The bill was read the third time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the clerk will \nreport S. 1042 by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 1042) to authorize appropriations for fiscal \n     year 2006 for military activities of the Department of \n     Defense, for military construction, and for defense \n     activities of the Department of Energy, to prescribe \n     personnel strengths for such fiscal year for the Armed \n     Forces, and for other purposes.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise regarding the pending bill, \nprovided that no other Senators seek recognition on another matter. \nSeeing none, I wish to accommodate my colleagues whenever possible.\n  It is now my privilege to once again bring forward for consideration \nby the Senate the annual Defense authorization bill. I commend my \ncolleagues on the Armed Services Committee. We have a magnificent \ncommittee. All members are very active. Our attendance is good and I am \nproud that this institution has such diligent and hard-working Senators \nto provide their input to our work on the Armed Services Committee.\n  I also recognize what I view, and this may be slightly biased on my \npart, as one of the finest professional staffs of any committee of the \nSenate. We have had a long history of extraordinary, competent, fair-\nminded, open-minded people who want to devote their careers to the men \nand women of the Armed Forces and the causes for which they offer their \nlife and limb, and that of their families.\n  Their work over the past several months has resulted in this \nimportant legislation. We completed the markup of this bill in record \ntime and in the spirit of true bipartisanship. In particular, I am \nprivileged to have the senior Senator from Michigan, Mr. Levin, a \nlongtime, dear, and valued friend, as my ranking member and full equal \nworking partner on this committee. He preceded me as the chairman of \nthe committee, but we will not go back into those days, nevertheless.\n  Mr. LEVIN. The glory days.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I have the floor.\n  We have served together on this committee for 27 years and we have, \nonce again, with the other wonderful collection of Senators on this \ncommittee and the staff, produced a bill which clearly supports our men \nand women in uniform and their families, and strengthens the national \nsecurity of our Nation.\n  I also want to acknowledge the strong support that we have received \nfrom the Republican leader and the Democratic leader of the Senate. \nThese two individuals have teamed up in years past to assist the \nmanagers in getting this bill through the Senate. I cannot ever recall \nstronger leadership by the Senate leaders. Maybe when our distinguished \ncolleague from West Virginia was the leader of the Senate at the time, \nI know he supported getting this bill through. His membership on this \ncommittee for these many years has been of great help to all of us who \nhave been privileged to serve as chairman and ranking member.\n  The bill before the Senate was unanimously reported out of the \ncommittee on May 12. It reflects the strong support for the members of \nour Armed Forces. The bill provides $441.6 billion in budget authority \nfor defense programs for the fiscal year 2006, an increase of $21 \nbillion, or 3.1 percent in real terms, above the amount authorized by \nthe Congress for fiscal year 2005.\n  At this juncture, I recognize the important contribution given by \nSenators Stevens and Inouye, the chair and ranking member, \nrespectively, of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Defense. It \nhas been their hope that the Senate will act on this bill. Until such \ntime as the Senate does act, it is not likely that they will proceed \nwith the continuation of their deliberations, markup, and the like to \nbring their important bill to the floor. I say that because I want all \nSenators to recognize it is the intention of the Senate leadership and \nthe managers of this bill, together with our two colleagues on the \nAppropriations Subcommittee on Defense, that this bill be acted upon by \nthe Senate prior to the scheduled recess for the month of August.\n  I mention that because one Senator had very politely said to me: I \nwould like to offer an amendment, but I think I will wait until after \nthe August recess. I politely informed him that it is the intention of \nall parties that this bill be enacted prior to the August recess. He \nappreciated my candor.\n  This amount is consistent with the President's budget request and \nwithin the budget resolution adopted by the Congress. The bill also \nincludes authorization for $50 billion in emergency supplemental \nfunding for fiscal year 2006 to cover the cost of military operations \nin Iraq, Afghanistan, and throughout the world, together with our \ncoalition partners, on the global war against terrorism.\n  I also acknowledge that while we put proper emphasis on Iraq, \nAfghanistan, and the war on terrorism, there are innumerable other \nmissions undertaken night and day by the men and women of the Armed \nForces for all aspects of the diverse security needs and requirements \nof this Nation. Many of them are on the far-flung outposts of the world \nperforming those missions beneath the sea, above the sea, or in the \nair. We acknowledge with fervent gratitude their contribution, together \nwith all of us who proudly served in uniform, and their families.\n  The past 3\\1/2\\ years have been a time of great successes and \nenormous challenges for the U.S. Armed Forces. The mission of our men \nand women in uniform has never been executed with better skill and \ndedication. I myself am privileged to have had modest experience in \nuniform. I have had the privilege of having an association with the men \nand women in uniform for 60 years. That is a long period of time. \nAlmost without exception, in all those years at some point in time I \nhave had the opportunity to either serve alongside of, or be in support \nof, the men and women of our Armed Forces. I had a very brief career in \nWorld War II, inauspicious as it was, and I had the opportunity to \nserve in that historic period. I would say unequivocally that, while \nour generation of World War II was referred to as ``the greatest,'' \nthis generation is every bit as great if not greater in the complexity \nof the threats posed against this Nation night and day and the \nsacrifices they are\n\n[[Page S8537]]\n\nbeing called upon to make in the performance of their duties and those \nof their families.\n  The rapid success, and it was a rapid success, of Operation Enduring \nFreedom in Afghanistan and the rather prolonged but nevertheless \nsuccessful operation to date, Operation Iraqi Freedom, has evolved into \nthe hard work of reconstruction and stability operations in both \ntheaters, necessary to secure peace and stability in their respective \nregions. Such important work brings with it new challenges associated \nwith an extraordinarily high operational tempo on people and equipment \nand the need to counter asymmetric threats, including improvised \nexplosive devices and the ever increasing, tragic, tragic use of the \nsuicide bomber. Further, the responsibility of the Nation is to \nproperly care for those who volunteer to serve--active, National Guard, \nreserve, retired, and their families. They deserve nothing less than \nour total support. The bill, in my judgment, meets those challenges.\n  This bill is being considered at a time when the United States \ncontinues to work with a coalition to defeat terrorism globally and \ndefend freedom and democracy. The recent tragic aftermath of terrorist \nbombings in London reminds us once again, in this global war on \nterrorism, of the ruthless nature of the enemy we face. When I say \n``we,'' it is not only the United States, but freedom-loving people \nwherever they are in the world. It is a war we must and will win.\n  Hundreds of thousands of soldiers, sailors, airmen, marines, and \nCoast Guardsmen--active, reserve, and National Guard--and countless \ncivilians who support military, diplomatic, and humanitarian operations \nare serving valiantly in Iraq, Afghanistan, and other locations to \nsecure the hard-won military successes and to preserve peace and \nfreedom. Successful elections in Iraq and Afghanistan in the past year \nare testament to the yearning of those people for a voice in their own \ndestiny, the willingness of the United States to assist, and the \nprofessionalism of the brave Americans and their coalition partners who \nvolunteer to serve. The U.S. Armed Forces serving around the world are \ntruly the first line of defense in the security of our U.S. homeland.\n  We are all mindful of the risks members of the Armed Forces face \nevery day, and of the sacrifices made by the families and their \ncommunities. I repeat, the communities are so involved with the men and \nwomen of the Armed Forces stationed overseas, the men and women in \nuniform who have been asked to do much in the past year and who \nresponded in the finest traditions of the generations of Americans who \npreceded them. The American people are proud of their men and women in \nuniform, and what they have accomplished to protect our freedom here at \nhome and abroad.\n  While recent successes have proven the value of past investment in \nthe people and equipment of the U.S. Armed Forces, this is no time for \nany complacency. The recurring lessons of our military operations are \nthat national security threats are ever changing and persistent. \nVictory and successes must be accomplished by vigilance and \npreparation. Such vigilance takes the form of enhanced readiness for \ntoday's Armed Forces, and preparation for future threats to the \nsecurity of the United States, its interests, and its allies.\n  In preparing this legislation, together with the members of our \ncommittee, we identified seven priorities to guide our committee's work \non the national defense bill now before the Senate. The first priority \nis to provide our men and women in uniform the resources they need to \nwin the global war on terrorism; second, to enhance the ability of the \nDepartment of Defense to fulfill its homeland defense responsibilities; \nthird, to provide the resources and authorities needed to rapidly \nacquire the full range of force protection capabilities for deployed \nforces, particularly with regard to improvised explosive devices; \nfourth, to continue the committee's commitment to improve the quality \nof life for those who serve--active, reserve, National Guard, and \nretired, and their families, with particular emphasis on recruiting and \nretention and on the health care for those who bear the wounds of our \nwar; fifth, to sustain the readiness of our Armed Forces to conduct \nmilitary operations against all current and anticipated threats; sixth, \nto support the Department's efforts to develop the innovative, forward-\nlooking capabilities necessary to modernize and transform the Armed \nForces; and, finally, to continue active committee oversight of \nDepartment programs and operations, particularly in the areas of \nacquisition reform to ensure proper stewardship of taxpayer dollars.\n\n  With passage of the bill before us, the Senate has the opportunity to \nsend a strong message in support of the men and women of the Armed \nForces serving at numerous posts at home and abroad that America values \nand honors their service and that of their families.\n  The bill contains much-deserved pay raises and benefits for military \npersonnel and their families, enhanced survivor benefits for those \nwhose loved ones have made the ultimate sacrifice, improved health care \nfor both active and reserve components of personnel and their families, \nand prudent investments in the equipment and technology our military \nneeds to address current and future threats.\n  I urge my colleagues to debate this bill in a constructive spirit and \nto support its adoption.\n  There is one issue I would like to highlight: My colleagues and I on \nthe committee, and I think almost every member of the committee shares \nthis view, and many of us in the Senate--we are all concerned about the \ndeclining state of the building of new ships for the U.S. Navy. We do \nnot believe the current or projected level of funding for shipbuilding \nis adequate to build the numbers of ships our Navy needs to perform and \ncontinue to perform its global missions. Always remember, the \nConstitution of the United States directs this Congress to raise its \narmies, but ``maintain'' a Navy. The Founding Fathers were specific in \nthat direction to the Congress and it is our duty to fulfill it. They \nhad the foresight to realize that a navy can not be quickly constituted \nor reconstituted. It takes a decade or more from the concept of a new \nship through the years to prepare the plans, to test the ship, to test \nthe system, and to finally slip it down the ways of the shipyard, and \nthen for a period of time to further test it before it gains its \nability to join the fleet. That is a long time.\n  In many respects that was as true years ago as it is today, so we \nmust learn the lesson that it takes time to maintain our Navy. As a \nmaritime nation, that presence of our Navy is often displayed in the \nform, not only of our ships, not only through ensuring open sealanes of \ncommunication and training in international waters, but also the \ninherent diplomatic mission of visiting our ports and proudly showing \nOld Glory, our flag. The Navy currently has 288 ships in the active \nfleet. This is the smallest number of ships in the Navy since before--I \nwould like to repeat this--the smallest fleet since before World War \nII. That is before December 7, 1941.\n  I believe the shipbuilding budget must be reviewed by the \nadministration as a matter of utmost urgency in the coming year, and I \nrespectfully urge the President to establish a special shipbuilding \nfund, to direct the OMB to provide a dedicated fund for the building of \nships rather than each year make the allocation--so much to the \nDepartment of the Navy, so much to the Department of the Air Force, so \nmuch to the Department of the Army. Keep those allocations as they are \ndevised each year, but superimpose on the allocation of funding for the \nNavy a sum of dollars to turn around this declining curve of \nshipbuilding.\n  America has much to be thankful for in terms of its patriotic young \nAmericans who volunteer to serve and who have individually and \ncollectively performed with such professionalism and distinction in \ndefense of the United States. The efforts of the U.S. Armed Forces have \nbeen remarkable, but they are not without cost--the loss of priceless \nlives that must be honored and remembered; the responsibility to care \nfor the survivors and their families; the cost of ongoing operations \nand related refurbishment or replacement of heavily used equipment; and \nthe responsibility to assure that those who serve, and their families, \nreceive the quality of life and the benefits they need and to which \nthey are entitled.\n  I believe the National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 2006 \nprudently addresses the defense needs of\n\n[[Page S8538]]\n\nour Nation and recognizes the service and sacrifice of our men and \nwomen in uniform and their families, provides the resources necessary \nto win the global war on terrorism, and makes the necessary investment \nto provide for the security of our Nation in the years to come.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in sending a strong message of \nbipartisan support for our troops at home, their families, and to the \nother nations in the world--America is committed to freedom.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks time? The Senator from Michigan is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I join with the chairman of the Armed \nServices Committee, Senator Warner, in bringing S. 1042, the National \nDefense Authorization Act for fiscal year 2006, to the Senate floor. I \ndo so proudly. I am always proud to stand next to Senator Warner and \nwith Senator Warner and our staffs in bringing this bill forward. It \nhas been many years that we have done this together, and we always look \nforward to it because it is a time we, together with our staffs, can \nspend time trying to strengthen the security of this country in a \nbipartisan way.\n  This bill, to my memory, has always been a bipartisan bill. Our \nstaffs work together on a bipartisan basis. The way they have worked \ntogether should be a role model for how we in the Senate should be \nworking. I congratulate Senator Warner for his leadership of our \ncommittee. He sets the right pattern for all of us. Again, it is an \nhonor to be standing here with him.\n  The bill we bring before the Senate is the product of 3 days of \nmarkup. I do not believe we needed a single recorded vote. There may \nhave been some voice votes where there were some differences, but I \ndon't even remember that. I think we worked out all of our differences. \nWhere there were differences that remained, I think we actually were \nable to address them, if not resolve them, but without actually a \nrecorded vote, if my memory is correct. That is quite a tribute to the \nleadership of Senator Warner as well.\n  We have a common interest in providing the support the men and women \nin uniform need and deserve. We are unanimous on that, regardless of \nour positions--which differ. As Members of the Senate we don't all have \nthe same position on events in Iraq--how we got there and how we \nproceed from here. There is no unanimity on that issue. And on a number \nof other issues there is not unanimity. But where there is unanimity is \nthat once that decision is made democratically to send our men and \nwomen to war, in harm's way, we stand behind them. And on that there is \nno dissent regardless of the positions of different Senators on the \nunderlying issues. The men and women in uniform deserve our support. \nThey are entitled to the support. During the Vietnam era, we had times \nwhen men and women in uniform did not receive the support they \ndeserved. That has not been true since Vietnam. And finally, I think \nour people recognize that the men and women we put in harm's way, who \nare in the uniform of the United States, when the Commander in Chief, \nthe Congress make a decision that they go to war, they are entitled to \nthe full support of the people and of the Congress of the United \nStates.\n\n  We are proud of these troops. Senator Warner and I have done many \nthings together in the Senate, and one of them has been to travel to \nvisit our troops. We have seen some of the most amazing men and women \nthis country can produce who are in uniform, some of the most \nprofessional, dedicated, committed, patriotic people you will ever find \nrepresenting the United States in uniform. We have been to far-flung \nplaces of the world. We have traveled long distances, but whenever we \narrived where we were going, we have had that kind of feeling that \nwhatever the thousands of miles were that we traveled to get there, it \nwas worth it just to be inspired literally by the men and women who \nrepresent this country and take the risks for all of us.\n  The bill that is reported by the Armed Services Committee will \nimprove the quality of life of the men and women in uniform, provide \nfunding needed to continue ongoing military operations in Iraq and \nAfghanistan, make needed improvements to the management of the \nDepartment of Defense, and authorize critical investments that are \nneeded to reduce the risks the United States will face in the 21st \ncentury.\n  First and foremost, the bill before us continues the increases in \ncompensation, in the quality of life our service men and women and \ntheir families deserve as they face the hardships that are imposed by \ncontinuing military operations around the world. Those demands have \nincreased significantly over the years, and we have tried to respond to \nthose demands and to those increased hazards which the men and women \nface.\n  In particular, the bill would authorize a 3.1-percent across-the-\nboard pay raise for military personnel, authorize a $70 million \nincrease in childcare and family assistance, services for military \nfamilies, and authorize additional funds for supplemental education aid \nto local school districts affected by the assignment or location of \nmilitary families.\n  We have increased the death gratuity to $100,000 for survivors and \nmilitary members who die in a combat zone, and we are going to have an \namendment which will broaden that further. We have increased from \n$250,000 to $400,000 the maximum amount of coverage available under the \nService Members Group Life Insurance Program.\n  Second, the bill would provide funding needed to continue ongoing \nmilitary operations in Iraq and Afghanistan and help address the \nchallenges our military faces around the world. For instance, the bill \nwould authorize a $50 billion supplemental to cover part of the cost of \nongoing military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan over the coming \nyears. We know that supplemental is going to be needed. We on the Armed \nServices Committee asked the Budget Committee to add this money for our \nauthorization bill because we have to plan on this expenditure. We know \nit is going to take place, and we should authorize it as part of a \nregular budget process and not just simply leave it to supplemental \nfunding.\n  So we are authorizing a $50 billion supplemental for 2006 to cover \nongoing military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. It is far more \nrealistic budgeting than we have too frequently not done in the past.\n  Our bill authorizes an increase in the Army's active-duty end \nstrength by 20,000 people to a total of 52,400 soldiers for fiscal year \n2006. It is going to be a challenge to meet that new end strength just \nin terms of recruitment, but we are determined that we are going to try \nto respond to the demand of our members of the military by increasing \nthe size of the Army's active-duty end strength. We have added 20,000 \nto that and added $1.4 billion over the President's request for force \nprotection gear for our soldiers in Iraq and Afghanistan. We authorize \nalmost $350 million for up-armored vehicles to provide additional force \nprotection for our troops in the field. That represents an increase of \n$120 million over the President's budget request.\n  We direct that $500 million be dedicated to the joint improvised \nexplosive device, IED, task force to facilitate the rapid development \nof technology to counter the top threat to our men and women in Iraq \nand Afghanistan. The chairman of our committee described the threat in \nterms of those IEDs and what we are doing to respond to that threat, \nwhich is everything we possibly can do given its nature and the fact \nthat threat is really, if not the top threat, one of the top threats to \nour service personnel.\n  Our bill authorizes up to $500 million for the continuation of the \nCommanders Emergency Response Program. This program enables our \nmilitary commanders in the field to respond quickly and flexibly to \nurgent requirements in fiscal years 2006 and 2007. They have told us \nthat this authorization and appropriation which follows is one of the \nmost effective actions we can take to increase their capability in the \nfield, and that Commanders Emergency Response Program continued at $500 \nmillion for these 2 years is provided.\n  Third, the bill contains a number of important provisions to improve \nthe efficiency and the transparency of the Department's operations. For \ninstance, the bill contains provisions that would prohibit the \ninappropriate use of contracting techniques that result in the \nheightened risk of fraud and abuse by\n\n[[Page S8539]]\n\nlimiting the Government's insight into contractor cost and performance \nin the acquisition of major weapons systems.\n  It addresses continuing awareness of interagency contracts by \nrequiring the inspector general to review major interagency contracts \nwhich have been used by the Department of Defense. There have been real \nabuses in these interagency contracts, and we have, indeed, had a \nnumber of hearings over the years into some of these abuses where one \nagency uses the contract of another agency in order to carry out some \nfunction, but there is no transparency. Nobody knows it is done. You \ncan do it noncompetitively. There is too much opaqueness in that \nprocess, and we are trying to make sure the abuses in the interagency \ncontract area are addressed, and so we require the inspector general to \nreview the major interagency contracts the Department of Defense is \nusing or has used.\n  Our bill strengthens the defense ethics oversight by requiring major \ndefense contractors to identify former Department of Defense officials \non their payrolls and by requiring a review of ethics rules that are \nraised by the increased use of contractors to perform Government \nacquisition functions, and we establish a contract fraud risk \nassessment team to assess the vulnerability of Department of Defense \ncontract fraud, waste, and abuse and require the Secretary of Defense \nto develop an action plan to address these areas of vulnerability.\n  Finally, the bill contains a number of critical provisions that \nshould help reduce some of the risks our country will face in the \ncoming century. We are particularly pleased that the bill authorizes \nthe budget request for the Department of Defense Cooperative Threat \nReduction Program and related Department of Energy nonproliferation \nprograms. The greatest probable threat we face as a nation would be if \na terrorist or terrorist group could get their hands on a nuclear \nweapon or weapon of mass destruction.\n  There are too many loose nukes in this world. We have to do more to \naddress the proliferation threat. I don't believe the funding in this \nbill is adequate. I hope we can find a way to increase the amount of \nfunding that goes into this threat reduction program and the other \nnonproliferation programs that are funded in this bill. Other than \ngiving all the support we possibly can to our troops, there is probably \nnothing in this bill that directly addresses the greatest threat we \nface, which is the threat of a nuclear weapon in the hands of a \nterrorist, than this threat reduction program and the nonproliferation \nprograms which are aimed at securing nuclear weapons and other weapons \nof mass destruction.\n  Our bill provides the President permanent authority to waive on an \nannual basis the condition that must be met before the Cooperative \nThreat Reduction Program money can be provided to countries of the \nformer Soviet Union. This is an authority which the administration has \nrequested. Instead of having to come to us each year for this \nauthority, we believe it should be made permanent. Our bill enhances \nthe authority of the Secretary of Defense to use cooperative threat \nreduction funds to address risks of proliferation of weapons of mass \ndestruction outside the countries of the former Soviet Union. We not \nonly have nuclear weapons and weapons of mass destruction inside those \ncountries, we have those risks outside, and we ought to use this \nprogram to address again what is surely the most, or one of the most, \nserious risks any nation can face.\n  We in our bill earmark $100 million of missile defense money \nspecifically for enhanced ground and flight testing to require \nobjective testing and evaluation of the operational suitability of each \nblock of missile defense that is produced.\n  There hasn't been enough testing in this program. There has been too \nmuch buying before we fly, and we are trying to see if we can't take \nsome of the risk out of this program, to see, if we are going to \nproceed, whether we can't proceed in a way which would guarantee a \nsystem which is effective and workable and useful rather than just \nplowing billions of dollars into a system procuring missiles that may \nnever be usable. So we take some of this money, specifically $100 \nmillion of that program, and we address it specifically to ground and \nflight testing in addition to what was previously planned.\n  We add $20 million to the President's budget to accelerate chemical \ndemilitarization activity and to enable the United States to meet \nobligations under the Chemical Weapons Convention.\n  While this bill takes many important steps to fund the national \ndefense and support our men and women in uniform, there is more that we \ncan and should do. I would like to just mention a few areas that I hope \nwe can revisit as our bill is considered in the Chamber.\n  First, the bill contains a provision that would increase the military \ndeath gratuity from $12,000 to $100,000, but it is restricted to \ncombat-related deaths. That means that the families of soldiers, \nsailors, airmen and marines who die in the line of duty outside of the \ncombat area will still receive only $12,000. Our top military officers \nhave uniformly testified that the amount of the death gratuity should \nnot be dependent on the circumstances of somebody who is on active \nduty. The death of a family member in an accident, for instance, while \non active duty can be every bit as hard on a family as a death in Iraq \nor Afghanistan. Somebody who is killed while being trained for duty in \nIraq or Afghanistan should surely have his or her family provided with \nthe same kind of benefit as somebody who is killed in combat. From the \nfamily perspective and I think morally, there is no significant \ndifference. They are on active duty, they are taking risks, and they \nare killed while taking those risks on active duty.\n  The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff testified before our \ncommittee the following:\n\n       When you join the military, you join the military. You go \n     where they send you. It's happenstance that you are in a \n     combat zone or at home. And I think we in the past held \n     treating people universally foremost and consistently and \n     that's how I come down on that.\n\n  So our top uniform folks support the uniform application of that \nbenefit to $100,000 for people who are on active duty.\n  Earlier this year, the Senate adopted that position. We adopted an \namendment to the Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act which would \nhave made the families of all soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines \nwho die in the line of duty eligible for the full death benefit. The \nappropriations amendment was dropped in conference, but we should try \nagain. I hope the Senate will stand strong on this issue and adopt a \nsimilar amendment to our bill.\n  Second, while the bill takes many positive steps to improve \ncompensation and benefits for our men and women in uniform and their \nfamilies, we have to do more for Guard and Reserve forces who are \nbearing so much of the burden in our current military operations.\n  Never before have we relied so heavily on the Guard and Reserve to \nserve on active duty over such an extended period of time. All members, \nrepresenting different States, understand that. The families of the men \nand women who are in our Guard and Reserve forces have reminded us \nabout how overly stretched those forces are. We do not get many \ncomplaints from the men and women themselves. They are too professional \nto do the complaining. We hear from families. We hear from employers.\n  Again, we have never before relied as heavily on our Guard and \nReserve forces to serve on active duty for extended periods of times as \nwe do now. Studies have shown that 40 percent of our junior enlisted \nmembers in the Reserve components nonetheless have no health insurance \nexcept when they are on active duty. I hope we can develop an approach \nto this problem that uses the military's TRICARE health care program to \nensure that members of the Reserve component have adequate health \ninsurance and are medically ready when called upon to serve.\n  Third, the bill earmarks $100 million of missile defense money \nspecifically for enhanced ground and flight testing and requires \nobjective testing and evaluation of the operational capability of each \nblock of missile defense which is produced. Those are positive steps, \nas I have said, which will move us in the direction of the ``fly before \nyou buy'' approach that we insist on with other major acquisitions.\n  However, the bill also authorizes more than $60 million in long-lead\n\n[[Page S8540]]\n\nfunding for more interceptors on top of the 30 we already are buying, \neven though those interceptors are not subject to operational testing \nand evaluation. If we want a missile defense that works, rather than \none that sits on the ground and soaks up money, we should insist on \ntesting the missiles that we already have before we go out and buy \nmore.\n  Finally, the administration requested $8.5 million for research and \ndevelopment of the robust nuclear earth penetrator, even though \nCongress canceled this program last year. Although the bill does cut \n$4.5 million of the Air Force money from this program, it authorizes \nthe Department of Energy to spend $4 million to resume the feasibility \nstudy. Instead of being a leader in the effort to prevent the \nproliferation of nuclear weapons, we, ourselves, pursue the development \nof a new nuclear weapon. It is exactly the wrong message to send to the \nrest of the world.\n  We are trying to persuade the rest of the world, don't go nuclear. We \nare telling some of those countries, if you do go nuclear, we may take \nvery serious action to prevent you from crossing certain red lines. Yet \nwe, ourselves, again are on the verge of putting in money to resume a \nfeasibility study for a new nuclear weapon to be developed. I know it \nis only a study, but it is a message. It is a loud message. It is a \ndramatic message. It is a compelling message. It is a persuasive \nmessage, and it is used against us when we go to other countries and \nsay: Don't go down that nuclear road.\n  They say: Wait a minute. You are considering the possibility of going \nfurther and you already have thousands of nuclears and you are trying \nto persuade us that we should not be using nuclear weapons to defend \nourselves when you are studying an additional use or additional weapon \nyourself? It weakens our argument and it weakens the argument that we \nmust make against the most serious threat we face, which is the \nproliferation of nuclear weapons.\n  Finally, as our chairman has said, as we begin consideration of this \nbill, the men and women of our Armed Forces, both Active and Reserve, \nare deployed in harm's way in many areas of the globe that are \nsubjected to daily armed attack in Iraq and Afghanistan. We joined \ntogether in standing behind our troops in expressing pride the \nextraordinary accomplishments on the battlefield. This bill will do \nmuch to provide them with the equipment they need and the compensation \nand benefits they deserve. If we can do more, we ought to do more. They \ndeserve it, and their families deserve it.\n  We have important issues to debate. Again, I conclude by thanking \nChairman Warner for his leadership, bringing this bill to the floor and \nhaving this bill in the fairly complete shape it is in coming to the \nSenate. I thank him for his leadership of our staffs. We have wonderful \nstaff, as he mentioned, and we have a wonderful committee.\n  We are blessed to have members on our committee who all contribute in \nsuch important ways to the production of the bill. One of those members \njust walked off the floor. I, as Senator Warner did, want to recognize \nSenator Byrd although he is not here. He is stalwart in his commitment \nto this Senate and to this Nation. There are times when his plate is so \noverly full and his heart is so heavy, but nonetheless he performs his \nduty, and he is an inspiration to all members. All members of our \ncommittee deserve praise for the contribution they made to the bill.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I certainly concur in those observations \nabout our highly esteemed colleague from West Virginia. I thank the \nSenator for his kind remarks.\n  I think this is No. 27 for us--a quarter of a century. It is a pretty \ngood record.\n  I am quite anxious, as I know the Senator is, that Senators bring \nforth amendments.\n  I will propose an amendment for deliberation. Moments ago, I notified \nyour staff about it. I am perfectly willing to procedurally take it up \nbecause I know two colleagues on that side of the aisle are interested \nin the same subject. We notified our offices this amendment would be \nbrought up. They may have some views on it. I hope they will address \ntheir views.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1314\n\n  I send an amendment to the desk and ask for its immediate \nconsideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Virginia, [Mr. Warner], proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1314.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To increase amounts available for the procurement of wheeled \n   vehicles for the Army and the Marine Corps and for armor for such \n                               vehicles)\n\n       On page 303, strike line 3 and all that follows through \n     page 304, line 24, and insert the following:\n       (3) For other procurement $376,700,000.\n       (b) Availability of Certain Amounts.--\n       (1) Availability.--Of the amount authorized to be \n     appropriated by subsection (a)(3), $225,000,000 shall be \n     available for purposes as follows:\n       (A) Procurement of up-armored high mobility multipurpose \n     wheeled vehicles (UAHs).\n       (B) Procurement of wheeled vehicle add-on armor protection, \n     including armor for M1151/M1152 high mobility multipurpose \n     wheeled vehicles.\n       (C) Procurement of M1151/M1152 high mobility multipurpose \n     wheeled vehicles.\n       (2) Allocation of funds.--\n       (A) In general.--Subject to subparagraph (B), the Secretary \n     of the Army shall allocate the manner in which amounts \n     available under paragraph (1) shall be available for the \n     purposes specified in that paragraph.\n       (B) Limitation.--Amounts available under paragraph (1) may \n     not be allocated under subparagraph (A) until the Secretary \n     certifies to the congressional defense committees that the \n     Army has a validated requirement for procurement for a \n     purpose specified in paragraph (1) based on a statement of \n     urgent needs from a commander of a combatant command.\n       (C) Reports.--Not later than 15 days after an allocation of \n     funds is made under subparagraph (A), the Secretary shall \n     submit to the congressional defense committees a report \n     describing such allocation of funds.\n\n     SEC. 1404. NAVY AND MARINE CORPS PROCUREMENT.\n\n       (a) Navy.--Funds are hereby authorized to be appropriated \n     for fiscal year 2006 for the procurement accounts of the Navy \n     in amounts as follows:\n       (1) For aircraft, $183,800,000.\n       (2) For weapons, including missiles and torpedoes, \n     $165,500,000.\n       (3) For other procurement, $30,800,000.\n       (b) Marine Corps.--Funds are hereby authorized to be \n     appropriated for fiscal year 2006 for the procurement account \n     for the Marine Corps in the amount of $429,600,000.\n       (c) Navy and Marine Corps Ammunition.--Funds are hereby \n     authorized to be appropriated for fiscal year 2006 for the \n     procurement account for ammunition for the Navy and the \n     Marine Corps in the amount of $104,500,000.\n       (d) Availability of Certain Amounts.--\n       (1) Availability.--Of the amount authorized to be \n     appropriated by subsection (b), $340,400,000 shall be \n     available for purposes as follows:\n       (A) Procurement of up-armored high mobility multipurpose \n     wheeled vehicles (UAHs).\n       (B) Procurement of wheeled vehicle add-on armor protection, \n     including armor for M1151/M1152 high mobility multipurpose \n     wheeled vehicles.\n       (C) Procurement of M1151/M1152 high mobility multipurpose \n     wheeled vehicles.\n       (2) Allocation of funds.--\n       (A) In general.--Subject to subparagraph (B), the Secretary \n     of the Navy shall allocate the manner in which amounts \n     available under paragraph (1) shall be available for the \n     purposes specified in that paragraph.\n       (B) Limitation.--Amounts available under paragraph (1) may \n     not be allocated under subparagraph (A) until the Secretary \n     certifies to the congressional defense committees that the \n     Marine Corps has a validated requirement for procurement for \n     a purpose specified in paragraph (1) based on a statement of \n     urgent needs from a commander of a combatant command.\n       (C) Reports.--Not later than 15 days after an allocation of \n     funds is made under subparagraph (A), the Secretary shall \n     submit to the congressional defense committees a report \n     describing such allocation of funds.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, there has been tremendous effort of our \ncommittee on both sides of the aisle with respect to the equipment \nbeing used, primarily in Iraq at this time, but could well be used \nelsewhere. We refer to them as the up-armored high mobility \nmultipurpose wheeled vehicles; humvees are part of that. There is a \nrange of these vehicles.\n  The purpose of this amendment is to add $105 million to the Army and \n$340 million to the Marine Corps for emerging up-armored HMMWV \nrequirements that the United States Central Command, under General \nAbizaid, has established.\n\n[[Page S8541]]\n\n  In the last few days, I was down at Quantico where they have a \nmagnificent research and development and forward-looking contingent. I \nlooked on the parade grounds at a series of vehicles being modified in \ncertain ways to provide a greater degree of protection to the \noccupants--namely, our soldiers or Marines--who must use these vehicles \nin the face of this insidious, frightful threat of suicide bombers, \nimplanted bombs which are activated by different devices, even a simple \ncell phone. This is tough going.\n  I commend a number of Senators--Senator Kennedy, Senator Bayh, a \nnumber of Senators on my side--who have been working this issue for \nsome years. The hour and the time has come to add significant sums of \nmoney.\n  At some point in this debate on the amendment I will go into further \ndetail, but the Committee on the Budget allocated to the Committee on \nArmed Services a very significant amount of money to be authorized at \nour discretion for the purposes of the immediate requirements of the \nmilitary in connection with their missions today, primarily in Iraq and \nAfghanistan.\n  The Army's current global war on terror requirement for up-armored \nHMMWVs is 10,000 vehicles. The Marine Corps current global war on \nterrorism requirement for up-armored HMMWVs is approximately 500 \nvehicles.\n  The markup of the fiscal year 2006 Defense bill, the one we are on, \nrecommends that $120 million be provided to the Secretary of the Army \nto address the emerging up-armored HMMWV requirements toward its \n10,000-unit requirement. The Secretary of the Army was provided the \nauthority and flexibility to procure up-armored HMMWV's tactical wheel \nadd-on armor, the M1151, the M1152 HMMWVs, once the Army received a \nvalidated requirement from a combatant commander. The amendment is \nfunded for 11,693 up-armored HMMWVs, and the Marine Corps is funded for \n498 up-armored HMMWVs through December 2005.\n  Since the markup of the fiscal year 2006 authorization bill, the \ncommittee has received new information that justifies, in our judgment, \nthe increase of the Army and the Marine Corps requirement for dollars \nto meet the up-armored HMMWV goals. The Army has an emerging \nrequirement for up-armored HMMWVs for Afghanistan which may increase \nthe overall requirement by 300 up-armored HMMWVs.\n  The Marines Expeditionary Force Forward Commander recently requested \nthat all HMMWVs in his area of operation be upgraded to the up-armored \nHMMWV variant. This could potentially increase the Marine Corps \nrequirement to 2,814 up-armored HMMWVs, of which 988 are now funded.\n  In keeping with the commitment of the Committee on Armed Services to \nmeet all force protection requirements, this amendment proposes to add \n$105 million to the Army budget authorized and $340 million to the \nMarines Corps to allow the Department to respond quickly to the \ncommander's request. It is there.\n  This is quite a complicated amendment. A number of Senators have \nexpressed an interest in this amendment. I would like to debate this \ntonight. I request the leadership consider having a record vote in due \ncourse. I urge Senators who have an interest in this matter to \ncommunicate with me or Senator Levin.\n  I would like to have Senators' views. I propose to put it to one \nside; thereby giving a full opportunity for all members to express \ntheir views. Again, I will seek the authority of the leadership to have \na record vote on this. Each Senator will want to vote on this \namendment. I cannot think of any equipment issue more important to the \nmen and women from your States than this.\n  I want to accommodate my colleagues, and I will yield the floor so my \ndistinguished colleague, Senator Levin, can make such comments as he \nwishes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, first, this amendment addresses a very \nsignificant issue, which took up a lot of time of the committee. We \nhave, in the bill itself, added some additional money to what the \nadministration requested because their request was so inadequate to the \nthreat. We have found over the period of time we have been in Iraq and \nAfghanistan a totally inadequate response to our armor needs.\n  We have had I don't know how many hearings in the Armed Services \nCommittee--the chairman says about five; and that would be about my \nrecollection, too--where we have pressed our military leaders, the \nSecretary of Defense, as to why there has been such a slow response to \nsuch an obvious need. So we have been pressing very hard to provide all \nof the adequate resources. We get different answers from the people who \nrun the Defense Department than we get from the people who are \nproviding the vehicles.\n  We were told, for instance, by the manufacturer that they never got a \nrequest for an increased amount. On the other hand, our military \nleaders said: Well, sure, we pressed for an increase in the amount.\n  We have a total conflict on the subject of whether there was ever a \ntime when funding was short, because the committee was determined that \nwe provide all of the resources--all of the resources--that are \nnecessary to provide the armor. It is inexcusable we have men and women \nwho are subject to these devices on the side of the road who do not \nhave the best armor.\n  Hearing after hearing, we put pressure on our civilian and uniformed \nleaders to provide the equipment our men and women deserve, and the \narmor our men and women deserve.\n  There has been a number of Members of our committee, particularly \nSenator Kennedy, Senator Bayh, and others, who have had not only a \nmajor interest in and made a major effort to press for additional \nfunding and for additional armor but who I know are interested in this \nsubject on this bill.\n  So I suggest to my friend from Virginia that we give them an \nopportunity to read what he has now offered because I think it would be \nvery possible they may want to either go in a slightly more increased \ndirection or in a different direction. And I am not sure, they may want \nto offer a second-degree amendment to this amendment or they may be \nperfectly happy to cosponsor it. But I would like to give them an \nopportunity, since this does come at this hour, to read to see exactly \nwhat is being proposed since they have such an interest in this issue \nand I know they were planning on offering language on this bill.\n  I would join in the suggestion that this language be available \npromptly to the members of the committee or any Member of the body \nbecause I think every Member of this body has had an interest in trying \nto press the Defense Department to provide greater armor at greater \nspeed.\n  I have been very dissatisfied, publicly, as to an issue having to do \nwith the fact that our military leaders tried to get the manufacturer, \nas we understand it, to have a second source. That would have required \nthe manufacturer to share some technology with the second producer. \nAccording to one story, they refused to share the technology with a \nsecond producer. If that is true, as I said publicly before, it would \nbe pretty shocking we would have a contractor who produces material for \nthe Defense Department, who knows we desperately need more, who would \nnot share the technology with a second source so we could produce the \narmor a lot faster.\n  There is a lot of significant background. I think we ought to give \nevery member of our committee and every Member of the Senate an \nopportunity to take a look at the approach the chairman is proposing to \nsee whether this meets the various needs and thoughts of Members of the \nSenate. I welcome the chairman's willingness to lay this amendment \naside to give those Members an opportunity.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, it is a perfectly reasonable request. I \nfully wish to accommodate my colleague's wishes. We will lay this \namendment aside. But I would like to draw attention to the fact that \nthe subject is one which has been under constant review, the subject of \nfive hearings in committee over a period of time. It is so important, I \nwould like to have this bill start off with the amendment. I am \nhopeful, with the concurrence of the leadership, we can address this \namendment this evening.\n\n[[Page S8542]]\n\n  I am perfectly willing to lay it aside now and let colleagues come \nover and speak to it, as you say, and take such parliamentary steps as \nthey so desire.\n  So at this time, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \npending amendment of the Senator from Virginia be laid aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1315\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Now, Mr. President, I have, I think, discussed with our \ncolleague another amendment. It relates to a subject that one of our \ndistinguished Members of the House of Representatives, Congressman \nSkelton, sent. He actually brought this up as a freestanding issue in \nthe House of Representatives. It was considered by the House and \nadopted. So it is now, presumably, before the Senate as a freestanding \nitem. But it would be my desire, subject to the viewpoints of my \ncolleague, Senator Levin, that it be incorporated in this bill, \nidentical to what Congressman Skelton wishes to do.\n  The essence of it is as follows: The National Defense University and \nthe Joint Forces Staff College do an extraordinary job of preparing our \nmilitary and, indeed, a number of civilian personnel for greater \nresponsibility. The Joint Advanced Warfighting School, which is part of \nthe Joint Forces Staff College, has created and is now presenting a \ncourse on Joint Campaign Planning and Strategy.\n  The first class graduated recently, and it was composed of an \nimpressive group of global war on terrorism officers, in other words, \nofficers who are devoting, at this time, their professional attention \nto this subject.\n  The amendment authorizes the award of a Master of Science degree, and \nit is one I think is deserving of the consideration of this body and, \nhopefully, adoption by this body. It is an amendment which I will now \nsend to the desk for immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Virginia [Mr. Warner], for himself and Mr. \n     Levin, proposes an amendment numbered 1315.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To authorize the National Defense University to award the \n  degree of Master of Science in Joint Campaign Planning and Strategy)\n\n       At the end of subtitle H of title V, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 596. AUTHORITY FOR NATIONAL DEFENSE UNIVERSITY AWARD OF \n                   DEGREE OF MASTER OF SCIENCE IN JOINT CAMPAIGN \n                   PLANNING AND STRATEGY.\n\n       (a) Joint Forces Staff College Program.--Section 2163 of \n     title 10, United States Code, is amended to read as follows:\n\n     ``Sec. 2163. National Defense University: master of science \n       degrees\n\n       ``(a) Authority to Award Specified Degrees.--The President \n     of the National Defense University, upon the recommendation \n     of the faculty of the respective college or other school \n     within the University, may confer the master of science \n     degrees specified in subsection (b).\n       ``(b) Authorized Degrees.--The following degrees may be \n     awarded under subsection (a):\n       ``(1) Master of science in national security strategy.--The \n     degree of master of science in national security strategy, to \n     graduates of the University who fulfill the requirements of \n     the program of the National War College.\n       ``(2) Master of science in national resource strategy.--The \n     degree of master of science in national resource strategy, to \n     graduates of the University who fulfill the requirements of \n     the program of the Industrial College of the Armed Forces.\n       ``(3) Master of science in joint campaign planning and \n     strategy.--The degree of master of science in joint campaign \n     planning and strategy, to graduates of the University who \n     fulfill the requirements of the program of the Joint Advanced \n     Warfighting School at the Joint Forces Staff College.\n       ``(c) Regulations.--The authority provided by this section \n     shall be exercised under regulations prescribed by the \n     Secretary of Defense.''.\n       (b) Clerical Amendment.--The item relating to section 2163 \n     in the table of sections at the beginning of chapter 108 of \n     such title is amended to read as follows:\n\n``2163. National Defense University: master of science degrees.''.\n\n       (c) Effective Date.--Paragraph (3) of section 2163(b) of \n     title 10, United States Code, as amended by subsection (a), \n     shall take effect for degrees awarded after May 2005.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. In brief, the amendment would amend section 2163 of title \n10, United States Code, to authorize the president of the National \nDefense University to confer the degree of Master of Science in Joint \nCampaign Planning and Strategy on those students attending the Joint \nAdvanced Warfighting School at the Joint Forces Staff College who \npursued the particular course.\n  The Joint Forces Staff College initiated a new advanced course of \nstudy in Joint Campaign Planning and Strategy in 2004. The program \nreceived its full accreditation from the Department of Education in the \nfall of 2004. As I said, the first class graduated in 2005. So the \nlegislation would authorize conferral of the degree retroactively to \nthat class of 2005 and prospectively to the future classes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, the pending amendment which I sent to the \ndesk, I ask unanimous consent that it be laid aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama is recognized.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I rise to discuss the bill before us, S. \n1042, the National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 2006. I am \npleased to serve under Chairman Warner and Ranking Member Levin on the \nArmed Services Committee. It is a particular thrill for me to have that \nhonor.\n  I am privileged to serve as the chairman of the Subcommittee on \nStrategic Forces. In that capacity, I have worked hard, our staff has \nworked hard, in cooperation particularly with my ranking member on the \nStrategic Forces Subcommittee, Senator Nelson of Florida. Our efforts \nhave been to contribute our part to the bill that is now before the \nSenate.\n  Under the leadership of Senator Warner, we believe we have achieved \nour goal of bringing forward legislation that serves the national \nsecurity needs of this country, protects the interests of our fighting \nmen and women, and does so while making deliberate and judicious use of \nprecious taxpayer dollars. We simply have to be frugal. There is no \nmoney to waste.\n  The Strategic Forces Subcommittee exercised oversight for the \nDepartment of Defense budget request for missile defense, strategic \nforces, space, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance, and \nintelligence support activities. The DOD budget request in these areas \nincluded $9.5 billion in procurement, $27.2 billion in research and \ndevelopment, and $3 billion in operations and maintenance. The \nadministration budget request also included $14.8 billion for the \nDepartment of Energy nuclear weapons and environmental management \nprograms and activities.\n  The bill reflects a net increase of $40 million in procurement, a net \ndecrease of $16 million in research and development, and a net increase \nof $11 million in the amount requested in operations and maintenance, \nfor a total net increase of $35 million--not a lot of increase. It also \nreflects the requested level of funding for the Department of Energy \nprograms and activities.\n  The bill fully funds the request for missile defense, but it does so \nin a way that reduces some funding for longer term developmental \nefforts to support near-term capabilities and enhanced testing. \nOverall, $8.8 billion was requested for missile defense activities, of \nwhich $7.8 billion is for the Missile Defense Agency.\n  Significant funding actions in the markup include an increase of $100 \nmillion for the ground-based midcourse defense system to enhance ground \nand flight testing, and an increase of $75 million for the Aegis BMD \nsystem to improve system performance and to accelerate SM-3 missile \ndelivery in 2007. Both of these systems, while continuing to undergo \ndevelopment and testing, are available today for use in an emergency to \nprotect the United States and its allies against limited ballistic \nmissile attacks. By focusing\n\n[[Page S8543]]\n\non near-term capabilities, this bill sends a strong message to \npotential adversaries that the United States is no longer vulnerable to \nballistic missile threats or coercion.\n  The bill makes significant adjustments to the President's budget \nrequest for military satellite programs. The bill recommends a $200 \nmillion reduction in the Transformational Satellite Program, TSAT, to \nput the program on a healthier developmental track; an increase of $100 \nmillion for the Advanced Extremely High Frequency Satellite Program, \nAEHF, to begin procuring a fourth AEHF communications satellite; and a \nreduction, however, of $75 million for the Space Radar Program due to \ninsufficient programmatic and cost definition. We expect this Space \nRadar Program to be successful as time goes by.\n  Related to the Department of Energy, the bill includes $14.8 billion \nfor nuclear weapons and environmental management programs for the \nfiscal year 2006, the amount requested by the administration. Of this \namount, $6.6 billion is for the National Nuclear Security \nAdministration nuclear weapons activities.\n  The bill includes a few modest increases to help reduce deferred \nmaintenance and to support the infrastructure of the nuclear weapons \ncomplex. The bill also increases funding for security at Department of \nEnergy sites. This is a reflection of the need to enhance security at \nthese sites in response to the potential threats that exist after 9/11.\n  The bill also includes authorization at the budget request to \ncontinue the feasibility study of the robust nuclear earth penetrator, \nRNEP. This bill does not, however, provide any funding for Air Force \nactivities to integrate RNEP into a delivery platform. The committee \nhas honored the balance struck 2 years ago when Congress enacted a \nprovision prohibiting the administration from proceeding beyond a \nfeasibility study of RNEP without explicit authorization from Congress. \nNo such authorization was sought by the administration this year, and \nnone is provided. The $4.0 million provided for RNEP is for \ncontinuation of the feasibility study and nothing beyond that.\n  The bill also funds the Department of Energy Environmental Management \nProgram at $6.6 billion. The Environmental Management Program is \naddressing the environmental cleanup needs at Department of Energy \nnuclear sites. This environmental contamination is an unfortunate and \nhighly expensive legacy of our victory in the Cold War. Our bill \nprovides appropriate funding to continue this cleanup program.\n  Again, I thank the ranking member on the Strategic Forces \nSubcommittee, Senator Nelson, for working with me on this legislation \nand throughout our hearings and in the markup leading up to this point. \nThe Armed Services Committee takes a lot of time and deliberation to \nproduce this bill. It is the product of a lot of hard work, a lot of \nhard choices, and a fair amount of compromise. I hope my colleagues \nwill support the bill that our committee has produced. I again express \nmy appreciation to Chairman Warner for his leadership, for the fact \nthat we have been able to move this bill promptly this year. I think \nour Nation is going to benefit from many of the important provisions \nthat are contained in it.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I wish to thank my longtime friend and \ncommittee member, the Senator from Alabama. We have worked together. We \nhave traveled together. We have been to Iraq together. We went down \nlast Friday to Guantanamo to inspect the detention facilities down \nthere. He has always responded to the request of the chairman, pack a \nbag, will travel, take on any mission. I thank him.\n  I also thank him for working as subcommittee chairman and getting the \nwork done in his subcommittee.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I thank the chairman. There is no \ncommittee on which I serve that is more of a pleasure to work and has a \nbetter bipartisan spirit. Chairman Warner and Senator Levin deserve \nmuch credit for that. We get to make a number of trips. Nobody makes \nmore trips than Chairman Warner, but it is a thrill to visit our fine \nmen and women in uniform in the highly dangerous areas that we many \ntimes get to visit.\n  It is an honor to be on the committee whose responsibility it is to \nsupport them.\n  I thank the chairman.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank my colleague.\n  Mr. President, we are working with the other side. I think we have a \npackage of cleared amendments, but maybe the Senator wishes to address \nsomething else.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1315\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the amendment which was just offered has \nnow been cleared on this side relative to the degree at the university. \nWe support it. Senator Nelson is our ranking member. We wanted to \ndoublecheck with him.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on amendment No. 1315?\n  If not, the question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 1315) was agreed to.\n  Mr. WARNER. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to add Senator Jon \nKyl as a cosponsor of amendment No. 1314.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n    Amendments Nos. 1318, 1319, 1320, 1321, 1322, and 1323, En Bloc\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, with the attention of my distinguished \nranking member, we ask that a series of amendments, which I will now \nsend to the desk, which have been cleared, be considered, and I ask \nthat any statements relating to the individual amendments be printed \nthe Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Virginia [Mr. Warner] proposes amendments \n     numbered 1318, 1319, 1320, 1321, 1322 and 1323 en bloc.\n\n  Mr. WARNER.

CHEMICAL DEMILITARIZATION FACILITIES.\n\n       (a) Authority To Use Research, Development, Test, and \n     Evaluation Funds To Construct Facilities.--The Secretary of \n     Defense may, using amounts authorized to be appropriated by \n     section 201(4) for research, development, test, and \n     evaluation, Defense-wide and available for chemical weapons \n     demilitarization activities under the Assembled Chemical \n     Weapons Alternatives program, carry out construction \n     projects, or portions of construction projects, for \n     facilities necessary to support chemical demilitarization \n     operations at each of the following:\n       (1) Pueblo Army Depot, Colorado.\n       (2) Blue Grass Army Depot, Kentucky.\n       (b) Scope of Authority.--The authority in subsection (a) to \n     carry out a construction project for facilities includes \n     authority to carry out planning and design and the \n     acquisition of land for the construction or improvement of \n     such facilities.\n       (c) Limitation on Amount of Funds.--The amount of funds \n     that may be utilized under the authority in subsection (a) \n     may not exceed $51,000,000.\n       (d) Duration of Authority.--A construction project, or \n     portion of a construction project, may not be commenced under \n     the authority in subsection (a) after September 30, 2006.\n       (e) Notice and Wait.--The Secretary may not carry out a \n     construction project, or portion of a construction project, \n     under the authority in subsection (a) until the end of the \n     21-day period beginning on the date on which the Secretary \n     notifies the congressional defense committees of the intent \n     to carry out such project.\n\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I rise today to speak with respect to \namendment No. 1326. to the Defense authorization bill, which was \nadopted by the Senate today, that directly affects the citizens of \nPueblo, CO, and the cleanup of those chemical weapons stockpiled at the \nPueblo Chemical Depot. I thank my colleagues, Senator Warner and \nSenator Levin, and their staffs, for their help on this measure. I \nthank, too, Senators McConnell and Bunning and my colleague from the \ngreat State of Colorado, Senator Allard. We have maintained an \nimportant alliance on this issue, and I appreciate their efforts.\n  This bipartisan Pueblo amendment, which I am proud to cosponsor, \nmoves $51 million from the Department of Defense's Research, \nDevelopment, Test and Evaluation budget to the Military Construction \nbudget for the Assembled Chemical Weapons Alternatives program. This \nprogram, known as ACWA, is the authority for chemical weapons \ndestruction at both the Pueblo Chemical Depot and the Bluegrass, KY, \nsite.\n  More than three-quarters of a million chemical weapons--mustard agent \nrounds--are stockpiled in the Pueblo Chemical Depot. These weapons are \na threat to the security of the surrounding community. The United \nStates has sworn to safely destroy these weapons before the 2012 \ndeadline established by the Chemical Weapons Convention. Progress has \nbeen slow in the past but has recently been moving forward.\n  Unfortunately, under the President's budget request, there was no \nmoney allotted for Military Construction at the Pueblo Chemical Depot \nfacility for fiscal year 2006. The program was on hold at the time the \nbudget was released. But now that the dedication and hard\n\n[[Page S8545]]\n\nwork of the citizens of Pueblo, along with a strong bipartisan effort \nhere in DC, has resulted in forward progress, money needs to be \ndesignated specifically for MilCon so the Department of Defense can \nspend money for ACWA construction projects. Without money being \ndesignated for MilCon, the progress at Pueblo Chemical Depot could be \nhalted once again.\n  The amendment adopted today was cosponsored by the Senators from \nColorado and Kentucky. It ensures that money will be available to be \nspent in fiscal year 2006 for construction, planning, and design work \nat both the Pueblo Chemical Depot in Colorado and at the Bluegrass, KY, \nsite.\n  This amendment is an essential step forward for the destruction of \nthe tons of chemical weapons still stored at the Pueblo Chemical Depot. \nI hope this is another indication that the Pentagon recognizes the \nurgency this situation demands--an urgency the people of Pueblo and all \nof Colorado are right to expect.\n  I am proud to be part of such a strong coalition of concerned \ncitizens and Senators from the communities impacted by these terrible \nweapons. But even though I am cautiously optimistic that today's \namendment signals positive action in the future, there is still much \nwork to do. I hope that this upcoming work will go forward in a similar \nmanner: with good communications, with utmost concern for the safety of \nthe citizens of Pueblo and Bluegrass, and with our eye always fixed on \nthe goal of the safe destruction of these chemical weapons by 2012.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I urge the Senate to adopt this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate?\n  If not, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 1324) was agreed to.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1325\n\n  Mr. LEVIN.

Mr. President, today I rise to honor one of the pillars of \nmy hometown, Searchlight, NV--Mrs. Verlie Doing. Saturday, July 23, \n2005 will be designated Verlie Doing Day, and it could not go to a more \ndeserving or influential person.\n  Searchlight has never been the same since Verlie came to town in 1968 \nto help her late husband run Sandy's Casino. They built the Searchlight \nNugget, which Verlie still owns. Verlie is a proud Texan, but she \nquickly adopted the citizens of Searchlight and put down lasting roots \nin the community that will benefit many generations to come.\n  For years, Searchlight did not have a senior center; so Verlie \ndonated a building for the Searchlight Senior Citizen's Center. \nSearchlight did not have a church, so Verlie helped found the \nSearchlight Community Church, where she plays the organ every Sunday. \nSearchlight did not have a modern\n\n[[Page S8546]]\n\npark so Verlie established Searchlight Park, equipped with a new \nplayground, grills, and picnic areas for the town.\n  These are a few of many visible contributions that Verlie made to the \ncommunity, but Verlie's most important contributions exist outside of \nthe public eye. She never asks for recognition and she does not draw \nattention to her actions, but her charity touches every person in need.\n  ``She's always doing something for someone,'' said long time friend \nMarion Young. ``Verlie has a kindness for everyone and she'll never let \nsomeone go down the road hungry.''\n  Much of Verlie's philanthropy occurs behind the scenes, but her \nimpact is felt throughout Searchlight. Each year, Verlie furnishes ice \ncream for ice cream socials. She has always supported the local police \ndepartment, allowing the Searchlight Police to have Police Officer's \nNight Out. Verlie also provides a steak dinner annually for our \nfirefighters and medical workers. Local children at the elementary \nschool are treated to hamburgers at the Nugget for good grades. Anyone \nin need always comes to Verlie first, and she never turns them away.\n  Verlie means a lot to me personally. After my father's passing, \nVerlie was a close friend to my mother. She would take her to Las Vegas \nto shop, and looked after her because my mother lived in Searchlight \nalone. Her thoughtfulness and compassion helped my mother make it \nthrough tough and trying times. I will never be able to repay her \nkindness to my mother.\n  Verlie understands the importance of community. Her philanthropy--\nboth visible and invisible--has made Searchlight the town it is today. \nVerlie Doing has touched every life in Searchlight, including my own, \nand I know that she has changed each life for the better.\n  Congratulations, Verlie. I am proud to honor an authentic Searchlight \nhero.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/20/senate-section/article/S8546-1", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8546-S8547]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICE ACT\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I want to take a few minutes to explain \nmy recent action related to S. 1418, the Wired for Health Care Quality \nAct. Today, with great reluctance, I asked Leader Frist to consult with \nus prior to any action related to consideration of this bill, which the \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee reported by voice vote \nthis morning.\n  The Wired for Health Care Quality Act would promote the use of \nelectronic health records by adopting standards for the electronic \nexchange of information, offer incentives for health care providers to \ncreate networks for secure exchange of electronic health information, \nand ensure quality measurement and reporting of provider performance \nunder the Public Health Service Act.\n  I fully support linking the adoption of health information technology \nto quality improvements in our health care system. They go hand in \nhand. Which is why Senator Baucus and I decided to introduce our \nMedicare Value Purchasing Act, S. 1356, jointly with Senators Enzi and \nKennedy's Better Healthcare Through Information Technology Act, S. \n1355. The thought behind a dual introduction was to enforce the message \nthat Medicare can drive quality improvement through payment incentives, \nand that the adoption of information technology is also a necessary \nstep not only to facilitate the reporting of quality measures but also \nto increase efficiency and quality in our health care delivery system.\n  Our bill creates quality payments under Medicare for all provider \ngroups. A considerable amount of time was devoted towards ensuring that \nthe development of quality measures and the implementation of value-\nbased purchasing programs under Medicare were properly vetted with \nprovider groups, beneficiary groups, and the administration. We did not \nwant to reinvent the wheel; we wanted to build on the initiatives that \nalready exist to develop and adopt quality measures. And because \nMedicare is the single largest purchaser of health care in the Nation, \nadopting quality payments in Medicare influences the level of quality \nin all of health care. We have seen time and time again how when \nMedicare leads, the other public and private purchasers follow.\n  Which is why I am troubled, that as currently drafted, S. 1418 would \nrequire the development of quality measures under the Public Health \nService Act. It is hard to comprehend how the quality measurement \nsystem in this bill intersects with the quality measurement system \ndeveloped in the Medicare Value Purchasing Act. The last thing we want \nto do is end up with two different quality measurement systems. This \nhas the potential to derail both proposals, effectively terminating or \nat least postponing the common goal of improving the quality of patient \ncare.\n  The Wired for Health Care Quality Act would also direct the Secretary \nof Health and Human Services, along with the Secretary of Defense, the \nSecretary of Veterans Affairs, and other heads of relevant Federal \nagencies to jointly develop a quality measurement system. The \ncoordination among all these Federal agencies alone is a massive \nproject that could indefinitely stall the development and \nimplementation of appropriate quality measures or result in one that \nfalls to the lowest common denominator. That could actually set back \nquality efforts.\n  I welcome the opportunity to work with the sponsors of S. 1418, \nSenators Enzi, Kennedy, Frist, and Clinton along with members of the \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee on this matter. I had \nhoped to accomplish that before the bill was introduced on the floor. \nUnfortunately, that did not happen. I do not take actions such as these \nlightly. But I am deeply troubled that, as currently drafted, the Wired \nfor Health Care Quality Act could end up unintentionally delaying our \ncommon goal of improving the quality of health care for all Americans.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise to address possible floor \nconsideration of S. 1418, a bill to amend the Public Health Service Act \nto enhance the adoption of a nationwide interoperable health \ninformation technology system and to improve the quality and reduce the \ncosts of health care in the United States.\n  Senator Grassley and I have been working since January with Senators \nEnzi and Kennedy on issues of quality and health information \ntechnology. Together, we introduced two bills on June 30--one that \ndeals with Medicare quality, and another to enhance quality through the \nwidespread adoption of health IT. The latter is S. 1356, the Medicare \nValue Purchasing Act of 2005, which develops a system of quality \nmeasurement and implements pay-for-performance in Medicare.\n  In drafting these two bills, we worked hard to craft language that \nwas complementary rather than contradictory. Ultimately, we viewed \nthese two pieces of policy as working together to build a comprehensive \nand workable health care quality system.\n  S. 1418 potentially disrupts the work we have done thus far, by \nincluding language that will force the duplication of quality \nmeasurement systems. It also raises questions about the jurisdictional \nreach of the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Medicare is the dominant payer in health care, with annual spending \nexceeding $300 billion. Furthermore, it is Medicare's payment systems \nthat are often adopted by private insurance groups. Private payers use \nthe Medicare physician fee schedule for their own book of business, and \nwe would expect these same insurers to follow Medicare's lead on pay-\nfor-quality.\n  I appreciate the process that Senators Enzi and Kennedy have \nundertaken with us over the last several months. And I appreciate the \nmajority leader's desire to move important health IT legislation. \nCongressional action on this issue is long overdue. But until common \nground can be reached on a feasible system of measuring quality, I must \nreluctantly object to moving forward with S. 1418. I believe that the \nprocess outlined in this bill for the development of quality measures \nmay well be unworkable and that it will raise deep concerns for \nhospitals, physicians, and other providers.\n  I also believe that the language on the development of quality \nmeasures in this bill ought to be designed for Public Health Service \nAct programs and explicitly applicable to these programs, not to \nMedicare or Medicaid.\n  I hope that our colleague, Senators Enzi, Kennedy, Frist, and \nClinton, will work with us to craft a bill that is appropriate for \nprograms under the\n\n[[Page S8547]]\n\nPHSA and that complements the Medicare Value Purchasing Act of 2005. \nUltimately, I believe that we have the same goals in mind. If we can \ncome to an agreement now, we can continue moving forward with these \nimportant policies that can change the shape, quality, and ultimately \nthe cost and benefit of our health care system.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/20/senate-section/article/S8547-1", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8547-S8548]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         METHAMPHETAMINE CRISIS\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, to draw attention to the meth crisis facing \nOregon and a growing number of States around the country, I stand once \nagain on the floor of the Senate introducing two more newspaper \narticles into the Record. Both articles highlight the plight of the \nmost vulnerable victims of the meth crisis: America's children.\n  As the first piece, ``The Little Round Faces of Meth,'' from The \nOregonian points out, ``The drug lurks behind nearly all of Oregon's \nmost shocking and horrifying cases of child abuse and neglect.''\n  The second article, ``A Drug Scourge Creates Its Own Form of Orphan'' \nwas printed in the New York Times a little over a week ago. As the \narticle explains, ``In Oregon, 5,515 children entered the [foster care] \nsystem in 2004, up from 4,946 the year before, and officials there say \nthe caseload would be half what it is now if the methamphetamine \nproblem suddenly went away.''\n  The burden that meth is placing on Oregon communities is enormous. \nAnd we have to do something about it. Because even if we get the \nepidemic under control right now, we are going to be dealing with the \nconsequences for years to come. And one of these consequences will be \ntaking care of the child victims of meth. As Jay Wurscher, director of \nalcohol and drug services for the children and families division of the \nOregon Department of Human Services explains in the New York Times \narticle, ``In every way, shape and form, this is the worst drug ever \nfor child welfare.''\n  We cannot afford to wait any longer. Each day we fail to act, another \nchild is neglected, abused or even worse--dead--as a result of meth. I \nurge Congress to pass and the President to sign the Combat Meth bill, a \nsolid step that will help us fight this terrible drug in Oregon and \naround the country. Among other things, the bill provides $5 million in \ngrants to help kids affected by meth.\n  Mr. President, I ask for unanimous consent that the full text of The \nOregonian article and the New York Times article be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                   [From The Oregonian, July 9, 2005]\n\n                     The Little Round Faces of Meth\n\n       You will have to imagine the face of a tearful 16-month-boy \n     found toddling alone last Wednesday morning alongside River \n     Road North in Keizer. You usually only see the faces of the \n     child victims of methamphetamine, or learn their names, when \n     they die.\n       The familiar faces of meth are the mug shots of the drug \n     users and dealers spilling out of Oregon's jails and prisons. \n     You have seen them so often in newspapers and on television \n     newscasts that they have all but blurred into one gaunt face \n     with hollow eyes, straggly hair, jack-o-lantern smiles.\n       But when a toddler winds up standing alone in a T-shirt and \n     soiled diaper along a busy Oregon commuter street, while his \n     parents apparently sleep off another night of drugs, it is \n     time to realize the most awful thing about meth is not the \n     rotten teeth it produces but the rotten parents.\n       That little boy in the diaper standing along River Road is \n     among thousands of Oregon children who have suffered neglect \n     and abuse linked to methamphetamine. State authorities say at \n     least half of the investigated cases of abuse and neglect in \n     Oregon trace back to the drug found in the apartment of the \n     little boy's parents, Kurt Michael Quinn, 42, and Ivory \n     Angela Williams, 26. The couple was arrested on multiple \n     charges, including child neglect and possession of a \n     controlled substance.\n       Of, course, meth was there. The drug lurks behind nearly \n     all of Oregon's most shocking and horrifying cases of child \n     abuse and neglect:\n       The parents who nailed a sheet of plywood over their baby's \n     crib so that he would not escape while they were on a meth \n     high.\n       The 10-month-old baby who crawled out of a two-story window \n     and fell to the ground while his mother was strung out on \n     meth.\n       The infant who died of an overdose from breast-feeding from \n     a mother addicted to meth.\n       There was meth in the family of Ashton Parris, who died at \n     15 months from severe head injuries after the state returned \n     him to his birth mother.\n       Jewell Newland was only 3-months-old when her meth-laden \n     father, James Dean Newland, picked her up and then fell on \n     her--with what the police affidavit called a ``whoof.'' Baby \n     Jewell was bleeding from the mouth, but no one took her to \n     the hospital for 14 long hours. She died of her injuries.\n       These are the little round faces of meth. They are the \n     faces that demand the additional police, the tougher prison \n     sentences, the expanded drug treatment and the hassle of a \n     few extra minutes at the pharmacy waiting for the cold \n     medicines that drug cookers turn into meth.\n       Yet, some still are not enlisted in this fight. Some oppose \n     the tough international restrictions needed to control the \n     ingredients in meth. Others want to weaken restrictions on \n     cold medicines.\n       If only they all had a chance to pass River Road the other \n     morning. If only they could see the face of that little boy \n     toddling along in his T-shirt and diaper.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                [From the New York Times, July 11, 2005]\n\n             A Drug Scourge Creates Its Own Form of Orphan\n\n                           (By Kate Zernike)\n\n       The Laura Dester Shelter here is licensed for 38 children, \n     but at times in the past months it has housed 90, forcing \n     siblings to double up in cots. It is supposed to be a 24-hour \n     stopping point between troubled homes and foster care, but \n     with foster homes backed up, children are staying weeks and \n     sometimes months, making it more orphanage than shelter, a \n     cacophony of need.\n       In a rocking chair, a volunteer uses one arm to feed a 5-\n     day-old boy taken from his mother at birth, the other to \n     placate a toddler who is wandering from adult to adult \n     begging, ``Bottle?'' A 3-year-old who arrived at dawn shrieks \n     as salve is rubbed on her to kill the lice.\n       This is a problem methamphetamine has made, a scene \n     increasingly familiar across the country as the number of \n     foster children rises rapidly in states hit hard by the drug, \n     the overwhelming number of them, officials say, taken from \n     parents who were using or making methamphetamine.\n       Oklahoma last year became the first state to ban over-the-\n     counter sales of cold medicines that contain the crucial \n     ingredient needed to make methamphetamine. Even so, the \n     number of foster children in the state is up 16 percent from \n     a year ago. In Kentucky, the numbers are up 12 percent, or \n     753 children, with only seven new homes.\n       In Oregon, 5,515 children entered the system in 2004, up \n     from 4,946 the year before, and officials there say the \n     caseload would be half what it is now if the methamphetamine \n     problem suddenly went away. In Tennessee, state officials \n     recently began tracking the number of children brought in \n     because of methamphetamine, and it rose to 700 in 2004 from \n     400 in 2003.\n       While foster populations in cities rose because of so-\n     called crack babies in the 1990's, methamphetamine is mostly \n     a rural phenomenon, and it has created virtual orphans in \n     areas without social service networks to support them. In \n     Muskogee, an hour's drive south of here, a group is raising \n     money to convert an old church into a shelter because there \n     are none.\n       Officials say methamphetamine's particularly potent and \n     destructive nature and the way it is often made in the home \n     conspire against child welfare unlike any other drug.\n       It has become harder to attract and keep foster parents \n     because the children of methamphetamine arrive with so many \n     behavioral problems; they may not get into their beds at \n     night because they are so used to sleeping on the floor, and \n     they may resist toilet training because they are used to \n     wearing dirty diapers.\n       ``We used to think, you give these kids a good home and \n     lots of love and they'll be O.K.,'' said Esther Rider-Salem, \n     the manager of Child Protective Services programs for the \n     State of Oklahoma. ``This goes above and beyond anything \n     we've seen.''\n       Although the methamphetamine problem has existed for years, \n     state officials here and elsewhere say the number of foster \n     children created by it has spiked in the last year or two as \n     growing awareness of the drug problem has prompted more lab \n     raids, and more citizens reporting suspected methamphetamine \n     use.\n       Nationwide, the Drug Enforcement Administration says that \n     over the last five years 15,000 children were found at \n     laboratories where methamphetamine was made. But that number \n     vastly understates the problem, federal officials say, \n     because it does not include children whose parents use \n     methamphetamine but do not make it and because it relies on \n     state reporting, which can be spotty.\n       On July 5, the National Association of Counties reported \n     that 40 percent of child welfare officials surveyed \n     nationwide said that methamphetamine had caused a rise in the \n     number of children removed from homes.\n       The percentage was far higher on the West Coast and in \n     rural areas, where the drug has hit the hardest. Seventy-one \n     percent of counties in California, 70 percent in Colorado and \n     69 percent in Minnesota reported an increase in the number of \n     children removed from homes because of methamphetamine.\n       In North Dakota, 54 percent of counties reported a \n     methamphetamine-related increase. At what was billed as a \n     ``community meeting on meth'' in Fargo this year, the state \n     attorney general, Wayne Stenehjem, exhorted the hundreds of \n     people packed into an auditorium: ``People always ask, what \n     can they do\n\n[[Page S8548]]\n\n     about meth? The most important thing you can do is become a \n     foster parent, because we're just seeing so many kids being \n     taken from these homes. ``\n       Officials also say methamphetamine has made it harder to \n     reunite families once the child is taken; 59 percent of those \n     surveyed in the national counties study agreed.\n       The federal Adoption and Safe Families Act of 1997, enacted \n     as babies born to crack users were crowding foster care, \n     requires states to begin terminating parental rights if a \n     child has spent 15 out of 22 months in foster care. It was \n     intended to keep children from languishing in foster homes. \n     But rehabilitation for methamphetamine often takes longer \n     than other drugs, and parents fall behind the clock.\n       ``Termination of parental rights almost becomes the regular \n     piece,'' said Jerry Foxhoven, the administrator of the Child \n     Advocacy Board in Iowa. ``We know pretty early that these \n     families are not going to get back together.''\n       The drug--smoked, ingested or injected--is synthetic, cheap \n     and easy to make in home labs using pseudoephedrine, the \n     ingredient in many cold medicines, and common fertilizers, \n     solvents or battery acid. The materials are dangerous, and \n     highly explosive.\n       ``Meth adds this element of parents who think they are \n     rocket scientists and want to cook these chemicals in the \n     kitchen,'' said Yvonne Glick, a lawyer at the Department of \n     Human Services in Oklahoma who works with the state's \n     alliance for drug endangered children. ``They're on the couch \n     watching their stuff cook, and the kids are on the floor \n     watching them.''\n       The drug also produces a tremendous and long-lasting rush, \n     with intense sexual desire. As a result of the sexual binges, \n     some child welfare officials say, methamphetamine users \n     are having more children. More young children are entering \n     the foster system, often as newborns suffering from the \n     effects of their mother's use of the drug.\n       Oklahoma was recently chosen to participate in a federally \n     financed study of the effects of methamphetamine on babies \n     born to addicted mothers. Doctors who work with them have \n     already found that the babies are born with trouble suckling \n     or bonding with their parents, who often abuse the children \n     out of frustration.\n       But the biggest problem, doctors who work with children \n     say, is not with those born under the effects of the drug but \n     with the children who grow up surrounded by methamphetamine \n     and its attendant problems. Because users are so highly \n     sexualized, the children are often exposed to pornography or \n     sexual abuse, or watch their mothers prostitute themselves, \n     the welfare workers say.\n       The drug binges tend to last for days or weeks, and the \n     crash is tremendous, leaving children unwashed and unfed for \n     days as parents fall into a deep sleep.\n       ``The oldest kid becomes the parent, and the oldest kid may \n     be 4 or 5 years old,'' said Dr. Mike Stratton, a pediatrician \n     in Muskogee, Okla., who is involved with a state program for \n     children exposed to drugs that is run in conjunction with the \n     Justice Department. ``The parents are basically worthless, \n     when they're not stoned they're sleeping it off, when they're \n     not sleeping they don't eat, and it's not in their regimen to \n     feed the kids.''\n       Ms. Glick recalls a group of siblings found eating plaster \n     at a home filled with methamphetamine. The oldest, age 6, was \n     given a hamburger when they arrived at the Laura Dester \n     Shelter; he broke it apart and handed out bits to his \n     siblings before taking a bite himself.\n       Jay Wurscher, director of alcohol and drug services for the \n     children and families division of the Oregon Department of \n     Human Services, said, ``In every way, shape and form, this is \n     the worst drug ever for child welfare.''\n       Child welfare workers say they used to remove children as a \n     last resort, first trying to help with services in the home.\n       But everywhere there are reminders of the dangers of \n     leaving children in homes with methamphetamine. In one recent \n     case here, an 18-month-old child fell onto a heating unit on \n     the floor and died while the parents slept; a 3-year-old \n     sibling had tried to rouse them.\n       The police who raid methamphetamine labs say they try to \n     leave the children with relatives, particularly in rural \n     areas, where there are few other options.\n       But it has become increasingly clear, they say, that often \n     the relatives, too, are cooking or using methamphetamine. And \n     because the problem has hit areas where there are so few \n     shelters, children are often placed far from their parents. \n     Caseworkers have to drive children long distances to where \n     parents are living or imprisoned for visits; Leslie Beyer, a \n     caseworker at Laura Dester, logged 3,600 miles on her car one \n     month.\n       The drain of the cases is forcing foster families to leave \n     the system, or caseworkers to quit. In some counties in \n     Oklahoma, Ms. Rider-Salem said, half the caseworkers now \n     leave within two years.\n       After the ban on over-the-counter pseudoephedrine was \n     enacted--a law other states are trying to emulate--the number \n     of children taken out of methamphetamine labs and into the \n     foster care system in Oklahoma declined by about 15 percent, \n     Ms. Glick said. But she said the number of children found not \n     in the labs but with parents who were using the drug had more \n     than compensated for any decline.\n       The state's only other children's shelter, in Oklahoma \n     City, was so crowded recently that the fire marshal \n     threatened to shut it down, forcing the state to send \n     children to foster families in far-flung counties.\n       At Laura Dester, three new children arrived on one recent \n     morning, the 3-year-old being treated for lice and two \n     siblings, found playing in an abandoned house while their \n     mother was passed out at home. The girl now wanders with a \n     plastic bag over her hair to keep the lice salve from \n     leaking. She hugs her little brother, then grabs a plastic \n     toy phone out of his hand, leaving him wailing.\n       ``Who's on the phone?'' asks Kay Saunders, the assistant \n     director at the shelter, gently trying to intervene. ``My \n     mom,'' the girl says, then turns to her little brother. \n     ``It's ringing!''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/20/senate-section/article/S8548-1", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8548]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n              Tribute to Private First Class Eric P. Woods\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise today to salute an extraordinary \nnative Iowan who has fallen in service to his country in support of \nOperation Iraqi Freedom. PFC Eric P. Woods, of the 2nd Squadron, 3rd \nArmored Cavalry Regiment, died on the 9th day of July, 2005, in Tal \nAfar, Iraq, due to injuries sustained when an explosive device \ndetonated under his vehicle. Woods, a combat medic was killed en route \nto aid an injured soldier. My prayers go out to his wife Jamie, his 3-\nyear-old son Eric Scott, his parents Charles and Janis Woods, and his \nmany other friends and family.\n  Eric Woods grew up in Urbandale, IA, and was an active member in the \nyouth group at Westchester Evangelical Free Church. At Urbandale High \nSchool he wrestled and played football and baseball before graduating \nin 1997. While attending Iowa State University, he became manager of \nKrause Gentle Company. After a move to Omaha, Eric became a medic in \nthe U.S. Army.\n  Private First Class Woods was a truly thoughtful soldier, requesting \npackages from home containing soccer balls, candy, and toys to give out \nto the children of Iraq. He will be remembered not only for his \nsacrifice for freedom but also the way in which he served, giving his \nlife on the way to help an injured fellow soldier. Recently, his pastor \nsaid of Eric: ``His motto was to charge, not retreat. He squeezed the \nmost out of life.'' Again my thoughts and prayers are with his family \nand friends. I ask my colleagues in the Senate and all Americans to \nremember with gratitude and admiration this courageous Iowan, PFC Eric \nP. Woods.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/20/senate-section/article/S8548-2", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8548-S8549]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n 50TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF SANITATION AGENCIES\n\n Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the \nachievements of the California Association of Sanitation Agencies, and \nto celebrate the organization's 50th anniversary.\n  CASA has provided the State of California with clean, safe, and \nreliable drinking water since its founding in 1955. Not only has CASA \nworked hard to ensure the well-being of Californians, but it has also \nchampioned a multitude of environmental issues related to clean water \nand water infrastructure that have been vital to California's long-term \neconomic and social stability.\n  I want to recognize CASA's proactive leadership in promoting \npartnerships with a variety of organizations to create a sound public \nhealth and environmental agenda. For the past 50 years CASA has been \nthe voice of the public wastewater agencies and served to assist and \nmonitor a variety of water quality, and related policy issues.\n  CASA has fought hard on behalf of California's sanitation agencies \nand played an active role in numerous legislative struggles. Among \nCASA's legislative achievements include sponsoring legislation that \ngives publicly owned treatment works the authority to levy civil and \nadministrative penalties against industrial dischargers for violations \nof local wastewater ordinances. Additionally, CASA has worked in \npartnership with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to develop \nand implement effective water rules for air toxics, sewer overflows, \nand biosolids management.\n  CASA has acted as a valuable resource by helping its member agencies \nunderstand and comply with varying\n\n[[Page S8549]]\n\nFederal and State water quality standards. CASA also has provided the \nlegal, legislative, and administrative support for the publicly owned \ntreatment work community and helped set the precedent for ensuring \nclean and safe water for all Californians. Over the years, I have come \nto value CASA's insight and suggestions for improving our Nation's \nwater quality.\n  Today I celebrate 50 years of CASA's devoted service and \ncontributions to our Nation, and call upon CASA to continue to lead the \nway in its innovative and cooperative stewardship of our Nation's \ncomplex and growing waterways. Water quality is imperative to the \ndevelopment and welfare of my State and the Nation, and I thank CASA \nfor its continued effort and contributions to the cause.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/20/senate-section/article/S8549-1", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8549]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    HONORING CENTENNIAL HIGH SCHOOL\n\n Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I am pleased to commend \nCentennial High School in Howard County, MD, for its fine performance \non this year's ``It's Academic'' quiz show. After many hours of \npractice and four rounds of competition, Centennial has emerged as the \n2004-2005 Baltimore-area ``It's Academic'' champion.\n  The team of Jeff Amoros, Michael Fasulo, Marin Lolic, and Seth \nManoff, with the assistance of their coach John Cheek, took first place \nout of 81 teams that competed from both public and private schools \nacross the State of Maryland. In its final match, Centennial defeated \ntwo formidable foes in Calvert Hall College High School and Oakland \nMills High School.\n  ``It's Academic'', which is telecast every Saturday morning during \nthe school year on WJZ-TV, channel 13, has been quizzing Maryland \nstudents since 1961. In fact, according to the ``2005 Guinness Book of \nWorld Records'', it is the world's longest running quiz show. For \nMaryland students, ``It's Academic'' provides an opportunity to \nchallenge not only their own knowledge of math, science, literature, \ngovernment and history, but also how their knowledge stacks up against \nstudents around the State. This year, Centennial's team demonstrated \nenormous skill and erudition. Congratulations to Jeff, Michael, Marin, \nSeth and Coach Cheek on a wonderful accomplishment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/20/senate-section/article/S8549-2", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8549]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/20/senate-section/article/S8549-3", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8549]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/20/senate-section/article/S8549-4", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8549]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE RECEIVED DURING ADJOURNMENT\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                          ENROLLED BILL SIGNED\n\n  Under the authority of the order of January 4, 2005, the Secretary of \nthe Senate, on July 19, 2005, received a message from the House of \nRepresentatives announcing that the Speaker has signed the following \nenrolled bill:\n\n       H.R. 3332.

A resolution adopted by the Senate of the \n     Legislature of the State of Michigan relative to the United \n     States Department of Agriculture (USDA) providing assistance, \n     including additional emergency funding, in the effort to \n     mitigate the infestation of the Emerald Ash Borer; to the \n     Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n\n                          Senate Resolution 35\n\n       Whereas, Michigan asked the federal government for $29.5 \n     million to fight the Emerald Ash Borer (EAB) in 2005. On \n     April 19th the USDA sent a letter to Governor Granholm saying \n     there would be no more emergency funding to fight the EAB. \n     The state has received only about $10.9 million from USDA, \n     which is not enough to fund all the current eradication \n     strategies; and\n       Whereas, With alarming swiftness, the Emerald Ash Borer, an \n     aggressive Asian insect, is threatening virtually all of the \n     ask trees in the state of Michigan and surrounding region. In \n     spite of the quarantine in 20 Michigan counties this beetle \n     has killed or damaged approximately 15 million ask tress in \n     the state. Overall, the EAB, an invasive species, is causing \n     similar devastation in the states of Ohio and Indiana, as \n     well as the Canadian province of Ontario, threatening as many \n     of 700 million ash trees in our state and 8 million in North \n     America; and\n       Whereas, Ash trees are very important to the ecology, \n     economy, and environment of our state and the nation. Ash \n     trees are used for many products in several sectors of \n     business. Beyond these factors, the ash trees that grace our \n     communities and neighborhoods are beloved shade trees that \n     contribute enormously to the character and beauty of \n     Michigan, the region, and the nation; and\n       Whereas, Governor Granholm is working to secure continued \n     assistance from the federal government to deal swiftly with \n     this devastating pest. Michigan needs sustained technical and \n     financial assistance to face this emergency. The state has \n     taken decisive actions to address this invasive species, but \n     the magnitude of the problem and the immediacy of the issues \n     make it clear we need the prompt assistance of Congress and \n     the USDA: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate, That we memorialize the Congress of \n     the United States and the United States Department of \n     Agriculture (USDA) to provide assistance, including \n     additional emergency funding, in the effort to mitigate the \n     infestation of the Emerald Ash Borer; and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives, and the members of \n     the Michigan congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-143. A concurrent resolution adopted by the Senate of \n     the Legislature of the State of Louisiana relative to \n     providing the necessary funding to restore Calcasieu Ship \n     Channel in southwest Louisiana in order that the economic, \n     safety, and security concerns may be adequately addressed; to \n     the Committee on Appropriations.\n\n                    Senate Concurrent Resolution 12\n\n       Whereas, the Calcasieu Ship Channel, located in southwest \n     Louisiana, consists of thirty-five inland miles of navigable \n     waterway and thirty miles of offshore channel in the Gulf of \n     Mexico with a project depth of forty feet; and\n       Whereas, two major refineries are completely dependent on \n     the ship channel for crude oil supply, which is significant \n     since these refineries produce four percent of the supply of \n     motor fuels for the United States and have no alternate means \n     of receiving crude oil imports; and\n       Whereas, the Calcasieu Ship Channel also hosts the largest \n     liquified natural gas import terminal in the continental \n     United States, which is undergoing an expansion to double its \n     capacity, and additional receiving terminals have been \n     proposed on the Calcasieu, one of which has been approved by \n     the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC); and\n       Whereas, the Port of Lake Charles handles over fifty \n     million tons of cargo per year, making it the nation's \n     twelfth largest port; and\n       Whereas, with an abundance of environmentally sensitive, \n     potentially combustible cargo combined with a lack of viable \n     alternative transportation modalities suggests that loss of \n     this critical transportation infrastructure would be \n     economically and strategically devastating; and\n       Whereas, for the congressional Fiscal Year 2006, operating \n     and maintenance funding of the Calcasieu Ship Channel was cut \n     disproportionately in comparison to other ports and \n     waterways; and\n       Whereas, the Calcasieu Ship Channel cannot be maintained at \n     its project depth at forty feet of draft under the proposed \n     budget for Fiscal Year 2006 and will be functionally impaired \n     as a result; such consequences to include:\n       (1) Increased risk of a grounding in an environmentally \n     sensitive estuary that is not protected by a levee system.\n       (2) Increase in the number of tanker ship transits of \n     liquefied natural gas and crude oil, which in turn will \n     compound the need for future dredging and maintenance.\n       (3) Increase in shipping costs to users of the ship channel \n     resulting from the mandatory lightening of ships, eventually \n     borne by consumers.\n       (4) Increase in the number of transits of hazardous and \n     combustible cargoes directly increases the number of \n     potential terrorist targets on the channel.\n       (5) Should the channel be closed due to a grounding, four \n     percent of the nation's motor fuel supply will be cut off \n     from the raw materials needed for its production: Therefore, \n     be it\n       Resolved, That the Legislature of Louisiana memorializes \n     the Congress of the United States to provide the necessary \n     funding to the Calcasieu Ship Channel in southwest Louisiana \n     in order that the economic, safety, and security concerns may \n     be adequately addressed. Be it further\n       Resolved, That to adequately address these concerns \n     presented by under-funding, the Calcasieu Ship Channel needs \n     fifteen million dollars in annual maintenance funding and an \n     additional one-time allocation of another fifteen million \n     dollars to restore the channel to its authorized dimensions. \n     Be it further\n       Resolved, That a copy of this Resolution shall be \n     transmitted to the secretary of the United States Senate and \n     the clerk of the United States House of Representatives and \n     to each member of the Louisiana delegation to the United \n     States Congress.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-144. A concurrent resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the Legislature of the State of Louisiana \n     relative to requesting the Base Realignment and Closure \n     Commission to reject the Defense Department's recommendation \n     to close the Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA)\n\n[[Page S8551]]\n\n     site in Slidell; to the Committee on Armed Services.\n\n                    House Concurrent Resolution 167\n\n       Whereas, the Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) site \n     in Slidell has been recommended for closure by the United \n     States Department of Defense; and\n       Whereas, DISA is located on fourteen acres of land owned by \n     the city of Slidell, and Slidell leases the land to the \n     federal government for one dollar per year; and\n       Whereas, DISA, a computer systems agency, employs one \n     hundred fifty-one employees with an annual payroll of $10.8 \n     million; and\n       Whereas, DISA's focus on technology serves as a stimulus \n     for the attraction of high-tech businesses and the \n     development of additional high-paying, professional jobs in \n     the area; and\n       Whereas, the loss of the ten-year-old, multimillion dollar \n     facility would be detrimental to the housing market, economy, \n     and the city of Slidell; and\n       Whereas, DISA effectively provides services that are \n     important to the defense of the nation: Therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Legislature of Louisiana does hereby \n     urge and request the Base Realignment and Closure Commission \n     to maintain the Defense Information Systems Agency location \n     in Slidell as an active military installation and further \n     requests that the members of the Louisiana congressional \n     delegation support its continued presence in the city of \n     Slidell and the state of Louisiana.

Hackworth's third \n     nomination for the Medal of Honor for his heroism in battle \n     while in the service of his country. Be it further\n       Resolved, That a copy of this Resolution shall be \n     transmitted to the secretary of the United States Senate and \n     the clerk of the United States House of Representatives and \n     to each member of the Louisiana delegation to the United \n     States Congress.

A joint resolution adopted by the General Assembly \n     of the State of Tennessee relative to proposed cuts in \n     agriculture-related programs and initiatives; to the \n     Committee on the Budget.\n\n                      Senate Joint Resolution 277\n\n       Whereas, agriculture has been the backbone of the American \n     way of life since the founding of our great nation and even \n     today the United States of America remains the breadbasket of \n     the world; and\n       Whereas, recognizing that farm planning is a multi-year \n     process, the 2002 Farm Bill enacted by Congress provided a \n     long-term commitment to the American farming and ranching \n     communities to ensure stability in the agriculture industry \n     and the overall agriculture economy; and\n       Whereas, the structure and funding levels of the current \n     farm bill are currently being threatened with budget cuts \n     that will jeopardize the futures of America's farmers and \n     ranchers, placing them at a serious competitive disadvantage \n     during World Trade Organization's agriculture trade talks; \n     and\n       Whereas, agricultural products are America's top export \n     with more than $62 billion in sales during 2004. Farm exports \n     enable jobs and businesses for millions of Americans; more \n     than 17 percent of the total American workforce is involved \n     in the production, processing, and sale of the nation's food \n     and fiber; and\n       Whereas, Tennessee ranks fourth in the nation in the number \n     of farms within our borders; and agriculture contributes \n     $38.5 billion to the Tennessee economy and accounts for more \n     than 214,000 jobs; and\n       Whereas, the economic well-being of Tennessee's \n     agricultural producers directly contributes to the economic \n     well-being of the state as a whole and, in turn, the economic \n     health of our producers is dependent on the preservation of \n     agricultural funding on a national level. Any budget cuts to \n     agriculture-related programs and initiatives will be \n     disastrous for the agricultural industry throughout the \n     entire nation: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate of the One Hundred Fourth General \n     Assembly of the State of Tennessee, the House of \n     Representatives concurring, That, in order to prevent \n     extensive economic damage to the American agriculture \n     industry and the economic stability of the citizens of \n     Tennessee, the United States Congress is hereby urged to stop \n     any cuts to the agriculture budget as proposed in the 2006 \n     Federal Budget documents and are also. urged to provide full \n     funding to the 2002 Farm Bill, and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Chief Clerk of the Senate is directed to \n     transmit enrolled copies of this resolution to the President \n     and Secretary of the U.S. Senate; the Speaker and the Clerk \n     of the U.S. House of Representatives; and each member of \n     Tennessee's congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-147.

A joint resolution adopted by the Assembly of the \n     State of Nevada relative to taking certain actions concerning \n     wilderness areas and wilderness study areas; to the Committee \n     on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n                       Senate Joint Resolution 1\n\n       Whereas, The provisions of 16 U.S.C. 1131 et seq., commonly \n     referred to as the Wilderness Act, establish the National \n     Wilderness Preservation System, which consists of areas of \n     federal public lands that are designated by Congress as \n     wilderness areas; and\n       Whereas, Congress has designated approximately 2.8 million \n     acres of federal public lands in Nevada as wilderness areas; \n     and\n       Whereas, If an area of federal public land is designated as \n     a wilderness area, it must be managed in a manner that \n     preserves the wilderness character of the area and ensures \n     that the area remains unimpaired for future use and enjoyment \n     as a wilderness area; and\n       Whereas, A reasonable amount of wilderness area in this \n     State provides for a diverse spectrum of recreational \n     opportunities in Nevada, promotes tourism and provides a \n     place for Nevadans to escape the pressures of urban growth; \n     and\n       Whereas, The provisions of the Wilderness Act and the \n     Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976, 43 U.S.c. \n     1701 et seq., provide for the study of certain areas of land \n     to determine whether those areas, commonly known as \n     wilderness study areas, are suitable for designation as a \n     wilderness area; and\n       Whereas, In conjunction with the provisions of the \n     Wilderness Act and the Federal Land Policy and Management \n     Act, the Bureau of Land Management of the Department of the \n     Interior in the late 1970s conducted an initial inventory of \n     approximately 49 million acres of federal public lands in \n     Nevada to determine the suitability of such lands for \n     designation as wilderness areas or identification as \n     wilderness study areas and, in 1980, recommended that \n     approximately 5.1 million acres of those lands be identified \n     as wilderness study areas; and\n       Whereas, Although Congress recently enacted the Lincoln \n     County Conservation, Recreation, and Development Act of 2004, \n     Pub. L. No. 108-424, 118 Stat. 2403, pursuant to which \n     approximately 768,000 acres have been given status as \n     wilderness areas and approximately 251,000 acres have been \n     released for multiple use under the Federal Land Policy and \n     Management Act, the Bureau of Land Management continues to \n     manage approximately 2.8 million acres of federal public \n     lands in Nevada identified as wilderness study areas; and\n       Whereas, Decisions concerning whether to designate \n     wilderness study areas as wilderness areas or release those \n     areas for multiple use are important and must be made in a \n     timely manner and without any unnecessary delays so that \n     those lands which are suitable for designation as a \n     wilderness an:a may be afforded full protection as such and \n     those lands which are not suitable for designation as a \n     wilderness area may be released for use and management for \n     the public good as accorded by law; now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate and Assembly of the State of Nevada, \n     Jointly, That the members of the Nevada Legislature urge the \n     Nevada Congressional Delegation to work with all interested \n     Nevadans, land managers, affected parties, local governments, \n     special interest organizations and members of the public in a \n     spirit of cooperation and mutual respect to address issues \n     concerning the designation of wilderness areas in Nevada; and \n     be it further\n       Resolved, That the members of the Nevada Legislature urge \n     Congress to take the following actions concerning wilderness \n     areas and wilderness study areas:\n       1. As part of the legislative process for determining which \n     federal lands should be designated as wilderness areas, and \n     in accordance with stakeholder agreements, continue the \n     policy of releasing federal lands that are a part of a \n     wilderness study area for multiple use, and to continue the \n     appropriate disposal of suitable federal lands for conversion \n     to state or private lands, when the determination is made \n     that those federal lands are unsuitable for designation as \n     wilderness areas;\n       2. When determining whether to designate land as a \n     wilderness area, carefully consider the requirements of \n     existing and future military operations on the land and in \n     the airspace over the land and make appropriate decisions \n     based on those requirements; and\n       3. Support the adoption of a schedule for the timely \n     consideration of a plan to release wilderness study areas \n     that are found unsuitable for designation as wild,erness \n     areas; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Secretary of the Senate prepare and \n     transmit a copy of this resolution to the Vice President of \n     the United States as the presiding officer of the Senate, the \n     Speaker of the House of Representatives and each member of \n     the Nevada Congressional Delegation; and be it further\n       Resolved, That this resolution becomes effective upon \n     passage.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-150. A joint resolution adopted by the Assembly of the \n     State of Nevada relative to directing the Secretary of the \n     Interior to provide full funding for the Clark County Sport \n     Shooting Park; to the Committee on Energy and Natural \n     Resources.\n\n                       Senate Joint Resolution 12\n\n       Whereas, The United States Congress passed the Southern \n     Nevada Public Lands Management Act of 1998, which authorizes \n     the United States Department of the Interior through the \n     Bureau of Land Management to sell certain federal lands in \n     Clark County to the private sector for development purposes; \n     and\n       Whereas, The provisions of the Act allocate 5 percent of \n     the profits from the sale of federal land to fund education \n     in Nevada, 10 percent to the Southern Nevada Water Authority \n     for water delivery projects, and 85 percent to a special \n     account to be used for the federal acquisition of \n     environmentally sensitive land to develop a Multi-Species \n     Habitat Conservation Plan to protect threatened and \n     endangered species, for capital projects on federal land \n     managed by the Bureau of Land Management, the National Park \n     Service and the United States Forest Service, and for \n     developing parks, trails and natural areas in Clark County; \n     and\n\n[[Page S8553]]\n\n       Whereas, Additional legislation amended the Act to include \n     the funding of conservation initiatives on federal land and \n     federal environmental restoration projects at Lake Tahoe and \n     to authorize that certain revenues be set aside for other \n     specific purposes; and\n       Whereas, The Las Vegas Valley is the fastest growing \n     metropolitan area in the United States and the Act was \n     passed, in part, to offset growing recreational and \n     environmental impacts on federal land surrounding the Las \n     Vegas Valley and to provide recreational amenities within the \n     Las Vegas Valley; and\n       Whereas, The residents of Clark County enjoy and utilize \n     the right to own and use firearms, with persons in one of \n     every three households estimated to own a firearm, and \n     firearm owners have expressed a strong desire to develop a \n     safe and affordable public shooting park in the Las Vegas \n     Valley; and\n       Whereas, The Las Vegas Valley has limited public shooting \n     opportunities and no public shooting parks, causing citizens \n     to use federal lands for practice shooting, which results in \n     illegal shooting, environmental damage and public safety \n     issues; and\n       Whereas, Law enforcement, the security industry and local \n     military units in the Las Vegas Valley have expressed a \n     desire for a shooting park to meet training and Homeland \n     Defense needs; and\n       Whereas, The need for a public shooting park was \n     acknowledged by the Department of the Interior and Congress \n     in January 2002 when President George W. Bush signed into law \n     H.R. 2937, which transferred 2,880 acres of federal land to \n     Clark County for the purpose of constructing a public \n     shooting park; and\n       Whereas, The Clark County Board of Commissioners directed \n     the Department of Parks and Community Services, with the \n     advice of a citizen advisory committee, to design, construct \n     and operate the shooting park; and\n       Whereas, The Sport Shooting Park Citizen Advisory Committee \n     has recommended a conceptual plan for a safe, affordable and \n     self-sustaining sport shooting park to meet the needs of the \n     public, and this project enjoys strong support from the \n     residents of the Las Vegas Valley; and\n       Whereas, The Department of the Interior, using money \n     generated from the sale of land in Las Vegas Valley as \n     required by the Southern Nevada Public Lands Management Act, \n     funded the first phase of this project; and\n       Whereas, The Clark County staff proposed that the federal \n     Parks, Trails and Natural Areas Subgroup recommend funding of \n     $42,160,000 by the Department of the Interior to complete the \n     remainder of the Sport Shooting Park development, as phases 2 \n     and 3 of the project; and\n       Whereas, The Parks, Trails and Natural Areas Subgroup \n     funding recommendation eliminated the proposed law \n     enforcement area and the park center, thereby reducing the \n     funding recommendation to $33,600,000; and\n       Whereas, The Clark County Board of Commissioners passed a \n     resolution on March 1, 2005, requesting a reevaluation of the \n     recommendation and the continuation of funding from the \n     Southern Nevada Public Lands Management Act of 1998; and\n       Whereas, The Secretary of the Interior has the authority to \n     authorize expenditure of money from the Act to provide full \n     funding for the Clark County Sport Shooting Park: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate and Assembly of the State of Nevada, \n     Jointly, That the members of the 73rd Session of the Nevada \n     Legislature hereby urge President Bush to direct the \n     Secretary of the Interior to provide full funding for the \n     Clark County Sport Shooting Park; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the members of the 73rd Session of the \n     Nevada Legislature support the resolutions adopted by the \n     Clark County Board of Commissioners on March 1, 2005, \n     concerning the Southern Nevada Public Lands Management Act of \n     1998; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Secretary of the Senate prepare and \n     transmit a copy of this resolution to the President of the \n     United States, the Vice President of the United States as the \n     presiding officer of the United States Senate, the Speaker of \n     the House of Representatives, the Secretary of the Interior, \n     and each member of the Nevada Congressional Delegation; and \n     be it further\n       Resolved, That this resolution becomes effective upon \n     passage.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-151. A concurrent resolution adopted by the Senate of \n     the Legislature of the State of Louisiana relative to \n     establishing a domestic energy policy that will ensure an \n     adequate supply of energy and the necessary infrastructure; \n     to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n                    Senate Concurrent Resolution 120\n\n       Whereas, the price of natural gas in the United States, the \n     highest in the industrial world, has recently spiked and \n     continues to show volatility; and\n       Whereas, the current price of natural gas has been equated \n     to paying sixteen dollars for a gallon of milk, twelve \n     dollars and seventy cents for a pound of ground beef, or nine \n     dollars and twenty-one cents for a gallon of gasoline; and\n       Whereas, abnormally high natural gas prices have created an \n     unanticipated burden of one hundred and eleven billion \n     dollars on the economy of the United States over the past \n     thirty months; and\n       Whereas, the United States relies too heavily on natural \n     gas in our national energy supply, creating a tremendous \n     imbalance between natural gas supply and demand; and\n       Whereas, Louisiana's manufacturers, farmers, small \n     businesses, local governments, retailers, and residential \n     consumers are struggling from skyrocketing natural gas \n     prices; and\n       Whereas, thousands of jobs in these industries are \n     threatened because many of these businesses use natural gas \n     as a raw material and as an energy supply; and\n       Whereas, the natural gas imbalance is not a free market \n     problem; and\n       Whereas, natural gas is domestically produced and very \n     difficult to import, and the United States cannot correct the \n     imbalance by the importation of natural gas; and\n       Whereas, the high price of natural gas is created by \n     governmental policies that increase demand for natural gas \n     while impeding the development of a greater supply by \n     discouraging exploration and production; and\n       Whereas, the Legislature of Louisiana supports a sound and \n     rational domestic energy policy; and\n       Whereas, such energy policy should develop a concerted \n     national effort to promote greater energy efficiency and open \n     promising new areas for environmentally responsible natural \n     gas production: Therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Legislature of Louisiana memorializes \n     the Congress of the United States to establish a domestic \n     energy policy that will ensure an adequate supply of energy \n     and the necessary infrastructure. Be it further\n       Resolved, That a copy of this Resolution shall be \n     transmitted to the secretary of the United States Senate and \n     the clerk of the United States House of Representatives and \n     to each member of the Louisiana delegation to the United \n     States Congress.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-152. A joint resolution adopted by the Legislature of \n     the State of Nevada relative to recognizing the unsuitability \n     of Yucca Mountain as the site for a repository to store and \n     dispose of spent nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive \n     waste; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n                      Assembly Joint Resolution 4\n\n       Whereas, Since 1954, when the Atomic Energy Act was passed \n     by Congress, the Federal Government has been responsible for \n     the disposal of radioactive waste, yet few environmental \n     challenges have proven more daunting than the problems posed \n     by the disposal of spent nuclear fuel and high-level \n     radioactive waste; and\n       Whereas, In July 2002, despite seemingly inadequate \n     standards set by the Environmental Protection Agency and the \n     recommendation of the Secretary of Energy, President Bush \n     signed legislation designating Yucca Mountain as suitable for \n     the nation's only repository for high-level radioactive waste \n     and spent nuclear fuel without regard to the constant and \n     vigorous objections of the political leaders and residents of \n     the State of Nevada, and ignored the underlying geologic \n     isolation requirements set by Congress; and\n       Whereas, The recommendation of Yucca Mountain was not only \n     premature but also flawed, especially given the Department of \n     Energy's failure to conduct a comprehensive evaluation of the \n     socioeconomic, environmental and public health and safety \n     impact both within Nevada and within communities along \n     national shipping routes; and\n       Whereas, Not only is the proposed repository in one of the \n     most geologically active areas in the nation but, according \n     to the Agency for Nuclear Projects, it is ``the only \n     repository under consideration in the world that is located \n     above the water table, not below it''; and\n       Whereas, Even if risks related to geologic disposal are \n     ignored, the designation of Yucca Mountain is of particular \n     concern because of its location within an area rife with \n     seismic and hydrothermic activity and because of its \n     proximity to numerous fractures and earthquake faults, which \n     could lead to underground contamination; and\n       Whereas, As more, problems are revealed, the Department of \n     Energy has gravitated from the concept of geologic isolation; \n     and now is relying almost exclusively on ``engineered \n     barriers'' to keep radiological materials from migrating \n     out of the repository and into the environment, \n     essentially ignoring the foundational recommendation of \n     the National Academy of Sciences that manmade materials \n     not be used to compensate for faulty geology or hydrology; \n     and\n       Whereas, The Nuclear Energy Institute has declared that the \n     repository can be licensed ``without the mountain,'' yet, if \n     that is true, if the mountain is irrelevant and waste \n     packages can be made to last for 10,000 years, why make tens \n     of thousands of shipments of radioactive waste through the \n     nation's cities to a site as seismically adverse as Yucca \n     Mountain; and\n       Whereas, In July 2004, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the \n     D.C. Circuit threw out a radiation safety standard set by the \n     Environmental Protection Agency, finding that the Nuclear \n     Regulatory Commission ``breached its duty'' to protect the \n     health and safety of the public by limiting repository \n     performance standards to 10,000 years, essentially ignoring \n     the National Academy of Sciences when it recommended that the \n     standard exceed 300,000 years; and\n       Whereas, The recent court decision has not only delayed the \n     licensing process, but the Department of Energy has stated \n     that they are unable to meet a standard longer than 10,000 \n     years; and\n\n[[Page S8554]]\n\n       Whereas, The Department of Energy contends it is better to \n     have all nuclear waste at a single location rather than \n     scattered around the country, yet this contention is flawed \n     because Yucca Mountain will be at capacity by the time it is \n     finally deemed to be ready for use, effectively putting to \n     rest the ``one safe site'' idea; and\n       Whereas, Those within the nuclear industry itself have \n     commented that storing high-level waste at a centralized \n     location is no longer essential and, in fact, permits have \n     been filed to build new nuclear power plants with on-site \n     storage and to increase storage at existing plants, the sites \n     of which are already protected by comprehensive security \n     plans; and\n       Whereas, The Department of Energy's own analysis of Yucca \n     Mountain suggests there would be fewer deaths and injuries if \n     the Department allowed the waste to continue to be stored at \n     existing power plants and storage sites until a safe and \n     permanent site and transportation proposal can be confirmed; \n     and\n       Whereas, Ninety percent of the waste to be shipped to Yucca \n     Mountain is now located east of the Mississippi and, if \n     transported, will impact at least 44 states, hundreds of \n     cities, thousands of communities and nearly 50 million \n     Americans who reside within 3 miles of potential shipping \n     routes; and\n       Whereas, An area identified as the Caliente rail corridor \n     has been designated as part of the transportation route, the \n     designation of which is being contested, particularly since \n     flooding occurred in that area in January 2005, eroding \n     approach embankments and causing railroad tracks to be washed \n     away, which led 5 to 10 trains to be rerouted through Reno; \n     and\n       Whereas, Compounding the transportation issue is the fact \n     that, even without an accident, Nevada's economy stands to \n     lose upwards of $5.5 billion annually as a result of the \n     stigmatizing effects of the repository and the transportation \n     of nuclear waste through the State; and\n       Whereas, As early as 1986, the Department of Energy \n     acknowledged the potential for impacts to a tourism-dependent \n     economy, an issue of great concern in Nevada, stating ``the \n     potential for adverse public perception of a repository and \n     its associated waste transportation could adversely affect \n     the tourism industry''; and\n       Whereas, Given the unique reliance of Nevada's economy on \n     the State's ability to attract tourists, any impacts that \n     reduce the number of visitors, especially to Las Vegas, would \n     have major economic consequences for this State, leading to \n     direct fiscal consequences for local governments as it is \n     predicted that, even without an accident, visitor spending \n     will decline by 7 percent, reducing local government tax \n     revenues by $91 million annually; and\n       Whereas, Not only is Nevada itself ranked the fastest \n     growing state in the nation but the Las Vegas Valley, in \n     particular, is one of the fastest growing areas in the \n     nation, with Henderson, North Las Vegas and Las Vegas being \n     among the top six fastest growing cities in the country, \n     which further raises concerns because Yucca Mountain is \n     located just 90 miles northwest of the Valley; and\n       Whereas, Recent setbacks include decreased funding by \n     Congress, delays in the licensing process and the backlog in \n     review by the Department of Energy of the documents to be \n     submitted with the application, of which there are more than \n     2 million documents still in need of study; and\n       Whereas, The inescapable conclusion is that the Federal \n     Government is in no way prepared to deal with, or is even \n     aware of, the effects of the Yucca Mountain project on \n     society and this country: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Assembly and Senate of the State of Nevada, \n     Jointly, That numerous hurdles, including budget shortfalls, \n     an unresolved radiation health safety standard, and \n     transportation and corrosion issues, are cause for \n     reconsidering Yucca Mountain as the proposed site for a \n     nuclear waste repository; and be it further\n       Resolved, That President Bush is implored to remember a \n     pledge he made in Las Vegas on August 12, 2004, to ``stand by \n     the decision of the courts and the Nuclear Regulatory \n     Commission,'' and to live up to this promise by ordering \n     the Department of Energy to stop its work on a license for \n     a nuclear waste repository in Nevada; and be it further\n       Resolved, That despite the fact that voters in Nevada chose \n     to re-elect President Bush, a recent poll indicates that \n     approximately 70 percent of Nevadans remain opposed to Yucca \n     Mountain, an ill advised project based on bad science, bad \n     law and bad public policy, a choice that ignores better, less \n     expensive and safer alternatives, a choice which hinders, not \n     helps, national security; and be it further\n       Resolved, That Nevada has already borne more than its fair \n     share of this nation's radioactive waste burdens, including, \n     hosting hundreds of nuclear weapons tests during the Cold War \n     and hosting the world's largest low-level and mixed \n     radioactive waste disposal facility at the Nevada Test Site, \n     which is also controlled by the Department of Energy; and be \n     it further\n       Resolved, That the issue of how to dispose of nuclear \n     waste, the deadliest substance known to mankind, is of great \n     importance, requiring decisions to be based on ``sound \n     science,'' as was promised Nevada and the nation in 2000, \n     before it is put on the roads, railways and waterways of this \n     country; and be it further\n       Resolved, That with the abundance of safe, economical dry \n     storage facilities at existing reactor sites, there is no \n     current spent fuel emergency and nuclear power plants face no \n     risk of shutdown, the residents and political leaders of the \n     State of Nevada urge President Bush and Congress and all \n     involved agencies to recognize the unsuitability of Yucca \n     Mountain as the site for a repository to store and dispose of \n     spent nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive waste; and be \n     it further\n       Resolved, That the Chief Clerk of the Assembly prepare and \n     transmit a copy of this resolution to the President of the \n     United States, the Vice President of the United States as the \n     presiding officer of the Senate, the Speaker of the House of \n     Representatives, the Secretary of Energy and each member of \n     the Nevada Congressional Delegation; and be it further\n       Resolved, That this resolution becomes effective upon \n     passage.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-153. A resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the Legislature of the State of Hawaii \n     relative to urging the Federal Government to provide medical \n     care and compensation to nuclear victims in the Republic of \n     the Marshall Islands; to the Committee on Energy and Natural \n     Resources.\n\n                          House Resolution 141\n\n       Whereas, the International Declaration of Human Rights \n     guarantees all world citizens the right to life and health \n     and a clean environment, and one of the essential components \n     in this fundamental right is the right to open information on \n     environmental hazards and the short- and long-term effects of \n     environmental contamination on human health; and\n       Whereas, given the continuing widespread reliance of many \n     governments on nuclear energy and nuclear weapons, and given \n     the imminent threat of acts of terror at nuclear facilities \n     that could release large volumes of radiation into the global \n     environment, it is essential that the federal government \n     gather comprehensive data from a wide range of communities on \n     sustained and extensive exposure to low-level radiation; and\n       Whereas, the United States government carried out sixty-\n     seven above-ground tests of atomic and hydrogen bombs in the \n     region of Enewetak and Bikini in the Marshall Islands from \n     1946 through 1958; and\n       Whereas, these bomb tests affected not only the atolls of \n     Enewetak and Bikini, but also the downwind atolls of \n     Rongelap, Utrik, Ujae, and others; and\n       Whereas, these atomic blasts were thousands of times more \n     powerful than the bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, \n     Japan; and\n       Whereas, three islands in the Bikini atoll and three \n     islands in the Enewetak atoll completely ceased to exist as a \n     result of these tests; and\n       Whereas, the federal government deliberately failed to \n     protect the citizens of the Republic of the Marshall Islands \n     from exposure to radioactive fallout; and\n       Whereas, significant numbers of residents of the four \n     affected atolls experienced acute radiation sickness, thyroid \n     cancer, skin cancer, other oncological illnesses, leukemia, \n     birth defects, stillbirths, damage to reproductive organs, \n     and endocrine disorders as a result of this exposure; and\n       Whereas, some of the radioactive materials released in \n     massive quantities in these atomic tests remain dangerously \n     radioactive for thousands of years; and\n       Whereas, the federal government has failed to conduct \n     comprehensive, independent, open, and transparent health \n     studies to determine the overall impact of the atomic bomb \n     tests on the health of the citizens of the Marshall Islands; \n     and\n       Whereas, newly declassified documents have verified that \n     the federal government carried out radiation experiments \n     deliberately injecting radioactive isotopes into Marshallese \n     citizens without their informed consent; and\n       Whereas, officials from the United States Department of \n     Energy, the National Cancer Institute, and other agencies \n     charged with the protection of public health have admitted \n     that they deliberately concealed or distorted the higher \n     thyroid cancer rates and other health effects among nuclear \n     survivors in the Marshall Islands; and\n       Whereas, the federal government has now threatened to cut \n     off funds for medical care and compensation of nuclear \n     victims in the Marshall Islands on the grounds that there is \n     no legal basis for such payments and that no further nuclear \n     health effects can be expected; and\n       Whereas, the Republic of the Marshall Islands currently \n     lacks the financial and technical resources needed to remedy \n     or combat the effects of radioactive fallout, to protect the \n     public from further radiation exposure, to complete the \n     further decontamination of all nuclear and military waste, or \n     the devolution and restoration of the affected lands; now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, by the House of Representatives of the Twenty-\n     third Legislature of the State of Hawaii, Regular Session of \n     2005, that the President of the United States and the \n     Congress of the United States are respectfully urged to seek \n     proper funding for medical care and compensation of nuclear \n     victims who are residents of the Republic of the Marshall \n     Islands, and for the development and decontamination of the \n     affected Marshall Islands communities; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the federal government is further requested \n     to immediately step up\n\n[[Page S8555]]\n\n     their efforts to screen the health of exposed Marshall \n     Islands populations and in particular, all newborn infants, \n     now and in the future, that may suffer the long-term effects \n     of exposure to radioactive fallout caused by atomic and \n     hydrogen bomb testing conducted by the United States; and be \n     it further\n       Resolved, That the federal government is urged to finance \n     and commission a comprehensive independent health study to \n     conclusively determine the impact of sustained exposure to \n     high-level and low-level radiation; provided that the scope \n     or duration of such health studies is requested to include \n     the likelihood of chromosome damage and the likely emergence \n     of genetic deformities in future generations; and be it \n     further\n       Resolved, That the federal government is encouraged to \n     establish health centers in the Republic of the Marshall \n     Islands, and to finance and provide resources necessary to \n     sustain health care adequate to the needs of nuclear victims \n     that are Marshall Island residents; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Congress of the United States is \n     requested to hold public hearings on the Change of \n     Circumstances Petition both in Majuro, Republic of the \n     Marshall Islands, and in Washington D.C., and to allow \n     representatives of the non-governmental organizations from \n     Enewetak, Rongelap, Utrik, and Bikini to testify; and be it \n     further\n       Resolved, That certified copies of this Resolution be \n     transmitted to the President of the United States, through \n     the Secretary of State, the President of the United States \n     Senate, the Speaker of the United States House of \n     Representatives, the members of Hawaii's congressional \n     delegation, the Executive Director of the Aloha Medical \n     Mission, the President of Micronesians United, the Director \n     of Pacific Island and Asian American Ministry of the United \n     Church of Christ, the Director of ERUB (Enewetak, Rongelap, \n     Utrick, Bikini) Honolulu Marshallese Ministry, and the \n     Director of the Friends Retreat Center.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-154. A concurrent resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the Legislature of the State of Louisiana \n     relative to approving funding for deepening the Houma \n     Navigation Canal, including funding efforts to make \n     beneficial use of the dredge material for embankment \n     stabilization; to the Committee on Environment and Public \n     Works.\n\n                     House Concurrent Resolution 84\n\n       Whereas, growth and development of businesses and \n     industries are beginning to be restrained by the shallowness \n     of the Houma Navigation Canal due to the fact that the \n     existing depth of the canal does not allow passage of the \n     larger barges and vessels which are necessary for newer \n     equipment and products; and\n       Whereas, the Houma economy is heavily dependent on the oil \n     and gas industry, and oil and gas exploration is venturing \n     farther out into the Gulf of Mexico and into deeper and \n     deeper water, ventures which require larger vessels and \n     heavier equipment for support; and\n       Whereas, Houma has always been a major location of the \n     industries necessary to support Gulf of Mexico oil and gas \n     exploration and production, but the city may soon no longer \n     be accessible to those support vessels and barges because of \n     the restrictive depth of the Houma Navigation Canal; and\n       Whereas, economic growth in the area is dependent on the \n     canal being dredged to a navigable depth of twenty feet, with \n     the additional benefit that dredging the canal will provide \n     dredge material that can be put to beneficial use in efforts \n     for bank stabilization and coastal preservation and \n     restoration; and\n       Whereas, the United States Army Corps of Engineers has \n     already begun design work on a set of locks in the canal, \n     which will be designed for a navigable depth of twenty feet, \n     and it is only logical that the canal on which the locks are \n     located would be the same depth as the locks: Therefore, be \n     it\n       Resolved, That the Legislature of Louisiana does hereby \n     memorialize the United States Congress and the Louisiana \n     congressional delegation to approve funding for deepening the \n     Houma Navigation Canal to a navigable depth of twenty feet, \n     including funding efforts to make beneficial use of the \n     dredge material for bank stabilization and coastal \n     preservation and restoration.

A joint resolution adopted by the Legislature of \n     the State of Nevada relative to mandating the reporting of \n     results of all clinical trials and the collection and \n     analysis of the data by the appropriate Federal agencies; to \n     the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n                      Assembly Joint Resolution 14\n\n       Whereas, A clinical trial is a research study involving the \n     participation and observation of human volunteers to \n     determine the safety and effectiveness of drugs, biological \n     products or medical devices; and\n       Whereas, There is no comprehensive system for tracking, \n     organizing and disseminating information about ongoing \n     clinical trials, and it is estimated that only half of the \n     approximately 1 million trials conducted over the past 56 \n     years have been reported; and\n       Whereas, One consequence of this lack of reporting is \n     ``publication bias'' wherein positive results of trials are \n     reported in order to get a drug approved, while trials which \n     show harmful effects are not reported, resulting in a \n     distortion of evidence on which to base medical \n     determinations, allowing physicians to unwittingly prescribe \n     drugs that may have hazardous side effects; and\n       Whereas, There are many reasons that volunteers participate \n     in trials, such as gaining access to new treatments before \n     they are widely available, obtaining expert medical care at \n     leading health care facilities, playing an active role in \n     their own health care and helping others by contributing to \n     medical research; and\n       Whereas, There are many risks to participation in these \n     trials, including possible unpleasant and even life-\n     threatening side effects, and with a voluntary registry such \n     as suggested by the pharmaceutical industry, companies may \n     not report results that are unfavorable to their products, \n     betraying the volunteers' trust, and without this \n     information, there cannot be a true scientific evaluation of \n     the study of that drug; and\n       Whereas, Many trials that are performed by academic \n     researchers are sponsored by pharmaceutical companies, \n     presenting a conflict of interest when reporting the results \n     of the trials, and nearly one-fifth of government scientists \n     say they have been pressured to support approval of a drug \n     despite having concerns about its safety; and\n       Whereas, Each clinical trial in the United States must be \n     approved and monitored by an institutional review board, \n     which is an independent committee of physicians, \n     statisticians, community advocates and others, to ensure that \n     the trial is ethical and that the rights of the volunteers \n     are protected; and\n       Whereas, Prescription drugs are regulated by the Food and \n     Drug Administration, but with the discovery that some of the \n     drugs developed for arthritis have been found to increase the \n     risk of heart attacks and that some patients, especially \n     children and teenagers who were prescribed antidepressants \n     had increased rates of suicide and violence, with substantial \n     evidence of the suppression of negative data concerning these \n     drugs in clinical trials, there is a growing movement \n     supporting a national registry of all clinical trials; and\n       Whereas, The pharmaceutical industry opposes full \n     disclosure because of concerns that competitors would learn \n     their research and development secrets and it would affect \n     their profits, but the pharmaceutical industry is \n     consistently one of the most profitable industries in the \n     Fortune 500 list, and the welfare of the public must take \n     precedence over all else; and\n       Whereas, For these reasons, the American Medical \n     Association has called for all clinical trials to be \n     registered with the Federal Government; and\n       Whereas, The International Committee of Medical Journal \n     Editors has issued a statement that, as of July 1, 2005, they \n     will require registration in a public trials registry for all \n     clinical studies that involve human patients as a condition \n     of consideration for publication in member journals; and\n       Whereas, In the 108th Session of Congress, H.R. 5252 and S. \n     2933 were introduced which required researchers to enter \n     their clinical trials into a federal registry before starting \n     them and to report the results of the trials at the \n     conclusion, but these bills died in committee; and\n       Whereas, Under current law, pharmaceutical companies are \n     required to post information only about trials of drugs for \n     serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions which are \n     then posted on an existing government website, \n     www.ClinicalTrials.gov. that currently has a database of such \n     studies conducted in all 50 states and in over 100 countries; \n     and\n       Whereas, This website could be expanded to include \n     information about the purpose, duration and outcomes of all \n     clinical trials; and\n       Whereas, It is imperative that federal legislation be \n     introduced to create a centralized and comprehensive national \n     registry for mandatory reporting of all publicly and \n     privately funded clinical trials involving drugs, biological \n     products or medical devices; and\n       Whereas, Since it has been shown that unfavorable trial \n     results which placed financial interests at risk are \n     particularly likely to remain unpublished and hidden from \n     public view, any legislation must require that the results of \n     all clinical trials be reported, whether those results are \n     positive or negative, because selective reporting of results \n     distorts the body of evidence available for decision making; \n     and\n       Whereas, By creating a single, comprehensive database of \n     clinical studies and their results. scientific information is \n     easily available, in a timely fashion, for use by \n     researchers, journalists, public interest organizations, \n     health care providers, patients seeking to enroll as subjects \n     in clinical trials and the general public so that they may \n     make informed decisions, resulting in safer and more \n     responsible clinical trials; and\n       Whereas, Since many adverse effects do not surface until a \n     drug is taken over a long period of time, periodic updates \n     must be included in the registry to improve knowledge of the \n     risks of longterm use; and\n       Whereas, To be effective, legislation would need to require \n     that institutional review boards deny a stamp of approval to \n     a clinical trial unless it is registered in the database; and\n       Whereas, To regain the public's trust in the clinical \n     trials procedure, there must be full disclosure of the \n     results of all clinical trials, allowing physicians and \n     patients to make safe, appropriate and effective health care \n     decisions by having all relevant information available; Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Assembly and Senate of the State of Nevada, \n     Jointly, That, because carefully conducted clinical trials \n     are recognized as a necessary and valuable tool in \n     determining the efficacy and safety of products, the members \n     of the Nevada Legislature hereby express their strong support \n     for a national registry of clinical trials for the health and \n     well-being of the public;

A joint resolution adopted by the Legislature of \n     the State of Maine relative to funding the costs of special \n     education and to end unfunded mandates; to the Committee on \n     Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n                            Joint Resolution\n\n       Whereas, the Congress of the United States has found that \n     all children deserve a high-quality education, including \n     children with disabilities; and\n       Whereas, the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, \n     20 United States Code, Section 1400, et seq., provides that \n     the Federal Government and state and local governments are to \n     share in the expense of education for children with \n     disabilities and commits the Federal Government to provide \n     funds to assist with the excess of expenses of education for \n     children with disabilities; and\n       Whereas, the Congress of the United States has committed to \n     contribute up to 40% of the average per-pupil expenditure of \n     educating children with disabilities and the Federal \n     Government has failed to meet this commitment to assist the \n     states; and\n       Whereas, the Federal Government has never contributed more \n     than a fraction of the national average per-pupil expenditure \n     to assist with the excess expenses of educating children with \n     disabilities under the Individuals with Disabilities \n     Education Act; and\n       Whereas, this failure of the Federal Government to meet its \n     commitment to assist with the excess expenses of educating a \n     child with a disability contradicts the goal of ensuring that \n     children with disabilities receive a high-quality education; \n     and\n       Whereas, the imposition of unfunded mandates by the Federal \n     Government on state governments interferes with the \n     separation of powers between the 2 levels of government and \n     the ability of each state to determine the issues and \n     concerns of that state and what resources should be directed \n     to address these issues and concerns; and\n       Whereas, the Federal Government recognized the inequalities \n     of unfunded mandates on state governments when it passed the \n     Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995; and\n       Whereas, since the passage of the Unfunded Mandates Reform \n     Act of 1995, however, the Federal Government continues to \n     impose unfunded mandates on state governments, including in \n     areas such as special education requirements: Now, therefore, \n     be it\n       Resolved, That We, your Memorialists, respectfully urge and \n     request that the President of the United States and the \n     Congress of the United States either provide 40% of the \n     national average per-pupil expenditure to assist states and \n     local education agencies with the excess costs of educating \n     children with disabilities or amend the Individuals with \n     Disabilities Education Act to allow the states more \n     flexibility in implementing its mandates; and be it further\n       Resolved, That We, your Memorialists, respectfully urge and \n     request that the Congress of the United States revisit and \n     reconfirm the Unfunded Mandate Reform Act of 1995 and put the \n     intent and purpose of the Act into practice by ending the \n     imposition of unfunded federal mandates on state governments; \n     and be it further\n       Resolved, That suitable copies of this resolution, duly \n     authenticated by the Secretary of State, be transmitted to \n     the Honorable George W. Bush, President of the United States, \n     to the President of the Senate of the United States, to the \n     Speaker of the House of Representatives of the United States \n     and to each Member of the Maine Congressional Delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-160. A concurrent resolution adopted by the Legislature \n     of the State of Hawaii relative to amending the No Child Left \n     Behind Act of 2001; to the Committee on Health, Education, \n     Labor, and Pensions.\n\n                    House Concurrent Resolution 245\n\n       Whereas, in 2002, the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 was \n     enacted on a bipartisan basis and signed into law by \n     President George W. Bush; and\n       Whereas, all states that accept federal Title I education \n     funds, including Hawaii, are subject to the requirements of \n     the Act; and\n       Whereas, the purpose of the Act is to compel all public \n     schools to make adequate yearly progress toward the goal of \n     100 percent student proficiency in math and reading by 2013-\n     2014; and\n       Whereas, these expectations are unreasonable for students \n     with limited English proficiency and students with \n     disabilities, making it impossible for many of Hawaii's \n     schools, that have a high population of these students, to \n     comply with the law; and\n       Whereas, the Act does not allow states that may already \n     have successful accountability systems in place to use their \n     system to comply with the spirit of the Act; and\n       Whereas, states should be allowed to use a value-added or \n     student growth approach in their state accountability plan; \n     and\n       Whereas, the Act is an under-funded mandate that causes \n     states and school districts to spend more money than the \n     amounts appropriated by Congress to implement the Act; and\n       Whereas, the Act coerces participation by placing punitive \n     financial consequences on states that refuse to participate; \n     and\n       Whereas, in 2004, the National Conference of State \n     Legislatures created a bipartisan task force to study the \n     Act, resulting in suggestions for specific changes to make \n     the Act more workable, more responsive to variations among \n     the states, and more effective in improving elementary \n     education; and\n       Whereas, the recommendations of the task force's February \n     2005 Final Report include the following:\n       (1) Substantially increasing federal funding for the Act;\n       (2) Reexamining the financial consequences for states that \n     choose not to participate;\n       (3) Reevaluating the 100 percent proficiency goal \n     established by the Act;\n       (4) Conducting a Government Accountability Office study of \n     the compliance and proficiency costs associated with the Act;\n       (5) Giving the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act \n     primacy over the Act in cases where these laws may conflict; \n     and\n       (6) Providing states with much greater flexibility to meet \n     the objectives of the adequate yearly progress provisions of \n     the Act; and\n       Whereas, although the Act aims to provide flexibility for \n     states to improve academic achievement and to close the \n     achievement gap, the task force found that little flexibility \n     has been granted to states to implement the Act: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, By the House of Representatives of the Twenty-\n     third Legislature of the State of Hawaii, Regular Session of \n     2005, the Senate concurring, that the United States Congress \n     is respectfully requested to amend the No Child Left Behind \n     Act of 2001 according to the recommendations of the February \n     2005 Final Report of the National Conference of State \n     Legislatures' Task Force on No Child Left Behind; and be it \n     further\n       Resolved, That the current law and any revisions thereof \n     recognize that under our federal system of government, \n     education is primarily a state and local responsibility; and \n     be it further\n       Resolved, That Congress is requested to allow states more \n     flexibility to continue to work toward the goal of closing \n     the achievement gap without the threat of losing federal \n     funds; and be it further\n       Resolved, That Congress is requested to appropriate federal \n     funding in amounts consistent with the levels authorized in \n     the Act for education programs and expanded information \n     systems needed to accurately reflect student, school, and \n     school district performance and to pay the costs of ensuring \n     student proficiency; and be it further\n       Resolved, That Congress is requested to authorize \n     appropriate assessment methods and an alternative methodology \n     for determining adequate yearly progress targets and progress \n     for students who are not yet proficient in English and who \n     have certain disabilities; and be it further\n       Resolved, That Congress is requested to amend the No Child \n     Left Behind Act's current provisions relating to adequate \n     yearly progress to apply sanctions only when the same groups \n     or subgroups within a grade level fail to meet adequate \n     yearly progress targets in the same subject area for two \n     consecutive years; and be it further\n       Resolved, That Congress is requested to amend the Act to \n     allow flexibility in:\n       (1) Determining adequate yearly progress using models that \n     measure individual student growth or growth in the same \n     cohort of students from year to year;\n       (2) Calculating adequate yearly progress for students \n     belonging to multiple groups and subgroups; and\n       (3) Determining whether certain categories of teachers, \n     such as special education teachers, are highly qualified; and \n     be it further\n       Resolved, That Congress is requested to modify the No Child \n     Left Behind Act's provisions relating to school choice by \n     limiting the option only to those students whose performance \n     is consistently below the proficiency level; and be it \n     further\n       Resolved, That certified copies of this Concurrent \n     Resolution be transmitted to the President of the United \n     States, the President and Secretary of the United States \n     Senate, the Speaker and Clerk of the United States House of \n     Representatives, and members of Hawaii's congressional \n     delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-161. A concurrent resolution adopted by the Legislature \n     of the State of Hawaii relative to supporting federal \n     policies designed to eliminate homelessness in the United \n     States; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \n     Pensions.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-162. A resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the Legislature of the State of Michigan \n     relative to the creation of a national cord blood stem cell \n     bank; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \n     Pensions.\n\n                          House Resolution 75\n\n       Whereas, In discussion on stem cells in this country, one \n     available resource has too often been overlooked--stem cells \n     from umbilical cords. For example, a special type of stem \n     cells known as hematopoietic progenitor cells have been \n     successfully used for decades to reconstitute bone marrow and \n     circulating blood cells in patients whose bone marrow\n\n[[Page S8558]]\n\n     has been damaged by chemotherapy or other underlying disease. \n     Blood collected from the umbilical cords of recently \n     delivered infants have proven advantages over other sources \n     of these cells, such as adult donors. Stem cells found in the \n     umbilical cord are less immunologically mature than other \n     sources, which lessens the risk of rejection when \n     transplanted. In addition, the collection of these cells \n     poses minimal risk to the mother and infant. In some cases \n     there are sufficient stem cells in one umbilical cord for a \n     transplant to reconstitute bone marrow in a recipient; and\n       Whereas, Nearly 12,000 Americans a year search for a bone \n     marrow donor. Of these, only a small fraction identifies a \n     relative who is an acceptable match for a successful \n     donation. All the others must rely on a transplant from a \n     stranger. More than 9 million adults have voluntarily entered \n     bone marrow donor registries worldwide. This number is not \n     sufficient to find a match for everyone in need; and\n       Whereas, The current system for collecting and registering \n     umbilical cord blood in the United States is fragmented, with \n     at least 20 public banks operating across the country, one of \n     which is located in Grand Rapids, Michigan. In 2004, the \n     United States Congress appropriated $10 million to the \n     Department of Health and Human Services' Health Resources and \n     Services Administration to establish a National Cord Blood \n     Stem Cell Bank Program. Congress directed the Institute of \n     Medicine to make recommendations to set up and operate the \n     bank. In April 2005 the Institute of Medicine met its \n     responsibility by issuing an extensive report with \n     recommendations on how to make the current system work and \n     expand it for the benefit of physicians and patients \n     searching for matching donors: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, By the House of Representatives, That we \n     memorialize the Congress of the United States and the \n     Department of Health and Human Services to take the steps \n     necessary to create the national cord blood stem cell bank \n     based on the recommendations of the Institute of Medicine; \n     and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives members of the \n     Michigan congressional delegation, the Secretary of the \n     Department of Health and Human Services and the Administrator \n     of the Health Resources and Services Administration. Adopted \n     by the House of Representatives, June 1, 2005.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-163. A concurrent resolution adopted by the Legislature \n     of the State of New Hampshire relative to supporting Federal \n     funding for Lyme disease research; to the Committee on \n     Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n                        Concurrent Resolution 4\n\n       Whereas, according to the Centers for Disease Control and \n     Prevention (CDC), Lyme disease is probably the most common \n     tick-borne bacterial disease in the world, and in the United \n     States, it accounts for more than 90 percent of all reported \n     cases of vector-borne illness; and\n       Whereas, New Hampshire ranked 12th nationwide in total \n     reported cases to the CDC in 2003; and\n       Whereas, the number of reported cases in 2004 in New \n     Hampshire has grown substantially from the 2003 reported \n     numbers; and\n       Whereas, the tick populations are spreading northward with \n     the primary carrier being the deer tick; and\n       Whereas, the lack of early detection of Lyme disease may \n     result in unrecognized illness and persistent symptoms of \n     Lyme disease infection; and\n       Whereas, further research and health care provider \n     education about Lyme disease laboratory testing is needed; \n     and\n       Whereas, the issue of co-infections is clouding the \n     diagnostic picture with babesiosis, ehrlichiosis, \n     anaplasmosis, Bartonella, RMSF, tularemia, tick paralysis. \n     and other infections possibly being transmitted by the bite \n     of the same ticks that transmit Lyme disease and Lyme-like \n     diseases; and\n       Whereas, the educational awareness of this disease, \n     insurance coverage, and research funding need more attention \n     in New Hampshire; and\n       Whereas, government officials need to understand the \n     complexities of this disease, develop good sound policy to \n     draw attention to Lyme disease, and stop the spread of Lyme \n     disease in the state of New Hampshire: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate, the House of Representatives \n     concurring, That the general court of New Hampshire strongly \n     supports more federal funding for Lyme disease research; and\n       That the general court will continue to educate the public \n     and physicians about this disease through the New Hampshire \n     department of health and human services and other appropriate \n     state agencies; and\n       That copies of this resolution signed by the president of \n     the senate and the speaker of the house of representatives \n     shall be sent by the senate clerk to the President of the \n     United States, the President of the United States Senate, the \n     Speaker of the United States House of Representatives. and to \n     each member of the New Hampshire congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-164. A concurrent resolution adopted by the Senate of \n     the Legislature of the State of Louisiana relative to \n     enacting Federal legislation to ensure that deserving victims \n     of asbestos exposure receive compensation; to the Committee \n     on the Judiciary.\n\n                         Senate Resolution 177\n\n       Whereas, asbestos, a mineral processed and used in \n     thousands of construction and consumer products, is a \n     dangerous substance and has caused thousands of people to \n     develop serious and often fatal diseases and cancers; and\n       Whereas, millions of workers have been exposed to asbestos, \n     and the economic toll resulting from litigation related to \n     exposure to asbestos could run into the hundreds of billions \n     of dollars; and\n       Whereas, many companies, in order to avoid bankruptcy and \n     to compensate victims with manifest injuries from exposure to \n     asbestos, have attempted to set aside sufficient resources to \n     compensate such victims; and\n       Whereas, the new claims are resulting in a depletion of the \n     funds available to compensate victims who have sustained \n     serious injuries and who are in desperate need of \n     compensation; and\n       Whereas, the United States Supreme Court has noted that \n     federal and state courts have been inundated by an enormous \n     number of asbestos cases that defies customary judicial \n     administration and calls for national legislation; and\n       Whereas, the United States Senate Judiciary Committee, \n     under the bipartisan leadership of Republican Senator Arlen \n     Specter and Democratic Senator Patrick Leahy, have crafted a \n     bipartisan piece of legislation that creates a fair and \n     equitable system to deal with the asbestos litigation crisis; \n     and\n       Whereas, this bipartisan legislation creates an asbestos \n     trust fund that will ensure that victims of asbestos exposure \n     will receive just and fair compensation: Therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Louisiana Senate does hereby memorialize \n     the members of the United States Senate from Louisiana, \n     Senator Mary Landrieu and Senator David Vitter, to continue \n     to work toward enacting federal legislation to ensure that \n     deserving victims of asbestos exposure receive compensation \n     and continue to work with Senators Specter and Leahy to pass \n     meaningful and fair asbestos litigation reform legislation. \n     Be it further\n       Resolved, That a copy of this Resolution shall be \n     transmitted to the secretary of the United States Senate and \n     the clerk of the United States House of Representatives and \n     to each member of the Louisiana delegation to the United \n     States Congress.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-165.

A bill to amend the Higher Education Act of 1965 to assist \nhomeless students in obtaining postsecondary education, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Ms. MURRAY. Mr. President, today I join Senator DeWine to introduce a \nbill that would make the dream of a college diploma more accessible to \nhomeless youth and kids in foster care.\n  We all know the obstacles students' in America need to overcome in \norder to succeed in post-secondary education. Couple these traditional \nobstacles with extreme poverty, residential instability, insufficient \ndocumentation and lack of awareness of supportive educational programs \nand it is no wonder homeless children and children in foster care are \nonly half as likely to go on to college as their peers.\n  Youth in foster care are less likely to be enrolled in college \npreparatory classes and are more than twice as likely as non-foster \ncare youth to drop out of high school altogether. Because The Higher \nEducation Act supports several programs that motivate and support \ndisadvantaged students to help increase their postsecondary educational \nattainment, it already has many of the tools necessary to intervene in \nthese student lives. My bill would help programs, such as TRIO and GEAR \nUP, target their resources to better serve homeless and foster care \npopulations. Early intervention is key in retaining these students and \npreparing them for post-secondary education.\n  More than 70 percent of teens in foster care desire to go to college, \nonly 27 percent of those who graduate from high school realize that \ndream. Although children and youth who experience the instability of \nhomelessness or foster care represent the full range of academic \ntalents and abilities, their situations create serious barriers to \nschool enrollment, attendance, and success.\n  Homeless and foster care youth do not have the traditional family \nnetwork to encourage or assist them in planning for a college \neducation. These youth need help to select a college, apply for \nadmission and obtaining financial aid. In addition, their student aid \nmust be used for so much more than just tuition and books. They face \nthe daunting challenges of housing, transportation and other basic \nneeds. By assisting these youth to become independent students we will \nincrease their access to student aid for financial aid purposes; \nimprove their changes for a smooth transition into, and completion of, \nhigher learning.\n  Our nation's economic well-being depends on our ability to provide \ngreater access to higher education for students, regardless of their \nfamily background. By passing this bill we guarantee more students than \never will be given the tools they need to attend college and succeed. \nThrough college we provide these vulnerable students with the best hope \nfor escaping the cycle of poverty and homelessness.\n  I look forward to working with HELP Committee Chairman Enzi to \nincorporate these provisions into the Higher Education Act \nreauthorization bill. And again, I thank Senator DeWine for his \ncommitment to these often overlooked children.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1429\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Improving Access to \n     Education for Students Who Are Homeless or in Foster Care \n     Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) According to a study of foster care children in the \n     State of Washington, a child who enters foster care is likely \n     to have poorer academic outcomes than a child not in foster \n     care, even after controlling for a variety of factors such as \n     poverty.\n       (2) Youth in foster care--\n       (A) are less likely to be enrolled in college preparatory \n     classes than non-foster care youth; and\n       (B) are more than twice as likely as non-foster care youth \n     (37 percent as compared to 16 percent) to have dropped out of \n     secondary school.\n       (3) 50 percent of foster youth in the United States \n     graduate from secondary school, compared with 85 percent of \n     youth overall.\n       (4) 70 percent of teens in foster care desire to go to \n     college.\n       (5) A report from Casey Family Programs indicated that, \n     nationwide, less than 27 percent of foster youth who \n     graduated from secondary school went on to college, as \n     compared to 52 percent of the general population. Moreover, \n     the college dropout rate among foster youth is far higher \n     than the rate among other students.\n       (6) A May 2002 report issued by the University of \n     California at Berkeley found that, of more than 3,200 foster \n     care youth who attended a community college from 1992 through \n     2000--\n       (A) 39 percent earned between 1 and 17 credits;\n       (B) 40 percent of the foster care youth earned no credits; \n     and\n       (C) many of the foster care youth did not attempt to take \n     classes for credit, but rather were enrolled in remedial or \n     other non-credit classes.\n       (7) Unaccompanied youth experiencing homelessness often \n     have left home for their own survival.\n\n[[Page S8561]]\n\n       (8) Although children and youth who experience homelessness \n     represent the full range of academic talents and abilities, \n     homelessness creates serious barriers to school enrollment, \n     attendance, and success.\n       (9) The McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. \n     11301 et seq.) requires State educational agencies and local \n     educational agencies to ensure that homeless children and \n     youth receive a free and appropriate public education, but \n     these provisions do not reach beyond secondary education.\n       (10) The barriers created by homelessness to kindergarten \n     through grade 12 education (extreme poverty, residential \n     instability, lack of documentation, and lack of awareness of \n     programs and resources) often are also barriers to \n     postsecondary education.\n       (11) Higher education offers students experiencing \n     homelessness the best hope for escaping poverty and \n     homelessness as adults.\n\n   TITLE I--FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE FOR STUDENTS WHO ARE HOMELESS OR IN \n                              FOSTER CARE\n\n     SEC. 101.

Mr. President, today I join Senator Murray in introducing \nthe ``Improving Access to Education for Students Who Are Homeless or in \nFoster Care Act.'' I thank Senator Murray for her deep commitment to \nthe education of children who are homeless or in foster care. I have \nworked with her on provisions to promote their access to and completion \nof education in both the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act \n(IDEA) reauthorization and the Head Start Act reauthorization and am \npleased to have worked with her again on this bill.\n  In the United States, on any given day, more than half a million \nchildren are in foster care--20,000 of whom are in the State of Ohio, \nalone. In 2003, also know that more than 900,000 children were found to \nbe victims of child abuse or neglect. More than half of the children in \nfoster care experience developmental delays. Children in foster care \nhave three to seven times more chronic medical conditions, birth \ndefects, emotional disorders, and academic failures than children of \nsimilar socioeconomic backgrounds who do not enter foster care.\n  We also know that homeless children face great barriers to higher \neducation. Often, these students have run away from an abusive home, or \nhave been lost to the system. These students also may be living on the \nstreet with a parent--too often with a parent suffering from an \naddiction to alcohol or drugs. These children will move from school to \nschool and shelter to shelter, piecing together their education as they \ncan. This is not good enough. Although we have tried to reach out to \nthese students through the McKinney Vento Homelessness Assistance Act, \nwe need to do more. These children deserve a better chance at an \neducation.\n  Education offers foster care and homeless children their best hope \nfor escaping the poverty and instability they experience. This bill \nincludes additional outreach to these hard to reach populations through \ncurrent Federal education programs, such as TRIO and GEAR UP. It also \nwould expand and clarify the definition of ``Independent Student'' in \norder to accommodate the special circumstances of foster care and \nhomeless children and would allow student financial aid administrators \nadditional flexibility to help this cohort of students attain access to \nhigher education. This bill would create a $20 million demonstration \ngrant program targeting foster and homeless children to help decrease \nthe barriers to higher education by involving stakeholders and their \ncommunities in the outreach process.\n  I look forward to working with HELP Committee Chairman Enzi to \nincorporate these provisions into the Higher Education Act \nreauthorization bill. I appreciate his willingness to incorporate \nprovisions related to homeless and foster children in the Head Start \nAct reauthorization bill, as well. He is equally concerned with the \nwelfare of these children. And again, I thank Senator Murray for her \ncommitment to these children. We cannot afford to overlook their needs.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DeWINE (for himself and Mr. Rockefeller):\n  S. 1430.

A bill to award grants to eligible entities to enable the \nentities to reduce the rate of underage alcohol use and binge drinking \namong students at institutions of higher education; to the Committee on \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I join several of my colleagues today to \nintroduce a series of bills related to the reauthorization of the \nHigher Education Act (HEA). These bills emphasize a number of issues \nthat are vital to higher education, including teacher quality, \nrecruitment, and retention; loan forgiveness for social workers, family \nlawyers, and early childhood teachers; and the reduction of drug use \nand underage drinking at our colleges and universities.\n  The quality of a student's education is the direct result of the \nquality of that student's teachers. If we don't have well trained \nteachers, then future generations of our children will not be well \neducated. That is why I am introducing a bill ``Ready to Educate All \nChildren Act'' that would provide $200 million in grants to our schools \nof education to partner with high-need local schools to ensure that our \nteachers are receiving the best, most extensive training available \nbefore they enter the classroom.\n  Studies find that a majority of graduates of schools of education \nbelieve that the traditional teacher preparation program left them ill \nprepared for the challenges and rigors of the classroom. Part of the \nresponsibility for this lies in the hands of our schools of education. \nHowever, Congress also has a responsibility to give our schools of \neducation the tools they need to make necessary improvements. This new \nbill would create a competitive grant program for schools of education, \nwhich partner with low-income schools to create clinical programs to \ntrain teachers. Additionally, it would require schools of education to \nmake internal changes by working with other departments at the \nuniversity to ensure that teachers are receiving the highest quality \neducation in core academic subjects. Finally, it would require the \ncollege or university to demonstrate a commitment to improving their \nschools of education by providing matching funds.\n  Another bill I am introducing today, is the ``Collaborative \nAgreements to Recruit Educators Act,'' which also would encourage \nimprovement in the education of our Nation's low-income students. \nChildren raised in poverty have a much more difficult time in finishing \nhigh school and going on to college. While about seventy percent of \nchildren in America will graduate from high school, that rate drops to \nfifty percent for low-income students. We know that every day, about \n3,000 children drop out of school. Our Nation's inner city schools have \nsome of the lowest rates of graduation. I strongly believe that \neducation is one of the most important ways to break the cycle of \npoverty. To break that cycle, we must keep our children in school, help \nthem graduate from high school, and increase their access to higher \neducation.\n  My bill would provide grants for collaborative agreements to between \nlocal education agencies in low-income communities and to colleges of \neducation. These partnerships would work to provide services, such as \nmentoring, tutoring, and scholarships through the college of education \nto the students at the partnering school in order to 1. encourage those \nstudents to graduate from high school, 2. let them know of \nopportunities within higher education, and (3) encourage them to become \nteachers, which are so badly needed.\n  Another complex issue affecting the teaching force is the high \npercentage of disillusioned beginning teachers who leave the field. \nThis bill would help combat this issue, as well. Schools of education \nreceiving these grants would be responsible for following their \ngraduates and continuing to provide assistance after they enter the \nclassroom. The more we invest in the education of teachers--especially \nonce they have entered the profession--the more likely they will remain \nin the classroom.\n  To further help teacher quality and retention, I am introducing a \nbill ``The Master Teacher Scholarship Act''--to establish a Master's in \nEducation Scholarship Program. The lack of promotions and salary \nincreases are some of the most pervasive reasons for the \ndisillusionment of teachers. This disillusionment is becoming a crisis \nas half of teachers leave the profession altogether within their first \nfive years of teaching. To both improve the quality of teachers and \nincrease their retention, this bill would provide $30 million in grants \nto schools of education to administer scholarships to eligible \nteachers. In return for the scholarships, teachers would agree to teach \nfor another five years and mentor a novice teacher for two years.\n  Today, along with Senator Dodd, I am introducing the ``Paul Wellstone \nEarly Educator Loan Forgiveness Act.'' Our dear friend and colleague, \nSenator Wellstone, and I had been working on this legislation together \nbefore his tragic death. I know he cared deeply about this issue and \nabout making sure that all children receive a quality education. He was \npassionate about that. Though our bill was originally called the \n``Early Care and Education Loan Forgiveness Act,'' we have renamed our \nbill in Paul's memory.\n  Our bill would expand the loan forgiveness program so that it \nbenefits not just childcare workers, but also early childhood \neducators. This loan forgiveness program would serve as an incentive to \nkeep those educators in the field for longer periods of time. Research \nshows that children who attend quality early childcare programs when \nthey were three or four years old scored better on math, language arts, \nand social skills in early elementary school than children who attended \npoor quality childcare programs. In short, children in early learning \nprograms with high quality teachers--teachers with a Bachelor's degree \nor an Associate's degree or higher--do substantially better.\n  When we examine the number and recent growth of pre-primary education \nprograms, it becomes difficult to differentiate between early education \nand childcare settings because they are so often intertwined--\nespecially considering that about 12 million children younger than age \nfive spend part of their time with a care provider other than a parent \nand that demand for quality childcare and education is growing as more \nmothers enter the workforce.\n  Because this bill targets loan forgiveness to those educators working \nin low-income schools or childcare settings, we can make significant \nstrides toward providing high quality education for all of our young \nchildren, regardless of socioeconomic status. The bill would serve a \ntwofold function. First, it would reward professionals for their \ntraining. Second, it would encourage professionals to remain in the \nprofession over longer periods of time, since more time in the \nprofession leads to higher percentages of loans forgiveness. The bill \nwould result in more educated individuals with more teaching experience \nand lower turnover rates, each of which enhance student performance.\n  I encourage my colleagues to join me in this effort to help ensure \nthat truly\n\n[[Page S8564]]\n\nno children--especially our youngest children--are left behind.\n  I also am working on two bills with my friend and colleague from West \nVirginia, Senator Rockefeller. These bills would provide loan \nforgiveness to students who dedicate their careers to working in the \nrealm of child welfare, including social workers, who work for child \nprotective services, and family law experts.\n\n  Currently, there aren't enough social workers to fill available jobs \nin the area of child welfare. Furthermore, the number of social work \njob openings is expected to increase faster than the average for all \noccupations through 2010. The need for highly qualified social workers \nin the child protective services is reaching crisis level.\n  We also need more qualified individuals focusing on family law. The \nwonderful thing about family law is its focus on rehabilitation--that \nis the rehabilitation of families by helping them through life's \ntransitions, whether it is a family going through a divorce, a family \ndealing with their troubled teenager in the juvenile system, or a child \ngetting adopted and becoming a member of a new family.\n  Across the United States, family, juvenile, and domestic relations \ncourts are experiencing a shortage of qualified attorneys. As many of \nmy colleagues and I know, law school is an expensive investment. In the \nlast 20 years, tuition has increased more than 200 percent. Currently, \nthe average rate of law school debt is about $80,000 per graduate. To \nbe sure, few law school graduates can afford to work in the public \nsector because debts prevent even the most dedicated public service \nlawyer from being able to take these low-paying jobs. This results in a \nshortage of family lawyers.\n  The shortage of family law attorneys also disproportionately impacts \njuveniles. The lack of available representation causes children to \nspend more time in foster care because cases are adjourned or postponed \nwhen they simply cannot find an attorney to represent their rights or \nthose of the parent or guardian. Furthermore, the number of children \ninvolved in the court system is sharply increasing. We need to ensure \nthat the interests of these children are taken care of by making \ncertain they have an advocate--someone working solely on their behalf. \nBy offering loan forgiveness to those willing to pursue careers in the \nchild welfare field, we can increase the number of highly qualified and \ndedicated individuals who work in the realm of child welfare and family \nlaw.\n  Finally, I am introducing a bill today that would help address an \nepidemic--the epidemic of underage drinking on college and university \ncampuses across the United States. This bill would provide grants to \nstates to establish statewide partnerships among colleges and \nuniversities and the surrounding communities to work together to reduce \nunderage and binge drinking and illicit drug use by students.\n  Many States, including my home State of Ohio, have coalitions that \ndeal specifically with the culture of alcohol and drug abuse on \nAmerica's college campuses. They work with the surrounding communities, \nincluding local residents; bar, restaurant, and shop owners; and law \nenforcement officials toward a goal of changing the pervasive culture \nof drug and alcohol abuse. They provide alternative alcohol-free \nevents, as well as support groups for those who choose not to drink. \nThey also educate students about the dangers of alcohol and drug use.\n  Furthermore, the coalitions recognize that while it is important to \npromote an alcohol aware and drug-free campus community, if the \ncommunity surrounding the campus does not promote these initiatives, \nthere will be no long-term solutions. Therefore, these coalitions also \nhave worked to establish regulations both on and off campus, which will \nhelp our Nation's youth to stay healthy, alive, and get the most out of \ntheir time at college. Some of these regulations include the \nregistration of kegs. This provides accountability for both the store \nand the student. This is just an example of one step that colleges, \nlocal communities, and organizations can take.\n  To help start the expansion of these coalitions, this bill would \nprovide $5 million in grants. This is an important demonstration \nproject that would help lead to positive effects for our young people. \nIt is up to us to change the culture, which has been perpetuated by \nyears of complacency and a dismissal tone of ``that's just the way it \nis in college.'' We must protect the health and education of our young \npeople by changing this culture of abuse--and that is exactly what this \nbill would help do.\n  I thank all of my colleagues who have worked with me on these bills. \nI look forward to the reauthorization of the Higher Education Act and \nworking with Chairman Enzi and Ranking Member Kennedy to incorporate \nthese important measures.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. McCAIN (for himself and Mr. Dorgan):\n  S. 1439. A bill to provide for Indian trust asset management reform \nand resolution of historical accounting claims, and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on Indian Affairs.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce the, Indian \nTrust Reform Act of 2005.\n  The following is an overview of the bill, title by title, which is \nfollowed by a discussion of the reasons for the measure.\n\n\nTitle I: Resolution of historical accounting claims in Cobell v. Norton\n\n  Title I of the bill would provide for a lump sum settlement of the \nclaims for an historical accounting that have been asserted in the case \nof Cobell v. Norton. The section would establish a Settlement Fund \nwhich would be administered by the Secretary of the Treasury and a \nSpecial Master. The total amount of the fund is left blank in this \nintroduced version of the bill. The Committee on Indian Affairs will \nhold a hearing on this soon and have further discussions with the \nparties, hopefully to reach a consensus number for the settlement. The \nsettlement fund would be distributed to individual Indians using two \nformulas: part of the fund would be distributed among all claimants \nequally, and part would be distributed under a formula that allocates \nfunds in accordance with a through-put analysis--account holders with \nhigh volume accounts would receive more than those with low volume \naccounts. A portion of the fund would be held in reserve for payment of \nattorneys fees at an hourly rate, for administration of the fund and \nfor claimants who successfully challenge their distribution in court. \nIf any of the reserved funds remain unused, they are to be distributed \nto the claimants under the formula.\n\n\n    Title II: Indian Trust Asset Management Policy Review Commission\n\n  Title II of the bill establishes and sets forth the duties, \nresponsibilities, and authority of a 12-member Indian Trust Asset \nManagement Review Commission. The Commission would have two principal \nareas of responsibility: 1. Reviewing all current trust resource \nmanagement laws, (including regulations), and the Secretary of \nInterior's trust resource management practices, and 2. Following that \nreview, preparing a report to the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs, \nthe House Committee on Resources and the Secretary of Interior \ncontaining the Commission's recommendations for improving the \nmanagement of those assets.\n\n\n   Title III: Indian Trust Resource Management Demonstration Project\n\n  Title III of the bill establishes an eight-year Indian Trust Resource \nManagement Demonstration Project. The demonstration project would \ninitially be open to all Indian tribes participating in section 131 of \nthe Fiscal Year 2005 Interior Appropriations Act and an additional 30 \nIndian tribes that submit applications to the Secretary. Participating \ntribes would negotiate a ``trust resource management plan'' with the \nSecretary, which would remain in effect for the full duration of the \ndemonstration project but would be subject to modification or \ntermination annually. A participating tribe would be allowed to \nnegotiate with the Department of Interior as to how the trust asset \nmanagement budget for the reservation would be prioritized. Self-\ngovernance tribes participating in the demonstration project would also \nbe permitted to develop their own ``customized'' trust asset management \nsystems and practices. Trust assets subject to the plan would have to \nbe managed in accordance with 1. The Federal trust responsibility and \n2. Certain basic standards set forth in the section. The trust asset \nmanagement plan itself would not create, diminish or increase\n\n[[Page S8565]]\n\nthe liability of either the United States or the Indian tribe. The \nIndian tribe would have the right to terminate the plan by giving the \nSecretary notice, but termination would not be effective until the \nbeginning of the next fiscal year.\n\n\n    Title IV: Fractional Interest Purchase and Consolidation Program\n\n  Title IV of the bill would be an amendment to Section 213 of the \nIndian Land Consolidation Act (25 USC 2212). As currently written, \nSection 213 of ILCA authorizes the Secretary to purchase fractional \ninterests in land in accordance with certain requirements. One problem \nwith this program is that the fractional interests are so small that an \noffer of fair market value is such a small amount of money that there \nis little incentive to sell. Accordingly, the amendment would be a new \nsubsection to ILCA Section 213 that would authorize the Secretary to \noffer more than fair market value for fractional interests in tracts of \nland that have 20 or more trust or restricted fractional interests--the \noffer would be fair market value PLUS an additional amount of at least \n$100 but not more than $350.\n  Also, this title would add another new subsection to ILCA section 213 \nthat would authorize the Secretary to offer, along with an offer to \npurchase any interest or interests under section 213, an additional \namount of money to settle any and all mismanagement claims against the \nUnited States that the interest owner may have in connection with the \ntract of land of which the fractional interest is a part. The interest \nowner would have the option of selling his or her interest to the \nSecretary with or without a settlement of mismanagement claims, i.e., \nthe settlement of mismanagement claims could not be made a mandatory \ncondition of the sale of the interest.\n  Also included as part of this title is a provision dealing with \ntracts of extremely fractionated land--specifically, tracts of land \nthat consist of 200 or more fractional trust interests. If the \nSecretary determines that a tract is owned by 200 or more individuals, \nshe is authorized to make the offer (not less than four times fair \nmarket value) via certified mail to each and every trust interest owner \nin the tract. The offer would include a notice that says they have 90 \ndays to reject the offer or it will be deemed to have been accepted. It \nwould include a pre-addressed (back to the Secretary) postage-paid \n``notice of rejection'' form that the offeree may use to reject the \noffer. If they fail to mail the form back in time, they will be given \nanother notice stating that they may withdraw the offer by mailing a \npostage pre-paid ``notice of withdrawal'' form back to the Secretary \nwithin 30 days. If They fail to do that in time, the offer is deemed to \nbe accepted.\n\n\n Title V: Restructuring the Bureau of Indian Affairs and Office of the \n                            Special Trustee\n\n  This title of the bill would reorganize the Bureau of Indian Affairs \nand Office of the Special Trustee for American Indians under a new \noffice within the Department of Interior, an Under Secretary for Indian \nAffairs. The title provides that the Under Secretary has \nresponsibility for the administration of all Indian trust and non-trust \nmatters, including, after a transition period ending on December 31, \n2008, matters currently within the scope of authority of the Special \nTrustee for American Indians under the American Indian Trust Fund \nManagement Reform Act of 1994 (25 USC 4041 et seq.). The Under \nSecretary would oversee a new Office of Trust Reform Implementation and \nOversight, but the Special Trustee would continue performing his duties \nunder the 1994 Act until December 31, 2008, at which time the OST would \nbe abolished.\n\n\n    Title VI: Annual Audit of Indian Trust Funds by the Government \n                         Accountability Office\n\n  Title VI of the bill requires the Government Accountability Office to \ncontract for an annual audit of all funds held in trust by the United \nStates for the benefit of an Indian Tribe or an individual Indian. The \naudit would be conducted in accordance with generally accepted auditing \nprinciples and the Single Audit Act. Copies of each audit report must \nbe submitted to the Secretary of Interior, the Senate Committee on \nIndian Affairs, and the House Committee on Resources.\n  Reasons for the bill: the performance of the United States over the \npast 125 years in its capacity as trustee and manager of Indian trust \nand restricted lands is not something to be proud of. The policy of \nallotting Indian tribal lands, which was made the general Federal \nIndian policy in the 1880s, was one of several federal ``experiments'' \nin Indian matters that have had regrettable results both for Native \nAmericans and for the Government. This policy of the 19th Century has \ncome back to haunt us now in the form of fractionated ownership of \nallotted lands--where some parcels of land are owned by hundreds and in \nsome cases over a thousand different Indian owners. This fractionation \nof ownership has led to a proliferation of individual Indian money \naccounts ``IIM accounts,'' now numbering in the hundreds of thousands, \nall of which the Federal Government has a trust obligation to track and \nmanage.\n  The staggering number of IIM accounts--along with decades of \nmismanagement on the part of Government officials--contributed to the \nconditions that led to the filing of the Federal class action here in \nthe District of Columbia known as Cobell v. Norton. A lot has happened \nin that litigation since it was filed 9 years ago, much of it reported \nin newspapers across the country, but I think it is fair to say that \none thing the case has shown is that the United States has not lived up \nto its duty as a fiduciary to the thousands of Indian beneficiaries of \nIIM accounts.\n  The principal objectives of the Cobell case are to obtain a complete \nhistorical accounting of IIM accounts and to reform the trust itself. \nThe Government has been ordered to perform a complete, detailed \naccounting of transactions relating to IIM accounts and to submit and \nimplement a plan to reform the trust. In hearings before the Committee \non Indian Affairs, officials from the Department of Interior have \nstated that the cost of doing the accounting may run in to multiple \nbillions of dollars, and representatives of the plaintiffs in the case \nas well as the GAO, have stated that much of this accounting cannot be \ndone due to missing or destroyed records, information, or data relating \nto the IIM accounts.\n  The bill I introduce today would provide a resolution of the class \naction relating to an historical accounting and would also bring a \nnumber of important changes to the Indian trust asset management \nsystem. In lieu of an accounting, the bill would create a settlement \nfund and direct the Secretary of the Treasury to develop a formula for \ndistributing the fund to the beneficial owners of IIM accounts in full \nsettlement for losses, errors, and unpaid interest in their IIM \naccounts. Several other aspects of the bill are included for the \npurpose of reforming the Indian trust management system. For example, \nthe bill would create a special commission charged with the \nresponsibility of examining current Indian trust management laws, \nregulations and practices and reporting back to the authorizing \ncommittees of jurisdiction in the Senate and House with recommended \nrevisions of these laws, regulations and practices. It would also \nrestructure the Bureau of Indian Affairs under an Under Secretary For \nIndian Affairs, phasing out the Office of the Special Trustee whose \nresponsibilities would be transferred to the Under Secretary after \nDecember 31, 2008.\n  I would like to thank the National Congress of American Indians, the \nInter-Tribal Monitoring Association, the Affiliated Tribes of Northwest \nIndians, representatives of the plaintiffs as well as many other \nstakeholders for their considerable and helpful input in developing \nthis legislation. The bill does not include everything that they \nrequested, and they may have issues with certain aspects of the bill as \nit is now written. That said, the bill is offered as a starting point \nfor discussion. I do not think that there is any provision in the bill \nthat is immutable, closed to debate or negotiation. Hopefully the \nstakeholders will remain engaged and continue to provide me with \ninformation and suggestions to make it a better bill, a bill that \nbrings substantial improvements to the administration and management of \nIndian trust assets.\n\n[[Page S8566]]\n\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues on both sides of the \naisle to enact this timely legislation. I ask unanimous consent that \nthe full text of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1439\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) Congress has appropriated tens of millions of dollars \n     for purposes of providing an historical accounting of funds \n     held in Individual Indian Money accounts;\n       (2) as of the date of enactment of this Act, the efforts of \n     the Federal Government in conducting historical accounting \n     activities have provided information regarding the \n     feasibility and cost of providing a complete historical \n     accounting of IIM account funds;\n       (3) in the case of many IIM accounts, a complete historical \n     accounting--\n       (A) may be impossible because necessary records and \n     accounting data are missing or destroyed;\n       (B) may take several years to perform even if necessary \n     records are available;\n       (C) may cost the United States hundreds of millions and \n     possibly several billion dollars; and\n       (D) may be impossible to complete before the deaths of many \n     elderly IIM account beneficiaries;\n       (4) without a complete historical accounting, it may be \n     difficult or impossible to ascertain the extent of losses in \n     an IIM account as a result of accounting errors or \n     mismanagement of funds, or the correct amount of interest \n     accrued or owned on the IIM account;\n       (5) the total cost to the United States of providing a \n     complete historical accounting of an IIM account may exceed--\n       (A) the current balance of the IIM account;\n       (B) the total sums of money that have passed through the \n     IIM account; and\n       (C) the enforceable liability of the United States for \n     losses from, and interest in, the IIM account;\n       (6)(A) the delays in obtaining an accounting and in \n     pursuing accounting claims in the case styled Cobell v. \n     Norton, Civil Action No. 96-1285 (RCL) in the United States \n     District Court for the District of Columbia, have created a \n     great hardship on IIM account beneficiaries; and\n       (B) many beneficiaries and their representatives have \n     indicated that they would rather receive monetary \n     compensation than experience the continued frustration and \n     delay associated with an accounting of transactions and funds \n     in their IIM accounts;\n       (7) it is appropriate for Congress, taking into \n     consideration the findings under paragraphs (1) through (6), \n     to provide benefits that are reasonably calculated to be fair \n     and appropriate in lieu of performing an accounting of an IIM \n     account, or assuming liability for errors in such an \n     accounting, mismanagement of IIM account funds (including \n     undetermined amounts of interest in IIM accounts, losses in \n     which may never be discovered or quantified if a complete \n     historical accounting cannot be performed), or breach of \n     fiduciary duties with respect to the administration of IIM \n     accounts, in order to transmute claims by the beneficiaries \n     of IIM accounts for undetermined or unquantified accounting \n     losses and interest to a fixed amount to be distributed to \n     the beneficiaries of IIM accounts;\n       (8) in determining the amount of the payments to be \n     distributed as described in paragraph (7), Congress should \n     take into consideration, in addition to the factors described \n     in paragraphs (1) through (6)--\n       (A) the risks and costs to IIM account beneficiaries, as \n     well as any delay, associated with the litigation of claims \n     that will be resolved by this title; and\n       (B) the benefits to IIM account beneficiaries available \n     under this title;\n       (9) the situation of the Osage Nation is unique because, \n     among other things, income from the mineral estate of the \n     Osage Nation is distributed to individuals through headright \n     interests that belong not only to members of the Osage \n     Nation, but also to members of other Indian tribes, and to \n     non-Indians; and\n       (10) due to the unique situation of the Osage Nation, the \n     Osage Nation, on its own behalf, has filed various actions in \n     Federal district court and the United States Court of Federal \n     Claims seeking accountings, money damages, and other legal \n     and equitable relief\n\n     SEC. 102.

Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senator McCain in \nintroducing this historic legislation. This bill is a necessary \nstarting point to begin resolution of the longstanding claims in the \nCobell v. Norton litigation, which involves the Federal Government's \nmismanagement of hundreds of thousands of individual Indian money \naccounts. The bill was drafted in a bipartisan manner and attempts to \naddress the principles recently developed and set forth by Indian \nCountry.\n  I want to thank the National Congress of American Indians and the \nInterTribal Monitoring Association for leading the consultative process \nutilized in developing these principles. Those principles helped guide \nthe drafting of this bill. The current language of the bill, however, \nis not perfect. Rather, it is intended to be a starting point for \nsubstantive and productive dialogue between the parties. Recently, the \nparties engaged in a 9-month mediation process that failed to result in \nany type of potential resolution. This litigation is nearly a decade \nold and has no end in sight. It is my hope that this bill will assist \nthe parties in reaching some type of resolution of this litigation.\n  The individual Indian trust account system was not a voluntary system \nelected by the individual Indians, but rather one imposed upon them by \nthe federal government more than one hundred years ago. The Federal \nGovernment serves as trustee of these accounts and the individual \nIndians are beneficiaries. Unfortunately, the Cobell litigation has \nbrought to light a very disturbing problem: the Federal Government, as \ntrustee, may not be able to provide an accurate and proper historical \naccounting of these accounts. Moreover, the Federal Government may not \nknow the proper balances of these accounts nor have sufficient \ndocumentation to determine the value of these accounts. Further, \ngovernment officials have stated that a full transaction-by-transaction \naccounting, presuming one can be performed, would cost more than $10 \nbillion. This cost would not include any monies determined to be \nunaccounted for or the interest on those monies.\n  The claims in the Cobell litigation on examples of broken promises \nand trust responsibilities to the Native Americans of this country, but \nit is my hope and desire that this bill will help us keep those \npromises, fulfill our responsibilities to Native Americans, and restore \ntrust and faith in our government. If Congress continues to allow the \nCobell litigation to proceed, the individual beneficiaries of these \naccounts will not be alive to reap the benefits these accounts and the \ntrust resource management system were intended to bestow.\n  It is an honor to serve as Vice Chairman of the Committee on Indian \nAffairs alongside chairman McCain. We have publicly pledged that we \nwill make our best effort to resolve this long overdue injustice to the \nfirst Americans. The introduction of this bill is the first step toward \nthat goal.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/20/senate-section/article/S8573-1", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8573-S8574]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 1303.

THE UNITED STATES-CHINA ECONOMIC AND SECURITY \n                   REVIEW COMMISSION.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The 2004 Report to Congress of the United States-China \n     Economic and Security Review Commission states that--\n       (A) China's State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs) lack adequate \n     disclosure standards, which creates the potential for United \n     States investors to unwittingly contribute to enterprises \n     that are involved in activities harmful to United States \n     security interests;\n       (B) United States influence and vital long-term interests \n     in Asia are being challenged by China's robust regional \n     economic engagement and diplomacy;\n       (C) the assistance of China and North Korea to global \n     ballistic missile proliferation is extensive and ongoing;\n       (D) China's transfers of technology and components for \n     weapons of mass destruction (WMD) and their delivery systems \n     to countries of concern, including countries that support \n     acts of international terrorism, has helped create a new tier \n     of countries with the capability to produce WMD and ballistic \n     missiles;\n       (E) the removal of the European Union arms embargo against \n     China that is currently under consideration in the European \n     Union would accelerate weapons modernization and dramatically \n     enhance Chinese military capabilities;\n       (F) China's recent actions toward Taiwan call into question \n     China's commitments to a peaceful resolution;\n       (G) China is developing a leading-edge military with the \n     objective of intimidating Taiwan and deterring United States \n     involvement in the Strait, and China's qualitative and \n     quantitative military advancements have already resulted in a \n     dramatic shift in the cross-Strait military balance toward \n     China; and\n       (H) China's growing energy needs are driving China into \n     bilateral arrangements that undermine multilateral efforts to \n     stabilize oil supplies and prices, and in some cases may \n     involve dangerous weapons transfers.\n       (2) On March 14, 2005, the National People's Congress \n     approved a law that would authorize the use of force if \n     Taiwan formally declares independence.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--\n       (1) Plan.--The President is strongly urged to take \n     immediate steps to establish a plan to implement the \n     recommendations contained in the 2004 Report to Congress of \n     the United States-China Economic and Security Review \n     Commission in order to correct the negative implications that \n     a number of current trends in United States-China relations \n     have for United States long-term economic and national \n     security interests.\n       (2) Contents.--Such a plan should contain the following:\n       (A) Actions to address China's policy of undervaluing its \n     currency, including--\n       (i) encouraging China to provide for a substantial upward \n     revaluation of the Chinese yuan against the United States \n     dollar;\n       (ii) allowing the yuan to float against a trade-weighted \n     basket of currencies; and\n       (iii) concurrently encouraging United States trading \n     partners with similar interests to join in these efforts.\n       (B) Actions to make better use of the World Trade \n     Organization (WTO) dispute settlement mechanism and \n     applicable United States trade laws to redress China's unfair \n     trade practices, including China's exchange rate \n     manipulation, denial of trading and distribution rights, lack \n     of intellectual property rights protection, objectionable \n     labor standards, subsidization of exports, and forced \n     technology transfers as a condition of doing business. The \n     United States Trade Representative should consult with our \n     trading partners regarding any trade dispute with China.\n       (C) Actions to encourage United States diplomatic efforts \n     to identify and pursue initiatives to revitalize United \n     States engagement with China's Asian neighbors. The \n     initiatives should have a regional focus and complement \n     bilateral efforts. The Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation \n     forum (APEC) offers a ready mechanism for pursuit of such \n     initiatives.\n       (D) Actions by the administration to hold China accountable \n     for proliferation of prohibited technologies and to secure \n     China's agreement to renew efforts to curtail North Korea's \n     commercial export of ballistic missiles.\n       (E) Actions to encourage the creation of a new United \n     Nations framework for monitoring the proliferation of WMD and \n     their delivery systems in conformance with member nations' \n     obligations under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, the \n     Biological Weapons Convention, and the Chemical Weapons \n     Convention. The new monitoring body should be delegated \n     authority to apply sanctions to countries violating these \n     treaties in a timely manner, or, alternatively, should be \n     required to report all violations in a timely manner to the \n     Security Council for discussion and sanctions.\n       (F) Actions by the administration to conduct a fresh \n     assessment of the ``One China'' policy, given the changing \n     realities in China and Taiwan. This should include a review \n     of--\n       (i) the policy's successes, failures, and continued \n     viability;\n       (ii) whether changes may be needed in the way the United \n     States Government coordinates its defense assistance to \n     Taiwan, including the need for an enhanced operating \n     relationship between United States and Taiwan defense \n     officials and the establishment of a United States-Taiwan \n     hotline for dealing with crisis situations;\n\n[[Page S8577]]\n\n       (iii) how United States policy can better support Taiwan's \n     breaking out of the international economic isolation that \n     China seeks to impose on it and whether this issue should be \n     higher on the agenda in United States-China relations; and\n       (iv) economic and trade policy measures that could help \n     ameliorate Taiwan's marginalization in the Asian regional \n     economy, including policy measures such as enhanced United \n     States-Taiwan bilateral trade arrangements that would include \n     protections for labor rights, the environment, and other \n     important United States interests.\n       (G) Actions by the Secretaries of State and Energy to \n     consult with the International Energy Agency with the \n     objective of upgrading the current loose experience-sharing \n     arrangement, whereby China engages in some limited exchanges \n     with the organization, to a more structured arrangement \n     whereby China would be obligated to develop a meaningful \n     strategic oil reserve, and coordinate release of stocks in \n     supply-disruption crises or speculator-driven price spikes.\n       (H) Actions by the administration to develop and publish a \n     coordinated, comprehensive national policy and strategy \n     designed to meet China's challenge to maintaining United \n     States scientific and technological leadership and \n     competitiveness in the same way the administration is \n     presently required to develop and publish a national security \n     strategy.\n       (I) Actions to revise the law governing the Committee on \n     Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), including \n     expanding the definition of national security to include the \n     potential impact on national economic security as a criterion \n     to be reviewed, and transferring the chairmanship of CFIUS \n     from the Secretary of the Treasury to a more appropriate \n     executive branch agency.\n       (J) Actions by the President and the Secretaries of State \n     and Defense to press strongly their European Union \n     counterparts to maintain the EU arms embargo on China.\n       (K) Actions by the administration to restrict foreign \n     defense contractors, who sell sensitive military use \n     technology or weapons systems to China, from participating in \n     United States defense-related cooperative research, \n     development, and production programs. Actions by the \n     administration may be targeted to cover only those technology \n     areas involved in the transfer of military use technology or \n     weapons systems to China. The administration should provide a \n     comprehensive annual report to the appropriate committees of \n     Congress on the nature and scope of foreign military sales to \n     China, particularly sales by Russia and Israel.\n       (L) Any additional actions outlined in the 2004 Report to \n     Congress of the United States-China Economic and Security \n     Review Commission that affect the economic or national \n     security of the United States.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 1313.

Mr. President, yesterday, President Bush fulfilled his \nconstitutional duty and nominated John Roberts to fill the vacancy left \nby Justice Sandra Day O'Connor on the Supreme Court of the United \nStates. The spotlight is now on the Senate of the United States of \nAmerica. The President has done his duty, and now we need to do ours.\n  Let me first pay tribute to Justice O'Connor who has been a real \ntrailblazer in her own right. The first woman on the Supreme Court, a \nthoughtful and dedicated jurist, she has ably served on the highest \nCourt for the past nearly 24 years. Her announced retirement creates \nthe first vacancy in nearly 11 years. This has been the longest period \nwith the same set of Justices in more than 175 years.\n  Article II, section 2 of the Constitution says that the President \nalone nominates, but he appoints only with the advice and consent of \nthe Senate. One of the best shorthand ways of understanding the \nSenate's role is that by deciding whether to consent to the nomination, \nwe give the President advice about whether to appoint the person he has \nnominated. Traditionally, we have done so by means of an up-or-down \nvote on the Senate floor.\n  I commend the President and his team of senior advisers for broadly \nsoliciting the views of Senators and other interested parties. The \nPresident and his staff spoke with more than two-thirds of the Members \nof this body, over 70 Senators, an absolutely unprecedented level of \ninteraction.\n  For some, though, it appears that even extensive consultation with \nall 100 Senators would not be enough if they did not like the \nPresident's nominee. On the other hand, if they did like the nominee, I \nsuppose they would declare a 5-minute chat with a Senate staffer to \nhave been a consultative triumph.\n  No President need consult at all with any Senator or with anyone else \nfor that matter. The President does so because, in his judgment, it \nwill help him fulfill his constitutional responsibility. President Bush \nhas done that and has nominated John Roberts to be the 109th individual \nto serve on the Supreme Court in American history. The ball is now in \nour court.\n  Judge Roberts has served on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the \nDistrict of Columbia Circuit ever since we confirmed him on May 8, \n2003, without even a rollcall vote, I might add, one of the few people \nwho have ever been confirmed by unanimous consent on the floor of the \nSenate.\n  Judge Roberts was so easily confirmed because he is so eminently \nqualified. He graduated summa cum laude from Harvard Law School and \nserved as managing editor of the Harvard Law Review--no small \nachievement. In other words, No. 1 in his class. He clerked for Judge \nHenry Friendly, one of the alltime great judges on the U.S. Court of \nAppeals for the Second Circuit, and then for Chief Justice William \nRehnquist on the U.S. Supreme Court, one of the alltime great Justices \non the Supreme Court.\n  Judge Roberts served as Special Assistant to the Attorney General, \nAssociate Counsel to President Ronald Reagan, and Principal Deputy \nSolicitor General under the first President Bush. And before his \njudicial appointment, he was head of the appellate practice group at \nthe distinguished law firm, internationally recognized, of Hogan & \nHartson.\n  He has been widely acknowledged as one of the most accomplished \nappellate attorneys in America, having argued nearly 40 cases before \nthe Supreme Court on a wide range of issues from antitrust and the \nfirst amendment to Indian law, bankruptcy, and labor law.\n  Not surprisingly, the American Bar Association unanimously gave Judge \nRoberts its highest well-qualified rating for his appeals court \nappointment. This has been the Democrats' gold standard for evaluating \njudicial nominees, and he has met every aspect of that standard.\n  The question now is how we should evaluate Judge Roberts' nomination \nto the Supreme Court and what standards we should apply. There is more \nconfusion about that than there should be. Yet I believe, like so many \nother endeavors, ending in the right place requires starting in the \nright place.\n  An effective process for hiring or selecting someone to fill a \nposition, any position, must start with an accurate description of that \nposition. I am reminded of a 1998 article by Judge Harry Edwards \nappointed in 1980 by President Jimmy Carter to the U.S. Court of \nAppeals for the DC Circuit. I was in this body at the time. He was that \ncourt's chief judge from 1994 to 2001 and a colleague of Judge Roberts. \nJudge Edwards warned that giving the public a distorted view of what \njudges do is bad for both the judiciary and the rule of law.\n  The debate about judicial selection is a debate about what judges do, \nabout their proper place in our system of representative government. \nGetting the judicial job description right is necessary for a \nlegitimate and effective selection process. It defines the \nqualifications for the job. It identifies the criteria we should apply. \nIt guides the questions that may properly be asked and answered and the \nconclusions that should be reached.\n  Judges take law that they did not make and cannot change, determine \nwhat it means, and apply it to the facts of a legal dispute. That is \nwhat judges do. That judicial job description applies across the board. \nIt does not depend on the parties or the issues before the court. \nIt does not depend on the law that is involved in a particular case. \nAnd it certainly does not depend on which side wins or should win.\n\n  I believe we must help our fellow citizens better understand what \njudges do so they can better evaluate what we will be doing in the \nweeks ahead as we consider this nomination now before us.\n  Without in any way trivializing the work of judges, I want to use a \npractical example because I believe it can be simple without being \nsimplistic.\n  Judges are like umpires or referees. They are neutral officials who \ntake rules they did not make and cannot change and apply those rules to \na contest between two parties or multiple parties.\n  How would we evaluate the performance of an umpire or referee? Would \nwe say he or she did a good job as long as our favorite team won the \ngame? If we were hiring an umpire or referee, would we grill him or her \nabout which side he or she were likely to favor in the upcoming \nmatches? Of course not.\n  Desirable results neither justify an umpire or referee twisting the \nrules during the game nor are automatic proof that the umpire or \nreferee is fair and impartial. Umpires and referees must be fair and \nimpartial from beginning to end during the contest before them. They do \nnot pick the winner before the game starts, nor do they manipulate the \nprocess along the way to produce the winner they want.\n  In the same way, we must not evaluate judges solely by whether we \nlike their decisions or whether their decisions favor a particular \npolitical agenda. The political ends do not justify the judicial means.\n  This is a very important point, something we must keep in clear focus \nthroughout the weeks ahead. That is why I wanted to raise it now at the \nbeginning of the confirmation process.\n  One thing that is becoming increasingly clear is not everyone who \nsays\n\n[[Page S8585]]\n\njudges must interpret but not make the law means the same thing. Some \nwho use that language still determine whether that standard is met the \nsame old way by whether a judge's decisions meet a litmus test.\n  Once again, an umpire or referee is not there to pick the winner. He \nor she is there to fairly and impartially apply the rules.\n  Similarly, judges are not there to pick the winner. They are there to \nfairly and impartially apply the law.\n  I emphasize this because it is at the heart of this entire debate \nover judicial selection, and I will be returning to it throughout this \nprocess.\n  We may like or dislike a judge's decision, but that is not the point. \nHis or her decisions may be consistent with certain political \ninterests, but that is not the point. That is not what judges do. It is \nnot their role in our system of representative government.\n  Rather, if the people do not like what the faithful and impartial \napplication of the law produces, then they and their elected \nrepresentatives can change the law.\n  That is our rule in our system of representative Government. \nExpecting judges to do our job--our legislative job--undermines the \njudicial branch and demeans the legislative branch. Simply put, judges \nmust be evaluated not by the results they reach but by the process they \nfollow to reach those results. That is what judges do.\n  Mark my words, we will hear in the days and weeks ahead this group or \nthat Senator demanding to know whether the nominee now before us would \nproduce the results they want or that they like. They want to know \nwhether the nominee will rule this way on this issue and that way on \nthis other issue. Some may try to cloak their mission, perhaps using \nterms their focus groups say will go down more smoothly with the \npublic. But we all know what is going on. They want to know which side \nthe umpire or referee will favor. They want to know that their team \nwill have an upper hand even before that team takes the field.\n  In recent days, we have heard speeches by Senators and seen letters \nby interest groups and law professors with lists of questions to ask \nthis nominee. Most of those questions are geared in one way or another \nto finding out how this nominee would likely rule; that is, the results \nthis nominee would likely deliver on certain issues.\n  Past nominees, including virtually every current member of the \nSupreme Court, have resisted such intrusive attempts to extract either \ncommitments or previews of future rulings. In that way, judicial \nnominees sometimes appear to have a deeper commitment to judicial \nindependence than some Senators.\n  I expect Judge Roberts will take a judicious approach to answering \nquestions, mindful of both the judicial position he already occupies \nand the one to which he has been nominated.\n  Last night, the head of one of the leftwing groups primed to attack \nJudge Roberts was on one of the cable talk shows as the news about the \nnomination circulated. It took him about 15 seconds to say the words, \n``serious problems,'' regarding this superbly qualified nominee.\n\n  Within minutes of the President's announcement last night, other \ngroups had already proclaimed the nominee an unacceptable extremist.\n  That kind of knee-jerk, results-oriented standard is wrong, whether \nsuch calls come from the left or the right.\n  As Judge Edwards reminded us, misrepresenting what judges do harms \nboth the judiciary and the rule of law.\n  Judges take law they did not make and cannot change, determine what \nthat law means, and apply it to settle legal disputes. That is what \njudges do.\n  In the days and weeks ahead, let us keep that job description in mind \nand set about determining whether the nominee now before us can do that \njob.\n  Judge Roberts twice came before the Judiciary Committee. As a matter \nof fact, he had to wait 14 years to finally be confirmed by the Senate. \nHe was nominated by George Herbert Walker Bush, Bush 1, and then \nrenominated by Bush 2, George W. Bush. But I remember him when he came \nbefore the committee. We had two hearings for him. I remember him as an \nintelligent, fair-minded, and thoughtful person, and so does everybody \nelse who knows him.\n  While I, of course, must withhold final judgment on Judge Roberts' \nnomination to the Supreme Court until after the confirmation hearing, \nmy initial reaction is President Bush appears to have submitted to the \nSenate a well-qualified nominee with the kind of intellect, integrity, \nand independence that is required for a Supreme Court Justice.\n  We must apply the right standard as we evaluate this nominee.\n  Having said all of that, I understand Senators are saying they can \nask any question they want, and I have said Senators on the Judiciary \nCommittee can ask any question they want, no matter how stupid the \nquestion may be. And we have all asked stupid questions from time to \ntime, I am sure. At least most of us have. But the judge does not have \nto answer those questions. In fact, under the Canons of Judicial \nEthics, judges should not be opining or answering questions about \nissues that may possibly come before them in the future.\n  I would like this body to remember some past nominations, and I will \ncite with particularity the nomination of Antonin Scalia to become a \nJustice on the U.S. Supreme Court. I remember time after time Senators \nasking him questions about how he might rule in the future on various \nissues, including Roe v. Wade. He refused to answer those questions \nbecause he thought those issues might come before him as a Justice on \nthe Supreme Court and, frankly, wanted to abide by the Canons of \nJudicial Ethics. He was not overly pressured. The Judiciary Committee \ntreated him with respect. He passed through the Senate 100 to zip and, \nof course, has become one of the leading conservative jurists in the \nhistory of the Court. But he did not have to answer questions that \nasked for specific conclusions in areas that likely would come before \nthe Court, and that is almost anything. In this day and age, there is \nso much litigation almost anything could come before the Court.\n  The second illustration is the Ruth Bader Ginsburg illustration. Ruth \nBader Ginsburg, when she came before the Senate Judiciary Committee, \nrefused to answer questions with regard to matters that might come \nbefore her if she would be confirmed as a Justice to the U.S. Supreme \nCourt.\n  Our side did not overly press her to answer those questions. We did \nnot scream and shout about, She has to answer my questions or I am not \ngoing to vote for her. We did not make demands on her that were \ninappropriate. We did not have outside groups giving us questions to \nask that are outrageous and formed for the purpose of trying to scuttle \nthe nomination. She took that position, and we honored her in taking \nthat position.\n  If I recall it correctly, she passed through the Senate I believe 96 \nto 3. We knew that she was a social liberal. We conservatives who are \npro-life knew she was pro-abortion. We knew that she differed with our \nside on many issues. We also knew that she was qualified, and we knew \nshe deserved a vote up or down out of respect for the position, out of \nrespect for the U.S. Supreme Court, and out of respect for her. She \nreceived her vote up or down, and there was not a lot of screaming and \nshouting about it, nor were there threats made, nor were there threats \nthat we might someday filibuster her if she did not agree with the \nresults we wanted her to rule on in advance.\n  That is what is going on, and it has been going on ever since the \nRehnquist nomination for Chief Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court. It \nhas only gone on on one side, and that is the Democrat side, in a \nseries of very embarrassing Supreme Court nomination proceedings, \nstarting with Justice Rehnquist. Why, some even violated the law and \nput out some of his medical records that were highly confidential.\n  When Bob Bork came up, it was unmitigated the way they treated him. \nEven Justice Souter was mistreated because they thought he might \npossibly be pro-life. Justice Kennedy was not as mistreated as the \nothers, but they were very concerned because they thought he might be \npro-life. In fact, even Justice O'Connor when she came to the floor had \nher critics on both sides because they were afraid she might be one way \nor the other on Roe v. Wade. The fact is, we now know where Justice \nO'Connor, Justice Kennedy, and Justice Souter are on these issues, but \nwe\n\n[[Page S8586]]\n\ndid not know at the time, nor do we know where to-be Justice Roberts is \non these issues as well. Nobody has asked him those questions and \nnobody should because those questions are all hot-button issues that \nmay come before the Supreme Court.\n  If there has ever been anybody qualified to go on the Supreme Court, \none would have to say John Roberts meets every requisite standard to be \nconfirmed as a Justice on the Supreme Court. This is a brilliant man. \nThis is an honest man with a sense of humor. This is a leading \nappellate advocate. He has held responsible positions in Government. He \nhas risen to the top of the legal profession. He has the highest \nrecommendation of the American Bar Association for the circuit court of \nappeals seat. He is one of the great legal thinkers of America. How he \nwill rule on various issues I, frankly, do not know. I believe him to \nbe conservative. The President said he would appoint only \nconservatives, which is his right. That is what one gets when they vote \nfor President.\n  If I have ever seen anybody who deserves being on the Court more than \nJohn Roberts, I have to think pretty hard. John Roberts is a fine man. \nI hope he will be treated with great respect and deference, and I hope \nthese very partisan, very nasty groups from the left and maybe even the \nright pack up their tents and go home because they do not belong in \nthis process the way they are acting, though in a free country they can \nact that way, and I would fight for their right to do so. We should not \nbe influenced by that type of inappropriate, prejudgmental approach to \nSupreme Court nominees.\n  I believe John Roberts will become a Justice on the U.S. Supreme \nCourt, I hope expeditiously, certainly before the first Monday in \nOctober so that the Court can have a full complement. I believe the \nSenate will overwhelmingly support him, and I hope that is the case. If \nit is not, then we are going to have to reexamine the way things go \naround here.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thune). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I rise today to briefly discuss the \nnomination of Judge John Roberts and commend the President for \nsubmitting for our consideration a superbly qualified nominee who has \nthe requisite background and experience to serve the Nation well as the \nnext Justice of the Supreme Court. Indeed, I think the President, after \nhearing advice from a whole host of different areas, simply decided to \nappoint the best person he found in America. That is what he did. I am \nproud of him. I think it is the right thing to do, and I believe this \nwill be proven out as time goes by.\n  I don't know John Roberts personally, but I do know his record. I \nstudied it 2 years ago when this Senate provided its unanimous advice \nand consent to place him in his current position on the District of \nColumbia Circuit Court of Appeals. We did so with the knowledge that \nthe D.C. Circuit in many instances has served as the launching pad for \nSupreme Court nominees. So I hope this process will be conducted with \ndignity and respect and that we will be able to have him in place \nbefore the Supreme Court convenes in October.\n  We considered his record then in great detail. People were heard \nfrom; people submitted information. In fact, 152 lawyers wrote in \nsupport of him. But he was looked at hard then. Only three people voted \nagainst him in the committee, and he was unanimously confirmed in this \nChamber.\n  A Supreme Court Jurist should have high standards. He or she should \nbe committed to the rule of law and to resist the temptation to \nlegislate from the bench. He or she should believe in the Constitution \nand adhere to the provisions provided in that great document regardless \nof whether he or she believes personally that those are correct. They \ndo not have to agree with the provisions. They didn't write the \nprovisions. They were written by ``we the people'' of the United States \nof America.\n  I participated in that hearing 2 years ago, and he gave the committee \na commitment that he would not carry a political agenda to the D.C. \nCircuit, that he would adhere to the law rather than follow politics. \nAnd over the last 2 years as a judge on the D.C. Circuit he has \nfulfilled that commitment. So I think and hope that he is off to a good \nstart in this process.\n  Make no mistake about it, Senators will have some questions, and \nhaving witnessed Mr. Roberts' eloquent testimony and principled \napproach to jurisprudence during his last hearing, I know he will have \nthe answers to those questions. He very simply won Senators over during \nhis last hearing, and this is why I believe he was confirmed with a \nstrong vote. I am sure the results will be the same this year.\n  The Senate must treat the nominee fairly and have a fair and \ndignified process. Converting legal disagreements into personal attacks \non the nominees as we have seen in the past in recent years is not \nappropriate. It is beneath the dignity of the Senate. It is not proper, \nand it should not be done. In many instances nominees have been \nunfairly personally attacked for simply following the law as they saw \nit.\n  So I am concerned about a fair process, not so much from the Members \nof our Senate--hopefully, that will not occur this time--but from some \nof the hard left attack groups.\n  A few weeks ago this cartoon appeared in the paper, and I would like \nto refer to it. I think it is a bit humorous, but I agree it raised a \nlot of money. It says: Don't let Bush nominate this rightwing extremist \nnut to the Supreme Court. And then leaves blank the name. So he hasn't \nnominated anybody yet, but they have already raised their money and \nlaid the game plan to attack whoever comes up as being some extremist \nrightwing nut. I think that is pretty interesting. They say here we \nwill plug the photo in as soon as we find out who it is.\n  I believe we have another one that I think is also humorous, but it \nhas a lot of truth in it. It says: We're here to voice our strongest \nopposition to the Bush Supreme Court nominee--whoever he may be.\n  That is where we are. A lot of money has been raised by groups. For \nthe first time I think, Mr. President, conservative groups, or groups \nthat tend to support the President's nominees raise money, too, so we \nmight have activity on both sides. That has not been the case in the \npast.\n  We laugh at these little cartoons and they are not a perfect truth, \nbut they have some truth in them. But last night the NOW group \nannounced right after the nomination that the President had nominated \nan anti-Roe judge and that the lives of women in America were at stake. \nThe People for the American Way contend that Judge Roberts' record does \nnot demonstrate a fundamental commitment to civil and constitutional \nrights. And other complaints have been raised about him before the ink \nwas dry on the nomination. So I hope that instead of buying into these \ngroups' broken records--the same charges that are paraded out every \ntime a Bush nominee is submitted--we will study Judge Roberts' record \nand have a fair process and consider what scholars in this country are \nsaying--practicing lawyers, judges with whom he practiced and before \nwhom he practiced. These are objective observers. Many of them are \nDemocrats. They will provide far more valid insight than hard left \ngroups such as MoveOn.Org or People for the American Way.\n\n  This is what we know about Judge Roberts so far. He has a keen \nintellect, sound legal judgment, and the highest level of integrity. He \ngraduated from Harvard college in 3 years summa cum laude and the \nHarvard Law School where he served as managing editor of the Harvard \nLaw Review. And, of course, serving on the law review at a law school \nis a great honor, and to be an editor or managing editor of that law \nreview is one of the highest honors any graduating senior can be given \nby his peers who elect him to that position.\n  After graduating from law school, he clerked for one of the most \nesteemed and respected jurists in the country, Judge Henry J. Friendly \non the Second Circuit Court of Appeals in New York, and then went on to \nclerk with Chief Justice William Rehnquist on the U.S.\n\n[[Page S8587]]\n\nSupreme Court, the very Court he has now been nominated to serve on. He \nhas clerked for the Chief Justice of the United States. He sat there at \nhis right hand. He has helped him develop and write the opinions and do \nthe research that goes into rendering an opinion. As a result, he has \nhad very good experience for that position. I am sure there are perhaps \nmany, hundreds perhaps, lawyers who would love to serve as Judge Henry \nFriendly's law clerk. There would be thousands that apply before the \nfew are selected to clerk on the U.S. Supreme Court. Why? Because they \nselect only the best. They select candidates who have high academic \nrecords and proven public integrity. So he served in the White House \ncounsel's office, served as the Principal Deputy Solicitor General to \nthe United States Department of Justice. The Solicitor General is the \nGovernment's lawyer to the courts of America, the appellate courts.\n  The Solicitor General's office sends the lawyers into the U.S. \nSupreme Court to stand up in that Court and represent the United \nStates. I was a U.S. attorney, and in the U.S. district court in \nMobile, AL, it was my honor and pleasure on a regular basis to stand \nbefore the U.S. district judge and say, ``The United States is ready, \nYour Honor.'' To represent the United States of America in court is a \ngreat honor. To represent the United States of America in the greatest \nCourt in the history of the world, the U.S. Supreme Court, is a great \nhonor. As the Principal Deputy Solicitor General, that is what he did \non a regular basis.\n  Prior to assuming his current position, he was known as probably the \nmost respected appellate lawyer in the United States, having argued 39 \ncases before the U.S. Supreme Court. When you have an important case, \nyou want the best lawyer in America to represent you in the Supreme \nCourt, and he was selected time and again by people to represent them \nin this highest Court, which is, indeed, a high compliment. His \nexperience goes beyond what I have described here. He practiced in one \nof the Nation's top law firms and has extensive government experience. \nThe American Bar Association, which rates judge nominees--they go out \nand interview people who have litigated for them, litigated against \nthem, judges before whom they practice, and they evaluate how fine that \nnominee is. They have just a few levels of recommendation, but the best \none, ``well-qualified,'' is reserved for a small number. Judge Roberts \nwas given the highest rating of the American Bar Association to serve \nin his current position, and I would not be surprised if he doesn't get \nit for the Supreme Court.\n  So I hope we will give him a fair process, that we will avoid \nestablishing a litmus test. However, it does concern me that one Member \nhas already said, ``We need to know where John Roberts is on the \nissues, whose side he's on.''\n  Well, you can't demand that a judge be on your side as a price for \nconfirmation. What do we mean, whose side they are on? What do we mean? \nWhose side are they are on? By definition, a judge is a person who is \nunbiased, a neutral referee, a person who treats everyone respectfully \nand then follows the law in a dispassionate, disinterested manner. That \nis why we give them a lifetime appointment.\n\n  We cannot go down this road asking judges, nominees, to commit to a \nspecific decision or to promise to be favorable to one view or another \nthat a certain Senator may have. What kind of disaster would that be? \nIt would invade the independence of the judiciary. Judges have to be \nneutral arbiters. They are not to call the balls and strikes before the \npitches are thrown, for Heaven's sake. We must not require him or \ndemand of him that he state how he expects to decide cases. That \nviolates the independence of the judiciary.\n  What I will ask him to do is to demonstrate a fidelity to the law, a \ncommitment not to legislate from the bench, and to leave the \nlegislation to the Congress and the State. He has demonstrated that \nover time.\n  The President has made a very wise decision. This nominee, from his \npast performance in the Judiciary Committee, has shown poise, good \njudgment, and a clear ability to articulate important issues to the \nSenators in an effective way that has won their respect. I am excited \nfor him.\n  I also am pleased to note he was chosen to be captain of his high \nschool football team. I will say this: They do not elect flakes to be \ncaptain of the football team. These are people who players have seen \nand worked with under difficult circumstances, and they respected him \nenough to choose him. He will be an outstanding member of the U.S. \nSupreme Court.\n  This Senate will be tested. Will we be objective? Will we be fair? \nWill we give this incredibly superb nominee the fair and just hearing \nto which he is entitled?\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/20/senate-section/article/S8587-1", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8587]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ORDERS FOR THURSDAY, JULY 21, 2005\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS.

In addition to highlighting some positive \nareas the committee focused on, I do want to highlight a few concerns.\n  First, I am pleased that an additional $50 billion has been \nauthorized for ongoing military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan for \nthe first few months of fiscal year 2006. I am disappointed that the \nadministration's request did not include any funding to support our \ntroops in their ongoing operations in Iraq and Afghanistan for 2006, \nand that they have not yet done enough to provide the needed \naccountability for how funds in Iraq and Afghanistan have been used so \nfar. I think Congress has done the right thing by taking the initiative \nto provide funding now for these ongoing operations, rather than\n\n[[Page S8588]]\n\nmaking the Army and the other services absorb these enormous expenses \nuntil next spring. It is imperative that we include an authorization of \nadditional funding in this bill.\n  But in the long term, we cannot continue to rely on supplemental \nfunding. The President should start submitting budgets that recognize \nthese enormous costs. The continued use of emergency authorizations to \nfund the global war on terrorism, and the administration's continued \nfailure to include the true cost of the war in the annual authorization \nrequest are bad for our military and are bad fiscal policy. For this \nreason, in the fiscal year 2005 emergency supplemental, we requested \nthat the Secretary of Defense provide a report to the Speaker of the \nHouse of Representatives, the majority leader of the Senate, and the \ncongressional Defense Committees that identifies such things as \nsecurity, economic, and Iraqi security force training performance \nstandards and goals. The report must also include an assessment of US. \nmilitary requirements, including planned force rotations, through the \nend of calendar year 2006. Once the process needed to identify these \nrequirements has been established, it should be possible for the \nDepartment of Defense to be able to identify funds needed for the \nglobal war on terrorism, and these costs should be able to be included \nin the fiscal year 2007 President's budget in February.\n  On the positive side, I am extremely pleased with the provisions \nsupporting the compensation and quality of life for the men and women \nin uniform. The budget includes funding for child care of military \nfamilies and for increased death gratuity to service members' survivors \nas well as increased service members' group life insurance.\n  But these increases do not go far enough to improve the quality of \nlife for our members of the military. The budget request did not \ninclude funding for the Citizen-Soldier Support Program, which improves \nand augments family readiness programs for families of the Reserve and \nGuard. The committee recommends an increase in operations and \nmaintenance, O, funds to expand the services of this program. The \nbudget did not include funding for the Parents as Teachers Program. The \ncommittee believes this program can provide a valuable service to \nmilitary families by providing instructional assistance to parents of \npreschool children.\n  In the O accounts, the Readiness Subcommittee did our best to \nsupport the readiness of our forces. Part of ensuring readiness is \nfunding it. As then-Secretary of the Navy Gordon England wrote to our \ncommittee earlier this year:\n\n       Readiness is a direct function of Operation and Maintenance \n     dollars available. Under-funding O adversely affects \n     readiness.\n\n  I am encouraged by the support for O funding in this bill, because \nthat translates directly into support for our men and women in uniform. \nThe subcommittee also took actions designed to improve the Army's \ntraining and get them to produce a strategy for both training and for \nthe basing of their forces as they convert to a modular brigade format.\n  I am pleased about our continued support for military construction \nand family housing needs that are so critical to quality of life for \nour service men and women. I also support many of the provisions we \nhave included that will further improve the management of the \nDepartment. I particularly appreciate the bipartisan effort that the \ncommittee made to address a wide range of procurement issues, \nenvironmental issues, and some longstanding DOD financial management \nproblems.\n  I share with the committee a great concern over the impact of the \nglobal war on terrorism on recruitment and retention. In order to \naddress this impact, the committee has recommended the payment of an \nincentive bonus not to exceed $2,500 to military members of the Active \nand Reserve components who transfer from the Regular or Reserve \ncomponent of one service to the Regular or Reserve component of another \nservice. The committee also recommends increasing the amount of \nselective reenlistment bonus for certain enlisted personnel and a \nretention incentive bonus for members of the selected Reserve qualified \nin a critical military skill or specialty.\n  With regard to the end strength of the services, the committee \nrecommends increases for the Army and the Marine Corps. As the conflict \ncontinues in Iraq, the Army and the Marine Corps are suffering the \ngreatest impact of prolonged tours of duty as well as multiple tours of \nduty. By increasing the end strength, the committee believes that the \nuse of the stop-loss practice will be significantly reduced. While we \nare already seeing a reduction in recruitment numbers, these increases \nare meant to alleviate some of the strain currently placed on the \nservice members deployed in the global war on terrorism.\n  Mr. President, this bill will provide needed funding for our service \nmen and women and the future of our national defense.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield back my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/20/senate-section/article/S8588-1", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8588]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 9:30 A.M.
