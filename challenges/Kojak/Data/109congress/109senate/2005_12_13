Mr. President, I wish to comment just very briefly on what \nis going on over the course of this week in Iraq, as it focuses on \nIraqi democracy and the process that has begun in this country today \nand will continue through Thursday when the elections are carried out \nin Iraq.\n  Earlier this morning, I had the opportunity to talk at the White \nHouse in a meeting by teleconference with our Ambassador to Iraq, in \nIraq, and General George Casey about the remarkable progress going on \nin that country today as they updated us with the plans for the \nelections, what is underway, and looking back to the tremendous \nprogress that has been made over the last several months and the truly \nremarkable progress that has been made in the elections in January and \nOctober and now the preparations made for the elections this week.\n  On Thursday, the Iraqi people began what is a historic process for \nchoosing their first fully constitutional parliament since the fall of \nSaddam, culminating in this nationwide vote on Thursday, December 15. \nIn our briefings this morning, it was pointed out that the elections \nare Thursday and many of us will be watching to see how large a turnout \nthere will be, recognizing that 10 million people turned out for the \nlast elections in October.\n  Our briefers also pointed out the fact that we have to moderate our \nexpectations a little bit in terms of the overall timing because of the \nsequence of the events with the elections on Thursday and then a \npreliminary certification of the elections about a week later and then \na final certification in early January, around January 6 or 7. The \ngovernment itself becomes a product of that\n\n[[Page S13460]]\n\nparliament, and that will not be finalized until April of next year, \nbut the process has begun, and the votes, even among Iraqis in this \ncountry right now, are beginning today.\n  The country, as we think back just 2\\1/2\\ years ago, that was ruled \nby tyranny and despotism is, with the help of American and coalition \nforces, transforming itself into a hopeful and democratic society. That \nhope is being felt by the Iraqi people as they move forward, rebuilding \nand renewing their country.\n  In yesterday's widely reported new polling data, the Iraqis believe \ntheir lives are going well, with nearly two-thirds expecting that \nthings will improve in the months and years ahead. Average household \nincomes have skyrocketed by 60 percent in the last 20 months, and \nIraqis are quickly joining the swift current of modernity with cell \nphones and the Internet, cars, washing machines, and satellite dishes. \nEven ABC News, which commissioned the poll, rates the Iraqi mood at ``a \nremarkable level of optimism.''\n  In Thursday's elections, we will also have marked yet another \nmilestone in their transition from dictatorship to democracy. Just in \nthe past year, we have witnessed a series of truly extraordinary \nevents. Last January, 8.5 million Iraqis defied the terrorists and \nmarched to the polls. Who will ever forget the remarkable picture of \nIraqis proudly displaying their purple-stained finger, citing that \nfreedom, that ability to vote. They showed the world their readiness \nand eagerness to participate in a new system of government.\n  Throughout the summer, Iraq's leaders worked through the painful \ngive-and-take process of drafting the nation's permanent constitution. \nEven though much of Iraq's Sunni Arab population boycotted the January \nelections, Iraq's elected officials worked hard to reach out and \ninclude the Sunni Arab representatives in the constitution-drafting \nprocess. They understood the importance of including leaders from all \nof Iraq's ethnic and religious communities in such a historic endeavor. \nAs we saw by summer's end, their patience, compromise, and inclusion \npaid off. The draft they produced established the framework for a \nstable and democratic Iraq at the heart of the Middle East. Their new \nconstitution safeguards individual minority rights, guarantees the \nprotection of human rights, and creates a system of government based on \nthe rule of law and the will of the Iraqi people.\n  In October, the Iraqi people turned out again, in overwhelming \nnumbers, to ratify their permanent constitution. More than 10 million \nIraqis across religious and ethnic lines went to the polls to \ndemonstrate their growing desire to have their voice heard in a \ndemocratic political process.\n  Most of the increase in voter turnout came in Sunni areas of the \ncountry.\n  As the political process continues to unfold, Iraq's Sunni Arabs are \ncoming to recognize the importance of taking part in that democratic \nprocess.\n  Only through peaceful politics can the Sunni Arab community in Iraq \nensure that its rights are secured, its interests protected, and its \npeople represented at the national, provincial, and local levels.\n  Even though many Sunnis voted against Iraq's permanent constitution, \nthe trend line of increased political participation among the Sunni \npopulation is heading up.\n  This morning, we were briefed directly from Iraq. The number of \npolling stations in the Sunni parts of the country are increasing \ndramatically day by day, much surpassing expectations.\n  More than 300 political parties and coalitions have registered for \nthis week's elections. Candidates are campaigning, and the Iraqi people \nare again showing their willingness to defy terrorist threats and \nparticipate--and participate actively--in the political process.\n  As President Bush articulated in his speech yesterday in \nPhiladelphia, Iraq is that central front in the war on terror.\n  Their move to democracy is essential to our shared victory over \nterrorism.\n  It is not going to be easy.\n  We face an enemy who targets innocent civilians with bombings and \nbeheadings--an enemy who despises freedom, that fears democracy. They \nwill bend every effort to derail Iraq's continued progress until they \nare ultimately defeated.\n  But I am confident the Iraqi people will succeed and that together we \nwill prevail over the terrorist enemy.\n  Time and time again, the Iraqi people have shown their friends and \ntheir enemies that they are steadfast in their determination to secure \na bright, peaceful, and prosperous future for their children and for \ntheir grandchildren.\n  They will do so again on Thursday, this Thursday, December 15.\n  I applaud President Bush for his unwavering commitment to freedom and \nliberty for the Iraqi people. I applaud the Iraqi people for their \nunwavering courage to secure their democratic future.\n  The United States will continue to stand behind them as they work to \nbecome a peaceful, a united, a stable, and a secure and more prosperous \nnation, a full member of the international community and a full partner \nin the global war on terrorism.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Idaho is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, may I inquire as to the state of the \nSenate? Are we in morning business?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. We are in morning business.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I thank the Chair. I will speak as in morning business.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/12/13/senate-section/article/S13460-1", "month": "12", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13460-S13461]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                CONTINUED DUMPING AND SUBSIDY OFFSET ACT\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, the leader, in opening the Senate this \nmorning, said we would come to the floor later today to begin to debate \nmotions to instruct the conferees on the budget resolution conference \nthat is now underway and being negotiated between the House and the \nSenate.\n  Of course, that is critical to our going home--the process to \nfinalize the work of the Congress this year. So for the next few \nmoments, I wish to speak about two issues that are in that conference \nthat will be a part of the debate this afternoon on the instruction of \nconferees.\n  The first one is what we call the Byrd amendment, also known as the \nContinued Dumping and Subsidy Offset Act.\n  To set the record straight, it is important to say that so people \nunderstand when I reference the Byrd amendment I am not talking about \nthe Byrd rule as it relates to what can and cannot be inside the budget \nresolution but is, in fact, what Senator Byrd, I, and joined by others \nsome time ago know as the Continued Dumping and Subsidy Offset Act.\n  As many Senators are aware, this amendment, the Byrd amendment, has \nhad tremendous support in this body. In fact, in 2003, 70 Senators \nnotified the President of our strong support for this provision. \nFurther, just recently, 25 Republican Senators notified the majority \nleader of our strong opposition to any repeal of the Byrd amendment in \nthe Deficit Reduction Act. I firmly believe those 25 Senators stand \nfirm in their opposition to any repeal. A provision such as the \nContinued Dumping and Subsidy Offset Act that has so much support has \nno place whatsoever in the budget resolution or what we call the \nDeficit Reduction Act. However, some in this body are calling the Byrd \namendment ``corporate welfare.'' If people in this country call a \nprovision that protects U.S. companies and manufacturers from \nintentional and illegal foreign dumping and in subsidies, so be it. You \ncan call it anything you want, but that is the reality of the existing \nlaw. When foreign companies continue to dump and get subsidies even \nafter an order goes into effect, the U.S. industry gets absolutely no \nbenefit from that measure. The only way we can level the playing field \nin those instances is to prevent those duties to be distributed to the \nvery American companies that are injured by those flagrant and illegal \npractices.\n\n  Some in this body would like to repeal the Byrd amendment because it \nhas been estimated to result in $3.2 billion in cost savings.\n  I have to tell you this estimate, in my opinion, is pure fabrication.\n  This year, for example, the Congressional Budget Office estimated \nthat this act's provisions would come to $800 million in fiscal year \n2005. In reality, however, the figure was $226 million. CBO's estimate \nwas off by a factor of\n\n[[Page S13461]]\n\nthree. That tells me that the 5-year estimate for 2006-2010 is grossly \noverestimated. Therefore, if we include repeal of the Byrd amendment to \ninflate budget-deficit reduction numbers, we are clearly not getting \nthose cost savings, while at the same time injuring U.S. companies that \nare committed to preserving and growing manufacturing jobs in this \ncountry.\n  Finally, some have argued we must repeal the act because it is in \nviolation of the WTO.\n  First, I believe this shows how far the WTO has overstepped their \nguidelines in placing obligations on our country we have never agreed \nto.\n  Second, there is nothing in any WTO agreement that specifies how \ncountries must spend their dumping duty proceeds. If we must do \nanything with respect to WTO, we ought to tell Ambassador Portman, as \nthe Senate has done many times in the past, to negotiate a specific \nagreement permitting duty distribution in the Doha Round. This is not \nthe time to repeal this provision while our negotiators are still at \nthe negotiating table.\n  I strongly urge my colleagues and the leadership to remove the repeal \nof the Byrd amendment from the Deficit Reduction Act. This is simply \nnot the time nor the place for such an action.\n  Further, I urge my colleagues to fall in line and support a motion to \ninstruct conferees to remove this repeal. Failure to do so will send a \nmessage to our injured U.S. companies and manufacturers that Congress \nis wearing rose-colored glasses and fails to see or act upon the evils \nof illegal dumping and foreign subsidies.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/12/13/senate-section/article/S13461-1", "month": "12", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13461-S13462]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       MILK INCOME LOSS CONTRACT\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, in speaking to conferees this afternoon in \nrelation to the deficit reduction or the budget reconciliation process, \nthis is an issue that, frankly, most Senators probably have not heard \nall that much about.\n  Everyone agrees that the reconciliation act, or Deficit Reduction \nAct, is an attempt by Congress to rein in spending and to build the \nappropriate budget in this climate. This legislation makes tough cuts \nin important programs in all areas of Government.\n  While nearly all programs are taking their lumps--if you will, \nsucking it up a bit--Congress is, ironically, considering increasing \nspending in a bill whose sole purpose is to decrease spending.\n  The Senate's version of the Budget Reconciliation Act, or Deficit \nReduction Act, includes a provision renewing the Milk Income Loss \nContract Program, also known as the MILC Program, which currently \nexpired in September of this year.\n\n  The CBO has scored this renewal in costs to the taxpayers of $1 \nbillion over a 2-year period. In other words, half a billion a year. \nThis deserves much more attention than it got in the Senate. The MILC \nDairy Price Support Program was included in the 2000 farm bill to \ncreate a permanent direct payment program to the dairy producers. \nDuring the farm bill debate, USDA warned that the new program would run \ncounter to the old dairy price support program in place since the \n1940s.\n  Analysis by the USDA in August of 2002 concluded that the MILC \nProgram would cause overproduction, thereby lowering farm prices to \nproducers, forcing the government to purchase the excess until prices \nstabilized. However, Congress ignored the USDA warning and authorized \nthe program to last until September of 2005, enough time to see dairy \nproducers through the tough times back in 2002.\n  Now, after over $2 billion in taxpayer-funded programs, some in the \nCongress have easily forgotten about the agreement to sunset a program. \nWhen we sunset a program it is the intent of Congress to conclude it.\n  Let me give some examples of how distorted it has become if the \nprogram is in support and in relation to production in our country. \nIdaho dairy production is now 4th in the Nation and one of the top \neconomic drivers in the economy of my State. During the 2003-2005 \nperiod, Idaho received $39 million in MILC payments, enough to be \nranked 12th in total payments received in the program, yet they are \nfourth in production in the Nation.\n  In comparison, California received $149 million over the same time, \nis ranked fifth in total payments and, of course, California is the No. \n1 milk producer in the Nation.\n  There seems to be no relationship. I guess some hands are just too \nsticky to let money pass just because the law is 3 years old and ready \nto expire.\n  My point is this: It is important to understand just what this \nprogram does and what the $1 billion for one program means in the \noverall picture. It has become market distorted. It provides little to \nno parity to all producers. It encourages inefficient overproduction in \nmilk and it sends the exact opposite signal to our trade negotiators \ntrying to sell the rest of the world on the idea that the United States \nis willing to cut domestic subsidies and amber box payments.\n  Regarding the WTO negotiations, our United States Trade \nRepresentative and USDA Secretary and many others are currently \nattempting to negotiate in the latest Doha Round getting started in \nHong Kong as we speak. It is clearly important we send a message. It is \nalso important when we sunset a program after having found out it is \nmarket distorting, we ought to do just that, instead of pump it up \nagain while we are asking all other programs that are federally \nexpended to reduce their overall expenditures, to reduce the budget \ndeficit and to bring this budget under control.\n  I hope our conferees, as they negotiate the budget deficit reduction \nact, or the budget resolution, would decide not to fund the MILC \nProgram, adhere to the sunset provision provided and allow a program to \ndie as this program effectively did by the sunset in September of this \nyear.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed for the Record \narticles in opposition to the MILC Program and also an article from the \nWall Street Journal.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                 December 1, 2005.\n       Dear Representative: On behalf of the hundreds of thousands \n     of senior citizens we support across America, I urge you to \n     make every effort to be sure that MILC, the now defunct dairy \n     farmer giveaway program is not resurrected through inclusion \n     in Reconciliation, or any other measure. Costing roughly $1 \n     billion (actual outlays could again top $2 billion), a new \n     MILC program, once more propping up inefficient dairy \n     farmers, should have no place in a budget that cuts spending \n     on Medicare, Medicaid, and other key senior programs like \n     LIHEAP. Outdated dairy farmer welfare has no business in what \n     should be a free-market. MILC, and similar government \n     intrusions into the dairy marketplace, cause instability and \n     price spikes. If extended, MILC will once again (as the USDA \n     admits) work in conflict with the federal milk price support \n     system. Worst of all, the oldest and the poorest among us \n     will suffer mightily to pay for the MILC giveaway to a select \n     few dairy farmers.\n       It would truly be outrageous to create a new MILC program, \n     or worse to have one included in reconciliation just to win \n     passage! Just look at what that nearly $1 billion in MILC \n     giveaway money will buy:\n       Medicare--The House proposal would cut $5 billion in \n     Medicare funding over five years. The almost $1 billion being \n     proposed for the MILC boondoggle could restore Medicare \n     funding and help provide better health care to some 140,000 \n     elderly Americans.\n       Medicaid--The House proposal cuts Medicaid spending by \n     $11.4 billion, compared with $4.3 billion in Senate cuts. \n     That $1 billion MILC giveaway could be better used to give \n     over 248,000 of the poorest Americans access to health care \n     through Medicaid.\n       Low Income Heating Assistance Program or LIHEAP--Through \n     LIHEAP, that wasted $1 billion in MILC money could help some \n     2,680,965 people cope with sky-rocketing heating bills. It \n     could be their only chance to stay warm this winter.\n       Student Loans--At a time when student loan programs are \n     being slashed ($14.3 billion in the Senate and $8.8 billion \n     in the House), $1 billion in special interest MILC funding \n     could help our grandchildren attend college at a time when \n     college costs are rising faster than inflation. The House \n     cuts will cost each student up to $5,800 more in interest and \n     fees over the life of their loans.\n       Food Stamps--Adding the $1 billion in MILC money to this \n     important program that helps feed needy seniors would fully \n     restore the $800 million in Food Stamp funding cut by the \n     House.\n       We believe the wasteful, expensive MILC program should be \n     left to rest in peace, thus helping to keep needed senior \n     health care and nutrition programs fully funded. As one \n     recent Wall Street Journal Editorial, Milking the Taxpayer \n     notes, the USDA identifies no less than a half-dozen support \n     programs for dairy farmers. We urge you to oppose the same \n     tired old politics of vote trading and ever more pork barrel \n     largesse for just a handful of dairy farmers on the dole. \n     Instead, we urge you to stand up for all of the seniors,\n\n[[Page S13462]]\n\n     the poor, the needy, the students, and the veterans who will \n     have less, just to fund MILC. As the Journal Editorial says \n     so well, ``Taxpayers have been MILCed enough by this \n     particular boondoggle.''\n       Please do the responsible thing for all Americans by \n     working to put an end to MILC once and for all. Rewarding \n     inefficiency should never be the function of any government \n     program, even when there are surplus funds to spend. Now, \n     when important health care and nutrition programs are being \n     cut or cancelled, MILC should not be allowed to rear its head \n     again.\n           Sincerely,\n     Michelle Plasari,\n       President, RetireSafe.\n     Jim Martin,\n       President, 60 Plus Association.\n                                  ____\n\n\n             [From the Wall Street Journal, Nov. 14, 2005]\n\n                          Milking the Taxpayer\n\n       It is a sign of just how unmoored from fiscal \n     responsibility the current Congress has become that in the \n     midst of a loud struggle over mostly symbolic budget cuts, \n     the party in power is having trouble even letting dead \n     programs stay dead.\n       One such program is the Milk Income Loss Contract program--\n     MILC for short, cleverly enough--which passed its sell-by \n     date at the end of September and expired. The House budget \n     bill does not include its revival. But the Senate version \n     reauthorizes MILC, and in 2004 the President promised \n     Wisconsin voters that he would fight for its extension, so \n     its fate lies with the House-Senate conference that will \n     reconcile the two massive budget bills.\n       MILC was one product of the 2002 farm-subsidy bill, and \n     even by farm-subsidy standards it is perverse. At the time \n     the program was voted into law, Congress asked the Department \n     of Agriculture to study the effects of the various \n     government-support programs on the dairy business. The USDA \n     duly issued its report in August, and for a technical \n     document the report was unequivocal that ``there is a basic \n     incompatibility'' between MILC and other pre-existing dairy \n     subsidy programs. (The USDA report identifies no fewer than a \n     half-dozen support programs for dairy farmers.)\n       The conflict is this. One of the oldest programs is the \n     milk price-support program, which dates to the Depression-era \n     Agricultural Adjustment Act. Under that program, the \n     government steps in and buys milk when the price falls below \n     a certain level. If that support price is set low enough, it \n     provides some income security to farmers while allowing the \n     market to clear and production to fall to the point where \n     prices can rise again.\n       Here's where MILC pours in and clouds the picture. MILC \n     makes direct payments to farmers based on their production \n     whenever the milk price falls below a certain level. What's \n     more, MILC kicks in at a much higher level than the price-\n     support program. The effect of this is that production is \n     encouraged by MILC even as prices are falling, which drives \n     the price down toward the support level and prevents the \n     shakeout that the price-support program is intended to allow.\n       The Agriculture Department found that MILC does in fact \n     artificially depress the price of milk by encouraging \n     overproduction, which is just what you'd expect. Then, \n     through the price-support mechanism, the government winds up \n     buying the milk that MILC encouraged the farmers to produce. \n     Thus, in the Ag Department's dry bureaucratese: ``The price \n     support program and the MILC program provide an example of \n     problems that can be caused by conflicting policy outcomes.''\n       In short, MILC distorts the market and conflicts directly \n     with other pre-existing subsidy programs. It has also cost \n     close to $2 billion since its inception, nearly twice the $1 \n     billion originally budgeted for it. Letting it expire should \n     have been a no-brainer, not least because dairy farmers still \n     enjoy numerous other forms of government handouts. It was \n     kept alive in the Senate through the exertions of Vermont \n     Democrat Pat Leahy, who isn't known for helping the GOP \n     agenda. With no GOP Senators in either Vermont or Wisconsin, \n     Republicans don't even have a political motive for keeping \n     this subsidy alive.\n       Two billion dollars over three years may be a drop in the \n     fiscal milk-bucket, but Republican lawmakers used to insist \n     on sunsetting government programs for a reason. Taxpayers \n     have been MILCed enough by this particular boondoggle.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/12/13/senate-section/article/S13462-1", "month": "12", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13462]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. CRAIG.

Mr. President, today I come to the floor to speak about \nthe pending reauthorization, extension of the PATRIOT Act, the \nlegislation passed in the wake of the September 11 attacks. This debate \nis fraught with emotion because we were all outraged at what happened \non September 11. Everyone in America and around the world shares a \ndesire to address the threat of global terrorism, to give law \nenforcement appropriate powers to pursue those terrorists. But we want \nto make sure in doing so we pass legislation that is in keeping with \nthe principles on which our country was founded--principles of \nindividual liberty and freedom.\n  Ultimately, this debate about renewing, extending the PATRIOT Act is \nabout police powers, the power that the people, through their elected \nrepresentatives, give to government, give to agents of government. \nWhether it is at the State, local, or Federal level, we give certain \npolice powers to government to conduct searches. We give the government \npower to detain individuals. We give the government power to serve \nsubpoenas, to confiscate records. We do it because we think ultimately \nit is in the public interest to do so. But just as the Framers \nrecognized, we need to provide a balance, to balance these very \nforceful, very powerful tools with personal freedom, civil liberty.\n  So as a result, we require the government, or government agents, to \nshow cause before they conduct a search. We set standards for evidence \nin a courtroom. They need to meet certain standards of evidence to \nconduct a search, certain standards of evidence to detain an individual \nor a suspect. And, of course, we have the principle of due process, \ntrial by jury, and the ability to have an appeal heard in a court of \nlaw.\n  Some people may say: We know that. These are fundamental. These are \nbasic to our system of justice. But it is important that we are \nreminded of these basic principles if we are going to get the \nreauthorization and the extension of the PATRIOT Act correct.\n  This is not a new set of issues. These are the very issues \ncontemplated by the Framers. In many respects, these police powers are \nissues that alarmed the Framers--and I say alarmed because they were so \nconcerned about the powers of Government and the powers of the State \nthat they wrote specific protections into the Constitution. The fourth \namendment, protecting from unreasonable search and seizure, \nspecifically addresses the threshold of probable cause, that the \nGovernment shall show probable cause before it conducts search and \nseizure of personal property.\n  The fifth amendment protects us from self-incrimination. We have all \nseen enough Perry Mason to understand what it means to invoke one's \nrights under the fifth amendment. It speaks specifically about due \nprocess and the right to an open, fair due process when one is being \nprosecuted, whether it is for a criminal act or whether we are \nprosecuting one of these powers of search and seizure, a power of the \nState to issue a search warrant.\n  The sixth amendment speaks specifically about a right to a trial and \nwhat it means to have one's case heard before a jury or in a court of \nlaw. All of these amendments and others, but these three in particular, \nspeak directly to balancing the rights of individuals and the liberty \nof individuals with the powers of the State.\n  The Framers were, quite frankly, very distrustful of Government and \nthe power of the Federal Government. I try to be a little less \npessimistic in my work in the Senate, but I must be frank with my \ncolleagues in stating that on this issue, on the PATRIOT Act, I have \nbegun this debate more from a position of mistrust and concern about \nthe work that had been done in preparation for this reauthorization and \nthe position taken by the administration. I will speak to that in a \nmoment, but it is important to note that on the Senate side we had \nbipartisan agreement and on the Senate side\n\n[[Page S13463]]\n\nwe had terrific leadership by Senator Specter on these issues. He \nunderstands this balance probably as well as anyone in the Senate. I do \nnot fault his work as a chairman and certainly not the work of the \nSenate as a whole, given that we had incorporated a number of \nprotections in our legislation.\n  The Justice Department began this process well over a year ago, \ntaking the position that we should make all the provisions of the \nPATRIOT Act permanent and we should not make any changes, we did not \nneed to make any changes. This is legislation that was passed just 6 \nweeks after September 11. I would not say it was passed in haste, but \nit was passed during a very difficult and emotional time in our \ncountry's history. We had sunsets on 16 provisions in the PATRIOT Act \nfor just that reason. We knew there was a lot of uncertainty as to how \nthis war on terrorism would progress, what tools law enforcement really \ndid need to pursue legitimate terrorist suspects, what we needed to do \nto get our hands around financial records or other financial \ntransactions that might lead investigators to uncover terrorist cells \nin America or around the world.\n  Anyone who understands the legislative process knows that was not a \nperfect bill, no matter how hard people worked on it. To suggest that \nwhen it came time for reauthorization there would be no need for \nchanges I believe suggests a lack of understanding of the process of \nCongress, the legislative process, and how things get put together on \nCapitol Hill, or lack of understanding about the substance in the bill, \nnot understanding all the provisions in the bill and how they did in \nsome cases unnecessarily infringe on civil liberties, or perhaps an \narrogance that leadership, those who were responsible for providing \nleadership within the Justice Department, knew they were not abusing \nany of the provisions in the law so no changes needed to be made. I \nwill speak to that argument shortly, but I think it is very \nunfortunate.\n  So when one has this kind of legislation, as sweeping in scope as \nthis is, and suggests when it comes time to deal with these sunset \nprovisions that no changes need to be made, I think shows a lack of \nsubstantive reflection on the balance between the police powers of the \nState I spoke about and civil liberties on the other hand.\n  Two years ago, I joined with a number of my colleagues in introducing \nthe SAFE Act: Senators Durbin, Salazar, and Feingold on the Democratic \nside, Senators Craig, Murkowski, and myself on the Republican side. We \nspoke specifically to a few provisions in the PATRIOT Act where we \nthought we could do a better job of protecting civil liberties.\n  The 215 section that allows the subpoena of business or library \nrecords, the national security letter provision--the national security \nletter is a sweeping order issued without the approval of a judge that \ngives investigators access to financial data, to medical data, or to \nother transaction records; the roving wiretap provision that is \nnecessary because we have new communication technologies that are more \nmobile than ever but where we still need to do a good job of specifying \nwho the target is of that roving wiretap; delayed search warrants--\nagain, sometimes there is going to be a need for conducting a search \nwarrant before notifying a target so that the investigation is not \njeopardized. But we should have specific provisions written in the law \nfor notifying that target after a certain period of time. As it was \nwritten, there was no period specified for notification.\n  Of course, the idea of sunsets is important to civil liberties \nanytime one is dealing with law enforcement legislation, because a \nsunset calls on Congress to come back, look at how a law was used, look \nat how it was implemented, how it affected civil liberties, and make \nappropriate changes.\n  I ask unanimous consent to speak for an additional 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I have no objection. I add to that consent \nthat I would then follow the distinguished Senator from New Hampshire \non the same subject.\n  Mr. SUNUNU. I so modify my request.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Reserving the right to object, I ask unanimous consent \nto follow the distinguished Senator from Vermont.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SUNUNU. We introduced the SAFE Act to deal with very specific \nareas where we thought the PATRIOT Act needed to be improved to better \nprotect civil liberties. Some would argue that with the PATRIOT Act, as \nit has been rewritten, the conference agreement, that there were only a \nfew areas now where there is a disagreement and so we ought to accept \nit as it is. I make a broad argument, though, that simply because we \nare conducting shortcuts on civil liberties in only a few areas is \nsimply not an effective argument. I think where civil liberties are \nconcerned, as I illustrated with the Framers' concerns, we ought to do \neverything in our power to make sure proper protection is provided.\n  A few key points about the weaknesses that remain in the PATRIOT Act, \nand with these weaknesses I will not be able to support the final \nconference report. I certainly will not support moving forward with the \nconference report, in part because I think these are substantive \nproblems but also because they are problems that should be easily \naddressed in a reworked conference agreement. The first deals with the \nbusiness and libraries provision, section 215. In section 215 we have \nestablished a very broad standard, too broad a standard, for \ninvestigators to get access to sensitive records--whether it is at a \nbusiness or a library; it makes no difference. The standard is that the \nrecords simply be shown as relevant to an investigation. That does not \nsound inappropriate, but as a legal standard that means records could \nbe subpoenaed that have no direct connection to a particular suspect.\n  As a result, the records of many innocent Americans, or the burden \nplaced on businesses to continually produce records under this \nprovision is going to be far too onerous.\n  There is also associated with this provision, this business records \nsubpoena power, a permanent automatic gag order that prevents you from \ndiscussing the fact that this order has been issued to you as an \nindividual or your business, and there is no judicial review of that \ngag order. I think this is a fundamental flaw in this conference \nreport, the idea that you have been served with a permanent gag order \nto restrict your free speech, to restrict you from talking about that \ngag order, and it is permanent and you have no ability to appeal it in \na court of law.\n  I would argue that taking your case, your appeal before a judge is \nfundamental to our system of justice in the United States of America. I \nwould further argue that it in no way undermines law enforcement's \nability to conduct an investigation to give the business or the \nindividual the opportunity to appeal that gag order in a court of law. \nThe argument that it might cost a little bit extra is ridiculous in the \nface of the need to protect individual civil liberties.\n  The system of judicial review for these section 215 subpoenas simply \nis not acceptable. Similarly, the system of judicial review on national \nsecurity letters fails to meet the important test of balancing \nindividual civil liberties. There is a very low threshold for getting a \nnational security letter. It is not approved by a judge. The threshold \nis merely a ``showing of relevance,'' once again not a direct \nconnection to a suspect, which is very problematic. Moreover, the \nthreshold for overturning the gag order--again a restriction on the \nability to even discuss the national security letter--is that you must \nshow bad faith on the part of the Federal Government. That is virtually \nimpossible. No individual, no business served with a national security \nletter will effectively be able to show bad faith on the part of the \nFederal Government, and therefore they will never have a national \nsecurity letter or its accompanying gag order overturned.\n  To have meaningful judicial review you have to have a meaningful \nstandard, a reasonable standard of showing in that court of law. I \nthink it is fair to say, if we look around the world at different \ngovernments' attempts to eviscerate the power of due process, this is \none way to do it--to have judicial review, to ``let people have their \ncase in\n\n[[Page S13464]]\n\na court of law,'' but set the standard of evidence or the standard for \noverturning an egregious decision so high that the government always \nwins. That is simply not acceptable where American civil liberties are \nconcerned.\n  Finally, let me turn to a few of the arguments posed or made to \nindividuals, such as Senator Leahy or Senator Feingold or me, who have \nbrought forward these objections. One argument is what I would describe \nas a very broad argument, that we need to extend the PATRIOT Act, we \nneed to fight terrorism, we need to make sure we don't undermine the \nability of law enforcement in their work to deal with terrorist \nthreats. I agree. Senator Leahy--I will take the opportunity to speak \nfor my colleague from Vermont. He agrees we need to do all of these \nthings. But that is not a substantive argument for not making these \nchanges he and I support. We are all for fighting terrorism. We are all \nfor extending the PATRIOT Act. I do not oppose the idea of subpoenaing \nbusiness records or even library records or the idea of a national \nsecurity letter. What I oppose is having such a powerful government \nforce in place without countervailing protections for civil liberties.\n  A second argument is one I mentioned earlier: for the Justice \nDepartment to say we have not abused any provisions in the current \nPATRIOT Act so just extend them all as written. It doesn't matter to me \nwhether it is a Democratic administration or Republican administration, \nthe argument that you have not abused a poorly written law is no \nargument at all for extending and making permanent that poorly written \nlaw. If it does not protect civil liberties, we should modify it. We \nshould make sure the protections are there so that no matter who holds \nthe reins of power, in the executive or the legislative or the judicial \nbranches of Government, those freedoms continue to be protected.\n  A third argument is if we do not move forward, if this bill fails to \nget a cloture vote this week and it goes back to conference, it will \nonly get worse. Let me get this straight. If you vote against a bill \nthat doesn't adequately protect civil liberties, we are going to take \nit back to conference and compromise civil liberties even further? I \nthink that is an outrageous argument to make. I think there are some \npeople who are making it, or who have made it, who do not intend it to \nbe taken that way. But I think it is only fair that it be taken that \nway. That is an inappropriate threat. If the attitude of the conferees \nis they will further restrict civil liberties if they do not get this \npoorly written bill passed, then perhaps no law is better.\n  I do not believe that. I think there ought to be a willingness to \nmake improvements. Again, there are no specific reasons for how these \nchanges that I have described--judicial review of a 215 gag order, a \nbetter threshold for overturning an NSL there is no substantive \nargument that I have heard for how these would undermine law \nenforcement's ability to pursue terrorists. These arguments simply do \nnot hold up.\n  Benjamin Franklin, 200 years ago, observed that:\n\n       Those who would give up Essential Liberty to purchase a \n     little Temporary Safety deserve neither Liberty nor Safety.\n\n  Those words are as true today as they were over 200 years ago. There \nis no reason to compromise the right to due process, the right to a \njudicial review, to fair and reasonable standards of evidence, in the \npursuit of our security and the pursuit of terrorists wherever they may \nbe around the world. I think making these changes is reasonable. They \nare fair.\n  I have joined with Senator Leahy in introducing a 3-month extension \nof the existing PATRIOT Act to ensure that we have plenty of time, in a \nreasonable and thoughtful way, to make very modest changes that would \ngo a long way toward ensuring this is a better bill, that it is a bill \nthat we can be proud of, and a bill that will protect civil liberties.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nVermont is recognized.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, first, if I might, I wish to compliment my \ncolleague and neighbor from across the Connecticut River, Senator \nSununu of New Hampshire. He has laid out very clearly and eloquently \nthe reasons we should not be rushed into a bad bill. It is not because \nany of us here have any love of terrorists. Of course none of us do; no \nAmericans do.\n  On a September morning 4 years ago, nearly 3,000 lives, American \nlives, were lost--not in a foreign nation but on our own soil. Our \nlives as Americans changed in an instant. There is not a person within \nthis Chamber who does not remember exactly where he or she was when \nthey heard the news of the attacks of 9/11. In the aftermath of those \nattacks, Congress moved swiftly to pass antiterterrorism legislation. \nWe moved as a Congress, as a Senate, as a House--not as Republicans or \nas Democrats, but as Americans, united in our efforts. The fires were \nstill smoldering at Ground Zero in New York City when the USA PATRIOT \nAct became law on October 30, 2001, just 6 weeks after the attacks.\n  I know how hard we worked. I was chairman of the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee at the time. Many of us here in the Senate today worked \ntogether in that spirit of bipartisan unity. We resolved to craft a \nbill that would make us safer as a nation.\n  Freedom and security are always in tension in our society, especially \nso in those somber weeks after the attacks. We tried our best to strike \nthe right balance between freedom and security.\n  The Senator from New Hampshire quoted Benjamin Franklin. As one reads \nthe history of the founding of this Nation and what the Founders went \nthrough, his quote stands out so much. Benjamin Franklin, like the \nother Founders, knew that had our new country not worked, had the \nRevolution not worked, most of them would have been hanged for trying \nto break away from our mother country. When he spoke of a people who \nwould give up their liberties for security deserving neither, he knew \nof what he spoke. And he set a key idea for the fledgling democracy of \nAmerica, and it is one that I like to think through the generations we \nhave strengthened. During my years in the Senate, I have done \neverything possible to strengthen that balance to maintain our \nliberties because if we do not maintain our liberties, at the best we \nhave a false security. It is not a real security.\n\n  One of the fruits of the bipartisanship of the PATRIOT Act, in trying \nto work out this balance, was the sunset provisions. Those key \nprovisions set an expiration date of December 31, 2005, on certain \nGovernment powers that had great potential to affect the civil \nliberties of the American people. We are just weeks away from that date \nnow.\n  Some may wonder how these sunset provisions worked their way into the \nPATRIOT Act. They were put there by the Republican leader of the House, \nDick Armey of Texas, and myself. We have entirely different political \nphilosophies, but we agreed on one thing: If you are giving great \npowers to our Government, you want to make sure there are some strings \nattached. It makes no difference whether it is a Republican \nadministration or a Democratic administration, you want to make sure \nthere are strings attached. Leader Armey and I insisted on these \nsunsets to ensure that Congress would revisit the PATRIOT Act within a \nfew years and consider refinements to protect the rights and liberties \nof all Americans more effectively, and we prevailed on that point.\n  Sadly, the administration and some in the leadership in the House and \nSenate have squandered key opportunities to improve the PATRIOT Act. \nThe House-Senate conference report filed last week by Republican \nlawmakers falls short of what the American people expect and deserve \nfrom us. The bipartisan Senate bill, which the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee and then the Senate adopted unanimously, struck a better \nbalance.\n  If I might, I wish to compliment the chairman of the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee, Senator Arlen Specter, the senior Senator from Pennsylvania, \nand those Republicans and Democrats in this body who worked with him, \nas I did, to put together a fair and balanced bill which was able to go \nthrough our committee, which is sometimes heavily divided on issues. \nInstead, it went through the Judiciary Committee unanimously and passed \nthe Senate unanimously. We worked together on that because we \nunderstand that the\n\n[[Page S13465]]\n\nreauthorization of the PATRIOT Act has to have the confidence of the \nAmerican people.\n  Think for a moment. Governments can limit the rights of the people in \ntheir countries really in only two ways: they can do it by force of \narms, by oppression and repression, as we have seen with totalitarian \ngovernments, or, if they have done it right, they can do it with the \nconsent of the governed.\n  As we are limiting some of these rights, as we are giving greater \npowers to our Government, we want to do it in a way where the American \npeople--all of the nearly 300 million people in this great country--\nwould have confidence in what we have done, because we do not enforce \nour laws in this country by force of arms, by dictatorship; we do it \nwith the consent of the governed.\n  I believe what we passed in the Senate and in the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee would have the confidence of the American people. But now we \nhave pushed forward and changed that to flawed legislation which will \nnot have that confidence and respect of the American people. The \nCongress should not rush ahead to enact flawed legislation to meet a \ndeadline that is within our power to extend. We owe it to the American \npeople to get this right. America can do better than this flawed \nlegislation.\n  The way forward to a sensible, workable, bipartisan bill is clear. It \nis very clear, as Senator Sununu said on the floor earlier this morning \nand as I have suggested. Yesterday, Senator Sununu and I introduced a \nbill to extend the sunset for the expiring PATRIOT Act powers until \nMarch 31, 2006. Give us until March 31 to get this right, give us until \nMarch 31 to have a bill that would have not only the respect of the \nAmerican people but especially the confidence of the American people. \nOur laws work if we have confidence in them, and they fail if we do not \nhave confidence in them.\n  In offering this bill, Senator Sununu and I have been joined by \nSenators Craig, Rockefeller, Murkowski, Kennedy, Hagel, Levin, Durbin, \nStabenow, Salazar, and others. It is a bipartisan effort to extend this \ndeadline. A deadline which Congress imposed to ensure oversight and \naccountability should not now become a barrier to achieving bipartisan \ncompromise and the best bill we can forge together.\n  This is a vital debate. It should be. These are vital issues to all \nAmericans. If a brief extension is needed to produce a better bill that \nwould better serve all of our citizen then by all means, let us give \nourselves that time. We want to give tools to prosecutors. I spent 8 \nyears of my life as a prosecutor. Some of the finest people on my staff \nare former prosecutors. We know the needs, especially in the electronic \nage. But we can do better, and America can do better if given the time.\n  I thank Senator Sununu and all of our cosponsors in coming together \nin a bipartisan way to advance what is a commonsense solution.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record some recent \neditorials on this matter.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Dec. 12, 2005]\n\n                          A Better Patriot Act\n\n       The conference report on the USA Patriot Act \n     reauthorization bill contains one major improvement over the \n     previous version and a few minor ones. The new bill contains \n     strong ``sunset'' provisions, under which the three most \n     controversial provisions would lapse again after four years, \n     not the seven of the earlier draft. This is no small win for \n     civil liberties. The sunset provisions in the original \n     Patriot Act have given Congress leverage over the past few \n     years to extract information from an administration not known \n     for openness concerning its use of the powers Congress gave \n     it. Insisting that the administration justify itself again \n     relatively soon ensures that Congress will be able to adjust \n     and refine the law as need be.\n       Yet the conference report remains far from perfect. A \n     bipartisan group of senators is still objecting that it does \n     too little to protect civil liberties, and they are \n     threatening a filibuster, though it is not clear whether they \n     have the votes to sustain one. Some of the changes they are \n     seeking are reasonable and constructive. While the bill does \n     not contain the worst excesses of the House version, which \n     was larded with irrelevant and often terrible policy changes, \n     it still has a fair number of extraneous sections. Some are \n     silly, some ugly.\n       What makes all this so frustrating is that a consensus bill \n     was surely possible. Indeed, it happened. The Senate version \n     of the bill passed on a unanimous vote, representing broad \n     agreement to grant government authorities the powers they \n     legitimately need while ensuring accountability in their \n     use--and it didn't contain a raft of irrelevant laws \n     unrelated to intelligence. The members balking at the current \n     bill would do a service if they forced a cleaner, more \n     accountable Patriot Act reauthorization.\n       Debate over the conference report has focused on a narrow \n     array of civil liberties issues, all quite technical. The \n     rhetoric from civil libertarians makes the stakes here seem \n     greater than they really are. The differences between the \n     various proposals are not huge in practical terms. They are, \n     however, significant. The conference report contains weaker \n     controls on secret warrants for business records in national \n     security cases than the Senate bill did. It also does too \n     little to get a handle on the use of national security \n     letters--a form of administrative subpoena that the FBI uses \n     in national security cases to obtain records of certain \n     business transactions. These problems are not unsolvable, and \n     it's hard to believe the government is today getting much \n     data through uses of these powers that would be forbidden \n     were they written more accountably.\n       What's more, sift through the bill and you'll find \n     provisions dealing with tobacco smuggling, establishing civil \n     immunity for folks who donate firefighting equipment to fire \n     departments, establishing new crimes--some punishable by \n     death--related to marine navigation, creating a new national \n     security division in the Justice Department, letting Secret \n     Service forensics experts help out in finding missing kids, \n     combating methamphetamine abuse and making life more \n     miserable for people challenging state convictions in federal \n     court. None of this, needless to say, has much to do with \n     protecting America from al Qaeda.\n       The Patriot Act cannot be allowed to lapse at year's end, \n     and the current bill is much improved over earlier versions. \n     But it could still be a lot better. Precisely because the \n     administration cannot afford to let its powers expire, \n     further improvement should still be possible.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                  [From the Fresno Bee, Dec. 12, 2005]\n\n                             Take the Time\n\n       Fresno, CA.--Barring an unlikely successful filibuster, the \n     USA Patriot Act is likely to be renewed this week, mostly in \n     the form it was given in 2001. That's when Congress, in the \n     wake of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, rushed to give law \n     enforcement broader powers of investigation. That's still \n     justified up to a point. Law enforcement and intelligence \n     agencies should not be hamstrung, for instance, by a now-\n     lapsed ban on sharing information.\n       But it's risky to give blanket authority to government \n     agencies to bypass the courts, as this law partly does. It's \n     too tempting to look into every nook and cranny just to be \n     sure there isn't something amiss there.\n       After lengthy debate behind closed doors, a House-Senate \n     conference committee agreed on compromise language that \n     congressional negotiators say will include more protection \n     for individuals. But if that's true, why do six senators--\n     three Democrats and three Republicans--still oppose the \n     measure? (One of them--Democrat Russ Feingold of Wisconsin, \n     the only senator to vote against the original law--is \n     threatening to filibuster the revised version on the Senate \n     floor.)\n       The principal objection of these lawmakers, and those of us \n     who cherish individual liberty, is that the law sets too low \n     a threshold for justifying the need to examine private \n     records, including medical, financial and employment. And \n     they are not persuaded--nor are we--that requiring \n     authorities to show that their investigation has some \n     relevance to an anti-terror investigation is enough.\n       These secret searches should be limited to specific \n     individuals and not be so broad as to allow ``fishing \n     expeditions.''\n       Supporters of the revised law say action is necessary now \n     because 16 provisions of the original act are set to expire \n     Dec. 31. That's true. But there's a way to avoid undue haste \n     without tying the hands of law enforcement: Adopt a proposal \n     by Sen. Patrick Leahy, ranking Democrat on the Judiciary \n     Committee, to extend the law for three months, allowing time \n     for public debate on a law that could be used as much to harm \n     individuals as to catch terrorists.\n       The compromise bill would make all but two of the 16 \n     expiring provisions permanent. The other two are to be \n     extended for only four years, rather than the 10 years sought \n     by House Republicans. That's small comfort to those whose \n     privacy will be at risk in the meantime.\n       House Judiciary Chairman James Sensenbrenner, a proponent \n     of quick action, claims it's needed to aid law enforcement in \n     detecting terrorists before they strike. But that sense of \n     urgency extends only so far. Former members of the 9/11 \n     Commission have just scorched Congress and the White House \n     for failing to protect the country in many ways, including \n     the misallocation of resources to states or localities based \n     on political clout instead of risk.\n       Americans would be no less safe if Congress were to \n     postpone a final vote and allow time for an open and honest \n     debate.\n                                  ____\n\n\n               [From the Kansas City Star, Dec. 12, 2005]\n\n                 More Time Needed To Forge Better Bill\n\n       Kansas City, MO.--A shaken Congress passed the Patriot Act \n     with almost no debate in the wake of the 2001 terrorist \n     attacks.\n\n[[Page S13466]]\n\n       Since then politicians across the spectrum have joined \n     librarians, city councils and other groups in raising alarms \n     about the law's intrusions on the privacy of American \n     citizens.\n       With the act set to expire Dec. 31, lawmakers are \n     scrambling to reach a compromise that would allow most of the \n     provisions to be renewed permanently. Time is short, but it's \n     essential for Congress to give Americans a better balance \n     between national security and civil liberty.\n       The House and Senate this week will consider a compromise \n     agreement reached by negotiators. The package makes a good-\n     faith attempt to address some of the problems. But it \n     continues to give law enforcement agencies too much leeway to \n     search people's homes and examine their records without first \n     obtaining permission from judges.\n       Provisions in the proposed law instruct judges to presume \n     federal agents' requests for records are valid, unless the \n     targeted people can prove the government acted in bad faith. \n     That places citizens at a serious disadvantage. Judicial \n     oversight doesn't mean much if the judges merely serve as \n     rubber stamps for law enforcement agents.\n       The compromise also does little to curb the burgeoning use \n     of ``national security letters,'' which the FBI uses to make \n     sweeping requests for records from libraries, telephone \n     companies and Internet providers.\n       Former Attorney General John Ashcroft used to sneer and \n     scoff at librarians who raised concerns about these requests, \n     implying they were rare. But The Washington Post has reported \n     that the FBI issues 30,000 such letters a year.\n       Senators from both political parties are raising valid \n     concerns about the proposed new law.

It's rare \n     for groups so far apart along the usual political spectrum to \n     agree on something. But they are united in their concern that \n     a compromise reached by Senate and House negotiators Thursday \n     won't sufficiently protect Americans' civil liberties. They \n     have reason for concern.\n       Sen. Arlen Specter, the Republican chairman of the Senate \n     Judiciary Committee, said the compromise legislation is ``not \n     a perfect bill, but a good bill.'' House and Senate \n     negotiators came up with a plan to permanently extend 14 of \n     16 provisions set to expire at the end of the year. Of \n     particular note: When a law enforcement agent seeks access to \n     records, by order of a secret court established under the \n     Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, the agent must provide \n     a ``statement of fact'' proving it is relevant to an anti-\n     terrorism investigation.\n       But the coalition's concerns about fishing expeditions got \n     a boost last week when a bipartisan group of six senators \n     issued a statement critical of the compromise: Republican \n     Sens. Larry E. Craig of Idaho, John E. Sununu of New \n     Hampshire and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, and Democratic \n     Senators Russell D. Feingold of Wisconsin, Richard J. Durbin \n     of Illinois and Ken Salazar of Colorado.\n       The primary concern is that restrictions in the Patriot Act \n     haven't gone far enough since its passage in the wake of 9/11 \n     to prevent government officials from going on so-called \n     ``fishing expeditions.'' The Washington Post reported in \n     October that the FBI used provisions of the act regarding \n     records-gathering to annually issue more than 30,000 \n     specialized subpoenas, or national security letters, seeking \n     information from businesses.\n       The letters don't require the government to demonstrate a \n     link between the information being sought and a suspected \n     terrorist. They only attest that the records sought are \n     relevant to a terror investigation. This provision of the \n     Patriot Act must be tightened before the anticipated House \n     and Senate votes this week.\n       Or, if such an agreement cannot be reached, both chambers \n     should take the advice of Sen. Patrick J. Leahy of Vermont. \n     The ranking Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, who didn't \n     agree to the compromise, has proposed a three-month extension \n     of the Patriot Act, past its year-end expiration date.\n       Sen. Feingold, the only senator to vote against the \n     original legislation in 2001, has threatened to filibuster \n     the bill extending Patriot Act provisions because it lacks \n     sufficient safeguards to protect constitutional freedoms. \n     Sixty votes would be required to block a vote on final Senate \n     passage.\n       A three-month extension is preferable, however, to a bitter \n     partisan battle on the Senate floor.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                 [From the Times Union, Dec. 12, 2005]\n\n                             True Patriots\n\n       Albany, NY.--There's scant comfort in the compromise \n     reached by House-Senate conferees late last week on renewing \n     the USA Patriot Act. While it is welcome news that House \n     negotiators failed in their attempt to have the most \n     controversial provisions of this law extended for seven \n     years, rather than four, as the Senate insisted upon, and \n     which is now part of the compromise, there is no \n     justification to put basic civil liberties at risk for even \n     four minutes, let alone four years.\n       Fortunately, a bipartisan group of six senators is vowing \n     to filibuster the accord, which is scheduled to be voted upon \n     this week. They are the true patriots. Their demands are \n     hardly burdensome. To the contrary, they want any final \n     legislation to include checks and balances against possible \n     abuse of power by government agencies acting under the \n     surveillance powers of the Patriot Act. That means some \n     monitoring of, say, FBI demands for reading, financial and \n     other personal information on American citizens. Former Rep. \n     Bob Barr of Georgia, who now heads a group called Patriots to \n     Restore Checks and Balances, sums up the issue this way:\n       ``Lawmakers could have easily fixed these controversial \n     record search provisions by simply adopting the Senate-passed \n     amendment to Section 215, requiring the government to show a \n     connection between records sought and a suspected foreign \n     terrorist, and by applying a similar requirement to the NSL \n     (National Security Letters) powers. The decision of some \n     lawmakers to rush this flawed Patriot Act legislation to a \n     vote may allow them to leave a little earlier for the \n     holidays this year, but it will also leave the civil \n     liberties of their constituents in jeopardy for years to \n     come.''\n       Supporters of the compromise argue that it does offer \n     safeguards against government abuses by requiring some \n     judicial overview. But a close reading of these oversight \n     requirements shows that investigators would have no trouble \n     meeting the loose standards for initiating searches.\n       No one, least of all Mr. Barr, is suggesting that the \n     government shouldn't be able to track down suspected \n     terrorists. But the broad surveillance powers granted under \n     the Patriot Act open the way for possible abuses, such as \n     collecting information on law-abiding Americans without \n     notifying them or allowing them the opportunity to challenge \n     the searches.\n       Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., who refused to sign the \n     compromise, suggests a reasonable solution: Rather than rush \n     the vote, extend the current act for three months and use the \n     extra time to forge a better bill. ``We owe it to the \n     American people to get this right,'' Sen. Leahy says.

The \n     House of Representatives passed this grab bag of police-state \n     tactics by a 357-66 vote with almost no debate.\n       Wisconsin Democrat Russ Feingold was the only senator to \n     vote no. At the time, Feingold called the Patriot Act a \n     ``truly breathtaking expansion of police power.''\n       A fearful Congress was stampeded into approving, almost \n     sight unseen, one of the broadest assaults on civil liberties \n     in our nation's history. Despite assorted court challenges, \n     the expansion of police power continues--an expansion which \n     has done little to capture the masterminds of the Sept. 11 \n     attacks or to prevent future attacks. But this expansion has \n     done much to undermine our hard-won Constitutional rights.\n       What has happened to our legal rights since then? Here's a \n     refresher:\n       You've lost your freedom of association. The federal \n     government can now monitor the doings of religious and \n     political organizations, even if there's no reason to suspect \n     that illegal activity is going on.\n       You've lost your freedom from unreasonable searches. The \n     federal government may search and seize your papers and \n     effects without probable cause and without a court warrant. \n     It can also question librarians and booksellers about your \n     reading habits, and threaten them with jail if they reveal to \n     anyone that you're being investigated.\n       You've lost your right to a speedy and public trial. The \n     federal government can now jail you indefinitely without you \n     being charged with a crime and can do so without holding a \n     trial and without allowing you to confront your accusers. \n     This is what you can expect if you are deemed to be a \n     ``terrorist'' or are deemed to be ``assisting a terrorist \n     group.'' The definition of ``terrorist'' and ``terrorist \n     group'' is purely up to the government, of course.\n       You've lost your right to legal representation. \n     Conversations between attorneys and clients can now be \n     monitored in federal prisons. That is, if you're fortunate \n     enough to have an attorney. The federal government now has \n     the right to deny you legal representation too.\n       In short, the federal government can arrest virtually \n     anyone it deems to be a danger to national security, even \n     without a formal criminal charge, and jail them indefinitely. \n     It can deny you a lawyer or even a trial, public or secret. \n     And all of this can happen without your family or friends and \n     relatives ever knowing what happened.\n       This is what the so-called war on terrorism has done to our \n     Constitutional rights. This is why the current debate in \n     Congress over extending the provisions of the Patriot Act is \n     important.\n       To keep the Patriot Act as it is means more secrecy, more \n     disinformation and more repression. It is quite frankly, un-\n     American. It is behavior straight out of a totalitarian \n     state; tactics not worthy of the world's greatest democracy.\n       The average American thinks he or she is safe. But history \n     has shown us that when a regime has absolute power, it's only \n     a matter of time before anyone and everyone is subject to \n     official intimidation and attack.\n       Security and ``fighting terrorism'' are not suitable \n     pretexts for destroying more than two centuries of American \n     jurisprudence. The rule of law as enshrined in the \n     Constitution is supposed to still mean something in America.\n       It's time to demand that Congress and the Bush \n     administration respect our civil liberties.

Mr. President, the majority leader has said that after \nthe first of the year we would turn our attention to immigration, and \nwell we should. Some estimates show that 10 to 20 million people living \nin the United States may be here illegally. Whatever one may think \nabout immigration, one has to start with the idea that our Nation is \nbased on a few principles, and one of the most important of those \nprinciples is the rule of law. This is a problem we need to address and \nthe American people have a right to demand we address. The buck stops \nhere. This is not something Governors can deal with or school districts \ncan deal with. It stops here.\n\n  Not long ago in Nashville I gave a speech in which I attempted to say \nI believe there are three parts to a comprehensive solution to \nimmigration, the kind of comprehensive solution President Bush has \ntalked about. Part No. 1 is border security. I had no more said the \nwords ``border security'' than the whole room rose and began to \napplaud; they were not interested in the rest of the story. I would \nlike to say a word today about the rest of the story, what our \nimmigration debate needs to include in addition to border security.\n  Let me turn to a lesson we are learning from across the ocean, from \nGreat Britain and France. Last month, the British Government instituted \na citizenship test that immigrants to Britain must pass before becoming \nBritish citizens. When he announced a number of related measures \nregarding British citizenship last August, Prime Minister Tony Blair \nsaid:\n\n       People who want to be British citizens should share our \n     values and our way of life.\n\n  These new rules were spurred by the terrorist attack in London last \nJuly in which four young men, three of whom were British-born children \nof Pakistani immigrants and the fourth who was a Jamaican immigrant, \nbombed the London subway system. In addition to taking new security \nprecautions, the British Government recognized the need to ensure that \nimmigrants to their country, and especially those who become citizens, \nintegrate into British society and demonstrate loyalty to their newly \nadopted homeland.\n  France is similarly facing a period of self-examination on \nintegrating immigrants and the children of immigrants following the 2-\nweek violent civil unrest that spread across many of France's poor \nsuburbs last month. That violence resulted in 126 policemen being \ninjured, 9,000 cars burned, and $250 million in damages, according to \nthe French Government.\n  Like their British neighbors across the English Channel, the French \nare trying to figure out how to integrate this dissatisfied \npopulation--the children of Muslim immigrants--into French society. \nAccording to the French Ambassador:\n\n       [T]hese teenagers feel alienated and discriminated against \n     both socially and economically. They don't want to assert \n     their differences. They want to be considered 100-percent \n     French.\n\n  We should learn a lesson from our friends across the ocean. As we in \nthe Senate begin to debate our immigration policy next month in the \nSenate, we would be wise to consider their quandary. Too often \ndiscussions on immigration reform begin and end with securing our \nborders. Securing our borders is step No. 1, but there are two \nadditional, essential steps to any comprehensive solution to our \nimmigration problems.\n  Step No. 2, once we have secured our borders, is to create a lawful \nstatus for those whom we welcome to work here and those we welcome to \nstudy here. We should remember who we are. This is a nation of \nimmigrants. President Franklin D. Roosevelt began one of his addresses, \n``My fellow immigrants.'' Once we secure the borders, once we deal with \nthe rule of law problem, we need then to remember step No. 2, which is \nthat we have millions of people whom we welcome to work here in all \naspects of our society. They need a legal status that respects our rule \nof law. We welcome the 572,000 foreign students who come here to study. \nWe hope many of them stay here. They are helping to create a higher \nstandard of living for us. If they go home they become ambassadors for \nAmerican values. Recently, Dr. Steven Chu, an American who was the \ncowinner of the 1997 Nobel prize in physics, pointed out to me that 60 \npercent of Americans\n\n[[Page S13468]]\n\nwho have won the Nobel Prize in physics are immigrants or the children \nof immigrants.\n  That is a second point--a lawful status for workers, and a lawful \nstatus for students and researchers, whom we want to come here. We want \nthem here because their being here helps raise our standard of living.\n  The third part that is essential to comprehensive immigration reform \nis an examination of how we help new immigrants to this country become \nAmerican.\n  In short, we need to have a discussion about fulfilling the promise \nto the national motto that is right above the head of the Presiding \nOfficer: E pluribus unum; from many, one. How do we do that? We do that \nby reminding ourselves that while we have all of this magnificent \ndiversity in this country, that is not our greatest accomplishment. Our \ngreater accomplishment is that we have turned that magnificent \ndiversity into one nation; that while we are proud of where we came \nfrom, we are prouder of where we are. We are united by principles, not \nrace. We are united by a common language, English, and by our history \nof constantly struggling to reach high ideals which our Founders set \nfor us as a nation.\n  We welcome new immigrants to join in that struggle toward becoming \nAmericans. We have an advantage, therefore, over our European friends. \nWe have been doing this through our whole history. We are unique in our \nworld in our attitude toward welcoming others. We are different because \nunder our Constitution, becoming an American can have nothing to do \nwith ancestry. America is an idea, not a race.\n  One can see that in the various naturalization ceremonies which occur \nin courthouses all around this country, as new citizens raise their \nhands and take an oath that George Washington first administered to his \nofficers at Valley Forge when he declared that he had no allegiance or \nobedience to King George III, and he renounced, refused, and abjured \nany allegiance or obedience to him, and swore he would support, \nmaintain, and defend the United States. That is what George Washington \nand his officers said. That is the standard for every American citizen \nwho comes to this country.\n  Once we secure our borders, once we establish a lawful status for \nworkers and for students we welcome here, then we should set about \nhelping prospective citizens become American.\n  Senator Cornyn and I have introduced a bill that we hope will be \nincluded as part of comprehensive immigration reform legislation. Our \nbill, the Strengthening American Citizenship Act, would do the \nfollowing: provide $500 grants for English courses; allow prospective \ncitizens who become fluent in English to apply for citizenship 1 year \nearly; provides for grants to organizations for courses in American \nhistory and civics, and authorize the creation of a foundation to \nassist in those efforts; codify the oath of allegiance that George \nWashington gave to his officers and took himself, and which is \nsubstantially administered to every new citizen today; direct the \nDepartment of Homeland Security to carry out a strategy to highlight \nthe moving ceremonies in which immigrants become American citizens; and \nestablish an award to recognize the contributions of new citizens to \nour great Nation.\n  Real immigration reform must encompass all three important steps: \nFirst, securing our borders. Second, a legal status for guest workers \nand guest students. Third, I hope I have reminded us of the importance \ntoday of remembering that motto we see when we are here in the Senate \nchamber that indispensable to immigration reform is helping prospective \ncitizens become American.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/12/13/senate-section/article/S13468-1", "month": "12", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13468-S13469]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            HIGHER EDUCATION\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed \nin the Record a statement I made to the Secretary of Education's \nCommission on the Future of Higher Education on December 9, 2005, in \nNashville.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  A National Dialogue: The Secretary of Education's Commission on the \n                       Future of Higher Education\n\n       Thank you for the time you are giving to this Commission's \n     work, and thank you for inviting me to testify.\n       I've seen higher education from many sides, so I'm \n     sometimes asked, ``What's harder: being governor of a state, \n     a member of a president's cabinet, or president of a \n     university?''\n       My answer is: ``Obviously, you've never been president of a \n     university, or you wouldn't ask such a question.''\n       I have six suggestions for recommendations you might make.\n       First, I hope you will urge the Administration that \n     appointed you to make the National Academies' ``Augustine \n     Report'' a focus of the President's State of the Union \n     address in January and of his remaining three years in \n     office.\n       This 20-point, $10 billion a year report is the National \n     Academies' answer to the following question that Senator Pete \n     Domenici, Senator Jeff Bingaman and I posed to them in May: \n     ``What are the ten top actions, in priority order, that \n     federal policy makers could take to enhance the science and \n     technology enterprise so the United States can successfully \n     compete, prosper and be secure in the global community of the \n     21st century?'' The report was written by a distinguished \n     panel of business, government, and university leaders headed \n     by Norm Augustine, former CEO of Lockheed Martin.\n       As 2005 ends, we Americans--who constitute just five \n     percent of the world's population--will once again produce \n     nearly thirty percent of the world's wealth.\n       Most of this good fortune comes from the American advantage \n     in brainpower: an educated workforce, and our science and \n     technology. More Americans go to college than in any country. \n     Our universities are the world's best, attracting more than \n     500,000 of the brightest foreign students. No country has \n     national research laboratories to match ours. Americans have \n     won the most Nobel Prizes in science, and have registered the \n     most patents. We have invented the internet, the automobile \n     and the computer chip, television and electricity. From such \n     advances have come a steady flow of the world's best paying \n     jobs.\n       As one scientist has said, we don't have science and \n     technology because we're rich. We're rich because we have \n     science and technology.\n       Yet I am worried that America may be losing its brainpower \n     advantage. Most Americans who travel to China, India, \n     Finland, Singapore and Ireland come home saying, ``Watch \n     out.''\n       The Augustine panel found I am right to be worried:\n       Last year, China trained 500,000 engineers, India 200,000, \n     while the U.S. trained 70,000.\n       For the cost of one chemist or engineer in the U.S., a \n     company can hire five chemists in China or 11 engineers in \n     India.\n       China is spending billions to recruit the best Chinese \n     scientists from American universities to return home to build \n     up Chinese universities.\n       They also found signs that we are not keeping up:\n       U.S. 12th graders performed below the international average \n     of 21 leading countries on tests of general knowledge in \n     math.\n       In 2003, only three American companies ranked among the top \n     10 recipients of new U.S. patents.\n       Of 120 new chemical plants being built around the word with \n     price tags of $1 billion or more, one is in the U.S. and 50 \n     are in China.\n       Among the Augustine Report's twenty recommendations were:\n       Recruit 10,000 new science and math teachers with four year \n     scholarships and train 250,000 current teachers in summer \n     institutes.\n       Triple the number of students who take Advanced Placement \n     math and science exams.\n       Increase federal funding for basic research in the physical \n     sciences by 10 percent a year for seven years.\n       Provide 30,000 scholarships and graduate fellowships for \n     scientists.\n       Give foreign students who earn a PhD in science, \n     engineering and computing a ``green card'' so they can live \n     and work here.\n       Give American companies a bigger research and development \n     tax credit so they will keep their good jobs here instead of \n     moving them offshore.\n       Some may wince at the $10 billion a year price tag. I \n     believe that the cost is low. America's brainpower advantage \n     has not come on the cheap. This year, one-third of state and \n     local budgets go to fund education. Over fifty percent of \n     American students have a federal grant or loan to help pay \n     for college. The Federal government spends nearly $30 billion \n     per year this year on research at universities, and another \n     $34 billion to fund 36 national research laboratories.\n       Just this year, Congress has authorized $75 billion to \n     fight the war in Iraq, $71 billion for hurricane recovery, \n     $13 billion in increased Medicaid spending and $352 billion \n     to finance the national debt. If we fail to invest the funds \n     necessary to keep our brainpower advantage, we'll not have an \n     economy capable of producing enough money to pay the bills \n     for war, Social Security, hurricanes, Medicaid, and debt.\n       Aside from the war on terror, there is no greater challenge \n     than maintaining our brainpower advantage so we can keep our \n     good paying jobs. That is the surest way to keep America on \n     top.\n\n[[Page S13469]]\n\n       Second, I suggest that you recommend that Presidents of the \n     United States appoint a lead advisor to coordinate all of the \n     federal government responsibilities for higher education.\n       My greatest regret as U.S. Education Secretary was that I \n     did not volunteer to be that lead person. Secretary \n     Spellings, with the appointment of this commission, has \n     assumed at least some of that responsibility. But the \n     authority of the Secretary of Education over higher education \n     is somewhat like the authority of the U.S. Senate Majority \n     leader or a university president: overestimated. Almost every \n     agency of the federal government has something to do with \n     higher education, tens of billions of taxpayer dollars are \n     invested every year and someone should be looking at all of \n     this in a coordinated way.\n       Third, I urge you to join me on the bandwagon for \n     deregulation of higher education.\n       The greatest threat to the quality of American higher \n     education is not underfunding, it is overregulation. The key \n     to the quality of our higher education system is that it is \n     not a system. It is a marketplace of 6,000 autonomous \n     institutions. Yet, thanks largely to the last two rounds of \n     the federal Higher Education Act, each one of our 6,000 \n     higher education institutions that accepts students with \n     federal grants and loans must wade through over 7,000 \n     regulations and notices. The President of Stanford has \n     said that seven cents of every tuition dollar is spent on \n     compliance with governmental regulations.\n       Fourth, I urge the Congress to overhaul the Medicaid \n     program and free states from outdated federal court consent \n     decrees so that states may properly fund colleges and \n     universities.\n       You have two charts before you that tell the story. \n     Nationally, during the five year period from 2000 to 2004, \n     state spending for Medicaid was up 36 percent, while state \n     spending for higher education was up only 6.8 percent. As one \n     result, tuition was up 38 percent.\n       The story in Tennessee was worse. Medicaid spending was up \n     71 percent, while higher education was up only 10.5 percent, \n     and tuition was up 43 percent.\n       By the way, during this same four year period, federal \n     spending for higher education was up 71 percent.\n       When I left the governor's office in 1987, Tennessee was \n     spending 51 cents of each state tax dollar on education and \n     16 cents on health care, mainly Medicaid. Today it is 40 \n     cents on education and 26 cents on health care, mainly \n     Medicaid.\n       To give governors and legislatures the proper authority to \n     allocate resources, Congress should give states more \n     authority over Medicaid standards and more ability to \n     terminate outdated federal court consent decrees that remove \n     decision-making authority from elected officials.\n       Fifth, I hope you will put a spotlight on the greatest \n     disappointment in higher education today: Colleges of \n     Education.\n       ``At a time when America's schools face a critical demand \n     for effective principals and superintendents, the majority of \n     programs that prepare school leaders range in quality from \n     inadequate to poor.'' Those are not my words, but those of a \n     new report by Arthur Levine, the President of Teachers \n     College, Columbia University. Or ask Richard Light, the \n     Harvard professor, who is working with university presidents \n     trying to find and inspire a new generation of leaders for \n     our colleges of education. Sometimes colleges of education \n     are even roadblocks to the very reforms they ought to be \n     championing. In 1983, when I asked colleges of education to \n     help me find a fair way to pay teachers more for teaching \n     well (which not one state was doing at the time), they said \n     it couldn't be done. So we invented our own system for \n     thousands of teachers, with virtually no help from the very \n     people who are in business to figure out such things. And \n     still today, despite the good work of Governor Hunt and \n     others, the lack of differential pay is the major obstacle to \n     quality teaching.\n       Finally, I hope you will put a spotlight on the greatest \n     threat to broader public support and funding for higher \n     education: the growing political one-sidedness which has \n     infected most campuses, and an absence of true diversity of \n     opinion.\n       To describe this phenomenon, allow me to borrow some words \n     from the past which may sound familiar to your chairman, \n     Charles Miller, who was once Chairman of the Board of regents \n     of the University of Texas: ``systematic, persistent and \n     continuous attempts by a politically dominant group to impose \n     its social and educational views on the university.'' This \n     was what the American Association of University Professors \n     (AAUP) called it in its censure of Texas Governor Pappy \n     O'Daniel's Board of Regents when the Board fired University \n     of Texas President Homer Rainey in the 1940's. This is \n     reported in Willie Morris' book, North Toward Home. Then the \n     AAUP was talking about one-sidedness imposed by the right, \n     instead of by the left--but political one-sidedness is \n     political one-sidedness, no matter from what direction it \n     comes.\n       There is more to this charge of one-sidedness than the \n     academic community would like to admit. How many conservative \n     speakers are invited to deliver commencement addresses? How \n     many colleges require courses in U.S. history? How many even \n     teach Western Civilization? How many bright, young faculty \n     members are encouraged to earn dissertations in the failures \n     of bilingual education, or on the virtues of vouchers or \n     charter schools?\n       I am not surprised that most faculties express liberal \n     views, vote Democratic and that most faculty members resist \n     authority. That is the nature of most university communities. \n     But I am disappointed when true diversity of thought is \n     discouraged in the name of a preferred brand of diversity. \n     This one-sidedness is not good for students. It is not good \n     for the pursuit of truth. And it undermines broad public \n     support for higher education. The solution to this political \n     rigidity lies not in Washington, D.C., but in the hands of \n     trustees, deans and faculty members themselves.\n       Last year Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison of Texas invited \n     former Brazilian President Fernando Henrique Cardoso to join \n     a small group of U.S. Senators in the Majority Leader's \n     office for a discussion. Dr. Cardoso was completing a \n     residency at the Library of Congress.\n       ``What memory of the United States will you take back to \n     your country?'' Senator Hutchison asked Dr. Cardoso.\n       ``The American university,'' he replied immediately. ``The \n     uniqueness, strength and autonomy of the American university. \n     There is nothing like it in the world.''\n       I salute Secretary Spellings and this Commission for \n     undertaking to preserve and improve higher education, \n     America's secret weapon for its future success. In coming to \n     your conclusions, I hope that you will urge the President to \n     adopt the Augustine Report and to designate a lead advisor \n     for higher education, that you will jump on the bandwagon to \n     deregulate higher education and preserve its autonomy, that \n     you will urge Congress to overhaul Medicaid and federal court \n     consent decrees so states can properly fund higher education, \n     and that you will urge trustees to revamp Colleges of \n     Education and ensure a campus environment that honors true \n     diversity of opinion.\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, Secretary Spellings has appointed this \ncommission to look at the future of higher education. Other than the \nwar against terror, keeping our brain power advantage so we can create \nnew jobs here in the United States and keep our jobs from going to \nChina, India, Finland, and Ireland, is the biggest challenge we face as \na nation.\n  I made a statement before the Commission on the Future of Higher \nEducation that it adopt the recommendations of the National Academies' \n``Augustine Report'' and urge the President to make it a focus of his \nState of the Union Address. The report recommends 20 steps to keep that \nbrain power advantage, and was written by a distinguished panel of \nbusiness, government, and university leaders headed by Norm Augustine, \nformer CEO of Lockheed Martin.\n  I also urged the commission to make certain that we deregulate higher \neducation; to make certain that the President appoints an adviser to \ncoordinate all of the Federal Government's responsibilities for higher \neducation; to urge Congress to overhaul Medicaid so States may properly \nfund higher education; to put a spotlight on the greatest \ndisappointment in higher education today, our colleges of education; \nand, finally, to put a spotlight on the greatest threat to broader \npublic support for funding of higher education, the growing political \none-sidedness which has infected most campuses in an absence of true \ndiversity of opinion.\n  I salute Secretary Spellings and her distinguished commission. I look \nforward to their recommendations. There could not be a more important \nsubject to our country's future for them to consider than how do we \ntake this remarkable system of higher education that we built in this \ncountry--the best in the world--and strengthen it so it can play a \npivotal role in helping Americans keep good-paying jobs in the United \nStates.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/12/13/senate-section/article/S13469-1", "month": "12", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13469-S13471]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              TANF PROGRAM\n\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I rise today to urge our colleagues in the \nSenate to instruct the conferees to the budget reconciliation bill to \nreject the House provisions dealing with the Temporary Assistance for \nNeedy Families, TANF, Program.\n  Like several of our colleagues, I have a long history of working to \nimprove our Nation's welfare policies to, first of all, make them more \neffective for States, but also more effective for families.\n  When I was privileged to serve as Governor of the State of Delaware, \nI also served, at the same time, as cochairman of the National \nGovernors Association's Welfare Reform Task\n\n[[Page S13470]]\n\nForce, along with then-Governor John Engler, and played a lead role in \nhelping to craft welfare reform legislation for Delaware and for our \nNation.\n  As Senator, I have pushed, for the past 3 years, for welfare \nreauthorization legislation that emphasizes work while also providing \nhelp to welfare participants with respect to childcare and educational \nopportunities.\n  Because of my extensive involvement with welfare reform for more than \na dozen years and my belief that the program can work for both States \nand families, I am troubled that the House of Representatives has \nchosen to include its welfare reauthorization bill in the budget \nreconciliation package. Doing so gives the Senate no opportunity to \ndebate the needed changes in this important program.\n  The TANF provisions included by the House would reauthorize and make \nsignificant policy changes to our Nation's welfare program. Those \nchanges include far more stringent work requirements than under current \nlaw while failing to provide sufficient childcare funding or other work \nsupports to help participants meet those new requirements. The House \nbill would dramatically increase requirements on States without giving \nthem additional resources. And the House language would make it more \ndifficult for TANF recipients to make the successful leap from welfare \nto work.\n\n  The budget reconciliation process is not the right place to \nreauthorize our country's welfare program. Instead, we should take the \nopportunity to reauthorize welfare through the regular legislative \nprocess, using the bipartisan bill reported out of the Senate Finance \nCommittee as our guide.\n  Earlier this year, you may recall, the Senate Finance Committee \nreported out a welfare reform bill--it is called the Personal \nResponsibility and Individual Development for Everyone Act, lovingly \nknown as the PRIDE Act--on a bipartisan basis. This legislation would \nmake commonsense changes and reauthorize the welfare reform program for \nthe next 5 years. The measure would also provide long overdue stability \nto States and beneficiaries who have been waiting since 2002 for us to \nprovide long-term reauthorization, a path forward.\n  I would like to commend this afternoon Chairman Grassley and Ranking \nMember Baucus, their Finance Committee colleagues, and their staff for \ntheir hard work in crafting the bipartisan PRIDE Act. That legislation \nis a testament to their dedication and their commitment to enabling \nAmericans to move off welfare and, most importantly, be better off. \nThat committee was able to find consensus on issues that can be both \ncomplex and, at times, controversial.\n  The PRIDE bill can and should be taken up by the full Senate and \ndebated on the Senate floor early next year. This is not a debate that \nshould consume weeks but, rather, a debate that should consume at most \na few days. I pledge today to work closely with my colleagues on our \nside and the Republican side of the aisle to ensure that the bill does \nnot get bogged down in the Senate and that we move it along.\n  A full debate, though, on the issues would give the Senate, not just \na few Senate conferees to a reconciliation bill, the opportunity to \nhave a real discussion about the future of welfare and what policies we \nshould accept or reject during reauthorization. That is what we need to \ndo. And I believe it need not take weeks to develop a consensus and \npass a bipartisan bill by a wide margin.\n  In my view, the House welfare reform bill, called the Personal \nResponsibility, Work, and Family Promotion Act of 2005, is, \nunfortunately, decidedly partisan. The bill was reported out of both \nsubcommittee and committee by party-line votes and was then dropped \nwholesale into the budget reconciliation bill.\n  While I am opposed to the inclusion of the House TANF provisions in \nthe reconciliation bill, I encourage my Senate colleagues to oppose \nincluding it for a number of other reasons as well.\n  I fear that the House's inclusion of a welfare reauthorization bill \nin a budget reconciliation bill sets up two likely possibilities: No. \n1, that the conferees will simply recede to the House TANF provisions; \nor, No. 2, differences between the House TANF provisions and the Senate \nPRIDE bill will have to be worked out during a hurried conference \ncommittee, in which a few conferees will be faced with tough choices on \nan incredible array of other issues. Neither scenario is acceptable. \nWelfare will likely be overshadowed in this context and is not likely \nto get much thoughtful review.\n  The work-first approach to welfare reform has enabled States to \nreduce caseloads dramatically over the last decade or so, while helping \nmembers of low-income families to move into jobs and toward financial \nself-sufficiency. We should build on these successes, not jeopardize \nthem. By giving welfare the proper legislative consideration in both \nthe House and the Senate, we can do just that.\n  The House TANF provisions differ greatly from the Senate's, and I \nbelieve a number of the House provisions are flat out unacceptable. The \nHouse bill would dramatically increase, for example, the number of \nhours that welfare recipients must work. You may recall, under current \nlaw, welfare recipients must work an average of 30 hours per week. \nHowever, under current law, mothers with young children under the age \nof 6 must now work at least 20 hours per week. The House bill, by \ncomparison, requires that all welfare recipients--if you have a child a \nweek old or a month old or a year old--even mothers with young children \nmust work 40 hours per week. That is a doubling of the required hours \nfor single parents with young children.\n  I have been supportive of increased work requirements in the past, \nbut the House bill increases work hours while failing to provide \nadequate funding for badly needed childcare.\n  My friends, we can do better than that. To me, it is just basic \nlogic, basic common sense that in order to move parents off welfare \ninto work, we have to give them access to decent childcare. The House \nbill provides only $100 million per year in additional childcare \nfunding to meet a doubling of work hours. Spread out over 50 States, \nthat does not come close to meeting the needs of families. In fact, \nover 5 years, this level of funding is $500 million less than what has \nbeen included in previous House-passed bills, and $5.5 billion less \nthan what the Senate would provide. What is more, according to the \nCongressional Budget Office, it is $4.3 billion less than what is \nneeded to keep pace with inflation and almost $8 billion less than the \namount needed to offset increased demand for childcare caused by the \nincreased work requirements.\n  Again, when I was privileged to serve as Governor of my little State, \nI saw firsthand that parents cannot move to work successfully if they \ndo not have an answer to this question: Who is going to take care of my \nchildren and how will I pay for it?\n  If we want to help parents find jobs--and I know we do--we need to \nhelp them secure childcare. It is just that simple.\n  In addition to what I feel are inadequate provisions surrounding work \nand childcare, the House bill also limits the ability of welfare \nrecipients to participate in educational activities such as vocational \neducation, allowing participants to participate in that activity for \nonly 3 months in a 2-year period instead of the current 12 months.\n\n  The Senate bill, on the other hand, continues to allow 12 months of \nvocational education and also establishes something called a Parents as \nScholars Program, which allows welfare recipients to go on to higher \neducation, not forever but for at least a limited period of time.\n  In my view, the House bill is not friendly to States either. It asks \nStates to make dramatic changes to their programs. Yet it gives them no \nadditional funding to accomplish those changes and little time to meet \nthose requirements before they would be subject to harsh penalties. The \nSenate bill, on the other hand, gives States time to meet new \nrequirements. If States make improvements but for some reason are not \nable to immediately ramp up to the strenuous new targets, penalties \nwill be temporarily waived--not permanently, temporarily. Perhaps some \nof my Senate colleagues on the other side of the aisle could find \ncommon ground with the House provisions. Perhaps some believe we could \nimprove upon the House provisions in conference to\n\n[[Page S13471]]\n\ncome up with something that is more workable.\n  I argue, however, that no matter what my colleagues think about the \nHouse proposal, we can all agree that the Senate should have the chance \nto consider welfare reauthorization under regular order, and soon. If \nwe are allowed to debate welfare reform in this body, I am confident we \ncould come up with a bipartisan agreement that truly advances our \nshared goal of making work pay more than welfare.\n  The motion I will offer tomorrow would urge conferees to give the \nSenate a chance to do just that, by rejecting provisions related to the \nreauthorization of TANF. Instead, the motion I will offer would urge \nthat the Congress enact freestanding legislation that builds on the \nbipartisan Senate Finance Committee PRIDE bill.\n  I cannot emphasize enough that the Senate bill was reported out of \nthe Finance Committee on a bipartisan basis. The House bill, on the \nother hand, has consistently enjoyed the support of only one party. \nFurther, welfare reform should not be considered in the whirlwind of \nbudget reconciliation. Reform should be based on sound policy, and we \nshould seek to find bipartisan consensus on this most important issue, \nsomething I am confident we can do.\n  Tomorrow, when the motion to instruct is offered, I urge and invite \nmy colleagues, both Democratic and Republican, to support it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, one of the major items that we will be \ntaking up prior to the end of the year is the issue of the renewal of \nthe so-called USA PATRIOT Act. There was quite an effort in the last \ncouple of years in the Senate to try to fix the problems with the \nPATRIOT Act that led me to vote against it originally. That was a very \ndifficult time, obviously, after 9/11/2001. The PATRIOT Act got through \non a very accelerated basis, and a number of us identified serious \nproblems that other people didn't have a chance to analyze at the time. \nBut the situation now has changed. We have had years to look at this. \nThankfully, the Senate worked together to do its job on this bill.\n  In the Judiciary Committee and in the Senate as a whole, we passed \nchanges to the USA PATRIOT Act, along with renewing the provisions \nscheduled to sunset at the end of this year. It was a unanimous vote. \nPeople from very different philosophies came together and said: Let's \nget this right. Let's make sure law enforcement has the power and the \nability to go after the terrorist network. But, at the same time, let's \ndo what we have to do to protect the civil liberties and rights of \nabsolutely law-abiding Americans.\n  Sadly, the conference committee did just the reverse. The conference \ncommittee ignored the will of the Senate. The conference committee did \nnot make changes in critical areas such as library records and business \nrecords, so-called sneak-and-peek searches, and national security \nletters, changes that were essential to reaching the changes that were \nagreed to in the Senate. I didn't think the Senate version did as much \nto protect civil liberties and the rights of innocent Americans as we \nshould have, but it was a move in the right direction. Regrettably, the \nconference report is nothing of the kind.\n  I join Senator Sununu, who spoke eloquently about this earlier today, \nin saying that the conference report that will be before the Senate is \nnot acceptable in its current form. The conference committee needs to \ngo back to the drawing board and make the changes that are needed. The \nchanges are very easy to find. They were contained in the unanimously \napproved Senate reauthorization bill.\n  Clearly, there will be much more to say about this as the week goes \non, but we are prepared to use whatever means we are allowed to use \nunder the Senate rules to try to prevent this conference report from \nbecoming law in its current form.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/12/13/senate-section/article/S13471-2", "month": "12", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13471-S13478]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                  IRAQ\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, over the past few months, I have \naddressed the Senate on a number of occasions about the \nadministration's flawed Iraq policies. I have discussed a number of \nproblems with those policies. But the most important problem is that \nthey are undermining our ability to counter a wide range of \ntransnational threats that face our country. In too many cases, these \nthreats have been overlooked or insufficiently addressed because of \nthis administration's misguided emphasis on policies in Iraq.\n  Today I will explain why we need to refocus our national security \nstrategy on the global campaign against terrorist networks, and I will \nbriefly identify five areas on which we need to focus. A clear, \ntargeted strategy to strengthen our national security is not an option \nbut a necessity in the face of the growing threats posed by jihadist \nterrorist networks. The President is spending a lot of time talking \nabout success in Iraq. Unfortunately, he fails to recognize that \nsuccess in Iraq will not be achieved by a massive and indefinite U.S. \nmilitary presence. He appears to fail to understand the limited role \nthat the U.S. military can play in Iraq's long-term political and \neconomic reconstruction efforts. I am afraid to say, he fundamentally \nfails to understand that success in Iraq, as important as it is, is \nsecondary to success in our larger campaign against global terrorists. \nIraq--simply put--is not the be all and end all of our national \nsecurity.\n  Our brave service men and women won a resounding victory in the \ninitial military operation in Iraq. They have performed magnificently \nunder very difficult circumstances. Now their task is largely over. The \ncurrent massive U.S. military presence, without a clear strategy and a \nflexible timetable to finish the military mission in Iraq, is actually \nfueling the insurgency and will ultimately prevent the very economic \nand political progress that the Iraqis are demanding and that the \nPresident has started to talk about in his speeches. This isn't a \nstrategy for success in Iraq or a strategy for success in the fight \nagainst global terrorism. That is why we need a flexible timeline for \nmeeting clear benchmarks and also withdrawing U.S. troops.\n  I am not talking about an artificial timetable, a phrase the \nPresident likes to use. I am calling for a public, flexible timetable \nwith clear benchmarks. I have suggested the end of December 2006 as a \ntarget date for completion of that mission. But I have made clear that \nany date will have to be flexible to respond to unforeseen \ncircumstances.\n  The administration has a unique opportunity this week to set our Iraq \npolicy on track. Iraqis will return to the polls on December 15 to \nchoose their leaders. Spelling out a plan for the timely withdrawal of \nU.S. troops from Iraq will signal U.S. support for an autonomous, \nindependent, and self-sustaining Iraqi government. There is no better \nway to empower the new Iraqi government and the Iraqi people than by \nshowing that the U.S. military mission in Iraq is not indefinite. If we \ndon't heed the advice of a growing chorus of experts to set a timetable \nfor withdrawal, it will be impossible to recenter our priorities and \nreengage in the global campaign against terrorist networks.\n  And that is what we need to do in order to defeat those networks.\n  We have not kept our eye on the ball, Mr. President. We have focused \non Iraq to the exclusion of these critical priorities, and we have done \nso at our peril. It is far past time for us to engage in a serious \ndialogue about the threats we face, and come up with a tough, \ncomprehensive national security strategy to defeat them.\n  What are these threats and where do they come from? As we all know, \nthe jihadist network is global in its reach, and it is showing no signs \nof slowing its recruitment and organization in every region of the \nworld. Since we waged war against the Taliban in the fall of 2001--a \nwar I supported, by the way--we have seen the network of extremist \njihadist movements proliferate throughout the world. We have seen it \nsurface in Madrid, London, Amman, Bali, and in places such as the \nPhilippines, Algeria, Pakistan, Somalia, and Nigeria. And while it has \nspread throughout the world, it holds certain\n\n[[Page S13472]]\n\nsimilar characteristics wherever it appears.\n  It is good to turn to the definition that the 9/11 Commission report \nitself gave of what this threat is: ``the enemy is not Islam, the great \nworld faith, but a perversion of Islam.'' The report reads:\n\n     [t]he enemy goes beyond Al-Qaeda to include the radical \n     ideological movement inspired in part by Al-Qaeda that has \n     spawned other terrorists groups and violence. Thus our \n     strategy must match our means to two ends: dismantling the \n     Al-Qaeda network and in the long term prevailing over the \n     ideology that contributes to Islamist terrorism.\n\n  In order to reduce the danger of Al-Qaeda and radical jihadism all \nover the world, we must invest our time, our attention, and our best \nminds on this global threat. And we can't defeat it with just one \naspect of American power. We need to develop and execute a national \nsecurity strategy that utilizes our entire arsenal of political, \neconomic, diplomatic and military power in order to counter the primary \nthreats against us. I want to lay out five major areas of concern \ntoday. They are (1) addressing the conditions in which terrorists \nthrive; (2) enhancing our military's ability to wage the campaign \nagainst global terrorists; (3) improving our public and private \ndiplomacy; (4) strengthening our non-proliferation efforts; and (5), \nfinally finishing the job in Afghanistan.\n\n  First, we must combat the conditions that make extremist ideologies \nattractive and that allow terrorist networks to take root and grow. \nFailed and weak states, such as Somalia, allow terrorism, narcotics \ntrade, weapons proliferation, and other forms of organized crime to \ntake root and grow. By not addressing these conditions, we allow \nwarlords and terrorists to thrive and we leave people suffering from \npoverty and oppression susceptible to their rhetoric, promises, and \npressure.\n  Let us not forget that three of the poorest and most isolated \ncountries in the world--Somalia, Sudan, and Afghanistan--served as the \nstarting blocks for the terrorist network that delivered the most \nlethal attack ever on the U.S. If it wasn't clear before September 11, \n2001, it is now--we ignore these places at our national peril.\n  Over 4 years after 9/11, places like Somalia continue to be large, \nblack holes on our radar, and continue to create the conditions that \nallow terrorist networks to recruit, train, and export their lethality \nat will. While Somalia has remained a failed state for over a decade \nnow, recent examples of the lawlessness that exist within that country \nmade headlines when freely operating pirates attacked a civilian cruise \nship 25 miles off of the Somali coast. We can expect more headlines \nlike that if we continue to think that supposedly small, marginal \nstates are not worth our attention.\n  That is why we should be taking seriously the inability of Uganda, \nthe new government of southern Sudan, or the U.N. to defeat the Lords \nResistance Army, which continues to commit atrocities around the Great \nLakes region of central Africa. And we do not always have to look far \nfor failed states. Right here in our backyard, Haiti endures rampant \npolitical violence and a festering humanitarian crisis, and has served \nas a base for narcoterrorists and criminal power structures throughout \nthe region for over a decade. Unfortunately, this administration has \nfailed to develop a comprehensive policy to help Haiti lift itself from \nchaos and to create livable conditions for the citizens of Haiti. That \nis a mistake because leaving a country to suffer under chaos only \ncreates a platform for further threats to the region and to our \ncountry.\n  If we fail to address weak and failed states, the lawlessness \ndisplayed by warlords, pirates, bandits, thugs, and thieves there will \neventually be exploited by our enemies. After all, terrorists find \nactive and passive support among the alienated and the disaffected. \nAddressing failed and failing states is not easy, but turning a blind \neye to them is naive and dangerous.\n  My second area of concern today is the need to prepare and equip our \nmilitary for a global campaign against terrorist networks. The war in \nIraq has had a devastating affect on our military's readiness and \ncapabilities. I have voted for an increase in the military's end \nstrength, but this is a long-term solution and does not address the \nimmediate problems we face as we continue to over-burden the brave men \nand women of our armed forces. It also does not address our failure to \nprioritize military spending. Right now, courageous servicemembers are \ntoo often required to do their jobs without the right equipment. While \nwe continue to spend billions of dollars on Cold War-era weapons \nsystems, we are not fully funding the needs of the military personnel \nfighting our current wars. It is a national shame that the Department \nof Defense budget, which so dwarfs our spending in any other sector, \nstill has failed to pay for the timely provision of adequate armor for \nour men and women in the battlefield.\n  Mr. President, waging a successful global campaign against terrorism \nalso will require us to counter new and growing terrorist tactics. \nImprovised Explosive Devices, IEDs, continue to increase in lethality \nand complexity in Iraq and elsewhere. I was pleased that Secretary \nRumsfeld recently appointed a retired general to lead a joint task \nforce on countering the threat of IEDs. As the death of 11 marines in \nIraq on December 5 showed, the U.S. military has yet to develop a \nstrategy or technology to sufficiently defend our servicemen and women \nfrom these troubling weapons. More troubling is the fact that we are \nnow seeing the use of increasingly sophisticated IEDs outside of Iraq. \nThis know-how and technology is being proliferated throughout the \nglobal network of terrorists who seek to harm the United States.\n\n  The IED task force needs to identify a strategy, tactics, technology, \nand training to defend from these weapons, but it also needs to figure \nout ways of countering the proliferation of IED technology, know-how, \nand tactical training that are currently being exported from Iraq. \nTragically, Iraq has turned in to a testing-ground for these new \nweapons, and the administration needs to explain not just how it is \ncountering the lethality of IEDs in Iraq, but also how it is mitigating \nor preempting the use of these weapons by terrorist networks globally.\n  My third area of concern is our woefully inadequate diplomatic \nefforts, public and private. As the recent 9/11 Commission report card \nshowed, we need to do much better in communicating our principles and \ngoals to the international community. In part we are failing because \nthis administration has not consistently adhered to the core American \nvalues that have made us a model around the world, that helped defeat \ncommunism, and that have inspired democracies globally. The \nadministration's approach to detainees, torture, and secret prisons, to \nname a few issues, has jeopardized this country's unique moral \nauthority as a country that upholds the rights, liberties, and freedoms \nof every individual. I believe that we can combat terrorism while \nremaining true to those values.\n  Mr. President, we need a new, sustained and comprehensive public and \nprivate diplomacy, and a concerted effort to tell the rest of the world \nwho we really are and what we really believe in. This diplomatic effort \nis essential if we are going to prevail in what is in part a battle of \nideas--and one that we cannot afford to lose. I am not talking about \ngiving lectures or showing videos, but about engaging in genuine \ndialogue with other peoples and countries. Listening, and responding \nto, their concerns is one of the most effective ways to improve our \nimage, and thus our relationship, with the international community.\n  Diplomacy also involves looking for opportunities to demonstrate our \ncore values. One such opportunity was lost in the response to the \nrecent tragic earthquake in Pakistan where hundreds of local religious \norganizations--many of them linked to extremist or anti-American \nideologies--beat out American relief efforts with quick, appropriate, \nand thoughtful responses. A CEO of a U.S.-based relief agency, having \njust returned from Pakistan, relayed to me his frustration that ``the \nUnited States lost a significant opportunity to win the hearts and \nminds of a core population in Pakistan vulnerable to extremist \nideologies because we responded with standard, boxed solutions.''\n  We also need to engage our international partners not only in the \ncampaign against terrorist networks, but also in the challenge to \neradicate malaria, address HIV/AIDS, help rebuild\n\n[[Page S13473]]\n\ncountries such as the Democratic Republic of the Congo, bring peace to \nthe Darfur region in Sudan, and help counter the impact that illicit \npower structures and the absence of rule of law have on societies \naround the world, to give just a few examples. We need to work hand in \nhand with those partners in developing strategies to isolate rogue \nstates and to advance democracy and respect for human rights.\n  The fourth area we need to focus on is the proliferation of weapons, \nlarge and small. We need to do much more to stop nuclear proliferation \nand ensure that terrorist organizations do not obtain access to nuclear \nweapons. We must deal with the threats of loose nukes as an urgent \npriority both at home and abroad. This administration unfortunately has \nfailed to do so. More nuclear weapons were secured in Russia in the 2 \nyears before 9/11 than in the 2 years after. That is an alarming fact. \nAnd we should not have missed the opportunity at the last Nuclear Non-\nProliferation Treaty conference to start moving forward on a new global \nregime; one that does a better job of protection and punishing cheating \nso that states cannot take their nuclear programs right up to the line \nof compliance and then withdraw from the treaty when they are ready to \nbecome new nuclear weapons states.\n  We should also reverse the foolish decision to ease export \nrestrictions on bomb-grade uranium that was part of the massive and \nmisguided Energy bill signed by the President this summer.\n  We must also focus on smaller weapons that continue to fall into the \nhands of terrorist networks at a cost of tens of thousands of lives \neach year. I applaud the recent announcement by my distinguished \ncolleagues, Senators Lugar and Obama, of their initiative to make more \nfunding and new authorities available for new proliferation programs \nand to counter the growing threat that light weapons, such as the Man \nPortable Air Defense System, pose to the United States.\n  Unfortunately, we are behind the ball on this issue, and we need to \ndrastically improve our ability to hunt down, shut down, and capture \nthe networks of arms dealers that are getting rich by selling weapons \nto our enemies.\n  Fifth and finally, we must refocus our energies on Afghanistan. The \nPresident spends a lot of time discussing Iraq, but not much time on \nAfghanistan which was and maybe still is home to Osama bin Laden. \nUnlike our presence in Iraq, our presence in Afghanistan is \ncontributing to increased stability in the country and region and is \ndelivering progress in the war on al-Qaida.\n  Success in Afghanistan is essential for making progress in the \ncampaign against terrorist networks, and it is where we must show the \ncommitment, resolution, and capabilities of America. It is one of the \nfirst battlefields in this war. We now have the opportunity to turn \nwhat was once a despotic and broken country into a thriving democracy. \nIt needs a lot of work, though, and disproportionate attention to Iraq \nhas drained many of our positive and appreciated efforts in \nAfghanistan.\n  I see three major areas that need further attention in Afghanistan.\n  First, as part of assuring long-term success in Afghanistan, we need \nto ensure that international assistance, much of it from the United \nStates, continues to be targeted, coordinated, and appropriate. We are \nrunning the risk of creating a ``Donor's Republic of Afghanistan'' by \ncreating an unsustainable Afghan Government that the Afghans themselves \ncannot afford or manage. At this time, annual recurring costs to \nmaintain the U.S.-developed Afghan National Army outweigh the central \nGovernment's revenue streams by a multiple of two or three. And this is \nnot taking into consideration the police force and other essential \npublic services that are in drastic disrepair or in need of further \ndevelopment.\n  Second, we need to continue burden sharing throughout the \ninternational community and encouraging a greater role for NATO, the \nUnited Nations and, most importantly, the Afghan Government, as it \nstruggles to fight resurgent terrorist and obstructionist threats.\n  I was glad to receive news last week that NATO will increase its \npresence in southern Afghanistan, but we need to assure that long-term \ndevelopment and security aid is tied to measurable benchmarks for \nsuccess.\n  Third, we need to continue to pressure countries such as Pakistan, \nIran, China, Russia, Turkmenistan, Kyrgyzstan, and others to be \nconstructive partners in the development of Afghanistan's new and \nfragile government and economy. Afghanistan is suffering from porous \nborders which make it an ideal environment for a thriving illegal drug \ntrade, illegal imports and exports, and terrorists and insurgents who \nwant to prevent the new Afghan Government from developing.\n  We have to succeed in Afghanistan. If we allow the new Afghan \nGovernment to become weak, feckless, and corrupt, we will risk losing \neverything we have invested. We will lose a partner in the campaign \nagainst terrorist networks, and we will lose the opportunity to point \nto Afghanistan as an accomplishment.\n  I have tried to identify five crucial areas in which we are not doing \nenough to protect our national security. We are not doing enough for a \nnumber of reasons, but foremost among them is the administration's \nsingle-minded and self-defeating emphasis on Iraq. The President's \ndebilitating and misguided Iraq policy is preventing us from focusing \nour attention, our resources, and our efforts on the global campaign \nagainst terrorist networks. That is why we need a plan to wind down our \nmilitary presence in Iraq and bring our focus back to the threat of \nradical jihadist-based terrorism.\n\n  While this administration talks and thinks about Iraq, our enemies \nare growing stronger around the globe. Those enemies are disparate, \ndiffuse, and relentless. They operate in ungoverned spaces, on the \nInternet, in cities, mountains, and jungles. Left unchecked, they will \ncontinue to plot against the United States.\n  Our national security policy is adrift, but we have the power to \nchange it, to correct our course. We must tackle these challenges and \nbuild a security strategy that protects our Nation from the most \ndangerous threat that it faces.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burr). The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, before the Senator from Wisconsin leaves \nthe floor, I request that he be available to discuss some of the \nprovisions of the PATRIOT Act. I see him remaining on the floor, so \npermit me at this time to take up a couple of the issues which the \nSenator from Wisconsin has raised, appropriately putting my question to \nthe Chair as our rules require, and then asking for responses.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. The Senator from Wisconsin has raised an issue on the \nnational security letters with respect to the presumption which arises \nwhen a high-ranking governmental official, such as the Attorney \nGeneral, Deputy Attorney General, Assistant Attorney General, head of \nthe FBI, or head of the departments making the request, certifies that \nthere is a national security interest or an issue of diplomatic \nrelations.\n  This is an issue which, as I understand it, the ranking member, the \nSenator from Vermont, Mr. Leahy, raised earlier. The question I have \nfor the Senator from Wisconsin is whether he is aware of the fact that \nthe conclusive presumption, which is present in the conference report, \nis not as tight as the conclusive presumption which was present in the \nSenate bill which passed unanimously from the Judiciary Committee, of \nwhich the Senator from Wisconsin is a member, and by unanimous consent \non the floor of the Senate, without objection by the Senator from \nWisconsin.\n  I refer specifically to the provision in the Senate bill which says: \nIn reviewing a nondisclosure requirement, the certification by the \nGovernment that the disclosure may endanger the national security of \nthe United States or interfere with diplomatic relations shall be \ntreated as conclusive unless the court finds that the certification was \nmade in bad faith.\n  That language is substantially repeated in the conference report, \nexcept that the conference report makes it tougher on the governmental \ncertification by requiring the high-level official to make the \ncertification.\n  Quoting from the conference report, it says: If at the time of the \npetition\n\n[[Page S13474]]\n\nthe Attorney General, the Deputy Attorney General and Assistant \nAttorney General or the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation \nor, in the case of a request by a department, agency, or \ninstrumentality of the Federal Government other than the Department of \nJustice, the head or deputy head of such department, agency, or \ninstrumentality--and now we come to the crucial language, continuing--\ncertifies that disclosure may endanger the national security of the \nUnited States or interfere with diplomatic relations, such \ncertification shall be treated as conclusive unless the court finds \nthat the certification was made in bad faith.\n  My questions to the Senator from Wisconsin are the obvious ones: No. \n1, was he aware that the conference report has the identical provision, \nexcept more restrictive, and if so, why does he now object to this \nprovision in the conference report when he approved it in committee and \nraised no objection on the floor?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. As the Senator well knows, on the floor we passed this \nbill by unanimous consent, without debate, but I and others raised our \nconcerns in the Judiciary Committee. The Senator well knows I was not \npleased with the outcome on this provision in the Senate. I fought hard \nto get as many changes as possible, but we did not get the changes we \nneeded with regard to national security letters, and the conference \nreport failed to improve this provision as it should have done.\n  The Senator is correct, as I understand it, that the Senate version \ndid not change much of existing law in this area, and the conference \nreport is essentially the same. The conference report did not include \nthe national security letter standard that a bipartisan group sought, \nthree Democrats and three Republicans, as well as other cosponsors of \nthe SAFE Act, which is that the Government can only obtain records that \npertain to a terrorist and spy.\n  In addition, in answer to the Senator's question, the judicial review \nof the NSL gag rule in the conference report also is inadequate. In the \nSAFE Act, we included meaningful judicial review of national security \nletters and the NSL gag rule. Under the Senate version, there is \njudicial review of national security letters and gag rule, but there \nagain, disappointedly, even the Senate version of the bill failed to \ncreate a standard that was realistic. It created a standard for the gag \nrule that would be virtually impossible to meet.\n  Of course, the areas that caused me to vote for the Senate bill were \nthe improvements it contained, especially the change to Section 215, \nwhich we have lost; on sneak and peak search warrants, which was \nlargely pulled back; and on John Doe roving wiretaps, which have been \nonly partially preserved.\n  The point is that I was not happy with this portion, but in light of \nsome of the other changes in the Senate bill, I did work, as the \nChairman knows, cooperatively with him to create a document that at \nleast had some balance. What has happened now is we have lost the \npositive changes we gained in the Senate bill, and we continue to have \na very inadequate provision relating to the national security letter \nauthority.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, with all due respect, the Senator from \nWisconsin has not answered my question. When he takes up the SAFE Act, \nwhich he cosponsored, so did this Senator. I was not satisfied with the \nprovisions of the PATRIOT Act in effect at the present time, and I was \na cosponsor of the same bill as the Senator from Wisconsin, Senator \nDurbin, and others, in order to protect civil liberties, which I sought \nto do in the Senate bill and I sought to do, and I think successfully, \nin the conference report.\n  When the Senator from Wisconsin talks about Section 215, I am coming \nto that and I wish to engage him in a discussion on that specifically, \nbut let me put it aside for a minute so as not to confuse that issue. \nWith respect to sneak and peak, the delayed notice, I am coming to that \nas well because there are major, vast improvements in the conference \nreport over existing law. With respect to the roving wiretaps, I am \ncoming to that, too. But focusing for just a minute one at a time so \nthere can be some understanding--this is a very complicated bill. I \nspoke on it at some length yesterday afternoon in order to acquaint my \ncolleagues with it. I have made quite a number of calls to my \ncolleagues, as far as I can go, to acquaint people with what is in this \nbill so we can understand it and vote on it with an understanding.\n  Coming back to the conclusive presumption in the national security \nletter, the question I posed to the Senator from Wisconsin was \nwhether--well, maybe three questions. Does not he agree that the \nconference report is even more protective of civil liberties than the \nSenate bill? The second question: Did he know about it? And if on this \nprovision alone, putting aside the others he referred to, 215, sneak \nand peak, and wiretap, and we want to come to sunset, too, which is a \ngigantic improvement--it was not mentioned by the Senator from \nWisconsin. I think when we get to that he will concede that was a big \nimprovement and maybe he overlooked it in commenting or at least any \ncomment that I heard him make. But coming back to the national \nsecurity letter, what about my three questions, if I may pose them \nthrough the Chair to the Senator from Wisconsin?\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I would say to the chairman through the Presiding \nOfficer, I did respond to his question, and I can tell him that I was \naware of the changes that occurred in the conference report vis-a-vis \nthe Senate bill. They are not adequate. We are still very far away from \nthe SAFE Act with regard to this provision. I note that the chairman \ncosponsored the SAFE Act and yet did not object, apparently, to the \nsignificant withdrawal from the SAFE Act provisions in this area. What \nwe need in this provision on these national security letters to prevent \npotential abuses, as well as the abuses that may well be already \noccurring--the Washington Post suggested some 30,000 national security \nletters per year--is a clear standard that these provisions can only be \nused to obtain records that pertain to a terrorist or a spy. Neither \nthe Senate version nor the version in the conference report achieves \nthat. So, yes, I acknowledge there are some language differences, but I \ndo not believe they achieve what we need to achieve with regard to \nnational security letters.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, the Senator from Wisconsin does not know \nwhat I did in conference because he was not a conferee. There is no \nreason why he should know. But I can tell him that I fought very hard \nfor a lot of these provisions, and I can tell him further that I was \nnot persuasive enough to get 100 percent of what I wanted.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I would like to say----\n  Mr. SPECTER. Wait just a minute. I have the floor. I want to finish \nthis, and I will come back to the Senator from Wisconsin and give him \nample time to comment on what he wants to comment on.\n  We have a bicameral system. If the Senate could act alone, we would \nhave had the Senate bill. When the Senator from Wisconsin says he was \nnot satisfied with this provision in the Senate bill contrasted with \nthe SAFE Act, I would not disagree with him about that. I will not \ndisagree with him about that at all. In the Senate bill, I did not have \neverything that I would like. There are 17 other members of the \nJudiciary Committee and there are many members who thought the Senate \nbill went too far on civil rights. It was necessary to balance very \ndelicately to get 18 Senators to agree, sort of unheard of, and I will \nnot go over the composition of the committee, but we have people from \nopposite ends of the political spectrum on that committee.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, would the Senator yield so I can respond \nto his comment?\n  Mr. SPECTER. One moment, and then I will yield for the Senator's \nreply.\n  The point is, the Senate came to this conclusive presumption and the \nSenator from Wisconsin voted for it. The full Senate came to this \nconclusion. The Senator from Wisconsin did not object to it. So I think \nit is rather late in the day--frankly, too late in the day--for the \nSenator from Wisconsin to say that a provision which he has approved is \nthe basis for rejecting the conference report because the conference \nreport did not do something he would have liked better.\n  Now, without yielding the floor, I ask unanimous consent that the \nSenator\n\n[[Page S13475]]\n\nfrom Wisconsin be allowed to make whatever comments he chooses on this \npoint.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, the first thing I want to say is that \nthe Senator from Pennsylvania is not the problem here. Everything he \nhas said is accurate. He fought tenaciously in the committee, and I \nthink brilliantly, to bring us together in a balanced package. I say to \nthe Senator, through the Presiding Officer, I am grateful for his \nefforts in the Judiciary Committee and the Senate as a whole, and for \nhis efforts in the conference committee, because I know the Senator \ntried. What happened in the Senate was that the will of this body as a \nwhole, which we all compromised on, prevailed. The Senator from \nPennsylvania correctly points out that I had to give, unfortunately, on \nthis national security letter issue, to get the important changes \nregarding library records, sneak-and-peek searches, and sunsets.\n  The fact is, I say to the Senator that of course I objected to that \nprovision. But I was trying to work with the Senator to come up with a \nbalanced package, as Senator Sununu and I were commenting earlier, a \npackage we could support as a whole. The Senator is now suggesting that \nafter we made some gains and we lost some issues, I should now accept \nthe one part we did not prevail on and give up the parts I did prevail \non. That strikes me as a rather odd deal.\n  It was, as the Senator knows, a very difficult vote for me to support \nthe Senate package. I was the only Member of this body to vote against \nthe original PATRIOT Act because it was deeply flawed, and the Senator \nfrom Pennsylvania and many others have acknowledged there were such \nflaws and we have worked together to fix what we could. I was \ndetermined, as I said at the time we passed the Senate bill, to work \nwith my colleagues to fix the other flaws, especially those in the \nnational security letters.\n  But this idea that when you get the package back and it only includes \nthe things you don't like and it doesn't include the things you did \nlike, that you should keep your mouth shut and you should not oppose \nit, that to me is ridiculous.\n  Mr. President, I say to the Senator, and I mean it absolutely \nsincerely, he has been a tremendous chairman. He has been one of the \nreal keys to us having any chance at all to fix this legislation. But I \nam very disappointed with what we got back from the conference \ncommittee. I know very well that the chairman did not want this \ndocument to look like this. He wanted it, I assume, to look like the \nvery document he crafted in the Senate Judiciary Committee.\n  I yield back to the Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I do not disagree with everything the \nSenator from Wisconsin has said. In fact, I like part of it where he \nsaid I was brilliant, I like the part where he said I was a tremendous \nchairman, but there were other parts with which I disagree as to what \nhe said.\n  A little levity will not hurt this debate any.\n  I focus only on national security letters at the outset, to establish \nthe point that the conference report is more protective of civil \nliberties on that point than the Senate bill. I want to go on to the \nother points. I have only faint hopes of persuading the Senator from \nWisconsin to support the conference report, but I do think it is very \nuseful to have this discussion because he is, appropriately, very \ndeeply involved in this bill and there is no better way to acquaint our \ncolleagues and the staffs--perhaps two or three people watching on C-\nSPAN2--to acquaint America, to the extent we can, with what we are \ndoing here.\n  On to section 215: Section 215 involves business records and the \nhighly controversial point on library records. The Senator from \nWisconsin is correct that the existing law is deeply flawed. Bear in \nmind, we are living under that law until we pass a new law. That is the \nlaw we are operating under today. Existing law enables a law \nenforcement official unilaterally to go to get records on his \ndetermination that they are relevant, and there is no judicial review. \nWhat the Senate bill did, and what the conference report perpetuates, \nis to put in judicial review. The traditional safeguard of liberty has \nbeen to interpose a disinterested, impartial magistrate between law \nenforcement and the citizen. That is what happens when you get a \nsearch-and-seizure warrant to establish probable cause. That is what \nhappens when you get an arrest warrant to take somebody into custody. \nWe have moved substantially toward that cause, although not quite \nprobable cause for a search warrant or an arrest warrant, but a very \nsubstantial portion of the way by the Senate bill, which is perpetuated \nin the conference report, that a court may issue an order for records \nonly on ``a statement of facts showing that there are reasonable \ngrounds to believe that the tangible things sought are relevant to an \nauthorized investigation to protect against international terrorism.''\n  The Senate bill established three criteria for the relevant standard. \nFirst, activities of a suspected agent of a foreign power; second, a \nforeign power or agent of a foreign power; third, an individual in \ncontact with or known to a suspected agent of a foreign power. In \nconference we did add an additional provision, which the Senator from \nWisconsin has objected to. The additional provision is that the judge \nmay order the production of records of an individual where the judge \nconcludes those records are important--crucial to the investigation, to \na terrorism investigation.\n  If I had my druthers, I wouldn't have put the provision in, but we \nhad a closed-door briefing where the Department of Justice came in and \nshowed us what they consider to be needed. I thought it was within the \nrealm of reason, but I knew it would be an obstacle to getting the law \nput into effect and getting support for that provision, and I opposed \nit. But when I recognized that there are other points of view besides \nmine and besides the Senate's, and without a lot of other major \nconcessions on the national security letter, which I have already \ndescribed and will come back to--there were more concessions we got \nthere--it seemed to me that provision was acceptable.\n  The question which I have for the Senator from Wisconsin is whether \nhe has had an opportunity to get that briefing? Last Thursday, I asked \nmy Chief Counsel, who has done such an extraordinary job, Michael \nO'Neill--who was here a moment or two ago; he's probably too busy to \nstay and listen to his speeches--to make a briefing available to the \nSenator or his staff. My question to the Senator from Wisconsin is, No. \n1, if he has had an opportunity to get that briefing; No. 2, if so, \nwhat he thought of it with respect to the weightiness of what the \nDepartment of Justice had to say; and, No. 3, if this modest addition \nis so significant as to sink--or in conjunction with other similarly \nunweighty matters--sink the bill?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. In response to the Senator from Pennsylvania, the \nSenator knows very well I am familiar with what went on in that \nbriefing. You and I spoke here outside this Senate Chamber about these \nvery provisions. I indicated to the Senator that I had my staff, who \nreceived this briefing, go over with me, in a secure setting, exactly \nthe hypotheticals that those who wanted this additional provision in \nthe conference report raised. My staff and I looked at those \nhypotheticals and were very unpersuaded.\n  Here is the significance. What the Senator from Pennsylvania is \nsuggesting is that it is not a major change to add, on top of the \nthree-part test of the Senate, an additional provision that merely \nrequires relevance. This is a big deal, because the other three \nprovisions require that the records pertain to a terrorist or spy, or \nrecords of people in contact with or known to a terrorist or spy, or \nrelevant to the activities of a terrorist or spy. All three of those \ntests require something closer to the connection that the Senator from \nPennsylvania and I demanded in the SAFE Act.\n  The additional item put in the conference report is the loophole, the \nexception, that swallows that three-part test. It does not require the \nconnection to the terrorist or spy, even though this legislation, from \nthe very outset, was supposed to be a response to what happened on 9/\n11, to terrorism. This does gut the changes to section 215 that are in \nthe Senate bill. This does render meaningless the efforts you and I and\n\n[[Page S13476]]\n\nothers made to get a good provision in the Senate. And, yes, it is a \nsufficient reason not to go forward.\n  The feelings the American people have about this poorly drafted \nsection 215 cannot be answered by a provision that simply demands \ngeneral relevance and does not require a connection to terrorism or \nespionage. It is unacceptable. And on that ground alone, although there \nare other grounds, it is very disturbing.\n  I want to say that the Senator, my colleague and friend, did try \nhard. He said earlier that if he had his druthers he would have \npreferred a better provision. This isn't about druthers. This is about \na devastating power of the Government to be able to go and take your \nlibrary records on some general notion of relevance that has nothing to \ndo with any connection to terrorism or espionage. That is unacceptable \nin America, and under our Bill of Rights.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I did not acquiesce in this matter simply \nas a matter of druthers or nondruthers. I acquiesced in this matter \nbecause it was, as a total scheme of things, acceptable. There was \nadequate protection. It is not, as the Senator from Wisconsin defines \nit, broad-ranging authority of a judge. The impartial judicial official \nhas to agree that it is a terrorism investigation, and that these \nrecords are crucial and important to the investigation, that they are \nrelevant to the investigation, and it is not something that is \nextraneous but it is a terrorism investigation.\n  I focus on this matter again not with any expectation of persuading \nthe Senator from Wisconsin but to tell my colleagues why he is \nobjecting to this provision, and to invite my colleagues, the other 98 \nSenators, if they want the briefing, to see why there were sensible \nreasons for the Department of Justice and the details of this provision \nnot going too far, not impinging on civil liberties because I wouldn't \nsupport a bill which impinged on civil liberties. I simply wouldn't do \nit. But there are others who have contentions, and we had a great many \nconcessions from the House of Representatives.\n  I have taken up the two principal considerations which the Senator \nfrom Wisconsin was arguing, the conclusive presumption in the national \nsecurity letter and this additional provision under section 215.\n  But I want to come back for a moment to the national security letter \non important concessions which the Senate obtained in the conference \nreport, first, to point out that the national security letter was not \nestablished by the PATRIOT Act which we enacted shortly after 9/11. The \nnational security letters have been in existence for decades. But the \nSenate utilized the revisions to the PATRIOT Act to put limitations on \nthe national security letters because they fit within the overall \nparameters. We have some very important concessions on national \nsecurity letters in the conference report. The standard has always been \nthat if you had a national security letter, you kept quiet about it, \nthe recipient did. There was no explicit opportunity for the recipient \nof a national security letter to challenge it. But the conference \nreport fixing up the Senate provision explicitly gives the recipient of \na national security letter the right to contact an attorney, to go to \ncourt, and to have a national security letter quashed, if it is \nunreasonable, oppressive, or otherwise contrary to law. The recipient \nalso has the power to get a court order to tell the target. That is \nsubject to a certification by these high-ranking governmental officials \nthat it would endanger national security or diplomatic relations.\n  But again, the provision in the conference report is more protective \nof civil liberties than what was in the Senate report. On this \nprovision on national security letters, the conference report goes much \nfurther than existing law. Again, the national security letters were \nnot covered in the PATRIOT Act.\n  I don't have a question for the Senator from Wisconsin. I will come \nto some later, but I ask unanimous consent that I might yield to the \nSenator, if he cares to reply at this point to what I have said, \nwithout losing my right to the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I say to the Senator that I meant what I \nsaid about his efforts and his sincere desire to try to fix these \nprovisions, and that is what we started to do in the Senate version.\n  Second, I do think this is an excellent process, that we need to come \nout here on the floor and be very specific about what is right and what \nis wrong about these provisions. It is neither sufficient to say to our \ncolleagues that we have to pass it as it is because the time is running \nout, nor is it sufficient for somebody on my side to say, look, this is \nan enormously dangerous, unfixable provision and the whole thing should \ngo down. Neither of those positions is defensible. What is defensible \nis to look at each of these provisions as we have been doing and ask if \nwe have done enough to protect law-abiding Americans. I come to the \nconclusion that we were very close, had maybe even achieved that with \nregard to section 215. But the conference report failed in that regard, \nand it brings us back far too close to the original mistake.\n  On the national security letters, I am not impressed by the \nimprovements of the Senate version, which I didn't find to be adequate \nin the first place. So with regard to both of those, not to mention the \nsneak-and-peek searches that we will discuss later on, the conference \nreport simply does not do the job.\n  I do recognize the Senator's sincere desire to make sure the Senate \nis well informed about the remaining issues that could affect how \nMembers vote on the conference report.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, the national security letters are \nstronger in the conference report than they were in the Senate bill. \nThe conclusive presumption in the conference report is more protective \nthan the language in the Senate bill on conclusive presumption. The \nconference report picking up the Senate bill provisions improves the \ncivil liberties protection from existing law by the explicit right of \nthe recipient to go to court to quash or to make the disclosure to the \ntarget.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, if I could make one remark, and then I \nwill have to leave. If the Senator will yield.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I will yield on the condition that I not lose my right \nto the floor.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. On the national security letters, we will have to agree \nto disagree and continue to debate this and come to a similar \nconclusion with regard to what the conference report did vis-a-vis the \nSenate bill. Perhaps we could agree on how valuable it would be in \nlight of how serious these concerns are about the national security \nletters, for that provision at least to be part of the group of \nprovisions subject to a sunset.\n  I want to point out to my colleagues with regard to these national \nsecurity letters that there may have been 30,000 issued, according to \nthe Washington Post, per year. That power is not sunsetted. That is \ntroubling.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I suggest that the Senator from Wisconsin \nget a classified briefing and not accept what he reads in the \nWashington Post. The Washington Post is wrong. I hope the Senator from \nWisconsin will not leave the floor. If I can have the attention of the \nSenator from Wisconsin, I hope he will not leave the floor while I make \na couple of other comments. I will try to be brief, although I don't \nthink it has been extensive so far.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I appreciate that. I need to leave briefly. I will be \nright back, but I enjoy this process. I need to take care of one \nmatter, and I look forward to returning to continue this discussion.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Let me be brief with one comment about 30,000. I urge \nthe Senator from Wisconsin to get a classified briefing and not to take \nthe facts of the Washington Post, because the Washington Post is \ntotally wrong. I am not at liberty to tell the Senator what the facts \nare, although I asked the Department of Justice to put those facts \nbefore the public. Too much is classified, and I think this is \ninappropriately classified. I would like to be able to detail it.\n  Let me talk about the delayed notice provisions.\n  Existing law provides for notification of the target in a reasonable \nperiod of time, which could mean anything. The Senate bill called for 7 \ndays, the House\n\n[[Page S13477]]\n\nbill wanted 180 days, and we got 30 days.\n  I suggest in the totality of the legislation that we are in the 85 to \n15-percent range, 85-percent Senate provisions, 15-percent House \nprovisions, and the 15 percent which the House has does not impinge on \ncivil liberties. I wouldn't take 1 percent if this were an \ninappropriate impingement on civil liberties. The 30 days can be \nextended by a court on cause shown for specific reasons.\n  With respect to the wiretap provision, I joined the Senator from \nWisconsin in opposing the roving wiretaps. I have never liked wiretaps. \nWhen I was district attorney for Philadelphia, this issue came up for \nconsideration of our body, and I was the only one of 67 county district \nattorneys to object to wiretapping.\n  Since I can only be brief here, I would invite my colleagues again--I \nknow I am not going to persuade the Senator from Wisconsin. In talking \nabout the late notice and talking about the wiretap provisions, I want \nmy colleagues to look at the details as to how we have protected \nagainst random selection on the specification, a description of the \nperson who is to be wiretapped, and showing that the person subject to \nthe wiretap is likely to try to avoid the wiretap.\n\n  The final comment I have to make is about sunsetting. The House put \nin a provision for a 10-year sunset. The Senate put in a provision for \na 4-year sunset. The House wanted the compromise of 7 years, halfway \nbetween 4 and 10. The Senate conferees insisted on a compromise at 4 \nyears. The House said it was not much of a compromise, not when they \nwere at 10 and the Senate was at 4 years. I thank the White House for \nassistance in working this detail out. We did so on the expectation \nthat by working the sunset to 4 years, we would have a number of \nSenators' signatures on the conference report and a number of House \nsignatures on the conference report.\n  I am not going to wash that linen in public as to what happened but \nonly to say that our ability to review this bill at 4 years is a mighty \npotent weapon to keep law enforcement on its toes, knowing it is going \nto be subject to review in that period of time.\n  I have pledged privately and publicly and again in the Senate \nyesterday to have extensive and piercing oversight as to what law \nenforcement does. I think the Senator from Wisconsin will agree on the \npoint that in the year I have been chairman, there has been real \noversight. We have called for it and done a job here.\n  The debate has been very useful. I don't have any questions to pose \nto the Senator from Wisconsin. I am glad he is here to respond so the \nother side can be articulated and so my colleagues can make their own \nevaluation as to the weight of the objection of the Senator from \nWisconsin to section 215, which is very limited to that one additional \nprovision, which is justified, so they can evaluate his objection to \nthe national security letters where the conclusive presumption is \ntighter in the conference report than in the Senate version and other \nprotections, and the protections on delayed notice, so-called sneak and \npeek, and wiretaps, and then especially on sunset.\n  The debate is very illuminating and does more than the speech I gave \nyesterday. There is nothing as dull as a speech on the Senate floor and \nnothing as lively as a little debate. This Senate has very little \ndebate, very little exchange of ideas where Senators come and in a \nrespectful way pose questions and in a respectful way give answers to \nilluminate rather than obfuscate; no table-pounding.\n  I thank the Senator from Wisconsin for what he has done this year on \nthe committee and for his thoughtful approach here, albeit wrong, \nalbeit not persuasive and should not carry the day. I thank him for his \ncontribution.\n  Without yielding the floor, I ask unanimous consent I may yield to \nthe Senator from Wisconsin without losing the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chambliss). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am thoroughly enjoying this, and I \ncame out here and described the Senator again as valiant on this issue. \nBut I am getting a little worried as we start reviewing each of these \nprovisions. The Senator from Pennsylvania voted for every single one of \nthese provisions that I have talked about as part of the Senate \nversion. There was a reason we drafted it that way.\n  When the Senator properly puts me through my paces on each of these \nissues and I identify my remaining objections and he minimizes the \nobjections--keep in mind he already voted for those very provisions; he \nvoted for exactly these provisions in the Senate bill. So when I point \nout on section 215 that a general relevance standard is not a \nsufficient protection and he agrees on the record that was troubling to \nhim, it seems to me that is a valid issue to be concerned about.\n  With regard to the sneak-and-peek provision, the Senator did not \nvote, when he voted in the Senate, for 30 days' permission for a sneak \nand peek and a 90-day extension after that; he voted for 7 days, \nbecause the Senator from Pennsylvania knows as well as any Member in \nthis Senate that the idea of a sneak-and-peek search in the first place \nis a very troubling exception to the fourth amendment protection that \nevery American has against unreasonable searches and seizures. This is \na very narrow exception. When the Senate voted in the Senate, he did \nnot vote for 30 days. He did not vote for a period of time that is over \nfour times larger than 7 days; he voted for 7 days. To now suggest this \nis somehow a trivial concern is not consistent with either the \nSenator's record on this particular legislation or consistent with his \napparent cosponsorship of the SAFE Act in the past.\n  This debate is valuable, but when the Senator actually lists these \nall together as he has done, the only thing I can agree with him on \nis--and I am grateful--that the sunsets have been preserved. That is \npositive.\n  Let me say, the Senator cosponsored the SAFE Act. He knows some of \nthe things we are sunsetting potentially permit the violations of the \nrights of innocent and law-biding Americans. A sunset is only a \nsecondary level of protection that essentially says, Look, people's \nrights might be violated now, but at least we will have a chance to \nchange it later. The idea of simply prevailing on the sunsets, which \nallow violations to continue without changing the substance of the law \nto protect Americans' rights and civil rights liberties, is not a \nsufficient reason to vote for the conference report. But I do look \nforward to further exchange with the Senator on this as the week goes \non.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank the Senator from Wisconsin.\n  The last comments made the argument better than I have during the \ncourse of the last hour when he chastises me for agreeing to 30 days \nwhen I voted for 7 days but the House bill has 180 days. That is a \nreason to vote against the bill. He has made my case.\n  When you take up an issue about what is fair and appropriate and \nadequately protective of civil rights as to when the target should be \nnotified as to a surreptitious or secret search of his apartment, and \nyou have an existing bill which says a reasonable period of time--which \ncould be anything--and the Senate comes in at 7 days and the House \ncomes in at 180 days, there is no real concession on civil liberties. \nThe House made a concession of 150 days, from 180 to 30. The Senate \nmade a concession of 23 days, from 7 to 30.\n  I ask the other 98 Senators whether this is a meritorious argument, a \nweighty argument, or more of scintilla. That is an expression we use in \nthe law when the item has virtually no weight. In the common law, they \ntalk about a peppercorn being adequate for consideration. But this is a \nscintilla. Maybe this is not even a scintilla, to say a concession from \n7 to 30 days is meaningful.\n  I am glad the Senator from Wisconsin made that as his final, \npersuasive, overwhelming argument because that illustrates the \nflimsiness of the considerations.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, because of the last exchange, that will \nnot be----\n  Mr. SPECTER. I have the floor, but I will yield to the Senator from \nWisconsin on unanimous consent. I saw Senator Byrd one day perfect \nthis, and I will not make a mistake of yielding without reserving the \nright to the floor.\n\n[[Page S13478]]\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I have no desire----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I have no desire to take the floor away from the \nSenator from Pennsylvania, but back where I live, when the Government \ncomes into your home and you do not know they have been rummaging \naround in your house and you find out 7 days later that they did this, \nyou are upset. If you do not find out for 30 days, where I come from \nthat is not a scintilla; that is a big deal. The U.S. Government coming \ninto your house without giving you notice, as people expect under the \nfourth amendment, is not a triviality.\n  It is at the very core of one of the most important provisions of the \nBill of Rights. I am not sure I am, in the end, even comfortable with \nthis concept of a sneak and peek search. I think it has been \ndemonstrated it may be needed in some cases, but why in the world can't \na judge have to renew that every 7 days?\n  It is not a matter of trivia to the people of my State that the \nGovernment can come into their house without notice under the fourth \namendment. And I reject the idea that it is a minor difference between \n7 and 30 days.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, the problem with the renewed argument by \nthe Senator from Wisconsin is not on 7 days or 30 days, it is on 1 day. \nIt is on any sneak and peek. It is on any delayed notification. Law \nenforcement has that latitude because they need to continue the \ninvestigation. If a disclosure is made, it will impede an \ninvestigation. A short period of time enables them to continue the \ninvestigation without alerting the target.\n  One day would be too long for the argument which is made by the \nSenator from Wisconsin. We are conducting this debate as if we have a \nlaw enforcement community in this country made up totally of rogues who \nhave no regard for the rights of the individual. And when they get a \ndelayed notice warrant, bear in mind, my colleagues and the Senator \nfrom Wisconsin, they have gotten judicial review on this sneak-and-peek \nwarrant. On this delayed notification warrant, they have gone to a \njudge and have gotten leeway on standards which are set forth and \narticulated in the PATRIOT Act.\n  Mr. President, the Senate is not in order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  The Senate will come to order.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Back to the substance of the argument: this period of \ntime, the less, the closer to the Senate position the better. But this \nis not some random act of a rogue law enforcement officer. This is a \ndelayed notice warrant which has been obtained by going to an impartial \nmagistrate and by showing cause and by showing reason to have this \ndelayed notice.\n  Mr. President, the Senator from New Hampshire was on the floor \nearlier today and has raised a number of arguments. I see other of my \ncolleagues on the floor seeking recognition so I will not take these up \nat this time. But I would invite my colleagues to examine what the \nSenator from New Hampshire has had to say in the context of the debate \nwhich I have had with the Senator from Wisconsin because I think they \nare covered. But I will want to deal with them specifically.\n  I would point out--I am looking through the transcript for a moment \non some of the things which he has had to say. There are also some \ncomments made by the Senator from Vermont, the distinguished ranking \nmember, which I will comment about later. We will have a debate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/12/13/senate-section/article/S13478-1", "month": "12", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13478-S13479]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                CONTINUED DUMPING AND SUBSIDY OFFSET ACT\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I want to take an additional moment or \ntwo, while I have the floor, to make a brief argument in support of the \nmotion which is going to be offered by Senator DeWine and Senator Byrd \nto instruct the budget conferees to drop the repeal of the Continued \nDumping and Subsidy Offset Act.\n  This legislation was passed in the year 2000 under a program which \nallows the Bureau of Customs and Border Protection to distribute duties \ncollected on unfairly traded imports to those U.S. businesses and their \nworkers who have been injured by dumped or unfairly subsidized imports.\n  Over 700 companies in almost every State of the Union, including many \nsmall- and medium-sized companies, have received distributions under \nthis act, benefitting producers and workers in lumber, crawfish, \nshrimp, honey, garlic, cement, mushrooms, steel, bearings, raspberries, \nfurniture, semiconductor chips, and a broad range of other industries \nacross the Nation hurt by continued unfair trade.\n  My State, Pennsylvania, has been a victim to a very substantial \nextent. Companies in a variety of industries, including those that \nproduce steel, cement, agriculture, and food products, have benefitted \nfrom the $1.261 billion since this program was put into operation. The \nWorld Trade Organization has objected to this provision, and it is my \nhope that the administration will fight the World Trade Organization's \nconclusion. There have been instances in the past where the World Trade \nOrganization has said our practices violate their laws, and our \nexecutive branch has gone to fight them to make a change. I think that \nis what they should do here.\n  This compensates the companies and the workers who have been \nvictimized by these unfair trade practices. As a matter of basic and \nfundamental fairness, this money ought to continue going to that.\n  In the interest of brevity, I ask unanimous consent that the complete \ntext of my statement be printed in the Record following my oral \nremarks.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n    DeWine Motion To Instruct Conferees To Drop the Repeal of CSDOA \n                   Statement of Senator Arlen Specter\n\n       Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, as I have said, I have sought \n     recognition to express my opposition to section 8701 of H.R. \n     4241, the House-passed budget reconciliation bill, which \n     seeks to repeal the Continued Dumping and Subsidy Offset Act, \n     CDSOA, or Byrd amendment, and to express my support for the \n     DeWine motion to instruct conferees to not include this \n     provision in the conference report.\n       CDSOA was enacted in 2000 to enable U.S. businesses and \n     workers to survive the face of continued unfair trade. The \n     program allows the Bureau of Customs and Border Protection to \n     distribute duties collected on unfairly traded imports to \n     those U.S. businesses and their workers who have been injured \n     by dumped and unfairly subsidized imports.\n       Over 700 companies in almost every State of the Nation, \n     including many small- and medium-sized companies, have \n     received distributions under CDSOA, which benefits procedures \n     of lumber, crawfish, shrimp, honey, garlic, cement, \n     mushrooms, steel, bearings, raspberries, furniture, \n     semiconductor chips and a broad range of other industries \n     across the Nation hurt by continued unfair trade.\n       In Pennsylvania, companies in a variety of industries, \n     including steels, cement, agriculture, and food products have \n     benefitted from these distributions by investing in research \n     and development, infrastructure improvements, and \n     improvements to pension programs. In doing so, companies have \n     been able to continue operations and, in some situations, \n     increased capacity.\n       Overall, disbursements have totaled $1.261 billion since \n     its inception in 2000, $226 million in fiscal year 2005. \n     Pennsylvania companies, alone, have received over $111 \n     million in disbursements under CDSOA from fiscal year 2005 \n     through fiscal year 2005 approximately $22 million annualy--\n     approximately 9 percent of the total distributions.\n       Repealing or modifying this act would negatively impact \n     U.S. workers and businesses, leading to the loss of the U.S. \n     jobs to foreign competition, which would cost thousands of \n     American workers their health insurance and pension benefits \n     and contribute to the further outsourcing of Americans jobs.\n       This provision has had broad support in this body, where \n     some 75 Senators have signed letters to the administration \n     urging retention of this vital provision in the face of an \n     adverse WTOP decision allowing countries to retaliate by \n     imposing tariff surcharges on U.S. products.\n       Congress directed the administration to resolve the WTO \n     issued in ongoing trade negotiations in the fiscal year 2004 \n     and fiscal year 2005 ombinus appropriations bills, and the \n     fiscal year 2006 CJS appropriations bill that became law last \n     month. That language requires the administration to hold \n     negotiations to recognize the right of countries to \n     distribute duties collected from unfair trade as they deem \n     appropriate.\n       I urge my colleagues to support the motion.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a letter \ndated November 4, 2005, and a letter which I signed along with some 69 \nother Senators, dated February 4, 2003, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n[[Page S13479]]\n\n\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, November 4, 2005.\n     Hon. Bill Frist,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Frist, It is our understanding that the House \n     of Representatives will include the repeal of the Continued \n     Dumping and Subsidy Offset Act (CDSOA) in their budget \n     reconciliation measure. We do not believe that the budget \n     reconciliation process should be used to substantively change \n     U.S. trade law.\n       The goal of our trade laws is to ensure that an even \n     playing field is provided for American and foreign producers \n     of goods. As you know, Congress passed CDSOA in response to \n     concerns about the consistent, unfair trade practices in \n     which some of our trading partners have been engaged. Under \n     CDSOA, hundreds of companies, farmers, ranchers, and worker \n     groups, from all across America, have received distributions \n     from duties collected from our trading laws. Recipients \n     include large, medium and small companies, worker \n     representatives and farmers in nearly every state in the \n     country.\n       Seventy-two senators have made their opposition to \n     repealing CDSOA public. Should legislation regarding budget \n     reconciliation move towards conference, we would urge the \n     Senate not to accede to any provisions that may be included \n     in the House bill that would repeal CDSOA.\n           Sincerely,\n         Mike DeWine, John Warner, Elizabeth Dole, Larry E.

George W. Bush,\n     President of the United States,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: We write to express our strong interest \n     regarding the approach that may be taken by the U.S. \n     Government in response to the WTO Appellate Body's January \n     16, 2003, ruling that the United States violated its WTO \n     obligations when it enacted the Continued Dumping and Subsidy \n     Offset Act (CDSOA) in 2000. In our view, the WTO has acted \n     beyond the scope of its mandate by finding violations where \n     none exists and where no obligations were negotiated.\n       CDSOA is a payment program established by Congress to \n     address policy objectives that can enable our domestic \n     producers to continue to invest in their facilities and \n     workers. Its continued operation is critical to preserve jobs \n     that will otherwise be lost as the result of illegal dumping \n     or unfair subsidies and to maintain the competitiveness of \n     American industry.\n       In its November 2002 statement to the Appellate Body \n     defending this law, the Administration stated that, ``[T]he \n     Panel in this case has created obligations that do not exist \n     in the WTO Agreements cited. The errors committed are serious \n     and many about a statute which, in the end, creates a payment \n     program that is not challenged as a subsidy.'' We concur with \n     this statement and consequently believe that America's \n     trading partners must be pressed into negotiations on CDSOA \n     prior to any attempt to change our laws.\n       Specifically, we urge you to: (1) seek express recognition \n     of the existing right of WTO Members to distribute monies \n     collected from antidumping and countervailing duties; (2) \n     promptly integrate the Administration's recent Report to \n     Congress on the WTO Dispute Settlement Process; and (3) \n     consult closely with the Congress on the particulars of any \n     approach taken in negotiations on this issue.\n       We look forward to consultations with your Administration \n     on this important matter and to obtaining a positive \n     resolution that preserves the law for American companies and \n     their workers.\n           Sincerely,\n         Robert C.

Mr. President, I rise to speak briefly in support of \nthe motion that I understand is to be made by the Senator from Montana, \nMr. Baucus, who is here on the floor, to instruct conferees with \nrespect to the Medicaid Program.\n  The motion to instruct conferees on the Medicaid Program highlights \none of the many ways in which the House of Representatives budget \nreconciliation bill radically departs from the Senate bill. Let me \nspend a very few minutes highlighting the differences between the House \nand Senate packages on Medicaid, particularly with regard to the health \nof children.\n  The contrast between the two bills could not be more stark. The \nSenate bill arguably improves coverage of children through the \ninclusion of the Family Opportunity Act that provides a State option to \nexpand Medicaid coverage to children with disabilities and through \ninclusion of outreach and enrollment funding based on legislation that \nSenator Frist and I introduced earlier this year.\n  In sharp contrast, however, according to the Congressional Budget \nOffice, the House budget reconciliation package imposes increased cost \nsharing on low-income Medicaid beneficiaries and reduces health \nservices by $6.5 billion over 5 years and by $30.1 billion over 10 \nyears.\n  For children, the impact of the House bill would be devastating. \nMedicaid covers more than 27 million children, almost one in four in \nthis country. Medicaid also covers more than a third of all the births \nand health care costs of newborns in the United States each year.\n  In spite of the importance of Medicaid for children, the House budget \npackage increases cost sharing for all children who rely on it for \nprescription drugs or for emergency room services. The bill also allows \nStates to impose premiums for the first time under Medicaid for \nchildren's coverage and to deny children coverage even if their family \ncannot afford to pay the premium or other cost sharing.\n  The House budget bill also allows States to eliminate the early and \nperiodic screening diagnosis and treatment benefit rules that are so \ncritical to the health of children with special health care needs and \ndisabilities. Benefits that could be lost include comprehensive \ndevelopmental assessments, assessment and treatment for elevated blood \nlead levels, eyeglasses, dental care, hearing aids, wheelchairs and \ncrutches, respiratory treatment, comprehensive mental health services, \nprescription drugs and speech and therapy services. In short, three-\nfourths of the savings in the House bill come at the expense of low-\nincome Medicaid beneficiaries. By CBO's estimate, half of the \nbeneficiaries affected by the increased cost-sharing provisions in the \nHouse package are imposed on children, and half of those who will lose \nMedicaid benefits would be children.\n\n  In CBO's own words:\n\n       We estimate that the number of affected enrollees [due to \n     increased cost-sharing requirements] would increase from 7 \n     million in 2010 to 11 million in 2015, and that about half of \n     those enrollees would be children.\n\n  CBO adds that, due to added premiums, ``about 70,000 enrollees would \nlose coverage in fiscal year 2010 and 110,000 would lose coverage in \nfiscal year 2015 because of the imposition of premiums.''\n  Furthermore, CBO estimates that the flexibility in the House bill to \nreduce benefits will also heavily impact children. CBO estimates that \n``benefit reductions would affect an estimated 2.5 million Medicaid \nenrollees in 2010 and about 5 million enrollees by 2015--about 8 \npercent of the Medicaid population--and that about one-half of those \nreceiving alternative [or reduced] benefit packages would be \nchildren.''\n  Without the Medicaid Program, the number of children without health \ninsurance, which was 8.3 million in 2004, would be substantially \nhigher. In fact, the number of uninsured children has dropped by over \n300,000 over the past 4 years due in large part to Medicaid and\n\n[[Page S13480]]\n\nthe SCHIP Program. We should not at this time be taking steps backward \nby reducing coverage for low-income and vulnerable populations that \nprimarily include the children I have been referring to.\n  I urge that colleagues support the Baucus motion to instruct \nconferees on Medicaid. We are coming into the holiday season. This is \nnot a time when we, the wealthiest Nation in the world, should be \ncutting health care assistance to the low-income children of this \ncountry. I did not support the Senate budget reconciliation bill for a \nvariety of reasons, but even with the imperfections that were in that \nbill, it was far superior to the House budget package. For one thing, \nit does not contain the type of cuts for children's health that are \nincluded in the House bill.\n  I urge my colleagues to recognize how much better the Senate bill is \nfor the health and well-being of our Nation's children. I urge my \ncolleagues to vote to instruct conferees to support the Senate's \napproach over that of the House of Representatives.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/12/13/senate-section/article/S13480-1", "month": "12", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13480-S13483]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         BUDGET RECONCILIATION\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, at the appropriate time I will be sending \na motion to instruct to the desk. I will be doing that at a later time. \nIn the meantime, I rise to speak on that motion.\n  The motion instructs the Senate conferees on the spending \nreconciliation bill not to bring back a conference report that hurts \nMedicaid beneficiaries. This is the item about which the Senator from \nNew Mexico just spoke.\n  Last month, the House passed such a bill, one that would hurt \nMedicaid beneficiaries. The House passed a bill that would cut health \ncare for millions of seniors and lower income Americans who depend on \nMedicaid.\n  I believe the Senate should reject these harmful cuts. In early \nNovember, the Senate voted by a thin margin to cut Medicaid, our \nNation's safety net health program for low-income Americans. Many of us \nat that time objected to those cuts. That day, the Senate bill planted \na seed of opportunity to make even more harmful cuts, hurting millions \nof low-income children, seniors, pregnant women, and individuals with \ndisabilities. Just 2 weeks ago, the Senate reconciliation bill bore \nbitter fruit. Why? Because the Medicaid cuts in the House bill turned \nout to be substantial and, in fact, will hurt millions of the poorest \nand neediest among us.\n  According to the Congressional Budget Office, most of the Medicaid \nsavings in the House bill come from targeting our poorest citizens. CBO \nsays three-quarters of the House bill's Medicaid savings come from \nprovisions that increase costs, cut benefits, or impair access to \nservices for low-income individuals. These cuts will affect millions of \npeople. The CBO estimates that about 17 million Medicaid enrollees will \npay more under the House bill, and half of those paying more will be \nchildren.\n  Who will these cuts affect? Medicaid now serves more than 50 million \nlow-income Americans. A quarter are children. A quarter are seniors and \ndisabled. The rest are pregnant women, low-income parents, and \nindividuals with serious medical needs.\n  Many believe that all low-income Americans are eligible for Medicaid. \nThat is not the case. Often only the very poor qualify. On average, a \nnonworking parent making about $150 per week for a family of three \nmakes too much for Medicaid. Again, a nonworking parent of a family of \nthree making about $150 a week makes too much for Medicaid. That is \nless than one-half the Federal poverty level.\n  Eligibility levels for working parents are also low. On average, a \nworking parent with a family of three earning more than $5.50 an hour \nalso makes too much to qualify for Medicaid. So we are talking about \nthe very poor.\n  Under the House bill, these needy individuals will pay more for less. \nCBO estimates that about 80 percent of the savings from increasing cost \nsharing would come from decreased use of health care services. Some may \nsay that increasing cost sharing will curb waste, abuse. I am not \nsaying we cannot or should not look at reducing unnecessary treatments \nunder Medicaid. Far from it. But increasing cost sharing is not the \nright way to do it.\n  Increasing costs deters patients from seeking health care services, \nboth good and bad services. If we really want to control overuse of \nservices, we should be investing in care management strategies for \nexpensive chronic diseases such as diabetes. These strategies have \nproven to lower cost while increasing the quality of care.\n  Increasing enrollee cost sharing can also have unintended systemwide \neffects. Many States have already said they will deduct the new \ncopayment fees from provider rates regardless of whether providers \ncollect the fees. The result puts the new burden on doctors and clinics \nand hospitals serving our health safety net. Many of these providers \nwill be forced to make up uncompensated care costs by increasing \nprivate market rates, which will drive up health care costs for all of \nus, leading to more uninsured and an even greater need for Medicaid.\n  Even more troubling, the House bill's premium increases will result \nin tens of thousands of individuals losing Medicaid coverage. According \nto CBO, about a quarter of the savings from the premium increases are \nfor individuals losing coverage. We don't need to rely on CBO to know \nthat this will actually happen. Why? Because in the State of Oregon, \nthis was tried, and the results were quite clear and disturbing. That \nState began to enforce nominal monthly premiums for higher income \nMedicaid beneficiaries. What happened? Oregon saw its enrollment drop \nby nearly one-half in 10 months. Nearly 50,000 individuals lost \ncoverage.\n  This increased cost sharing amounts to a tax on poor families now in \nMedicaid. For a family of three with income at 135 percent of poverty, \nannual cost sharing would be as high as $1,086 per year or, stated \nanother way, about 60 percent of their annual Federal tax liability.\n  Let me say that again. For a family of three, with income at 135 \npercent of poverty, annual cost-sharing could be as high as over \n$1,000, which amounts to less than 60 percent of their annual Federal \ntax liability. In effect, it is a tax--a big tax, about 60 percent of \ntheir Federal tax. Add them together and it is about 160 percent of tax \nthey are paying.\n  Many of these poor individuals would also be forced to pay more to \nget less. How? Because the House allows States to cut Medicaid \nbenefits.\n  The Congressional Budget Office estimates that 5 million enrollees \nwould see their benefits cut over the next 10 years. Half of those \naffected would be children. Higher income children would no longer have \nguaranteed access to medically necessary care under Medicaid.\n  It is also unclear whether individuals with disabilities and chronic \nconditions would be protected. This could undermine access to more \nexpensive treatments and services for those individuals who turn to \nMedicaid because the private market will not cover them.\n  Shifting costs and cutting benefits for our poorest and least able to \npay is not the smart way to preserve our Nation's safety net for future \ngenerations.\n  In the Finance Committee, many of my colleagues on the other side of \nthe aisle chose to support the Senate bill because it didn't include \nchanges that would hurt Medicaid beneficiaries. My friend and \ncolleague, Finance Chairman Grassley, praised the bill, saying it \n``protects Medicaid benefits for the most vulnerable in our society.''\n  The Senator from Oregon, Mr. Smith, said that ``the reconciliation \npackage we are considering today is not only fiscally responsible, but \nalso morally defensible. This is a bill that protects the less \nfortunate among us. It takes pains to preserve the vital safety net \nprograms that millions of Americans rely on.''\n  And the junior Senator from Pennsylvania said during the committee \nmarkup:\n\n       Let us set the record straight. We are not cutting health \n     care services to the beneficiary.\n\n  So today I will offer this motion to set the record straight on \nMedicaid cuts. This motion instructs Senate conferees on the \nreconciliation bill to reject changes to Medicaid that would hurt \nMedicaid beneficiaries or undermine Medicaid's guarantee. Given the \nthreat of the cuts passed in the House, the Senate must take a stand in \nsupport of the neediest among us.\n\n[[Page S13481]]\n\n  Let us ensure that we keep the record straight on Medicaid. Let us \nensure that we do no harm to the vulnerable individuals whom Medicare \nserves. Let us pass this motion.\n  Mr. President, at the appropriate time I will make the motion.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island is recognized.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I, too, at the appropriate moment will offer \na motion to instruct the conferees. I will offer the motion in \nconjunction with Senators Collins, Kennedy, Snowe, Lieberman, Leahy, \nBingaman, Coleman, Salazar, Stabenow, Clinton, Lugar, Harkin, Levin, \nSmith, and Pryor.\n  This motion to instruct conferees is about LIHEAP, the Low Income \nHeating Assistance Program. Each of us, at this point, is very familiar \nwith the struggle that is taking place today. If you were in New \nEngland over the weekend, as I was, or in many other parts of the \ncountry, you understand that temperatures have fallen and many families \nare having to perform a juggling act with their budgets in order to \nheat their homes.\n  According to EIA's most recent short-term energy outlook, released \nlast week, energy costs for the average family using heating oil are \nestimated to hit $1,454 this winter, an increase of $255. That is a 21-\npercent increase over last year's heating season. Natural gas prices \ncould hit $1,024 for an average family using natural gas. That would be \nan increase of $282 or a 38-percent increase. For a family using \npropane, prices are projected to hit $1,269, an increase of $167 from \nlast heating season, and that is a 15-percent increase.\n  Despite these sharp increases in fuel costs, we sadly continue to \nfund LIHEAP--the one program that can provide sufficient help to these \nfamilies--at the same level as last year, which in reality means an \nactual cut in the level of assistance we can provide low-income \nconsumers this winter's heating season.\n  The responsible thing for Congress to do is to fully fund LIHEAP at \nthe full $5.1 billion authorized in the Energy Policy Act enacted \nearlier this year. Indeed, we have tried to do that on numerous \noccasions. Today marks the fifth time in the last 2 months that Senator \nCollins and I, along with some 30 other colleagues, have made an \nattempt to fully fund LIHEAP. We offered amendments to the Defense \nbill, the Transportation-Treasury-HUD bill, Labor-HHS bill and, most \nrecently, the tax reconciliation bill. On each occasion, we reach \nacross the aisle and across the country to provide more assistance for \nthe LIHEAP program. While we did not reach the 60-vote margin needed to \npass these amendments under the budget rules, in each instance, a \nmajority of this body was on record supporting full funding for LIHEAP.\n  My preference, of course, was to provide funding to fully fund LIHEAP \non an emergency basis through an appropriations bill. Those \nopportunities have passed. Budget reconciliation is the last train that \nis leaving the station. That is why I come to the floor and will offer, \nat the appropriate time, a motion to instruct budget conferees to \ninsist on a level of funding for LIHEAP that is sufficient to fully \nfund the program at its fully authorized level.\n  The heat-or-eat dilemma is not just rhetoric. The RAND Corporation \nconducted a study and found that low-income households reduced food \nexpenditures by roughly the same amount as increases in fuel \nexpenditures. In some respects, this is a tidal wave not of rising \nwater, like Katrina, but of rising energy prices.\n  We have all had the opportunity to visit our constituents and get a \nfirsthand glimpse of the struggle they are faced with. A few weeks ago, \nI visited with Mr. Aram Ohanian, an 88-year-old veteran of the U.S. \nArmy in World War II, living on a $779-a-month Social Security check. \nMoney is so tight that he sometimes has to eat with his children or go \nto a local soup kitchen. He also gets assistance from our Rhode Island \nfood bank. These heating price increases to Mr. Ohanian will be very \ndifficult. He received LIHEAP assistance last year, but that assistance \nwill be relatively less this year because of rising prices and greater \ndemand.\n  Last month, the Social Security Administration announced that cost-\nof-living adjustments for 2006, on average, are about $65. That $65 \nincrease to Mr. Ohanian is not going to take up the slack in terms of \nthese tremendous increases in fuel prices.\n  The motion to instruct conferees that we will submit at the \nappropriate moment calls for LIHEAP to be funded at the fully \nauthorized level. Under the best-case scenario, if we fully fund \nLIHEAP, there would still be a significant number of Americans who \nqualify for the program but will not get any help. LIHEAP would still \nonly serve about one-seventh of 35 million households that are poor \nenough to qualify for assistance. But at least we are taking a step by \nfully funding this important program.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this motion when it comes to the \nfloor for a vote.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire is recognized.\n  Mr. GREGG. I ask for the regular order, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate is in morning business with 10 \nminutes for Senators.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, we are trying, as the Senate and as a \nCongress, to wrap up the business for the Government this year. A major \npart of that effort is to complete the budget process. Included in the \nbudget were two directions to the Congress, which were voted in by a \nmajority of the Congress--regrettably, very few people from the other \nside of the aisle supported it--and one of the directions was, for the \nfirst time in 8 years, to attempt to bring under control the rate of \ngrowth of entitlement spending.\n  Anybody who looks reasonably at the Federal Government--and let's \ntake an independent view here and the view specifically of Chairman \nGreenspan, who recently gave a speech in London where he pointed out \nthat the biggest concern he has from the standpoint of fiscal policy \nwas the burgeoning costs of the Federal Government which were being \ndriven by entitlement spending, and which would explode as the baby \nboom generation began to retire in 2008 and become an untenable burden \nfor the children of the baby boom generation and their children as they \nhave to pay the taxes or costs of supporting that retired generation \nwhich is so large.\n  This bill, in what I consider to be the first act of fiscal \nresponsibility of significance in the last 8 years, moved legislation \nthat said the Congress, for the first time in 8 years, will address the \nissue of entitlements.\n  Now, the savings being projected in the bill were not that dramatic \nand they continue to be not that dramatic. They are large numbers, \nobviously, but in the context of the total spending on entitlements, \nthey are not that large.\n  For example, the savings that are being projected in the area of \nMedicaid are about $10 billion over 5 years. But what you have to \nunderstand--and that is a big number--is over that period, Medicaid \nwill be spending approximately $1.4 trillion--trillion dollars. So we \nare actually asking for less than a one-tenth of 1 percent reduction in \nthe rate of growth in Medicaid, and Medicaid during that period will \ngrow at 40 percent--a 40-percent growth rate over those 5 years, down \nfrom 41 percent, assuming we make the $10 billion reduction over the 10 \nyears in the rate of growth.\n  The total deficit reduction bill was to be somewhere in the range of \n$35 billion to $50 billion, depending on which bill was taken from \nwhich House. It left the Senate at $39 billion and left the House of \nRepresentatives at about $50 billion, $51 billion, something like that; \nI am not sure. In any event, it is going to fall somewhere between \nthose two numbers.\n  We as a Congress hopefully can pass legislation that accomplishes \nthat goal which starts to reduce the rate of growth of entitlements and \nreduces the debt of the Government to at least $40 billion--hopefully \nmore than that, $45 billion, $46 billion over the next 5 years. This is \nthe responsible thing to do, and it will be the first act of \nsignificant fiscal responsibility in which we have participated in a \nwhile around here as we continue to pass in the entitlement area--there \nhas been significant fiscal responsibility in the nondefense \ndiscretionary area executed by the Appropriations Committee under,\n\n[[Page S13482]]\n\nagain, the budget which essentially froze nondefense discretionary \nspending and put in place what is known as caps so we can enforce them.\n  Ironically, none of these proposals for fiscal responsibility put in \nplace have received any significant support from the other side of the \naisle. When the budget passed this Congress, I don't think any Members \nfrom the other side of the aisle voted for it. When the reconciliation \nbill passed this Congress, two Members from the other side of the \naisle--I appreciate it very much--the Senator from Louisiana and the \nSenator from Nebraska voted for it, but other than that, no one else on \nthe other side of the aisle voted for fiscal responsibility or an \nattempt to reduce the rate of growth of the Government. So this has \nbecome a lifting exercise in which, for all practical purposes, \nRepublican Members of the Congress appear to be ready to participate.\n  Yet today we are hearing from the other side of the aisle that they \nwant to instruct the conferees of a bill, against which they voted--\nthey voted against the budget, which was the underlying bill--instruct \nthe conferees how the conference should occur. I find that to be a \ntouch inconsistent--to be kind, a touch inconsistent, a big touch \ninconsistent, to be honest. Here they are, folks who have not voted for \nany fiscal restraint and, in fact, as we moved through the \nappropriations process have suggested that we add $500 billion of new \nspending to the Federal Government under the appropriations process, \nwhich is not, by the way, impacted under this deficit reduction bill \nbecause this is entitlement activity, the two accounts being separate, \nappropriations being one-time annual expenditures of the Government, \nentitlements being programs which people have a right to and, \ntherefore, they can go out and receive funding. They may be veterans, \nthey may be low-income individuals, they may be students--they have a \nright to receive funding. It goes on independent of annual legislation.\n  As I said, the other side of the aisle not only has not supported the \nefforts of fiscal responsibility by voting for either the budget or the \nvast majority, with the two exceptions I mentioned, not voting for a \ndeficit reduction bill, but now come forward with a series of what are \ngoing to be instructions to the conferees as to how the conferees \nshould act after they voted against passing the bill and moving forward \nwith the legislation. Chutzpah is an understatement for that type of \napproach.\n  Let's just take one or two examples and discuss them for a second. \nFor example, the Senator from Rhode Island was talking about LIHEAP. \nThere is significant irony in the position of the Senator from Rhode \nIsland--significant irony. To begin with, he voted against the one \nproposal that we could have passed--which was funded--which would have \nfunded LIHEAP to keep people protected from the increase in oil costs. \nIt was paid for. That amendment was offered by myself. It was paid for \nwith an across-the-board cut in the Labor-HHS bill. It would have fully \nfunded the LIHEAP account at a level which would have held harmless \neverybody who receives LIHEAP money, low-income energy assistance, \nbecause we all realize the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program is \na critical program and there is going to be significant stress, \nespecially in the Northern States, as a result of the increased costs \nof the price of oil. And yet this was opposed.\n  When this opportunity came along, it was opposed for political \nreasons, if nothing else, I suspect, because they wanted to make a \nclaim that they were going to fund LIHEAP at a level that was \nsignificantly higher than what CBO and what the Energy Department and \nwhat everyone else said was needed, including the Health and Human \nServices Department, to hold the program harmless, to keep the people \nfunded who needed to be funded.\n\n  That increase, which was required, was a $1.2 billion increase. You \ndon't have to listen to me to believe that. Take a look at the letter \nthe Senator from Rhode Island sent out asking that the funding in \nLIHEAP be increased--it was signed by I think 44 Members of the \nSenate--be at a level that held harmless the system so people who \nreceive money under LIHEAP would get the money they needed. What was \nthe number in that letter? The number was $1.2 billion. But suddenly, \nin order to promote an agenda which had nothing to do with making sure \nthe people were held harmless but had a lot to do with maybe headlines, \nwe find the number being asked for is another $1.5 billion on top of \nthat. It is not paid for, not offset. Just run up the debt and put \nmoney into an account far in excess of what that account needs to do \nthe job right.\n  In fact, as a result of the warm season in November in many of the \nNorthern States and the result of the softening, to some degree, of oil \nprices, especially home heating oil prices, the number has now dropped. \nIt is down below $1.2 billion, according to the estimates I have been \nseeing, to hold the system harmless. I am still willing to go to the \n$1.2 billion level and have it paid for. That is the way it should be \ndone. You have to set priorities. You live in a household, and this is \nall about households trying to make ends meet. They set priorities.\n  One of the priorities should be that the Federal Government should \nnot pass the bills in an energy program today which pays for oil that \nis purchased today and given out today on to our children and our \ngrandchildren to pay through debt. We should pay for it ourselves. We \nshould be willing as a Congress to step up and say: Yes, this is an \nimportant program; yes, it should be funded at a level that holds \neverybody harmless and makes sure they get the support they need, but \nalso it should be paid for by the generation that is going to benefit \nfrom it or at least the Government that is taking advantage of it. It \nshould not be passed on to the next generation as a bill to our kids \nbecause our kids are also probably going to have cold winters, and they \nsure are going to have tough energy issues because we haven't solved \nany of those issues around here. We passed an energy bill that was \nfilled with a lot of vertical subsidies but didn't have a whole lot of \ngood energy policy in it; a little bit, a little bit of good energy \npolicy and a lot of bad policy which was basically driven by interest \ngroups around here, but it sure didn't do anything to make us more \nlong-term solvent in the area of energy.\n  One item that might address that is the issue of producing more \nenergy for our country, and that, of course, is a big issue in this \nbill, and we will get into that in a later discussion.\n  The point here is we are being asked to vote for the reconciliation \nbill when it comes out of conference. We are being asked to instruct \nthe conferees to add another $2.9 billion of debt onto our children's \nbacks rather than doing an appropriate action which is what I suspect \nthe conference will do, which is increase the money in the Low-Income \nHome Energy Assistance Program by $1.2 billion, or something in that \nrange, and have it paid for within the context of the entire deficit \nreduction bill, which is the fiscally responsible way to approach this \nissue.\n  This will make a good press release, and it will obviously make a \ngood political ad, but I hope there will be a followup statement and \nmaybe even a followup political ad, maybe paid for by our kids or \ngrandkids which says: Hey, why are you doing this to us? Why do you not \ntake responsibility for your generations? Why are you giving us a bill \nfor oil and heat for this year when we may have the same bills to deal \nwith when we retire or when our children have to take care of us in \nretirement 10, 15 years from now?\n  Let us do this the right way. Let us make this system solvent, not \nonly solvent but make the system--put in the system the funds that are \nnecessary to make sure that people who need the low-income energy \nassistance can get it under the higher oil prices, and then let us pay \nfor it. Set a priority and say there are some things we can afford, \nsome things we cannot afford, and in the Federal Government let us make \nthe decisions to reduce the things we cannot afford and pay for the \nthings we need, which specifically would be this proposal for low-\nincome energy assistance at $1.2 billion. But that is not the politics \nof this institution.\n  So I do hope we will pass a reconciliation bill, otherwise known as a \ndeficit reduction bill, and I do hope it will step forward and reduce \nthe debt by somewhere around $45 billion or $46 billion, maybe more, \nand that in that process\n\n[[Page S13483]]\n\nwe will address the low-income energy assistance program and make sure \nthat it is funded at a level that is necessary in order to make sure \npeople are held harmless, and low-income individuals who need energy \ncan afford it to heat their homes and do not have to make difficult \nchoices. But we should all do it within the context of prioritizing the \nresponsibilities of the Federal Government today and not pass our \nresponsibilities today on to our children and our children's children \ntomorrow by deficit-financing this event.\n  So we are going to get these instructions. I guess there has been \nsome unanimous consent agreement worked out. There are going to be \nabout seven proposals, instructions to conferees. I just hope that as \nwe go through these instructions people will have the intellectual \nintegrity to ask the question, if they did not vote for the bill, if \nthey did not vote for the budget which was trying to control spending, \nand they did not vote for the deficit reduction bill which is trying to \ncontrol spending, why are they coming to the floor and suddenly telling \nthe conferees how they should go about hitting their targets which are \npart of the bill, which they did not vote for, and they do not support? \nMaybe we will hear somebody preface their request for instructions with \nan explanation of that point.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/12/13/senate-section/article/S13483-1", "month": "12", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13483-S13485]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                ASBESTOS\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, Libby, MT, is a special place. Libby is a \ncity of more than 2,600 people in Lincoln County, in the northwest \ncorner of Montana. It rests in a valley high in the Rocky Mountains, on \nthe green Kootenai River between the Cabinet and Percell Mountains.\n  Libby is not a rich city. In 2000, the median family income in Libby \nwas just under $30,000. That compares with just over $40,000 in all of \nMontana, and just over $50,000 in all of America.\n  Across the river, and 9 miles northeast of the town, rises a mountain \nthat they call Zonolite Mountain. Until 1990, the W.R. Grace Company \nused to mine vermiculite there in the mountain.\n  Vermiculite is shiny mineral. Heat it, and it pops like popcorn. \nPeople used to pop vermiculite to make building insulation. They called \nthe popped vermiculite ``Zonolite.''\n  The layers of rock where people found the vermiculite contained \nharmful asbestos. And the vermiculite outside Libby is laced with a \nespecially dangerous type of asbestos, called tremolite.\n  Tremolite is the most toxic form of asbestos. Termolite has long \nfibers that are barbed like fishhooks. These fibers work their way into \nsoft lung tissue. These fibers do not come out.\n  Until the mid-1970s, W.R. Grace processed the vermiculite mined in \nLibby in a nearby mill. The mill was so dusty that workers often could \nnot see their hands on their brooms. Dust was everywhere. Mill workers \nswept dust outside. They dumped it down the mountainside. I remember \nseeing employees come out of the mine off the bus so caked with dust I \nwondered what in the world is going on here. I never knew any working \nconditions to be so dusty.\n  The mill's ventilation stack spewed the dust into the air. The \nventilation stack released 5,000 pounds of asbestos every day. When the \nwind blew from the east, a deadly white dust would cover the town.\n  For decades, 24 hours a day, the dust fell all over Libby. Dust fell \non Libby's gardens. Dust fell on Libby's homes. Dust fell on Libby's \nhigh school track. Dust fell on Libby's playgrounds.\n  Some of the vermiculite went downtown to a plant, right next to the \nbaseball diamonds. The plant popped the vermiculite into Zonolite. \nBatches of Zonolite spilled all around the plant.\n  Kids played in the Zonolite. People brought home bags of Zonolite to \npour into the attics. People put Zonolite in their walls. People put \nZonolite in their gardens. People put vermiculite and ore in road beds. \nPeople used vermiculite and ore as aggregate in their driveways.\n\n  An article in the journal Environmental Health Perspectives would \nlater conclude:\n\n       Given the ubiquitous nature of vermiculite contamination in \n     Libby, along with historical evidence of elevated asbestos \n     concentrations in the air, it would be difficult to find \n     participants who could be characterized as unexposed.\n\n  Every day, men from the valley went to the mountain to work in the \nmine and the mill. Every day, these men came home, covered with the \nfine, deadly white powder.\n  The powder got into their clothes. The powder got into their \ncurtains. The powder covered their floors.\n  The fine fibers of tremolite asbestos are easy to inhale. Miners \ninhaled fibers in the mine. Workers inhaled fibers at the mill. Wives \ninhaled fibers when they washed their husband's clothes. Children \ninhaled fibers when they played on the carpet.\n  And those fibers caused respiratory disease. Those fibers caused a \nserious lung disease called asbestosis. And those fibers caused a \nserious form of cancer, mesothelioma, which plagues the chest and \nabdominal cavities.\n  Tremolite asbestos causes unique diseases. These diseases are highly \nprogressive and deceptive. These diseases often result in severe \nimpairment or death, without the typical warning markers that show up \non x-rays. Without the usual medical signals, the people of Libby often \nwent undiagnosed.\n  The Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry found that \npeople from Libby suffer from asbestos-related disease at a rate 40-to-\n60 times the national average. People from Libby suffer from the \nasbestos cancer mesothelioma at a rate 100 times the national average.\n  Because of the W.R. Grace mine and the mill, hundreds of people in \nLibby died from asbestos-related diseases. And hundreds of current and \nformer area residents are now ill.\n  The people in Libby will be plagued by asbestos for years to come. \nThese diseases can take 40 years to appear. Hundreds more will fall \nvictim to these diseases in the future.\n  Now, the people of Libby must watch their neighbors struggle to tend \ntheir gardens. They must watch their neighbors struggle to walk to the \ncafe. They must watch their neighbors struggle to provide a future for \ntheir children. And they must wonder if they, too, will fall ill.\n  Hundreds of people live in discomfort. Hundreds of people live in \npain. ``It took my mother 17 months to slowly suffocate,'' said Gayla \nBenefield.\n  After Gayla's mother died in 1996, Gayla and her sister sued W.R. \nGrace. They brought only the second such lawsuit to be decided by a \njury in Libby. W.R. Grace had quietly settled dozens of other claims \nwith agreements of secrecy.\n  In 1999, the Environmental Protection Agency started to investigate. \nThe EPA found tremolite contamination in the air around the nursery. \nThey found it near the ball fields. They found it inside homes.\n  The EPA started cleaning up. The entire community of Libby was \ndesignated a Superfund site. Libby was listed on the EPA's National \nPriorities List.\n  The EPA concluded:\n\n       The occurrence of non-occupational asbestos-related disease \n     that has been observed among Libby residents is extremely \n     unusual, and has not been associated with asbestos mines \n     elsewhere, suggesting either very high and prolonged \n     environmental exposures and/or increased toxicity of this \n     form of amphibole asbestos.\n\n  The EPA has worked hard. The EPA has shown a good response and solid \nclean-up work. And the EPA is committed to finishing the job. I commend \nthem. I made many visits to Libby--many, many times. I talked with EPA \nofficials over the years, and I think they have done a pretty good job.\n  The EPA has identified more than a thousand properties in Libby that \nstill need cleaning up.\n  The agency has pushed back the timeframe for cleaning up the town \nfrom 2004 to 2008. After having been in Libby for 3 years, the agency \nhad completed only 10 percent of the cleanup work needed to give the \ntown a clean bill of health. The EPA must keep Libby a priority.\n  In 1999, I was the first high-ranking elected official to visit \nLibby. Since the winter of 1999, I have gone to Libby 16 times. I have \nworked heard to get funds to help with cleanup, health care, and \neconomic development.\n  I have looked into the eyes of people in Libby. I have seen mothers \nand fathers, sister and brothers, husbands\n\n[[Page S13484]]\n\nand wives. I have listened to their troubling stories.\n  In Libby, I heard many concerns of residents who cannot afford their \nhealth care. People are sick. Many are getting sicker. They are dying \nup there. Health care is one of the most pressing needs facing Libby.\n  In 2000, I helped to establish the Center for Asbestos Related \nDiseases, or CARD. The CARD clinic has done a tremendous job providing \nhealth care and screening for Libby residents. CARD needs additional \nFederal dollars to provide more and better care.\n  The healthcare costs of treating asbestos-related disease can be \ndevastating. Simple, routine procedures to help a person breathe more \neasily can cost more than $30,000. Those costs continue to add up. They \nare crippling a community that is struggling to get back on its feet.\n  The people of Libby face a health care crisis. This crisis was caused \nby alarming rates of tremolite asbestos-related disease. Treating the \nsick people in Libby will cost hundreds of millions of dollars. It was \ncaused by no fault of their own, but, I might add, by a company that \nknew it was damaging and killing the people in that community.\n  Libby is working to overcome years of asbestos exposure from the W.R. \nGrace mine. They have been through enough. They did not ask for this \nlot. Affording quality health care remains one of the biggest hurdles \nfor the town to move forward.\n  That is why I fought to make sure that asbestos bills working through \nthe Senate addressed the needs of the people of Libby. When, in May of \nthis year, the Judiciary Committee voted to report S. 852, the Fairness \nin Asbestos Injury Resolution Act, the committee included appropriate \nlanguage.\n  The good people of Libby need our help. They are dying up there. They \ncannot afford health care. I am dedicated to getting them the \nhealthcare treatment that they need and deserve. I made a commitment to \nthe people of Libby and I intend to work together with my colleagues to \nsee that commitment honored.\n  Asbestos disease has devastated many communities across the country \nBut tremolite asbestos hit Libby hardest of all. Libby is unique. The \ntype of asbestos at Libby is unique. The duration of exposure at Libby \nis unique. The manner in which asbestos disease manifests itself in \nLibby is unique. And the community-wide exposure in Libby was unique. \nThat is why the tailored solution that the Judiciary Committee has \nproposed makes sense.\n  I want my colleagues to know that I will fight to defend the Libby \nprovisions in the asbestos bill. Libby is extremely important to me. If \nthe Congress takes out the Libby provisions from the bill, they will \nlose my vote.\n  People in Libby are dying from tremolite asbestos exposure. The town \nhas risen mightily to the challenges that it has faced. But they need \nour help. They deserve our help.\n  The people in Libby are working hard to revitalize their economy and \ntheir community. They are rightly proud of their resilience and their \nability to land on their feet. They deserve all the help that we can \ngive them to make their town whole again.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Libby provisions in the asbestos \nbill. Help us to right this terrible wrong. Help these hundreds of \nsuffering people to get health care and help save the life of this \ntown.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Alexander). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I do want to, as I have the privilege of \nso often doing, express my thanks to my Democratic colleague, the \nranking member of the Senate Finance Committee, for his cooperation \nparticularly on this United States-Bahrain Free Trade Agreement that we \nwere able to unanimously report out of our committee. The reason I want \nto emphasize ``unanimous'' isn't just to be complimentary to Senator \nBaucus but also to the people of this country who think that everything \ndone in this Congress is always so partisan, that Republicans and \nDemocrats never get along, that we never talk to each other, that we \nnever agree on anything. I can see why they have that impression \nbecause that is the impression the news media of America gives about \nthe Congress of the United States. But as practical matter, nothing \ngets done in the Senate that isn't somewhat bipartisan, and \nparticularly there is quite a tradition of bipartisanship in our Senate \nCommittee on Finance.\n  This recent bill that is before us, the United States-Bahrain Free \nTrade Agreement, is the latest representation of that bipartisan \ncooperation.\n  I thank Senator Baucus very much.\n  I give strong support to the bill S. 2027; that is, the United \nStates-Bahrain Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act.\n  This legislation is not only good for our U.S. economy, but it is \nalso going to promote free trade, which is an economic issue as it \ncreates jobs, but it also promotes democracy, and it promotes economic \nstability.\n  In regard to economic stability, the reason I emphasize that is \nbecause the Middle East is seen as an area of the world that is not \nvery stable. I think that enhancing trade with those countries, large \nor small, is going to bring great economic stability which in turn \nought to bring some political stability.\n  On top of all this, it is going to cement our ties with this small \nkingdom of Bahrain. That country is a very strong ally of the United \nStates in that region.\n  This trade agreement is a clear win for our economy. It will create \njobs.\n  Upon entry into force of this agreement, Bahrain will immediately \neliminate 100 percent of its duties on imports of U.S. consumer and \nindustrial products.\n  U.S. farmers will also benefit. On day one of the agreement, Bahrain \nwill grant duty-free access on 98 percent of its tariff lines that \napply to U.S. agricultural as well as food products. Duties with \nrespect to that small remaining 2 percent will be phased out over a \nperiod of 10 years.\n  This is solid market access for U.S. farmers and U.S. manufacturers.\n  U.S. service providers will also gain from this agreement.\n  Bahrain will provide substantial market access across its entire \nservice regime. The service provisions of the agreement are based upon \na ``negative list'' approach, which means that all service sectors are \ncovered. In other words, there will be trade in all service sectors \nunless they are specifically excluded as a result of the list.\n  Bahrain is already a major center for service providers in the Middle \nEast, and the government recognizes that its service sector can become \neven stronger through economic liberalization. Because of this \nagreement, as the region develops, there is going to be very enhanced \nopportunities for U.S. exporters.\n  While it is important to note how the United States-Bahrain Free \nTrade Agreement will benefit the economy of the United States in the \naggregate, it is even more important to point out how it will benefit \nindividual U.S. companies and their workers.\n  For me, I didn't have to look very far to find Iowa workers and Iowa \ncompanies that benefit from this agreement.\n  For example, the HNI Corporation--it used to be referred to as the \nHON Corporation--the Fortune 500 company in my State, this company in \nMuscatine, IA, looks forward to the implementation of this trade \nagreement. HNI is the second largest manufacturer of office furniture \nin North America. It is specifically targeting the Bahraini market for \nincreased sales. So HNI employees in Iowa as well as other States will \nbenefit from Senate passage of the agreement.\n\n  Workers at the Lennox residential heating and cooling products \nfactory in Marshalltown, IA, also stand to gain from the agreement. \nLennox has a strong interest in increasing its sales in Bahrain. Like \nHNI, Lennox has a presence in many States, so its employees not only in \nIowa but throughout the country will benefit from the implementation of \nthis agreement.\n  Smaller businesses throughout the United States also stand to benefit \nfrom this trade agreement. One such company is Midamar Corporation \nlocated in Cedar Rapids. The Midamar\n\n[[Page S13485]]\n\nCorporation supplies halal food and food service equipment to \nrestaurants, hotels, and distributors throughout the world. This \ncompany was started in 1972 by Cedar Rapids native Bill Aossey. When \nBill returned to Iowa after serving in the Peace Corps and traveling \nthroughout the Middle East, he came up with the idea of starting a \ncompany dedicated to exporting Iowa products. Now, 33 years later, Bill \nhas a lot to show for this hard work. He employs 30 Iowans and the \nMidamar Corporation is very much a clear success.\n  I visited the Midamar facility last August and I can report Bill \nAossey and his employees are very enthusiastic about this prospect of a \ntrade agreement with Bahrain being implemented so they can even do more \nbusiness in the Middle East.\n  Aside from the immediate benefits to United States exporters to \nBahrain, this agreement's impact will extend beyond Bahrain. The United \nStates is promoting trade liberalization and economic growth in other \ncountries in the Middle East and this agreement will serve as the \ntemplate for other trade agreements being negotiated in the region. The \nsolid gains for U.S. farmers, workers, manufacturers, and service \nproviders found in this agreement may be replicated in other free trade \nagreements of their region.\n  This has already happened with the country of Oman. The United States \nrecently concluded a free trade agreement with Oman that was based \nlargely upon our agreement with Bahrain so the benefits to HNI \nCorporation, Lennox, and Midamar that I have identified will be \nmultiplied as other Arab countries adopt free trade agreements with the \nUnited States that are based largely upon the Bahrain agreement.\n  This is all part of a broader goal and that was expressed in May 2000 \nby President Bush proposing a plan of graduated steps for Middle \nEastern nations to increase trade and investment with the United States \nand others in the world economy, culminating with the establishment of \nthe Middle East Free Trade Agreement by the year 2013. The importance \nof this vision of President Bush was brought home on July 22, 2004, \nwhen the report of the 9/11 Commission was released. That report \ncontains as one of its key recommendations that ``comprehensive United \nStates strategy to counterterrorism should include economic policies \nthat encourage development, more open societies and opportunities for \npeople who improve the lives of their families and to enhance the \nprospect of their children's future.''\n  Our trade agreement with Bahrain is an important achievement in that \narea and joins previously concluded bilateral trade agreements between \nthe United States and Israel, Jordan, and Morocco. The agreement with \nBahrain is an important part of a broader effort to encourage \ndevelopment, more open societies, and opportunities for people to \nimprove the lives of their families and to enhance prospects for their \nchildren's future throughout the Middle East.\n  Finally, I urge my colleagues to support this bill before the Senate \nimplementing the United States-Bahrain Free Trade Agreement.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, today we begin debate on the free trade \nagreement between the United States and Bahrain. This is an agreement \nthat strengthens our ties with a stalwart ally in a troubled part of \nthe world. It is an agreement with a leading reformer in the Middle \nEast, and with the most open economy in the Arab world. And it is an \nagreement worthy of our support.\n  On the first day of enactment of the U.S.-Bahrain Free Trade \nAgreement, 100 percent of trade in manufactured goods will be duty \nfree, opening up markets for U.S. exports of motor vehicles and parts, \nmedical equipment, refrigeration equipment, et cetera. Agricultural \nexports are also expected to rise, and I hope Montana beef is among \nthem.\n  The services chapter is the most robust of any agreement the United \nStates has negotiated. Bahrain has promised American companies doing \nbusiness in the kingdom a regime free of barriers, modern in its \nregulation, and respectful of intellectual property rights.\n  For Bahrain, this agreement means greater integration into the world \neconomy, a better environment for its workers, and a pioneering role in \nthe Arab world. For the Middle East as a region, I hope this agreement \nis a firmly planted seed that will grow prosperity, openness, and \nstability.\n  A strong agreement such as this one does not automatically happen. It \ntakes hard work. It takes perseverance, followthrough. It takes vision. \nFortunately, the United States and Bahraini officials have these \nqualities in spades. I applaud their hard work. Ambassador Belooshi--\nwho, I might add, is observing these proceedings close by, very close, \nI might add--of the Kingdom of Bahrain typifies the courageous action \nand progressive thinking the Bahrainis have shown through the FTA \nprocess, and we should applaud him for it. He has done a super job.\n  I also applaud Ambassador Rob Portman and his predecessor, Bob \nZoellick. Ambassador Zoellick negotiated a strong agreement, and \nAmbassador Portman saw it through. Ambassador Portman listened to \nSenators' interests in monitoring Bahrain's end to its boycott of \nIsrael, and together we worked out a solution. He has been equally \nenergetic and flexible in working with my colleagues in the House Ways \nand Means Committee to alleviate their concerns, especially on labor.\n  I also applaud the very capable and energetic staff of the USTR. They \nare dedicated public servants, putting in long hours and endless effort \ninto their work. They do a super job.\n  This is the first FTA to come before us since the very contentious \nCentral American Free Trade agreement.\n  The overwhelming support I expect the Bahrain agreement to secure is \na testament to what can be achieved when the administration and the \nCongress work together to address concerns.\n  The Bahrain FTA shows that when the administration keeps an open \ndialogue with Congress, we can find common ground and achieve our \ncommon goals. I hope that we can continue to build upon the success of \nthis FTA in helping to heal the wounds of previous battles.\n  I think we have before us a model for open dialogue, and for \ncongressional support for trade liberalization.\n  I hope that we can take this model and apply it to much larger \ntrading partners and even bolder agreements. Agreements that will open \nbigger markets, realize greater opportunities, and make our industries \neven more competitive.\n  Mr. President, I am pleased to support the U.S.-Bahrain free trade \nagreement. I urge my colleagues to pledge their support as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/12/13/senate-section/article/S13485-1", "month": "12", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13485-S13486]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         BUDGET RECONCILIATION\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I also take this opportunity to speak on \na motion to instruct conferees on the Byrd amendment.\n  Yesterday, a Senator sent a letter to the majority leader saying he \nwould oppose the reconciliation bill if we used repeal of the Continued \nDumping and Subsidy Offset Act to achieve billions in budget savings. \nWhile disappointed, I was not surprised. In fact, I say, join the club.\n  Already, one Senator told me he would oppose reconciliation unless \nspecific provisions on specialty hospitals were not included. Several \nother Senators threatened to vote against the reconciliation bill \nunless the MLLC Program was not extended. Another Senator told me he \nwill vote no if we save money by trimming waste from the Medicaid \nProgram. A group of southern Senators said they would vote no on the \nreconciliation bill if the Grassley provision on payment limits in the \nfarm program became a part of the bill.\n  So, no savings from the CDSOA repeal; no savings from the MLLC \nProgram; no savings from Medicaid; no savings from payment limits. With \neveryone threatening to vote ``no'' there will be no savings in any \nFederal program, ever.\n  Everyone says they are for balanced budgets as long as it is someone \nelse whose budget is cut to get the job done--not their pet issue. We \nneed to ask ourselves whether we want to trim the Federal budget or \nnot. If not, what does the Republican Party stand for?\n  The most egregious threat has to be over budget savings from the \nrepeal of the Continued Dumping and Subsidy\n\n[[Page S13486]]\n\nOffset Act. This program is Government pork at its worst. It takes \nmoney that should go to the treasury of the United States and it \ntransfers that money to a select group of companies. Talk about special \ninterests, Mr. President. Plus there are very few limits on what these \ncompanies can do with the money that is raised by an act of Congress.\n  According to the General Accounting Office, one recipient even used \nthe money to pay off his home mortgage. The program is so bad it did \nnot even pass during the light of day a few years ago. Instead, it was \npushed into a conference report before it could receive scrutiny by \neither House of Congress. Ironically, some are arguing that budget \nreconciliation shouldn't be used to save money by repealing this \namendment. They argue it should go through the regular order. I don't \nknow why they would argue this given the provision never went through \nregular order before it became law in the first place.\n  Here, unlike passage a few years ago of this bad amendment, repeal \nwent through regular order in the House. Repeal just a couple weeks ago \nwent through regular order in the House where that amendment had never \neven been considered by the other body when it was originally adopted a \nfew years ago.\n  So let me be clear. We are not talking about repealing any aspect of \nour trade remedy laws. Every trade protection that has been in place \nfor years stays in place. What we are talking about is getting rid of a \nGovernment subsidy program that enriches the few at the expense of the \nmany.\n  A recent report from the Government Accountability Office shows this \nin very stark detail. Over $1 billion has been distributed so far under \nthis program. One company alone--one company alone--of that $1 billion \nreceived almost 20 percent of the disbursements, and the top 5 \nrecipients account for almost half of those disbursements.\n  You do not have to cast a very wide net to see where this corporate \nwelfare is going. Just 39 companies account for over 80 percent of the \ndisbursements. And the World Trade Organization has authorized a number \nof our trading partners to retaliate against us. This is where, to help \na few companies through this amendment, we are going to end up hurting \na lot of American producers, some of them in our powerful agriculture, \nand maybe end up hurting every consumer in America. As a result, \ninnocent U.S. exporters are taking a big hit so the lucky few can \ncontinue guzzling at the public trough.\n  Already, our exporters face additional duties imposed by Japan, \nCanada, Mexico, and the European Union. Here is where it affects some \nproducts. Our producers of live swine, fish, oysters, cigarettes, dairy \nproducts, wine, paper products, clothing, sweet corn, industrial belts, \nsteel products, forklift trucks, printing machines, and others, are all \nbearing the brunt of sanctions against some American companies because \nwe have a law on the books that violates our international agreement \nand at the same time benefits a handful of major companies in America.\n  It happens that Brazil, Chile, India, and South Korea could soon \nimpose sanctions. As more countries exercise their authority to \nretaliate and as payments under this program continue to grow, innocent \nU.S. exporters--the ones I have listed and others--and, more \nimportantly, their employees, will continue to be hurt more and more as \ntime goes on. That is not right. This situation needs to end.\n  The Government Accountability Office report points out some other \nridiculous aspects of this program, such as the complete lack of \naccountability. Recipients of funds under the program submit claims \nbased upon qualifying expenditures, but there is no way to tell whether \nthose claims are even justified. In fact, the evidence suggests they \nmay not be justified.\n  In 2004, company claims were about $1.3 trillion. Mr. President, I \nsaid that right: Companies were making claims for $1.3 trillion. The \ngross domestic product of the United States in 2004 was $11.75 \ntrillion. So if the 770 recipients of funds under the Continued Dumping \nand Subsidy Offset Act, referred to as the Byrd amendment, are to be \nbelieved, they spent about 11 percent of the U.S. gross domestic \nproduct last year on qualifying expenditures.\n  I understand that in the year 2005--the year now ending--claims are \nabout $3.2 trillion. That is equivalent to one-quarter of the GDP of \nthe entire United States of America.\n  I think those figures show the magnitude of the incentive for fraud \nunder this program. The proponents of this program ought to be \nembarrassed. This program is bad economic policy, bad trade policy, and \nbad Government to use the power of Government to end up giving a few \ncompanies in this country the benefit of the Federal Government's power \nto tax.\n  It should be repealed, as the House has done. I hope that coming out \nof conference we can have this provision in there. I hope we will not \ninstruct conferees to disagree with the House. In the process of doing \nthis, we are going to put $3.2 trillion into the Federal Treasury \ninstead of having it go as corporate welfare to a handful of companies.\n  If we cannot repeal such a blatant example of Government pork to save \nmoney during a time of skyrocketing budget deficits, then why are we \nhere as representatives of the people at all? Are we here to protect \nthe pockets of a select few, or do we want to do, and will do, what is \nin the best interests of our Nation?\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/12/13/senate-section/article/S13486-1", "month": "12", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13486-S13488]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       A NEW AMERICAN RENAISSANCE\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Toward the end of the 14th century, Emperor Manuel II \nPalaeologus ruled a waning Byzantine Empire. Looking across the \nBosporus, he saw a growing threat from the Moslem Ottoman Turks. In \n1390, he sent an embassy up the Adriatic Sea to Venice to build \nalliances. And to head the mission, he named the 35-year-old Manuel \nChrysoloras.\n  Although his embassy to Venice did not prosper, Chrysoloras' \nreputation did. And in 1396, the chancellor of the University of \nFlorence invited him there to teach Greek. The chancellor wrote: ``[W]e \nfirmly believe that both Greeks and Latins have always taken learning \nto a higher level by extending it to each other's literature.'' \nChrysoloras accepted.\n  But no one in Italy had studied Greek for 700 years. Chrysoloras \nbegan. He taught Greek in Florence, Bologna, Venice, and Rome. He \ntranslated Homer and Plato. He wrote the first basic Greek grammar in \nWestern Europe.\n  As the early renaissance poet Dante Alighieri wrote in The Divine \nComedy, ``A great flame follows a little spark.'' The flame of learning \nspread through the rest of Europe, reconnecting the West with classical \nantiquity, experimentalism, and the desire to live well.\n  Chrysoloras and scholars like him helped to begin the scientific \nrevolution and artistic transformation that would become known as the \nItalian Renaissance. Europe emerged from the backwater. Commerce and \nexploration burst forth. The Modern Age began.\n  Renaissance historian Matteo Palmieri exhorted a fellow Italian of \nthe mid 15th century to ``[t]hank God that it has been permitted to him \nto be born in this new age, so full of hope and promise, which already \nrejoices in a greater array of nobly-gifted souls than the world has \nseen in the thousand years that have preceded it,''\n  With the Renaissance, Western Europe began its domination of the \nworld economy. The West has held this power so long that it is easy--\nespecially for us here in the West--to take it for granted. But it need \nnot have been so.\n  In the century leading up to the year 1000, Moorish Spain could claim \na far more advanced civilization than that of Christian Italy. \nCordoba's streets were paved and lit. Cordoba had 300 public baths and \n70 libraries. Cordoba's great central library alone held 400,000 \nbooks--more than all of France. The Arab postal service delivered \nregular mail as far as India. Arab civilization was internally \ncreative. And Arab thinkers of the time were open to Persian and Indian \nscience, as well.\n  In the 12th century, an English scholar named Adelard of Bath \ntraveled through the Islamic lands of Spain, North Africa, and Asia \nMinor. Adelard reported: ``The further south you go, the more they \nknow. They know how to think.''\n  And Adelard carried back from the south a way of thinking. He said: \n``Although man is not armed by nature, nor is naturally swiftest in \nflight, yet\n\n[[Page S13487]]\n\nhe has something better by far--reason.''\n  The advanced Moorish state suffered civil conflict and fell to the \nless-developed Christian states of Europe. Finally, on January 2, 1492, \nthe leader of the last Muslim stronghold in Granada surrendered to \narmies of a resurgent, newly-united Christian Spain. The remaining \nSpanish Muslims were forced to leave Spain or convert to Christianity.\n  At the end of the first millennium, Arab Spain had the most advanced \nscience and economy of its day. But in the centuries that followed, it \nfell to a newly-emergent Western Europe.\n  At the end of the first millennium, Western Europe slumbered in its \nDark Ages. But in the next centuries, it emerged into the Renaissance.\n  We here today inherit the legacy of the Italian Renaissance. We have \nabsorbed the learning of the Arab Caliphates. And we inhabit the land \nmade known to Europeans by another voyage of 1492.\n  At the end of the second millennium, America has the most advanced \nscience and economy of our day. But we cannot take that leadership for \ngranted.\n  In the centuries ahead, if America wishes to remain the most advanced \neconomy of our day, we will need to create a new American renaissance.\n  We need this new American renaissance, because leadership does not \ncome from continuing to do what we do already. Smart people in China \nand India and around the globe are quickly learning how to do what we \ndo now. And people in China and India and around the globe will be able \nto do it more cheaply.\n  Instead, leadership comes from constant innovation. Leadership comes \nfrom rapidly adjusting what we do to what the market demands. And \nleadership comes from serving the customer. Fortunately, these are \ncharacteristics at which Americans excel.\n  This is my eighth Senate floor statement this year on \ncompetitiveness. I began in June with a general statement on \ncompetitiveness and America's place in the world. In June, I also spoke \nof education and competitiveness. In July, I spoke of trade \nand competitiveness and health care and competitiveness. In September, \nI spoke of savings and competitiveness. In October, I spoke of energy \nand competitiveness. In November, I spoke of immigration and \ncompetitiveness. And today, I conclude this series of addresses with \nthis discussion of the need for the new American renaissance.\n\n  My message is this: To foster this continuing American renaissance, \nAmerican government cannot stand idly by. Remaining economically \ncompetitive will require action. Let me summarize my six-step agenda \nfor action. This is what we need to do:\n  First, we must improve education. The Italian Renaissance relied on \nthe learning of the Greeks that Manuel Chrysoloras helped to spread. \nThe new American renaissance will rely on our having the best educated \nworkforce of the centuries to come.\n  We need to ensure that children come to school ready to learn. We \nneed to ensure that children have modern and well-equipped schools. And \nwe need to ensure that children have small classes.\n  We should raise salaries for teachers in poor schools by 50 percent. \nWe should raise the salaries of top-performing teachers and teachers in \nmath, science, and languages by another 50 percent.\n  We can ensure quality afterschool programs. We can lengthen the \nschool year.\n  We must support community colleges and link them more strongly to \nworkforce opportunities. We must expand Pell Grants. We must improve, \nconsolidate, and expand education tax incentives. We must expand and \nextend the deduction for tuition expenses. We must increase \nscholarships and loan forgiveness for science and engineering students. \nWe must expand the Hope and Lifetime Learning credits.\n  We need to make it possible for non-traditional students to obtain an \neducation. We need to retrain workers whose jobs are lost to trade and \nhelp them reenter the workforce.\n  We should make it easier, consistent with the requirements of \nnational security, for foreign students to study in America.\n  We should make visa renewals during multiyear studies routine. And we \nshould change visa renewal requirements policies that are now \ncontingent on students' return to their home countries.\n  Second, we must foster research. For it was discovery that helped \nbring about the renaissance.\n  We need to reward innovation and risk-taking. We need to fully fund \nresearch support organizations like the- National Science Foundation, \nthe National Institutes of Health, and the Office of Science at the \nDepartment of Energy. We need to simplify and make permanent the R \ntax credit.\n  We should encourage talented foreign students to study, research, and \ninnovate at American universities and research institutions. And we \nshould simplify the permanent residence process for exceptional foreign \nstudents with advanced science degrees from American universities.\n  Third, we have to advance international trade. Insularity \ncharacterized the Dark Ages. The Renaissance spread from an \ninternational spark. And the ensuing blaze of international commerce \nbrought on the Modern Age.\n  We must open new markets for American exports worldwide. We must \nimprove enforcement of existing trade agreements. We must do more to \ndefend American intellectual property rights. And we must prompt China \nto further loosen its currency.\n  We should look more to Asia for bilateral agreements. We should \nadvance regional trade agreements in Asia. We should seek out further \nsectoral agreements such as the WTO's Information Technology Agreement. \nAnd we should launch an initiative in the advanced medical equipment \nsector.\n  We need to expand trade adjustment assistance to service workers. And \nwe need to expand wage insurance.\n  We can make it easier for major American companies to employ and \ntrain their overseas employees. And we can facilitate international \nparticipation in meetings and conferences and travel to trade shows.\n  Fourth, we must address the burden that high health care costs place \non American business. And we must help provide health insurance to \nthose who do not have it.\n  We can provide health insurance tax credits to small employers. We \ncan fund employer-based group-purchasing pools. We can increase funding \nfor high-risk pools. We can expand Medicaid and the State Children's \nHealth Insurance Program. We can permit a Medicare buy-in for the near-\nelderly.\n  We need to facilitate the use of health information technology. We \nneed to use health IT to link medication administration to a patient's \nclinical information. We need to foster standards for the \ninteroperability of health IT systems. We need to improve healthcare \nproviders' ability to exchange clinical data. And we need to provide \nloans and grants to encourage the use of health IT. The Senate has \npassed legislation this session to further many of these health IT \ngoals. The House must do it, too, and move quickly to provide higher \nMedicare reimbursements and work to improve quality of care, known as \n``pay-for-performance.''\n  We should provide higher Medicare reimbursements to providers working \nto improve the quality of delivered care. And we should coordinate \nsenior care to ensure adequate preventive care and chronic condition \nmanagement. This year's Senate-passed spending reconciliation bill took \nthe first steps toward pay-for-performance. Although there is much in \nthat bill that gives me pause, we should enact those pay-for-\nperformance changes.\n  Fifth, we must increase national savings to finance the investment \nand innovation of the next renaissance.\n  We need to plug the biggest leak in our national savings pool: the \nfederal budget deficit. We need to truthfully report current and future \nFederal Government spending needs. We need to restore pay-as-you-go \nrules for both entitlement spending and tax cuts.\n  We should reduce the annual tax gap. We should eliminate wasteful and \nunnecessary spending. We should eliminate wasteful and unfair tax \nbreaks, such as abusive tax shelters and corporate tax loopholes. And \nwe should slow the growth in healthcare costs.\n  We can increase private savings. We can improve financial education. \nWe can encourage automatic enrollment of\n\n[[Page S13488]]\n\neligible workers in retirement savings plans. We can bring payroll-\ndeduction retirement savings to private sector workers lacking 401(k)s \nor similar plans. We can make incentives for saving more progressive. \nAnd we can extend the Savers' Credit and expand it to Americans with no \nincome tax liability.\n  Sixth, for a modern renaissance, we must address the need for \nsustainable and environmentally compatible sources of energy.\n  We can launch a new ``Manhattan Project'' to develop clean \nalternative energies. We can foster the use of hydrogen and fuel cells. \nWe can foster wind energy. We can make a clear commitment to the \ndevelopment of biomass and ethanol-based fuels.\n  We should encourage energy R through research grants to industry \nand educational institutions and tax incentives for R We should \noffer prizes to spur innovation.\n  We need an investment tax credit for coal gasification technology. We \nneed a tax credit for companies that generate fuel using an updated \nversion of the F-T process. And we need a Federal loan guarantee so \nthat companies can finance these capital investments. This year's \nenergy and highway bills addressed some of these needs.\n  Taken together, these policies form a bold agenda to advance American \ncompetitiveness. They can help maintain American economic leadership in \nthe world. And they can help to preserve high-wage American jobs here \nat home.\n  Beginning next month, I will introduce a comprehensive 2006 \nlegislative package to strengthen America's competitiveness in a \nchanging world. This package will encompass several bills that cover \nthe many aspects of competitiveness. I invite my colleagues to join me \nin this effort.\n  The early Renaissance poet, Dante Alighieri, embodied the spirit of \nhis times when he wrote in The Divine Comedy that people ``were not \nborn to live like brutes, but to follow virtue and knowledge.''\n  And from that grounding of virtue and knowledge flowed naturally \nDante's description: ``And thence we came forth, to see again the \nstars.''\n  Let us follow virtue and knowledge and foster a new American \nrenaissance. Let us strengthen America's competitiveness in a changing \nworld. And let America again go forth, toward the stars.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Allen). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/12/13/senate-section/article/S13488-1", "month": "12", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13488-S13490]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      BAHRAIN FREE TRADE AGREEMENT\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, my understanding is that the Senate is \ntaking up the free-trade agreement with Bahrain. Of all the priorities \nthat exist in our country dealing with the subject of trade, somewhere \nclose to last would be a trade agreement with Bahrain. Nothing against \nthe country of Bahrain. I am sure it is a wonderful place. I have not \nactually visited there. But I believe the total trade between our \ncountry and Bahrain is somewhere in the neighborhood of $700 million, \nless than $1 billion on both sides of the ledger.\n  There are all kinds of trade problems our trade officials ought to be \nworking on. But a free-trade agreement with Bahrain would not rank \nright near the top. Let me tell you what would rank near the top.\n  We are deep in debt with respect to international trade. This country \nis in desperate trouble with respect to trade. We are now experiencing \na trade deficit of over $700 billion a year. That means every single \nday, 7 days a week, we buy more from abroad than we sell in exports, $2 \nbillion a day every day 7 days a week. How long can a country sustain \nthat?\n  We have lost 3 million jobs in this country in the past 4 years--3 \nmillion jobs--going to China, to Vietnam, Bangladesh, Indonesia, and \nmore.\n  So what is all of this about? It is about a new strategy, a strategy \ndeveloped in the past two to three decades, but accelerated now more \nrecently. It is a strategy that says we are a global economy, and \nbecause it is a global economy, enterprises, corporations, and others \nshould take a look around this world and find out where these 1 to 1.5 \nbillion people are who will work for pennies an hour, employ them, shut \ndown your U.S. manufacturing plant, hire the employees in China or \nBangladesh, for example, and it will all work out because they will \nwork for 30 cents an hour, and they will build bicycles and wagons and \nproduce textiles and other things. And then you can ship it to a big \nbox retailer in this country, and someone can walk through the front \ndoor of that big box retailer and buy a cheap product.\n  I noticed last year at Christmastime there was a woman from Texas who \ndecided she was going to buy her children some presents, and she wanted \nto make a point of buying American made products. So she started \nshopping, and she discovered she could not purchase one present for her \nchildren that was made in the United States.\n  What does it mean? It means our country is changing and our country \nis, in my judgment, being hollowed out. Jobs are being lost, the middle \nclass is shrinking because we have been told now American workers must \ncompete with others around the world who are willing to work for 30, \n40, 50 cents an hour, work without health insurance, without a \nretirement, and work under the threat, in many cases, if they would \nlike to organize as workers, of being sent to prison.\n  I can actually give names of people now sitting in prison in China \nwhose transgression was deciding to try to organize workers because the \nconditions in those plants were awful. So there are people who tried to \norganize workers, were arrested, and now are sitting in prison. Those \nare the conditions under which we are now trading.\n  One-third of our trade deficit, incidentally, is with the country of \nChina. Last month, we sold China $3 billion worth of American goods--$3 \nbillion. And we purchased from China $23 billion in goods.\n  China has almost 1.4 billion people, and we are told this is going to \nbe a huge market for American production. The creation of a middle \nclass in China is going to be terrific for our country because we will \nbe able to produce and sell into the Chinese marketplace.\n  It is not working out that way, of course. What is happening is China \nsells us $23 billion worth of goods produced in China, and we sell them \nonly $3 billion worth of goods produced in America, $20 billion-a-month \ntrade deficit with China. On an annual rate, that is a $240 billion \ndeficit with China in a year. That is unbelievable. And this Congress \nis perfectly content to dose through it all; in fact, probably a very \nsatisfactory sleep for most because they still are willing to stand on \nstreet corners and chant about this so-called free trade that is not \nfree at all.\n  Some will say, and I think perhaps most who have studied economics \nwill say, that this is unsustainable. This country is headed toward \nsome whitewater rapids with these kinds of trade deficits. We are not \nonly losing American jobs because American workers are being told they \ncost too much money, and we are going to produce elsewhere, but we are \nalso up to our neck in debt.\n  Incidentally, the trade deficits are financed by selling part of our \ncountry. Every single day we sell another $2 billion worth of our \ncountry to foreigners. That is the way the trade debt is financed.\n  In most recent months, one of General Motors' top executives called \nin about 300 of the top executives of the companies they buy parts from \nand said this to them: You are the companies from which we buy \nautomobile parts. We want you to begin producing those parts in China. \nYou need to move those parts to China. Get your production done in \nChina. We are about driving down the costs.\n  Then we see Delphi, which was formerly part of General Motors and \nthen spun off as the largest automotive parts producer, going through \nbankruptcy, and Delphi says to the public: The problem is we have \npeople making $20 to $30 an hour. That is up to $40,000, $50,000, \n$60,000 a year. What we want to do is get to a point where we have \npeople making $8 to $10 an hour. In fact,\n\n[[Page S13489]]\n\nwhat we want to do is move most of our production offshore to China and \nelsewhere so we can pay 30 cents an hour. And then the jobs that are \nretained, we want to pay $8 to $10 an hour.\n  I ask this question of, yes, General Motors, IBM, and all of these \ncompanies engaged in this activity, and virtually all of them are: Who \nwill be your future customers if your job is to lay off American \nworkers so you can produce elsewhere where it is cheap in order to sell \nback into this established marketplace? Who is going to buy your laptop \ncomputers and your automobiles?\n  If we were going to do something representing a priority today for me \non trade, I would deal with China first. But there are all kinds of \nbilateral trade problems with a number of major trading partners. Let \nme give you some examples.\n  I have mentioned many times that in the past year we will have \nshipped in well over 600,000 automobiles from Korea into this country. \nIn return, we were able to send about 3,900 American vehicles to be \nsold in Korea. Sound fair? Sound reasonable? Sound like a thoughtful \ndeal for America? The answer is clearly no.\n  What this means is shifting American jobs elsewhere, produce the cars \nin Korea, ship them to the United States, and if you start selling any \nU.S. vehicles in Korea, shut it down. That is what has happened. \nIncidentally, the Dodge Dakota pickup truck became a little bit popular \nfor a couple of months in Korea. They saw that and shut it down just \nlike that. They do not want American vehicles sold in Korea. They just \nwant to sell their cars here.\n  China has 20 million cars on the road. It is estimated that by the \nyear 2020 they will have 120 million cars on the road. They are gong to \nadd 100 million cars because they want to start driving in China, even \nin the rural areas of China. General Motors says a Chinese company has \nstolen the production blueprints for one of its small cars. They have \nactually filed a legal action against the Chinese company for stealing \nwhat they call the production blueprints for a vehicle.\n  So a company in China called Chery, which is only one letter away \nfrom Chevy, is going to be producing a car called the QQ. The QQ is a \ncar that will be produced in China with what General Motors alleges are \nthe production blueprints that were stolen from General Motors.\n  Recent Wall Street Journal reports say that the Chinese are gearing \nup for a very substantial automobile industry, and they want to export \naround the world.\n  I ask unanimous consent for an additional 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. They want to export those vehicles around the world so \nvery soon. Unless something changes, China will be exporting \nautomobiles as Korea is doing. Does anyone think China wants to take \nAmerican vehicles into China? No, no. What they want to do is accept \nthe American marketplace as a sponge for all that they produce.\n  I have spoken at great length on the Senate floor about the people \nwho have lost their jobs in this country when their plants closed down. \nI talked about Pennsylvania House Furniture. In fact, I talked to the \nGovernor of Pennsylvania about this. Pennsylvania House Furniture, the \ndescription of that for almost a century was using the finest \nPennsylvania wood and producing high-end furniture, and when people \nbought Pennsylvania House furniture, they knew they were getting a real \npiece of furniture.\n  Well, La-Z-Boy bought that furniture company. After a couple of \nyears, La-Z-Boy decided, we want to produce that furniture in China. \nThe Governor of Pennsylvania and others tried to put together a \nfinancing package to keep the jobs in Pennsylvania, to do everything to \nsee if they can keep in this country the Pennsylvania House Furniture \nCompany that had been around a century.\n  The answer was no. La-Z-Boy said: Those jobs are going to China. Now \nwhat they do is ship the wood from Pennsylvania to China and pay the \nChinese workers pennies on the hour to put the wood together in \nfurniture and then send the furniture back to our country to be sold. \nYes, it is Pennsylvania House furniture but not made in Pennsylvania. \nSo those workers lost their jobs. Is it because they were not good \nworkers? No, they were craftsmen. In fact, the very last piece of \nfurniture they made in Pennsylvania they turned upside down and those \ncraftsmen who made that furniture all signed their name on it, the last \npiece of furniture that company made in America by American workers. \nLa-Z-Boy, which owned Pennsylvania House Furniture, decided, as so many \nothers have, that those jobs had to go to China because they can pay \npennies on the hour, they can work kids if you want to, they can dump \nthe pollution into the sky and into the water, and they will not have \nanybody worrying about whether they are going to form a union because \nit will not be allowed. That is not fair trade. That is not something \nwe should continue to allow in this country, stand by and thumb the \nsuspenders and whistle a little bit while Americans lose those jobs and \nthose jobs go to China and then come back to a big-box retailer to be \nsold at discount prices. Who ultimately is going to buy those products?\n  My point is this does not work. Instead of dealing with a range of \nissues, yes, with China, Korea, Canada, Mexico, Europe, with whom we \nhave very large trade deficits and growing trade deficits, I might add, \ninstead of dealing with that, talking about it, responding to that, \ntrying to deal with this country's challenges in trade, we are on the \nSenate floor talking about the free trade agreement with Bahrain.\n  Where is the energy to do something real? Once again, it is a small \nmoment to do a free trade agreement with Bahrain. It is a very small \ncountry in the middle of the Middle East. Our total trade with them, on \nboth sides, is $700 million a year. We cannot get trade officials in \nthis country, this administration or this Congress, to look truth right \nin the eye on these kinds of problems, the huge deficits, year after \nyear, that are shipping jobs overseas. There is another corollary to \nthis as well. The same companies that decide that they should not hire \nAmericans, they should shut down the American plant and, by the way, do \nso with an encouragement by this Congress because this Congress gives \nthem a tax break--and we voted I think four times on my amendment to \nshut down the tax break that subsidizes jobs going overseas, but, no, \nthis Congress still wants to provide a tax subsidy to those companies \nthat shut down their American plant and move jobs overseas. But this \nnew environment in which companies do not say the Pledge of Allegiance \nany more but they are an international corporation, they want to \nproduce where they can produce for pennies, they want to sell into this \nmarketplace where they can get high-end consumers to buy it, and then \nat the same time, by the way, they want to run the income, if they can, \nthrough a mailbox in the Bahamas or the Caymans.\n\n  I want to mention that there is one building that is a five-story \nbuilding in the Cayman Islands located on Church Street. I have brought \na photo of it to the Senate floor previously, and I should do that \nagain at some point. That building is the official residence and \naddress for 12,748 corporations.\n  Now, one might ask, how is it 12,748 corporations can share a \nresidence or an address in a 5-story white building in the Cayman \nIslands? Simple. It is nothing more than an address.\n  What is the purpose of having an address in a 5-story white building \nin the Cayman Islands? So that one does not have to pay taxes to this \ncountry. Money can be moved through a tax haven and avoid paying U.S. \ntaxes. So one is a U.S. company, they are chartered probably in \nDelaware, have all the advantages of being an American, but now the new \neconomics tell them they should produce in China, sell in this \nmarketplace and set up an address in a 5-story white building mailbox \nin the Cayman Islands, so that they can have all the opportunities that \ncome with being an American, except the responsibilities to hire \nAmerican workers or to pay American taxes. That is what is happening.\n  People say, well, that is just an anticorporate rant. It is not. I \nthink there are some wonderful corporations in this country, some \nterrific corporations with inventive people, creative\n\n[[Page S13490]]\n\npeople, who have advanced this country, have produced wonderful, \nbreathtaking products, but I think there is a culture in this country, \nwith respect to trade and corporate responsibility, that has gone off \nthe track. In this Congress, we cannot get anybody to talk about trade, \nexcept perhaps to come and stand around to talk about the Bahrain trade \nagreement on a Tuesday. Would it not be wonderful if we were talking \nabout this full-blown crisis of $2 billion a day to date, $2 billion \nthat we purchase from abroad more than we sell to abroad, and therefore \ntoday someone off the shores of this country owns $2 billion worth of \nthis country. We are selling this country piece by piece.\n  A budget deficit in this country is financed in the traditional way, \nbut a trade deficit is financed in a very different way. When we \npurchase those foreign goods, the trade deficit puts American currency \nin the hands of foreigners. They then use that currency to purchase \nreal estate, stocks, bonds, to purchase part of this country. Every \nsingle day we are selling part of this country with an incompetent \ntrade strategy, a jingoistic trade strategy that chants about free \ntrade that has long ago been discredited. We ought to be describing \ncircumstances of requiring fair trade. As a country, we ought be a \nleader in deciding, yes, let us expand trade in open markets, but it \nmust be fair, and if it is not fair then this country is obligated to \ntake the lead to insist on and demand fairness.\n  Our job ought to finally be to pull others up, not to push us down. \nWhat has happened more recently is we are pushing American workers \ndown, pushing incomes down, the standard of living down in this country \nand seeing jobs exported, opportunity exported, and exporting part of \nour future. That is not satisfactory to me. I regret we are here \ntalking about this free trade agreement when in fact we should be \ntalking about the center, the bull's-eye of the target dealing with \ntrade that is causing this hemorrhage of red ink and the loss of \nAmerican jobs day after day after day.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a great \nMinnesotan and great American, former Senator Eugene McCarthy, who \npassed away last Saturday at the age of 89. Senator McCarthy served two \nterms in this body, from 1958 to 1970, after serving five terms in the \nHouse of Representatives. In addition to his very distinguished \nlegislative career, he is perhaps best remembered for his historic \nPresidential campaign in 1968, in which he deposed an incumbent \nPresident.\n  Eugene Joseph McCarthy was born on March 29, 1916, in Watkins, MN. He \ngraduated from St. John's University in Collegeville, MN, in 1935, and \nthen earned a master's degree in economics and sociology at the \nUniversity of Minnesota.\n  After college, he spent 9 months as a novice in a Benedictine \nseminary. The world pulled him away, however, and he played \nsemiprofessional baseball, taught high school social science, was a \nprofessor at his alma mater, St. John's, and then chaired the sociology \ndepartment at St. Thomas University in St. Paul, MN.\n  During World War II he worked in a military intelligence division of \nthe War Department. He married a fellow teacher, Abigail Quigley, with \nwhom he had three daughters and a son. Abigail McCarthy passed away in \n2001.\n  In 1948 Gene McCarthy was elected to the House of Representatives \nfrom Minnesota's Fourth Congressional District. While in the House, \nCongressman McCarthy founded McCarthy's Mavericks, which was the \nforerunner of the Democratic study group that would, in succeeding \ndecades, be influential in developing many important legislative \ninitiatives.\n  In 1952, he was the first Member of Congress to challenge Senator \nJoseph McCarthy in a nationally televised debate on foreign policy. \nThat political courage presaged his decision 15 years later to \nchallenge an incumbent President. In 1958, Congressman McCarthy \ndefeated an incumbent Senator to become Senator McCarthy. He was \nreelected to the Senate in 1964 with over 60 percent of the vote. Then, \nin November of 1967, he announced his candidacy for President, \nchallenging the incumbent President of his own party, Lyndon Johnson. \nIn his announcement speech he said:\n\n       I am hopeful that this challenge may alleviate this sense \n     of political helplessness and restore to many people a belief \n     in the process of American politics and of American \n     government.\n\n  His candidacy ignited a new generation of political activists, many \nof them young college students who shaved, showered, and went ``Clean \nfor Gene.'' They swarmed into New Hampshire for the first political \ncontest of 1968. There they helped Senator McCarthy transform the \npolitical landscape by holding President Johnson to 49 percent of the \nvote in the Democratic primary, with 42 percent voting for Senator \nMcCarthy. Seldom has a second-place finish been considered such a \nvictory. Two weeks later, President Johnson withdrew his candidacy for \nreelection. Shortly thereafter, fellow Senator Robert Kennedy and \nfellow Minnesotan Vice President Hubert Humphrey entered the \nPresidential contest, two actions that Gene McCarthy would never forget \nor forgive.\n  The Democratic contest became divisive in subsequent primaries, then \ncatastrophic with the assassination of Robert Kennedy, then destructive \nat the tumultuous national convention in Chicago that nominated Hubert \nHumphrey, not Gene McCarthy. The nominee and the party did not recover \nfrom that disastrous convention and Richard Nixon was elected President \nin November. The Vietnam war continued for 7 more years.\n\n  Gene McCarthy retired from the Senate in 1970 and never again held \npublic office. Some of his later remarks, reflecting his disenchantment \nand his defiance, along with his acerbic wit, dismayed some Democrats \nand disillusioned former supporters. Gene McCarthy, however, was always \nhis own man. He once said his definition of patriotism was ``to serve \none's country not in submission, but to serve it in truth.''\n  He used his pen and his tongue to speak his own truth, regardless of \nthe personal or political consequences. In that respect, he was a true \npatriot.\n  After he was decried by Johnson's supporters as a mere ``footnote in \nhistory,'' he retorted, ``I think we can say with Churchill, `but what \na footnote.'''\n  You are much more than a footnote, Senator McCarthy. You were a U.S. \nSenator. You made history and you changed history. You were true to \nyourself, to your ideals and to your convictions. You were a poet, a \nphilosopher, and a patriot, a great Minnesotan and a great American. \nMay you rest in peace.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Will the Senator yield for a second before he does yield \nthe floor?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank the Chair. I commend my colleague from Minnesota \nfor taking the time to speak about an old friend, a remarkable \npolitician, a remarkable Senator, Gene McCarthy.\n  In my younger days in Iowa, when they still had a bounty on Democrats \nin my State and Republicans ran everything, we always had the Democrats \nfrom Minnesota come down--McCarthy and Mondale and Humphrey, people \nsuch as that. But Gene McCarthy was a very rare, a unique individual. I \nwas listening in the cloakroom to what the Senator from Minnesota was \nsaying about Gene McCarthy. He had a way about him that was like Mark \nTwain. He had a great sense of humor. He could, like Mark Twain, say \nvery succinctly what it might take others a paragraph to say. That was \none of the qualities I always envied about McCarthy. I always thought, \nGosh, why can't I say it like that? He had a great way with words.\n  Like Mark Twain, Gene McCarthy had the ability, with very few words, \nto puncture the inflated egos of puffed-up politicians. If you were on \nthe other\n\n[[Page S13491]]\n\nend of it, you didn't feel good about it. He had a way of doing it \nwithout being mean, but when you heard him--and he never attacked \nanyone but he did it in terms of what they stood for, what they were \nsaying--you heard it and you realized McCarthy was right. He had a \nrefreshing and disarming way about him in his approach to politics. He \nmade his point and he made it well.\n  I do not know if my friend from Minnesota repeated the quote that was \nattributed to him in the newspaper that I read the other day, which I \nthought was McCarthy at his best. He said one time that being a \npolitician is sometimes like being a football coach. You have to be \nsmart enough to know how to play the game but dumb enough to think it's \nimportant.\n  Those of us who think all the things we do here are so grandiose \nshould realize we pass on and others take our place. A lot of the \nthings we do here, we may think are important and they are not that \nimportant.\n  So that was Gene McCarthy. He would say things that made you smile, \nmade you think about things.\n  I say to my friend from Minnesota, I got out of the Navy in November \nof 1967 and I returned home to Iowa in 1968. At that point I was not \nactive in politics. But like so many of my colleagues and friends in \nthe Navy, I lost a lot of my friends in Vietnam. Slowly but surely over \nthe 5 years that I was on active duty, I became convinced that the war \nin Vietnam should not go on, that it was wrong, that we ought to get \nout of there.\n  But, of course, I was in the Navy at the time. I couldn't say \nanything about it. I was a Navy person. So I thought, well, now that I \nam out maybe I can do something. I was looking for someone to give me \nadvice. I was looking for someone out there who would stand up and take \nthe lead on this--Gene McCarthy. Gene McCarthy was the first politician \nI ever met who wasn't afraid to say the ``emperor has no clothes.'' And \nonce he did that, people realized, you are right; that this war in \nVietnam was nonsensical, that we ought to bring an end to it. He \nencouraged a lot of young people. And I can still remember, and I will \nbet the Senator from Minnesota has the same memory. I had one of those \ndaisies on the trunk of my car, a blue and white daisy with \n``McCarthy'' on it. That was in 1968.\n  I think he brought a lot of young people in and gave a lot of young \npeople encouragement that they could change the system and that they \ncould make a difference.\n  Through his later years I became a friend of Gene McCarthy. In fact, \nwhen I ran for President in 1991, he was running again. So we found \nourselves running against each other.\n  As we were both fading and Bill Clinton was winning everything, he \ndrew me aside one time and said: Do you ever wonder why we are still \nhere and what we are doing?\n  I said: Yes; I do wonder that sometimes.\n  He said: Well, we are here because the liberal position needs to be \nenunciated and fought for regardless of who the nominee is.\n  I am paraphrasing, but that is the way I remember him saying that.\n  I just wanted to take the time to commiserate with my good friend, \nSenator Dayton, about a wonderful human being, a truly remarkable U.S. \nSenator, one of the most intelligent individuals to ever grace the \nfloor of the U.S. Senate, and to remember his legacy, the legacy of \nhaving the courage of your convictions, of standing up for what you \nthink is right, and once in a while don't take ourselves too seriously.\n  That was the Gene McCarthy I knew and loved. We will remember him \nalways.\n  I thank my colleague from Minnesota for taking the time today to \nremember our good friend and departed colleague.\n  Mr. DAYTON. I think Senator McCarthy would be very impressed with the \nextemporaneous eloquence of the Senator from Iowa and very appreciative \nof his kind words. Of course, Iowa has the first Presidential contest. \nBack in those days, I would have seen a lot more of Senator McCarthy.\n  Mr. HARKIN. He would have taken me to task for talking so long. He \nwould have said: You could have said that in 2 minutes.\n  Mr. DAYTON. I thank my friend.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, so ordered. The Senator \nfrom Iowa is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/12/13/senate-section/article/S13491-1", "month": "12", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13491-S13494]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             RECONCILIATION\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I know that a motion to appoint conferees \nhas not happened yet on the reconciliation bill, but I understand that \nthe majority leader will sometime today be making that motion. It is a \ndebatable motion, and obviously an amendable motion. I think there are \nmaybe four or five different motions to instruct our conferees \nregarding the reconciliation bill.\n  I want to take the time now to talk about it, even though I have an \namendment, but it is not timely to send the amendment to the desk. But \nI do want to talk about what that amendment will do and why I am going \nto be offering it.\n  Basically, it has to do with funding cuts for food assistance \nprograms.\n  It has been a challenging year for all of us, especially here in the \nSenate. There have been many things upon which this Chamber disagreed. \nWe have had some spirited debates and disagreements. The budget debate \nand ensuing reconciliation bill has been one of the most challenging of \nthese debates.\n  But there are also times when agreement rather than discord \ncharacterize our proceedings.\n  While I disagreed with the underlying reconciliation bill passed by \nthe Senate, I was pleased and proud of one of the sources of bipartisan \nagreement that we had both in committee and on the floor. It was the \ndecision by the Senate not to cut food assistance programs for working \nAmericans, for low-income working Americans.\n  The Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry considered such \ncuts. In fact, the President's budget included a proposal to cut the \nFood Stamp Program by nearly $600 million. But after careful \nexamination of the Food Stamp Program, after deliberation in the \ncommittee, both Republicans and Democrats decided against any cuts to \nthe Food Stamp Program.\n  I commend today, as I did at that time, our chairman, Senator \nChambliss, for listening carefully to committee members' concerns by \nlooking at this and for his conscientious decision not to include any \nsuch cuts in the committee-passed measure.\n\n  I commend as well many members of both parties who have objected to \ncutting food assistance programs through the reconciliation process.\n  There are many reasons food stamp cuts should not be enacted.\n  First, the Food Stamp Program is the first line of defense in the \nUnited States against hunger and food insecurity, providing food \nassistance to nearly 25 million Americans. It is also one of our \nlargest child nutrition programs. Eighty percent of food stamp \nbenefits--over $23 billion in 2005--go to families with children.\n  Another reason cutting food assistance is not appropriate is because \nthe need is growing and not diminishing.\n  Just recently, a U.S. Agriculture Department study found that 38.2 \nmillion people lived in households that were food insecure in 2004, and \nthat the number increased by nearly 2 million between 2003 and 2004.\n  Since 1999, the number of individuals classified by USDA as food \ninsecure rose by 7 million people. These are significant numbers.\n  That any American should live in the shadow of hunger at the dawn of \nthe 21st century is shocking and embarrassing. That the number has \nincreased dramatically in the past 5 years is unacceptable.\n  We have also been reminded of another reason we shouldn't have food \nstamp cuts. We have been reminded by the numerous hurricanes and \ndisasters this fall of the tremendous role that the Food Stamp Program \nplays in times of emergency. The Food Stamp Program rapidly provided \nemergency food assistance to approximately 2.2 million individuals \naffected by Hurricanes Katrina, Rita, and Wilma, allowing victims to \nobtain food assistance within days.\n  Finally, the Senate Agriculture Committee chose not to cut the Food\n\n[[Page S13492]]\n\nStamp Program because there is not much to cut. It operates efficiently \nand effectively.\n  For 5 years in a row, the error rate in the Food Stamp Program has \ndeclined to consecutive all-time lows.\n  Frankly, if there were fraud, waste, and abuse to go after, I would \nbe the first in line to do so.\n  I say that because I have been on this Agriculture Committee in both \nthe House and the Senate--this marks my 30th year. We have gone through \na lot in the Food Stamp Program in that time. We have cut and trimmed. \nWe have gone from food stamps to an electronic benefits card to cut \ndown on fraud, waste, and abuse. It has worked well.\n  We have a program that by any measurement operates efficiently.\n  The farm bill we passed in 2002 included a major reform to the \nquality control system. Just last year, Congress made improvements to \nFederal child nutrition programs. Again, because of this bipartisan \napproach, which I believe kind of goes back to the Dole-McGovern years \nwhen they forged an alliance to ensure we had a bipartisan agreement on \nthe Food Stamp Program, we have a sound, efficiently, effectively run \nprogram. There just is not any--I would not say there isn't any, but to \ngo after what little abuse there may be would cost more than what is \nhappening. We have tightened down on this program over the last 30 \nyears. There is not much fraud, waste, and abuse to go after, so if \nCongress wants to make any cuts in the Food Stamp Program, they have to \ngo after benefits.\n  I am pleased to say that was not an option either in the Senate \nAgriculture Committee or that the Senate wanted to consider.\n  However, not so across the Capitol. The House of Representatives \npassed a reconciliation bill that makes significant cuts to the Food \nStamp Program of approximately $700 million. According to CBO, the Food \nStamp Program cuts contained in the House reconciliation bill would \neliminate food stamp benefits for at least 250,000 individuals. These \nare mainly working families with children and legal immigrants.\n  Right now in the Food Stamp Program, if you are a legal immigrant--\nforget about illegal immigrants; illegal immigrants have no access to \nthe Food Stamp Program. I hear that all the time, but they have no \naccess to it and they cannot get an electronic benefit card. But a \nlegal immigrant must be here 5 years before that person can qualify for \nfood stamps. That is the law right now. Now, they still have to meet \nstandards. In other words, they still have to meet the standards of \nanyone else to be eligible, such as income standards, asset standards, \nand work requirements. They still have to meet these standards. Even if \nthey meet these standards, they still have to wait 5 years.\n  The House extended it to 7 years. These are legal immigrants. These \nare people we want here. What does the sign on the Statue of Liberty \nsay? Give me your tired, your poor. A lot of these people are tired, \nthey are poor, but they are here to build a better life. They are \nworking, they are legal, and their kids are in school here. Yet we want \nto make it even tougher.\n  The second thing they did is they changed the system whereby States \nhave said, Okay, if you qualify for Temporary Assistance for Needy \nFamilies, then you automatically qualify for food stamps. It makes \nsense. In the 1990s we made a change to allow the States to align their \nprograms. If you qualified for Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, \nthen you used to have to go to another office to qualify for food \nstamps. It was twice the paperwork, twice the administrative burdens. \nWe said, Why go through all of that? So we made a change that \nstreamlined the program.\n  The House takes that out. The House bill takes a step backward from \nwelfare reform. We put this in there for welfare reform back in the \n1990s; they take a step backward. We tried to change it so we would \nmove low-income families from welfare to work.\n  One of the provisions was to provide allow TANF recipients to \nautomatically qualify for food stamps. The House now takes that away. \nIt makes no sense. In fact, it will increase the burden on States. They \nwill have to spend more money, and we will probably have to take people \nthat now qualify off the food stamp rolls. These are low-income people \nwho work and make money who now qualify because they qualify for \nTemporary Assistance for Needy Families. Yet these are the very people \nfor whom we want to build a bridge. We want to get them off welfare and \nget them to work. A lot of times, part of that bridge is food stamps \nand making sure families have enough food to eat.\n  So all of the cuts the House made retreat from the bipartisan \nagreements Congress made in recent years to streamline and make the \nFood Stamp Program more effective and to make welfare reform work.\n  When the majority leader makes his motion to instruct conferees, I \nwill be back in the Senate to offer a motion to instruct conferees on \nthe reconciliation conference committee to reject cuts to Federal food \nassistance programs. I might add that we should have a lot of \nbipartisan support. Senator Smith of Oregon and I are joining together \nto offer this amendment to instruct.\n  There was also a letter written by a number of Republican Senators \nrecently asking that we not make cuts in the Food Stamp Program. I hope \nwe can have a strong vote on this. We should have a recorded vote. I \nwill ask for a recorded vote to send a strong signal to the House of \nRepresentatives that the Senate will not accept their food stamp cuts. \nBy voting for this motion to instruct, the Senate can show that it \nstands side by side with working families, that we do not want to \nretreat from welfare reform. We do not want to retreat from the changes \nwe have made to make this program meaningful and effective.\n  I will offer that motion at some point, I hope today--whenever the \nmajority leader makes a motion to instruct the conferees.\n\n\n                                 LIHEAP\n\n  There are a couple of other items on which there will be motions \nmade. There will be a motion offered by Senators Collins and Reed, \nagain, to instruct conferees to add $2.92 billion in funding for the \nLow-Income Home Energy Assistance Program. That is the amount required \nto bring LIHEAP up to its authorized level.\n  The House reconciliation bill provides an additional $1 billion for \nLIHEAP. Unfortunately, because of the way the program works, my home \nstate of Iowa would not receive additional funding under the House \nbill. My State of Iowa gets pretty darn cold, I can tell you. Last \nweekend I was out there, and it was 6 above zero.\n  In contrast, the level of funding provided in the Reed-Collins \namendment provides an additional $24 million for LIHEAP in Iowa, money \nthat I can say is desperately needed.\n  Last weekend when I was out there, I met with some families who have \napplied and have been qualified for LIHEAP. There was one woman with \ntwo children who lives in a rented house. She gets no child support \nfrom her husband. She works full time every day. The kids go to school. \nShe has a low-income job. She qualified for LIHEAP at $319.\n  I mentioned that later on to someone, that I met this person who \nqualified for $319 LIHEAP. This individual said to me: Well, that is \npretty good; that will take care of her heating bills for the month. \nBut it is $319 for the year. A year. For Iowa, that means you have to \nbuy heat in October, November, December, January, February, March, \nApril--6, 7 months. That is $319 to help pay heating for 7 months. This \nindividual thought that was for 1 month. I said: No, no, that is $319 \nfor the year. And the price of natural gas--we heat with natural gas in \nIowa--has gone up 40 percent in the last year. This program is \ndesperately needed.\n  According to the Hawkeye Area Community Assistance Program in \nsoutheast Iowa, LIHEAP funds are likely to run out in mid-January, one \nof the coldest months of the year. Last week, I held a discussion in \nSpencer, IA, to hear firsthand from some citizens. Again, I want to \ntell you, these people are not just concerned about the high cost of \nhome heating; they are in panic.\n  Now, because of a State law, they are not going to have utilities cut \noff. But in order to qualify and pay their bills, they may have to cut \nother necessities, such as medical care, prescription drugs, clothes, \nother things.\n\n[[Page S13493]]\n\n  One of the women I spoke with is on disability. She is on an ``even \npay'' program. This is where you pay the same amount every month so you \ndo not get hit with a big bill in the wintertime. Last year, with \nLIHEAP assistance, she paid 9 percent of her income on heat--9 percent \nfor heat. This year she figures it will be about 13 percent. Her ``even \npay'' monthly bill--get this--last year was $39 a month. This year it \nis $68 a month, a 75-percent increase. This is a person with a \ndisability, living alone, trying to heat her house.\n  For another woman, her even-pay bill was $72 a month last year. This \nyear it is $84 a month. The testimony I listened to from these women is \nbacked up by hard data. According to a statewide Iowa survey, more than \n20 percent of households receiving LIHEAP report going without needed \nmedical care or prescription drugs--1 out of 5. More than 10 percent \nreported going without food in order to pay their heating bill. And I \ncan tell you the numbers are going to skyrocket this winter.\n  Last winter, about 86,000 Iowa households received an average of $317 \nin LIHEAP assistance. Keep in mind that is for the year. Most years, \neveryone who applies gets some level of assistance. But this year we \nare not so certain of that.\n  Community services agencies are being deluged with calls from \npanicked senior citizens and others who simply do not know how they are \ngoing to stay warm. Many have had their utilities cut off and they \ncannot make the past-due payments to get them turned back on. Others \nare being threatened with cutoffs just as we head into winter.\n  Of course, the catch-22 situation most people do not understand is \nthat you cannot qualify for LIHEAP if your gas or electricity has been \ncut off. Let's say you did not make your payments this summer, so they \ndid not connect you back up. You cannot qualify for LIHEAP now.\n  The other thing is a lot of low-income families who live in a small \ntown or rural area, such as I do, heat their home using propane. I have \na propane tank outside my house. That is how we heat our houses in \nsmall towns. Well, when they deliver propane, you pay for the whole \nthing at one time. That is unlike natural gas, for which once you have \nit coming in, they cannot cut you off. If you cannot pay your propane \nbill, you do not get it delivered. That hurts poor people in small \ntowns such as mine. That is another thing we have to remember as to \npeople who live in small towns and communities who heat their homes \nwith propane.\n  We can do better. We need to boost the LIHEAP funding. I hope the \nmotion that will be offered by Senator Collins and Senator Reed to \ninstruct the conferees to add $2.92 billion in funding for LIHEAP will \nagain be supported by an overwhelming majority of the Senate.\n  Mr. President, there is one last one. A motion will be offered by \nSenator Kohl to instruct conferees to reject cuts in the Child Support \nEnforcement Program. Again, in the Senate last month when we debated \nthe reconciliation bill, I offered a sense-of-the-Senate amendment \nopposing the House's drastic plan to gut the successful child support \nprogram--a $4.9 billion cut. The Senate accepted it on a voice vote, \nwhich around here is tantamount to unanimously accepting something.\n  It is not right, it is not ethical, it is not moral to cut a program \nthat gave crucial funds to over 17 million children last year. But the \nbill approved by the House would slash funding for child support \nenforcement efforts by 40 percent over the next 10 years.\n  Again, CBO estimates that as a result of these cuts, more than $24 \nbillion in delinquent payments will go uncollected in the next 10 \nyears. This is money that goes directly to feed and clothe children. \nThe biggest negative impacts will be felt by children living in poverty \nand children in low-income households. In my home State of Iowa, it is \nestimated that collections will drop by more than a third in the first \nyear.\n  Now, keep in mind, this is not Government money going out for child \nsupport. This is the Government money we send out to States to help \nthem collect child support from deadbeat dads. I think that is \nsomething we all support. Yet if you take away the funding that helps \nthem go out and collect it, CBO estimates $24 billion will go \nuncollected in the next 10 years.\n  For families in poverty who receive child support, those payments \naccount for an average of 30 percent of their income.\n  Why is the House doing this? Why would the House want to pull the rug \nout from underneath our efforts to collect child support payments--\nchild support payments that benefit the most vulnerable, disadvantaged, \nneglected children in our society? Well, they are doing it in order to \nmake room for yet another $60 billion in tax cuts--tax cuts that \noverwhelmingly benefit our wealthiest citizens.\n  Child support payments helped lift more than 1 million Americans out \nof poverty in 2002. As a result of what the House did, many of these \npeople--and these are mostly children--will go back into poverty. This \nis cruel. It is counterproductive. Talk about penny wise and pound \nfoolish. Because you take this away, these families will fall back into \npoverty. They then will end up on food stamps, Medicaid, TANF, \nTemporary Assistance for Needy Families, other forms of public \nassistance--unless you cut those, too. And guess what. The House bill \ncuts food stamps, cuts Medicaid, disconnects the food stamps from the \nTANF program. Think about what the House is doing here.\n  According to the Office of Management and Budget, for every $1 we \nspend on child support, $4.38 is recovered for families in child \nsupport payments. Not a bad deal. The President even praised this \nprogram.\n  Reforms have made the program effective. Since 1996, there has been \nan 82-percent increase in collections. With the House cut, deadbeat \nparents get off, kids suffer, and the goal of self-sufficiency becomes \nless attainable for more custodial parents trying to stay off of \nwelfare.\n  Cutting this program is outrageous. I urge my colleagues again to \nsend a loud and clear message to the House and the American people that \nthe Senate will not accept these cuts in the Child Support Enforcement \nProgram.\n  Again, I wanted to talk about those three. Now I will offer one \nmotion with Senator Smith. Senator Kohl is going to offer another. \nSenator Reed of Rhode Island and Senator Collins will be offering \nanother.\n  Last evening, we met, conferees met on the Labor, Health and Human \nServices, Education appropriations bill. As you know, the Senate passed \ntheir version. The conference was abysmal in that the House insisted on \nall their provisions. It went back to the House. The House defeated it. \nSo we went back to conference again last night.\n  I pointed out that there are three avenues of cuts that are going to \nhurt low-income families right before Christmas, at least Christmas to \nthose of us who are of the Christian faith. Think about what is \nhappening right before Christmas.\n  We are going to cut programs for some of the most vulnerable of our \ncitizens in the Labor-HHS appropriations bill. We are cutting Head \nStart. We are cutting assistance programs in health. We are cutting \nprograms such as LIHEAP that give people a little hope that they will \nhave enough money to pay their fuel bills. We have all these cuts \ncoming in the Labor-HHS bill.\n  But that is not the end of it. We now have this reconciliation bill \nthat is going to cut the very things I talked about--the child support \nenforcement program, Medicaid, food stamp cuts. So we are going to \nwhack the poor right before Christmas with the Labor-HHS-Education \nappropriations bill. We give them another backhand in the \nreconciliation bill, if we take what the House has. And then there is \none more coming. It is my understanding that the DOD appropriations \nbill will have a 1-percent across-the-board cut in these discretionary \nprograms, another cut to the most vulnerable of our citizens.\n  So right before Christmas, we say to the poor in this country, to the \nlow-income families working and struggling to pay their heating bills, \nkeep their families together, trying to make it through the winter: \nHang your stockings. And guess what this Congress is going to put in \nthem. Three lumps of coal.\n  That is what we are doing to the poor. I can't believe we are doing \nthis right before Christmas. Yet right before Christmas, we are going \nto try to enact a tax cut of which over 50 percent goes to people \nmaking over $1 million. If my figures are right, I think\n\n[[Page S13494]]\n\nless than 7 percent of the money in the tax cuts goes to people making \nless than $50,000 a year. Ninety percent goes to people making over \n$100,000 a year. The most vulnerable people work for the minimum wage, \npeople who are making 8 bucks an hour. Guess what that is a year? That \nis 16,000 bucks a year. Try feeding two or three kids on that.\n  I don't understand how we can do this at this time of year. I don't \nunderstand how we can do it at any time of year. But you would think \nnow our consciences would bother us in making these kinds of cuts. It \nis almost as if this Congress is trying to rewrite Charles Dickens' \n``Christmas Carol.'' Remember Scrooge in the ``Christmas Carol'' has a \nchange of heart at the end and sees clearly what the spirit of \nChristmas is all about. It is as if this Congress is rewriting Charles \nDickens' tale and Scrooge does not have a change of heart right before \nChristmas. It is as if this Congress, if we proceed down this path--and \nit looks as though that is where we are headed--truly will be the \nScrooge who is stealing the food from young kids, taking away hope that \nlow-income families have, destroying the hope a lot of low-income \nfamilies have. All for more tax cuts for some of the most privileged \npeople.\n  We all have friends, a lot of friends who make a lot of money. I \ndon't hear them clamoring for these tax cuts. In fact, what I hear them \nsaying is: Why are you doing this? Why don't you take care of the \nbusiness of the country? Why don't you do something about education and \nhealth care and getting people out of poverty and getting people jobs \nand getting people work? That would be a better use than giving the \nrich a few more dollars with which to buy another diamond or a \nwristwatch that costs $25,000. I saw a wristwatch advertised in the \npaper for $25,000. Why would anyone buy a wristwatch for $25,000. All \nit does is tell the time.\n  I have a watch. It might have cost me about 75 bucks. I have had it \nfor 10 years. I had it repaired once.\n  I don't mind if people who have a lot of money want to spend it that \nway. But why are we cutting the taxes for these people and then, to \nmake it up, cutting food stamps? It would be one thing if you could say \nwith a straight face: We have to do it to cut the deficit. But guess \nwhat. Under this reconciliation bill the deficit goes up, not down. So \nwith the tax cut we get a bigger deficit. And then we are still cutting \nfood stamps, Medicaid, LIHEAP, and a number of other programs that are \nout there that help low-income people.\n  I hope at this time of year especially we will think long and hard \nabout what we are doing around here and that we will come to our \nsenses. The Senate has acted well. We acted in a good, bipartisan \nfashion to do these things. I hope tomorrow when we vote on the various \nmotions to instruct, we will have that same bipartisan approach as we \nhad before. Hopefully, there will be a new spirit across the Capitol in \nthat House Members will agree to go along with the Senate provisions \nand not cut food stamps and LIHEAP and the child support enforcement \nprogram, among a number of others.\n  We await the majority leader making his motion. Until that point, I \nyield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I come to the floor to advise the American \npublic. We just heard a very eloquent talk by the Senator from Iowa on \nthe motion he plans to offer to instruct conferees on food stamps, but \nI think it is very important that the American people recognize that 1 \nout of every 19 people in this country who receive food stamps receive \nthem illegally. In other words, they are not eligible.\n  In this motion to instruct, it states in No. 5:\n\n       The Food Stamp Program operates efficiently and effectively \n     with its error rate at an all-time low.\n\n  It is at an all-time low. It is 6.64 percent. In other words, 1 out \nof 14 who are getting food stamps have an error associated with what \nthey are receiving, or 1 out of 15 or 16. But in terms of overpayments, \n5.5 percent of the money spent, $1.6 billion, is spent on food stamps \nto people who don't qualify.\n  An easy way for us to control food stamps is to make the error rate \nless--in other words, to do a better job--instead of to gloss over and \nsay we don't have a problem here and it is running efficiently and \neffectively. Anybody else in their own personal budget, if they were \npaying out 5.5 percent more than what they should be, would be quick to \nchange that.\n  The Federal financial management oversight subcommittee which I chair \nhad a hearing this year. It is true, they have reduced the error rate \nsome. But a 6.9-percent overall error rate is unacceptable, and a 5.5-\npercent overpayment rate is highly unacceptable. In a time of \ntremendous budget deficits, in a time of war, and a time of natural \ndisasters that have hit us greater than we have ever seen, accepting \n5.5 percent and saying we can't do better is unacceptable. It is \nunacceptable by everybody who lives by a budget out there who is an \nAmerican citizen. For us to have a motion to instruct to say that is \ngood, that is effective, that is efficient, it is not the truth.\n  We need to be cognizant of the fact that we have a long way to go to \nhelp those people who need us with food but at the same time to not \nhelp those people who are cheating the system, who are squandering \nmoney that would otherwise go to people who have needs when those \npeople who don't have needs are stealing from the system. I think it is \nimportant for the record to reflect that.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, this budget is about choices. We in \nCongress can choose to protect Medicaid, the Federal safety net for \nover 50 million Americans, by supporting the Baucus motion to instruct.\n  Or we can turn our backs on the millions of working families who \nwould otherwise be uninsured without the Federal guarantee of Medicaid \nbenefits by giving States the green light to charge more in monthly \npremiums than are charged in monthly premiums under Medicare; by \nallowing Medicaid cost-sharing that can grow six times faster than \nwages; by permitting States to provide fewer Medicaid benefits to \nrecipients in rural areas than those offered to recipients in urban \nareas; and by asking hospitals, pharmacists, and other health care \nproviders to continue to participate in the Medicaid program even if \nthey cannot cover their costs.\n  If the Senate recedes to the House on Medicaid, then we will begin to \nundo one of the most important social programs of our time. And people \nand health care providers in our respective States will suffer greatly. \nIn West Virginia, nearly 20 percent of our State's population--over \n350,000 people--depend on Medicaid for access to health care.\n  Not only is it unfair to consider such draconian changes to the \nMedicaid Program in the context of meeting an arbitrary budget number, \nit is also unwarranted.\n  Some of my colleagues have argued that Congress must reduce spending \nin Medicaid in order to decrease the Federal deficit. I would remind my \ncolleagues that this budget does not decrease the Federal deficit. \nInstead, this budget could increase the Federal deficit by $10 to $20 \nbillion over the next 5 years. And that is not even considering the \ncost of adding more tax cuts.\n  Even more important is the fact that there are other options on the \ntable besides Medicaid that provide more than enough savings to meet \nthe $10 billion budget target set by Congress. Reducing Medicare \noverpayments to HMOs saves nearly $12 billion over 5 years alone.\n  America has a moral obligation to take care of its most vulnerable \ncitizens. Programs that help low-income working families improve their \nlot in life should be the last resort when it comes to balancing the \nbudget.\n  Not supporting this motion to instruct fails our Nation's pregnant \nwomen, children, the elderly, and the disabled.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this motion to instruct. The quality \nof life of 50 million Americans depends, on it.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/12/13/senate-section/article/S13495-1", "month": "12", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13495-S13496]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S13495]]\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                       Corporal Jonathan F. Blair\n\n  Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, I rise today with a heavy heart and deep \nsense of gratitude to honor the life of a brave young man from Fort \nWayne. Jonathan Blair, 21 years old, died on November 19 in Bayji, Iraq \nwhen a roadside bomb exploded near his vehicle during a combat \noperation. With his entire life before him, Jonathan risked everything \nto fight for the values Americans hold close to our hearts, in a land \nhalfway around the world.\n  Remembered for his thoughtfulness and patriotism, Jonathan joined the \nArmy shortly after graduating from Elmhurst High School in 2002. The \nattacks of September 11 inspired him to consider military service, but \nJonathan also saw the military as a gateway to further knowledge and a \npotential ticket to a higher education. One of his high school teachers \nfondly recounted to the Fort Wayne Journal Gazette that Jonathan was a \npatriotic and ``cerebral'' student who would contemplate fully any \nanswer in class. Another teacher remembered, ``Jonathan challenged you \nas a teacher to make him better as a student; he was just a really \ninteresting kid.''\n  Jonathan was killed while serving his country in Operation Iraqi \nFreedom. He was a member of the 1st Battalion, 187th Infantry Regiment, \n3rd Brigade Combat Team of the 101st Airborne Division based at Fort \nCampbell, KY.\n  Today, I join Jonathan's family and friends in mourning his death. \nWhile we struggle to bear our sorrow over this loss, we can also take \npride in the example he set, bravely fighting to make the world a safer \nplace. It is his courage and strength of character that people will \nremember when they think of Jonathan, a memory that will burn brightly \nduring these continuing days of conflict and grief.\n  Jonathan was known for his dedication to his family and his love of \ncountry. Today and always, Jonathan will be remembered by family \nmembers, friends, and fellow Hoosiers as a true American hero, and we \nhonor the sacrifice he made while dutifully serving his country.\n  As I search for words to do justice in honoring Jonathan's sacrifice, \nI am reminded of President Lincoln's remarks as he addressed the \nfamilies of the fallen soldiers in Gettysburg: ``We cannot dedicate, we \ncannot consecrate, we cannot hallow this ground. The brave men, living \nand dead, who struggled here, have consecrated it, far above our poor \npower to add or detract. The world will little note nor long remember \nwhat we say here, but it can never forget what they did here.'' This \nstatement is just as true today as it was nearly 150 years ago, as I am \ncertain that the impact of Jonathan's actions will live on far longer \nthat any record of these words.\n  It is my sad duty to enter the name of Jonathan Blair in the official \nrecord of the U.S. Senate for his service to this country and for his \nprofound commitment to freedom, democracy, and peace. When I think \nabout this just cause in which we are engaged and the unfortunate pain \nthat comes with the loss of our heroes, I hope that families like \nJonathan's can find comfort in the words of the prophet Isaiah, who \nsaid, ``He will swallow up death in victory; and the Lord God will wipe \naway tears from off all faces.''\n  May God grant strength and peace to those who mourn, and may God be \nwith all of you, as I know He is with Jonathan.\n\n\n        Remembering Army Sergeant First Class Michael C. Parrott\n\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I rise to reflect for a moment on the \nservice and life of SFC Michael Parrott of Tinmath, CO. Sergeant First \nClass Parrott was tragically killed last month while serving this \nNation in Balad, Iraq. Today would have been Sergeant First Class \nParrott's 50th birthday.\n  Mike Parrott was a native of Canton, NC, where he graduated from \nPisgah High School in 1974 and went on to earn a degree from the \nUniversity of North Carolina at Asheville. His 6-foot-tall frame made \nhim hard to miss in a crowd, but it was his easy smile and brown eyes \nthat first drew the attention of his wife, Meg, when she was a student \nat UNC-Asheville almost two decades ago. Mike Parrott was honest, \nopinionated, and unafraid to speak his mind. His wife, Meg, knew how \nunique Mike was when she discovered that he kept Voltaire in his \nbathroom. They celebrated their 19th wedding anniversary last month.\n  Mike Parrott was an avid fan of the outdoors and could often be found \nbiking, camping and hiking, activities he and Meg often enjoyed \ntogether. Mike rode his bike to and from work, and made it a point to \nrun every day. In fact, this past year, on the day of the Leadville \nMarathon, Sergeant First Class Parrott laced up his running shoes and \nran 26.2 miles in the blazing Iraqi heat.\n  Sergeant First Class Parrott was a true American patriot. Sergeant \nFirst Class Parrott served in this Nation's armed forces for more than \n15 years in active and reserve duties. Three years ago, he signed up \nfor the National Guard, looking to reach his 20 years of service. He \nwas a member of the 115th Field Artillery Brigade in Cheyenne and was \non loan to the 28th Infantry of the Pennsylvania Army National Guard at \nthe time of his death. He had already completed a year's tour in Kuwait \nwith his Wyoming unit but signed up as a loaner to return to Iraq.\n  Sergeant First Class Parrott was an inspiring leader for the men who \nserved under him, some less than half his age. They looked up to his \nleadership and calm, affectionately calling him ``The Old Man.'' \nSergeant First Class Parrott believed that he had a mission to help \nyounger soldiers. He looked forward to being a mentor.\n  Sergeant First Class Parrott and his wife both disagreed with U.S. \npolicy in Iraq, but he did not shrink from his duties. Instead, he rose \nhonorably to serve his Nation in the time it called for his aid.\n  Mr. President, what becomes clear upon reflection is that SFC Mike \nParrot loved this Nation. He loved its spirit of dissent and \ndiscussion. He loved its wide open spaces and natural wonders. He loved \nit for providing him the opportunity to be with his wife and family, \nhis friends of so many years that gave him so much. He was the \nembodiment of Voltaire's remark: ``I may disagree with what you have to \nsay, but I shall defend, to the death, your right to say it.''\n  To the family of SFC Mike Parrott, including his wife Meg Corwin and \nhis mother Suzanne Parrott, know that the thoughts and prayers of an \nentire Nation are with you today. We are grateful for Mike's courageous \nservice to the people of America and Iraq. The values he lived by will \nremain far beyond our time on this Earth, a humble legacy that will \nlive on in every life he touched.\n\n\n               a fallen hero: army sergeant luis r. reyes\n\n  Mr. President, I also wish to reflect on a life of promise taken too \nsoon from us--Army Sergeant Luis Reyes of my home State of Colorado.\n  Sergeant Luis Reyes was 26 years old, a member of the 947th Engineer \nCompany of the Colorado National Guard based out of Durango. He was \nkilled in Kuwait while on his way to Iraq.\n  A native of Denver, Luis was a husband of 6 years to his wife, \nChristina, and a father of two: Sienna and Nikko. Luis was devoted to \nhis family and community, a man known for helping his friends and \nneighbors with repair jobs and who loved to work on his truck.\n  After graduating Montbello High School in Denver in 1997, Luis \nenlisted with the Army and married Christina after finishing basic \ntraining. He had just re-enlisted for another 3-year term with the Army \nand in one of his last phone calls home marveled to his wife about his \nservice in the Middle East, telling her it was a ``whole other world.''\n  When Sergeant Reyes was killed, his unit was on its way to help Iraq \nwith the complicated task of rebuilding its infrastructure and roads. \nIt was an important mission, which will allow the far-flung villages of \nIraq to connect once more with each other and foster the blessings of \nliberty.\n  A friend of Sergeant Reyes remembered him as a man who would go \n``above and beyond'' the call of duty. With his service to this Nation, \nLuis Reyes did just that. He could have stayed with his young family in \nthe safe confines of Aurora. But he had a passion for serving this \nNation and accepted great risk on behalf of all of us.\n  Isaiah 25:8 teaches us, ``The Lord will swallow up death in victory; \nand the\n\n[[Page S13496]]\n\nLord will wipe away tears from off all faces.'' To Sergeant Reyes's \nwife, Christina, and his two young children, his mother Tomasa and his \nbrother Roger, the thoughts and prayers of an entire Nation go with you \nduring this difficult time. Luis served this Nation with honor and \ndistinction and has left all of us forever in his debt. For that, we \nall offer our humble thanks.\n\n\n                 tribute to specialist gregory l. tull\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise today to honor one of our \ncountry's bravest, SPC Gregory L. Tull of Pocohontas, IA. Specialist \nTull sadly died November 25, 2005, after an improvised explosive device \ndetonated near his Humvee in Al Anbar province in Iraq. Specialist Tull \nserved with the Iowa Army National Guard's 1st Battalion, 194th Field \nArtillery based in Storm Lake, IA. He was only 20 years old.\n  I ask that all Americans join me in remembering and honoring \nSpecialist Tull. He was an upstanding and courageous soldier who fell \nfar before his time. Our country has survived these many years due to \nthe brave men and women who have served in our Armed Forces, and it \ngreatly saddens me to announce that another young man has made the \nultimate sacrifice for our country and for the freedom of Iraq.\n  LTC Gregory Hapgood of the Iowa Army National Guard remembered that \nSpecialist Tull was ``a good guy that didn't shrink from \nresponsibility,'' and was someone who ``wanted in on the action.'' \nDuring this crucial time in America's history, we should all remember \nGreg Tull's courage and dedication to his country.\n  We should also stand with Specialist Tull's parents, Eileen and Gary, \nand his brother, Bryan, and all his family in their time of grief. Our \nthoughts and prayers also go out to Gregory's friends, classmates, and \nall others who were lucky enough to know him. Greg Tull did not die in \nvain, but rather gave his life defending America and promoting freedom \naround the world. He will be sorely missed but also fondly remembered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/12/13/senate-section/article/S13496-1", "month": "12", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13496]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             WORLD AIDS DAY\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, December 1, was World AIDS Day, and I \nwanted to take this time to both acknowledge the good work that is done \naround world to prevent and treat this disease and to acknowledge the \nneed is still great around the world and in our own country to fund \nprevention, treatment, and support.\n  AIDS kills 3 million people each year, and 13,500 people are newly \ninfected each day. AIDS has already left 15 million orphans in its \nwake. The theme of World AIDS Day 2005 was ``Keeping the Promise.'' To \ndate, the United States has led the world in contributions to the \nGlobal Fund, providing one-third of all contributions. However, the \nstatistics tell us that while we have come far, we still have far to go \nin preventing this tragic disease, including here at home.\n  We have experienced many medical miracles in the form of drugs that \nhelp people diagnosed with HIV/AIDS live healthier longer. Yet, we seem \nto be able to fund less and less of the services that help individuals \nstay healthy and maintain the structure of their lives.\n  I was recently visited by constituents who were either HIV positive \nor had full-blown AIDS. They told many moving stories about how their \nlives had been made better by programs that help them get health \nservices, pay for their drugs, rent and provide other support services. \nMany of these programs are through the Ryan White Act.\n  The unmet need grows daily. For example, in Portland, the Russell \nStreet Dental Clinic provides about $60,000 worth of services to HIV \npatients each month compared with about $15,000 a month 3 years ago. In \n2003, a study was released that documented the service gaps in Oregon. \nThe list of services for which there is not enough funding to meet the \nneed is long and includes dental care, help with legal affairs, \ncounseling, housing and help in paying rent or utilities, and \ntransportation.\n  Despite an increased number of people living with HIV/AIDS, Ryan \nWhite funding has decreased. Many of the programs my constituents tell \nme help them are through Title I of the Ryan White Act. This title \nprovides the vital core services of Medical care, mental health and \nsubstance abuse treatment, dental care, and case management.\n  The Oregon AIDS Drug Assistance Program has had to change eligibility \nand take other steps to limit enrollment because of budget constraints. \nThis program helps individuals with their drug costs. I view it as a \nwise investment because it helps people stay healthier, working, and \nproductive.\n  What I have heard from my constituents is sheer frustration that the \nprograms they know work are yet again on the chopping block. I share \ntheir frustration. An investment in health care, whether abroad or in \nour own country, an investment in a community and in making that \ncommunity healthier. I hope Congress keeps this in mind as we face \ndifficult decisions about funding in the future.\n  I ask unanimous consent that my remarks be printed in the Record.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/12/13/senate-section/article/S13496-2", "month": "12", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13496]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE FOR PAKISTAN\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, this past year, the world has witnessed \nmultiple natural disasters including the tsunami in South Asia and \nHurricane Katrina in the gulf coast. Most recently, the devastating \nearthquake that struck northern Pakistan in early October has been \nequally catastrophic. More than 73,000 people were killed in the \nimmediate aftermath, while tens of thousands more were wounded. Just as \ntroubling, millions more have been left homeless having lost their \nlife's possessions in this tragic event.\n  As Pakistan approaches the bitter winter months, many are still \nwithout adequate shelter. The United Nations estimates that at least \n350,000 will remain in the mountainous regions of Pakistan through the \nwinter and will require sufficient food and materials to winterize \ntheir tents in order to survive. Exacerbating the situation is the \nrecent cancellation of helicopter sorties that deliver humanitarian \nrelief due to deteriorating weather conditions. In addition, UNICEF is \nconducting a massive immunization campaign to vaccinate individuals \nfrom the measles following an outbreak at a camp outside of \nMuzaffarabad in early December. For all these reasons, it imperative \nthat countries honor their commitments to this ravaged country to \nensure humanitarian relief is provided to the victims of this tragedy.\n  To date, the international community and private industries have \npledged aid for relief an reconstruction, and the United States has led \nthe effort. After recognizing that our original pledge of $50 million \nwould be inadequate to assist the victims, the United States \nsubstantially increased the amount of aid to Pakistan by pledging a \ntotal of $510 million.\n  In addition, the United States has provided rescue teams and aircraft \nto assist in locating victims in remote areas. The U.S. military has \nhelped deliver humanitarian supplies, as well as evacuating casualties \nfrom the region. Currently a Mobile Army Surgical Hospital, MASH, unit \nhas been established in the most devastated parts of the country to \nperform urgent surgery and attend to less critical patients.\n  While I applaud these efforts, we should remember that Pakistan has \nbeen a critical ally in the war on terror. Unfortunately, our image in \nthe Muslim world has been distorted though propaganda and \nmisperceptions of America's intent in the Middle East. Humanitarian aid \ncan assist in dispelling these myths and will clearly demonstrate that \nthe American people are deeply compassionate toward all those in need.\n  With the upcoming winter months, it will be vital that the \ninternational community continue to honor the commitments it has made \nto Pakistan. I believe that the United States should lead these \nefforts. We have a moral obligation to reach out and assist those who \nare so desperately in need, and I look forward to working with my \ncolleagues to ensure the victims of this earthquake receive adequate \nhumanitarian assistance.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/12/13/senate-section/article/S13496-3", "month": "12", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13496-S13497]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    ALLOWING A CONTINUING FRIENDSHIP\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the future of Air \nForce TSgt. Jamie Dana and her working military dog Rex.\n\n[[Page S13497]]\n\n  When our Nation's leaders called thousands of men and women in \nuniform to liberate Iraq from its most brutal dictator, Technical \nSergeant Dana was among those brave citizens for whom the duty to her \ncountry comes before all other luxuries. Technical Sergeant Dana joined \nthe Air Force in 1998 and volunteered to serve in Iraq. Her assignment \nincluded supporting Army personnel by clearing vehicles at checkpoints \nand searching buildings for booby traps and explosives. Jamie was never \nalone while performing her duties in Iraq. She was accompanied by a \nworking military dog, Rex, a 5-year-old German shepherd. The duo had \ntrained together in the military fo 3 years and deployed as a team \nfirst to Pakistan and then Iraq.\n  Last June, after completing another mission, Technical Sergeant Dana \nand Rex were traveling in an armored humvee when a roadside bomb \nexploded under her seat. She suffered severe wounds resulting in \nmassive internal bleeding that required 19 blood transfusions. ``The \nhelicopter ride was the scariest 45 minutes of my life,'' remembers \nMajor Paul Morton, a member of the medical trauma team who helped save \nJamie's life.\n  Even when facing death, Technical Sergeant Dana never stopped \nthinking about her friend and comrade Rex. While recuperating from the \ninjuries she suffered in Iraq, Rex has always been in Jamie's prayers. \nAlthough her future in the Armed Forces remains uncertain to this day, \nDana never questions her decision to go to war. As she stated in a \nrecent interview, ``I had begged for it. I wanted to deploy. You want \nto feel like you're a part of it.''\n  After her military duty is over, Technical Sergeant Dana plans to \nbecome a different kind of vet--a veterinarian, a profession that I \nadmire. Dana asked the Air Force for permission to adopt her beloved \nfriend, and I commend the leadership of the Air Force and Senator \nWarner for their efforts to find a legislative solution to Jamie's \nrequest. I fully support the inclusion of this solution in the Defense \nauthorization conference report. The work of our Nation's military and \npolitical leaders demonstrates their willingness to express our humble \ngratitude to those who proudly wear our Nation's uniform and endanger \ntheir lives to protect the freedom that we often take for granted. \nJamie's story traveled thousands of miles and warmed the hearts of her \nfellow Americans, as well as political and military leaders.\n  A simple act of Congress will allow Technical Sergeant Dana be \nreunited with Rex. Both Jamie and Rex gave their best in the fight to \nprotect the ideals of liberty and courageously participated in the \nspread of democracy across the globe. The least this country can do to \nhonor their service is to allow this friendship to continue.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/12/13/senate-section/article/S13497-1", "month": "12", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13497]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            STOLEN VALOR ACT\n\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, today, I join my colleagues, Senators \nConrad, Vitter, Salazar, Nelson, Johnson, Chambliss, Thune, Hagel, \nIsakson, Lautenberg, Dole, and Stevens, in cosponsoring S. 1998, the \nStolen Valor Act of 2005.\n  During this Christmas season, our forces are deployed around the \nworld, and many serve in hostile locations. Our service men and women \ncontinue to make great sacrifices abroad to ensure our safety here at \nhome. It is our duty to recognize and honor that sacrifice and heroism. \nUnfortunately, some civilians have created elaborate lies to claim some \nof this honor as their own.\n  I am disturbed by stories of these despicable frauds who have tried \nto falsify heroic military records. These people wear medals that they \ndid not earn, and claim honors which they do not deserve. This type of \nlie strikes at the very heart of the honor of our military and our \nNation.\n  We must act now to protect the reputation of our military heroes with \nthe full force of law. Those who seek to steal recognition that they \nhave not earned must be held accountable and brought to justice. The \nStolen Valor Act of 2005 does just that by enhancing penalties for \nmaking false claims in regard to personal medals awarded for combat \naction and valor, such as the Purple Heart, Distinguished Service \nCross, Navy Cross, Air Force Cross, Silver Star, or Congressional Medal \nof Honor. This law will allow law enforcement officials to prosecute \nindividuals who falsely claim to be recipients of these awards, and \nperpetrators may receive a sentence of up to 1 year as a result.\n  As a veteran, I will always seek to protect the honored place of our \nmilitary heroes. I cherish the sacrifices of all veterans, and I will \ncontinue to do everything in my power to support and protect their \ninterests. I look forward to working with my Senate colleagues to pass \nthis important piece of legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/12/13/senate-section/article/S13497-2", "month": "12", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13497]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        REPUBLICAN JEWISH COALITION AD SUPPORTING WAR ON TERROR\n\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, Freedom is Worth Fighting For. That is \nthe headline of a full page advertisement today in The New York Times. \nI was proud to add my name to this strong statement in support of our \ntroops and our President in fighting the war on terror. The ad is \nsponsored by the Republican Jewish Coalition, a grassroots organization \nbased in Washington, DC, with five full-time offices, 41 chapters, and \nover 20,000 members across our Nation.\n  The ad takes strong exception to a resolution approved last month by \nabout 2,000 members of the Union for Reform Judaism--URJ--at a \nconvention in Houston. The URJ resolution said, ``American Jews, and \nall Americans, are profoundly critical of this war and they want this \nadministration to tell us how and when it will bring our troops home,'' \nand called the Iraq war ``unjust.'' The resolution reversed a 2002 URJ \nendorsement of the war and, according to news accounts, was adopted \nwith very limited debate and only one person speaking against it.\n  As the Republican Jewish Coalition ad states, the URJ statement that \nAmerican Jews oppose President Bush on Iraq is misleading and wrong. \nThe URJ does not speak for me. Nor does it speak for all reform Jews or \nfor the American Jewish community.\n  The Republican Jewish Coalition ad carries the signatures of 180 \nleaders and prominent figures in the Jewish community. In addition to \nmy name, among those signing the newspaper ad are my colleague in the \nother body Representative Eric Cantor of Virginia, Hawaii Governor \nLinda Lingle, and two former chairmen of the Conference of Presidents \nof Major American Jewish Organizations, James Tisch and Kenneth \nBialkin. Other signers include rabbis and cantors; as well as State and \nlocal elected officials.\n  The Republican Jewish Coalition ad contains several other important \nmessages. It notes that we support the President and the war on terror. \nWe stand behind our troops and their mission of creating a safe, \ndemocratic Iraq. This mission is vital, says the ad, not only for the \ncontinuing fight against terrorism and the stability of the Middle \nEast, but also for making the world a safer place for our children. I \nbelieve this message of support is particularly important as the Iraqi \npeople prepare to vote for a permanent government later this week.\n  We can never surrender to terrorism. Those who attacked us on \nSeptember 11, 2001, will not hesitate to do so again if given the \nopportunity. We dare not encourage them by weakness and vacillation in \nour unrelenting war on terror.\n  I commend the Republican Jewish Coalition for its leadership on this \nvital issue. I am proud to stand with them in defense of freedom.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/12/13/senate-section/article/S13497-3", "month": "12", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13497-S13498]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n   CALIFORNIA HIGHWAY PATROL OFFICER DAVID MARIN ROMERO: IN MEMORIAM\n\n Mrs. BOXER.

Officer David Marin Romero \nspent 23 years with the California Highway Patrol, providing the \ncitizens of California with safety and service. On September 23, 2005, \nwhile on motor patrol in the city of Industry, Officer Romero was \nstruck and killed by a driver suspected to be under the influence of a \ncontrolled substance.\n\n[[Page S13498]]\n\n  The California Highway Patrol was Officer Romero's passion. He began \nhis career with the California Highway Patrol at the Riverside Station \nnear his home, and a year later he transferred to the Sante Fe Springs \nStation, near his childhood community. Romero served the remainder of \nhis career in Santa Fe Springs, giving back to his community. He loved \nriding his motorcycle and combined this with his passion for law \nenforcement to become a very successful motorcycle officer. Officer \nRomero's colleagues shall always remember his infectious grin, \npractical jokes, and commitment to his job.\n  Officer Romero was a devoted family man. He is survived by his wife \nSandra and children, Austin, Windsor, David, Victor, and Vanessa. When \nhe was not on duty, Officer Romero enjoyed spending time with his \nfamily, riding dirt bikes, and coaching his children's sports teams. \nOfficer David Marin Romero served the State of California honorably and \nconscientiously, and fulfilled his oath as an officer of the law. \nOfficer Romero gave his life while assisting those in peril or \ndistress.

Mr. President, I rise to honor the memory of the \nlate Nick Bronzan, a tireless champion for young people and seniors in \ncentral California. Mr. Bronzan, a long-time Fresno resident, passed \naway in the peaceful company of his family and loved ones on December \n4, 2005. He was 90 years old.\n  Nick Bronzan, the son of Yugoslavian immigrants, was a true son of \nCalifornia's Central Valley. He was born in Stockton and spent his \nformative years in Manteca. A gifted athlete, Nick excelled as a \nfootball player at Fresno State College. Admired by his coaches and \nteammates for his great leadership qualities, Nick served as the \ncaptain of the 1939 championship team.\n  Upon graduation, Nick taught mathematics and coached a number of \nsports at Kerman High School for 5 years. Nick and his wife Peggy were \nbeloved for all they did in both school and community activities. He \nwould further his passion for helping young people by working for the \nYMCA in Fresno, Tulare, and Culver City. In 1961, Nick became the \ngeneral secretary of the Fresno YMCA, and 7 years later, he was \nappointed as the executive director of the Central Valley YMCA. \nThroughout his professional career, Nick demonstrated an unyielding \ncommitment to positively impact the lives of young people.\n  In his retirement, Nick generously lent his leadership and passion \nfor community service to a number of very worthy and empowering causes. \nAs director of the Fresno Foster Grandparents Program, he spearheaded a \nvolunteer program for seniors to work with children lacking parents and \nfamilies. Nick also began a house-sharing organization to increase and \nenhance older companionship. A powerful and determined advocate for the \nsenior community, Nick successfully convinced businesses to hire senior \nwatchmen to work late shifts. In 1984, he was appointed by then-\nCalifornia Assembly Speaker Willie L. Brown, Jr., to the California \nCommission on Aging and Long-Term Care. Whereas some see their golden \nyears as a time to fade into the background in public life, Nick \nembraced it as an opportunity to continue to lead, to motivate others, \nand to make good things happen.\n  Nick Bronzan devoted 70 of his 90 years to community service. Nick \nselflessly gave his boundless energy, genuine compassion, and precious \nhumanity to uplifting and empowering those who are most often neglected \nin our society: the young and the old. Nick has left behind a legacy of \nservice and the admiration of those whose lives he touched over the \nyears. He will be dearly missed.\n  Nick is survived by his wife Peggy; two daughters, Mary Bronzan and \nAnn McDonald; son, Bruce; five grandchildren and seven great-\ngrandchildren. On December 11, more than 200 members of his family and \nfriends gathered in Fresno to honor a rich life, well lived.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/12/13/senate-section/article/S13498-2", "month": "12", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13498]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO LINWOOD CARTER\n\n Mr. LUGAR.

Carter II began his career with the Congressional Research \nService in 1975 and will be embarking on a well-earned retirement \nshortly after the New Year. As an information research specialist in \nU.S. military and international security affairs, Linwood has responded \nto literally thousands of congressional research requests over the \nyears with a level of professionalism and skill I have seldom \nencountered. In carrying out our responsibilities as legislators, we in \nthe Senate and our colleagues in the House confront a constant need for \naccurate and timely information; often it has been through the efforts \nof Linwood Carter that those responsibilities have been met. His \nmastery of the Library of Congress's resources and the informational \nnooks and crannies in the world of international security affairs has \nbeen unsurpassed.\n  Linwood's dedication to serving the needs of Congress is \nunparalleled. His quiet professional demeanor will be sorely missed by \nMembers, the Congressional Research Service, and by the Library of \nCongress. I would like to extend our thanks to him for his efforts on \nour behalf for the last three decades and to wish him the best in the \nyears to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/12/13/senate-section/article/S13498-3", "month": "12", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13498-S13500]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n COMMENDING THE INDIANA WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION CIVIL SUPPORT TEAM\n\n Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I rise today to commend the \ncertification of the Indiana Civil Support Team and the support it will \nprovide the people of Indiana in the event of an attack utilizing a \nweapon of mass destruction. During this holiday season, many prefer not \nto think of the horrors associated with nuclear, chemical and \nbiological weapons, but the 22 members of the 53rd WMD-CST don't have \nthat luxury. It is their job to help protect Hoosiers should a WMD \nattack occur in Indiana.\n  On November 28, 2005, the Pentagon announced that the Indiana Civil \nSupport Team was fully ready to assist civil authorities in responding \nto a domestic weapon of mass destruction incident. Stationed in \nIndianapolis, the team possesses the requisite skills, training and \nequipment to make a difference in assisting first responders and local \nofficials in the critical moments immediately following a nuclear, \nradiological, chemical or biological event. The CST is able to deploy \nrapidly, assist local first responders in determining the nature of the \nattack, provide medical and technical advice, and pave the way for the \nidentification and arrival of follow-on State and Federal military \nresponse assets.\n  In March 2004, I was pleased to join with Governor Kernan and Senator \nBayh to announce the creation of the WMD-CST in Indiana. The team is \nmade up of highly skilled, full-time members of the Indiana National \nGuard and Reserve who have completed 20 months of intense training. The \nteam is equipped with sophisticated detection, analytical, monitoring, \ncommunications and protective equipment and is under the command and \ncontrol of Governor Mitch Daniels. This signifies another important \nstep to ensuring that our country, the State of Indiana, and our local \ncommunities are prepared should we face terrorists armed with a \nnuclear, chemical or biological weapon.\n  Last week's announcement occurred with little fanfare and negligible \npublic interest. This is unfortunate because the threat posed by the \nproliferation of weapons of mass destruction is the No. 1 national \nsecurity threat facing our country.\n  Chemical weapons were introduced on the battlefields of World War I. \nNuclear weapons ended World War II. Biological weapons were components \nof Cold War arsenals. The 20th century\n\n[[Page S13499]]\n\nwitnessed the brutal use of these powerful weapons by superpowers and \nnation-states. Technological advancements and the proliferation of \nweapons, materials and know-how have made weapons of mass destruction \naccessible to a growing number of national and non-state entities.\n  Despite the threat of nuclear annihilation throughout the standoff \nbetween the United States and the Soviet Union, it was unfathomable \nthat a religious sect could acquire the means to attack a major \nmetropolitan subway system with biological weapons. Yet the Aum \nShinrikyo dispersed anthrax in a Tokyo train station in March 1995. Who \nwould have expected rebels from a remote region of the Caucasus to \nthreaten the detonation of a radiological weapon in a Moscow park? \nChechens did that in November 1995. Even more difficult to believe \nwould have been the notion that the leader of a deadly terrorist \norganization would announce that it was the organization's mission to \nacquire a weapon of mass destruction and use it against the United \nStates. Osama bin Laden did that in December 1998.\n  The use of a weapon of mass destruction in the United States could \ncripple our economy, lead to the fall of our Government, and threaten \nlarge segments of our population with disease and death. During the \nCold War, the Soviet Union had the resources and incentives to \ncarefully guard and maintain these weapons and the scientific knowledge \nthat produced them. But the political collapse of the Moscow government \nwas accompanied by a broader economic collapse throughout the vast \nnation. Not only did Russia and the other successor states have few \nresources for maintaining the Soviet-era arsenal, they could not even \nafford to adequately pay members of the military and scientific \ncommunity who had responsibility for safeguarding the weapons and \nrelated technology. The United States faced the grim possibility that \nweapons previously held in impenetrable Soviet facilities and \ntechnology previously restricted to the minds and computers of elite \nSoviet scientists could be stolen or sold to the highest bidder.\n  As a country, we must acknowledge that the weapons that haunted the \nCold War are now available to irrational and undeterrable foes. While \nthe threat of nuclear attack from the Soviet Union was awesome, it was \ncertain, in that we knew who and where our enemy was and had the \nability to hold them at equal peril. The post-Cold War security \nenvironment is anything but certain. Battles are no longer determined \nby armored divisions taking and holding large swaths of territory, nor \nis strategic competition marked by the building of the biggest bomb or \nthe longest range missiles. A small group of fanatics with the right \ncontacts and resources can obtain and utilize a weapon of mass \ndestruction that could destroy or make unlivable large portions of \nWashington, DC, New York, or Chicago. Similarly, toxins introduced into \nour food supply and distribution systems could spread disease and \npanic.\n  There is no silver bullet to these threats. U.S. security will be \nsecured by small numbers of American Government officials and \ncontractors working with former enemies to eliminate the weapons that \ncould threaten the future of our country. It will also depend on \nAmerican allies working closely and effectively in detecting and \ninterdicting these weapons and local police officers, medical \npersonnel, and guardsmen preparing to respond to a WMD event.\n\n  Since the end of the Cold War, I have worked with colleagues here in \nCongress and the executive branch to defend the American people from \nthese threats. I have often described the best strategy to deal with \nthe WMD threat as ``defense in depth,'' layers of defensive efforts \ndesigned to stop a nuclear, chemical and biological weapon from \nreaching our shores.\n  The first line of defense is prevention and entails activities at the \nsource to stop weapons, materials and know-how from leaving their \ncurrent locations. The second is detection and interdiction and \ninvolves efforts to stem the flow of illicit trade in these weapons and \nmaterials at foreign and domestic borders. The third line of defense is \ncrisis and consequence management and requires domestic preparedness \nshould such threats turn into hostile acts. Individually, each of these \nlines of defense is insufficient; together, they help to form the \npolicy fabric of an integrated defense-in-depth.\n  In 1991, I joined with Senator Sam Nunn and co-authored the Nunn-\nLugar, Cooperative Threat Reduction Program. The program's goal is to \naddress the threat posed by nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons \nat their source. Over the program's first decade and a half it has \nfocused on the threats emanating from the former Soviet Union. When the \nUSSR crumbled, it had the largest nuclear, chemical, and biological \narsenals in the world. The next day, four new independent countries \nemerged from the ashes with nuclear weapons. The totalitarian command \nand control system that secured the chemical and biological weapons \narsenals and infrastructure disappeared. Divisions of ballistic \nmissiles, wings of long-range bombers, and fleets of strategic missile \nsubmarines were left with a bankrupt, dysfunctional master and numerous \nindividuals and organizations seeking to steal them.\n  The Nunn-Lugar Program has made excellent progress in eliminating \nthese threats. Ukraine, Belarus, and Kazakhstan emerged as the third, \nfourth and eighth largest nuclear powers in the world. Today all three \nare nuclear weapons free. More than 6,760 nuclear warheads, each \ncapable of destroying an American city, have been deactivated. Nearly \n2,000 intercontinental ballistic missiles fired from land-based silos, \nmissile submarines, and bombers have been eliminated. Two-thirds of the \nSoviet Union's strategic bomber force and over half of its strategic \nsubmarine force have been destroyed.\n  The Soviet Union also left behind enormous quantities of chemical and \nbiological weapons materials. Russia declared a chemical weapons \nstockpile of 40,000 metric tons stored under questionable. A public \naccounting of the Soviet biological weapons programs has never been \nmade, but it is believed to be the largest and most advanced in the \nworld. Tens of thousands of scientists, engineers, and technicians had \nassisted in the development of the Soviet Union's weapons of mass \ndestruction. With the economies of Russia and other republics in bad \nshape, many of these experts faced unemployment, and concerns existed \nthat they might have an incentive to sell their skills to other \ncountries and terrorist organizations. In each of these cases, Nunn-\nLugar has responded with innovative dismantlement strategy for the \nchemical weapons stocks, elimination of biological weapons production \ncapacity and security upgrades for pathogen collections, and partnering \nwith the private sector to find long-term, peaceful employment for \nformer weapons experts.\n  Nunn-Lugar has also taken on formerly top-secret missions to remove \ndangerous weapons and materials before they could fall into the wrong \nhands. In November 1994, the United States launched Project Sapphire to \nremove 600 kilograms of highly enriched uranium from Kazakhstan and \nship it to Oak Ridge, TN. More recently, Operation Auburn Endeavor was \ncarried out in Georgia to remove HEU and transport it to Scotland. In \nMoldova, the United States removed fourteen MIG-29s capable of \nlaunching nuclear weapons because of efforts by a number of rogue \nstates to acquire them.\n  Despite the progress we made in the former Soviet Union, the skills \nand capabilities of the Nunn-Lugar Program were confined to that \ngeographical region. In 2004, Congress changed that by approving the \nNunn-Lugar Expansion Act which authorized the use of up to $50 million \nin Nunn-Lugar funds for activities outside the former Soviet Union. \nThis authority will be used for the first time in Albania to destroy \nnearly 16 tons of chemical weapons and consideration is being given for \nthe program to work in Libya and countries in Southeast Asia.\n  Earlier this year, I joined with Senator Barack Obama to introduce \nlegislation focused on improving the capabilities of other nations to \ndetect and interdict weapons and materials of mass destruction and \nbolstering, expanding, and improving the second line of defense. The \nUnited States military and intelligence services cannot be everywhere. \nWe need the cooperation and vigilance of like-minded nations if we are \nto successfully detect and interdict WMD threats before they can be \nused against their targets. The United\n\n[[Page S13500]]\n\nStates has constructed the Proliferation Security Initiative, which \nenlisted the participation of other nations in the interdiction of WMD, \nbut it lacks a coordinated effort to improve the capabilities of our \nforeign partners so that they can play a larger and more effective \nrole.\n  The Lugar-Obama bill earmarks 25 percent of the Nonproliferation, \nAntiterrorism, Demining, and Related Programs account to address the \nshortcomings in the State Department's response. If currently law, this \nwould have amounted to $110 million this year. Our bill goes one step \nfurther by calling on the State Department to also commit 25 percent of \nannual foreign military financing amounts to nations for the purchase \nof equipment to improve their ability to detect and interdict WMD. This \nwould represent a potent but flexible tool that could help build a \nnetwork of WMD detection and interdiction capabilities world wide and \ncontribute to U.S. national security.\n  Senator Obama and I recently wrote in the Washington Post that the \nUnited States cannot stop the proliferation of weapons of mass \ndestruction alone. We need the vigilance of like-minded nations, but \nmany of our potential partners lack the capability to detect hidden \nweapons and interdict shipments. We believe our legislation will \naddress this gap.\n  If weapons or materials of mass destruction elude U.S. programmatic \nefforts at the source, at international borders, and our own borders, \nthe next line of defense must take the form of help to local ``first \nresponders''--the firemen, police, emergency management teams, and \nmedical personnel who will be on the front lines.\n  In 1996, I joined my colleagues Sam Nunn and Pete Domenici in \noffering the Nunn-Lugar-Domenici ``Defense Against Weapons of Mass \nDestruction'' legislation. For the first time, it directed the \nprofessionals from the Department of Defense, Department of Energy, \nFederal Bureau of Investigation, Department of Health and Human \nServices, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, and the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency to join into a partnership with local \nemergency professionals in cities across the country, including \nIndianapolis and Fort Wayne.\n  The Pentagon developed plans to supply training and equipment to 120 \ncities across the country. In February 1998, the Nunn-Lugar-Domenici \nDomestic Preparedness Program visited Indianapolis and Marion County. \nSix hundred fifty first responders received training to respond to \nnuclear, chemical and biological incidents. In the years that followed, \nthousands of additional professionals received instruction through the \nprogram's train-the-trainer program. In 2000, Fort Wayne and Allen \nCounty received similar training under the Nunn-Lugar-Domenici Program.\n  The training proved its worth when Indianapolis was confronted with \nthe threat of weapons of mass destruction. Planned Parenthood clinics \nin Indianapolis and New Albany and at St. Matthews Catholic Church and \nelsewhere received anthrax threats. We were relieved that the threats \nwere determined to be false but proud to see the professional manner in \nwhich the city's first responders reacted to the threat and treated the \npotential victims.\n  Over the last 15 years, I have worked closely with both Bush \nadministrations and President Clinton to safeguard the American people \nfrom the threats associated with weapons of mass destruction. We still \nhave much work to do, but the certification of the Indiana WMD-CST \nmakes the people of Indiana safer. I am thankful that in the event of a \nWMD incident, the people of Indiana will not be alone. Local first \nresponders and the WMD-CST will be there to provide assistance and \nexpertise.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/12/13/senate-section/article/S13500-1", "month": "12", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13500]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/12/13/senate-section/article/S13500-2", "month": "12", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13500]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations and withdrawals which were referred to the appropriate \ncommittees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/12/13/senate-section/article/S13500-3", "month": "12", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13500]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    MEASURES PLACED ON THE CALENDAR\n\n  The following bills were read the second time, and placed on the \ncalendar:\n\n       H.R. 4096.

A bill to direct the Consumer Product Safety Commission to \nissue regulations concerning the safety and labeling of portable \ngenerators; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, over the last several years, \nhundreds of Americans have died from the poisonous carbon monoxide \nemitted from portable gas generators. Congress needs to step in and act \nquickly to stop these needless deaths. That is why today I am \nintroducing the Portable Generator Safety Act.\n  As most of us know, portable generators are frequently used to \nprovide electricity during temporary power outages. These generators \nuse fuel-burning engines that give off poisonous carbon monoxide gas in \ntheir exhaust.\n  Every hurricane season, news stories come from Florida and elsewhere \nabout people injured or killed by poisoning caused by portable gas \ngenerators. From 1998 to 2003, the most recent year of official \nstatistics, at least 228 carbon monoxide poisoning deaths were reported \nto the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission. At least one person was \nkilled and seven were hospitalized near Miami, FL, this fall after \nbeing overcome by carbon monoxide fumes. And over the last two \nhurricane seasons in Florida, at least twelve people died from \npoisoning caused by poorly ventilated portable generators. These people \ndied because portable generators are not manufactured to automatically \ncut off when high carbon monoxide rates are reached and because many \nmanufacturers fail to place adequate warning labels on generators.\n  Here is what is especially troubling about these senseless deaths: \nThe Consumer Product Safety Commission has known for years that people \nwere dying from carbon monoxide poisoning at an increasingly alarming \nrate. In study after study, the Commission has recognized the high \ndeath rate from portable generators, and Commission staff has found \nthat portable generator warning labels are often inconsistent, vague, \nand incomplete. Yet the Commission has continued to let the generator \nindustry police itself--without any mandatory Federal safety standards.\n  Enough is enough. Industry self-regulation--which works in some \nsettings--clearly is not working here. Congress must now step in and do \nits part to eliminate these tragic and avoidable deaths.\n  My bill--the Portable Generator Safety Act--takes some simple, \ncommonsense steps. The bill requires the Consumer Product Safety \nCommission to pass tough Federal regulations within 180 days of the \npassage of the bill. The new regulations would have three components.\n  First, every portable generator must have a sensor that automatically \nshuts off the generator before lethal levels of carbon monoxide are \nreached. Other products, such as portable heaters, already contain \nthese types of sensors, which save lives.\n  Second, every portable generator must have clearly written warning \nlabels on the packaging and on the generator itself. These labels must \ninclude a pictogram that visually depicts the safety hazard from carbon \nmonoxide. What I am talking about here is labels that are easy to read \nand can quickly be understood by people who are desperate for power in \nemergency circumstances.\n  Third, every instruction manual that accompanies a portable generator \nmust clearly explain the safety hazards associated with operating the \ngenerator.\n  How many more innocent people must needlessly die before we require \nthe Consumer Product Safety Commission and the portable generator \nindustry to take some sensible, pro-consumer steps? It is my goal that \nafter the next hurricane season, we will not be back here asking these \nsame questions.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2084\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Portable Generator Safety \n     Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Portable generators are frequently used to provide \n     electricity during temporary power outages. These generators \n     use fuel-burning engines that emit carbon monoxide gas in \n     their exhaust.\n       (2) In the last several years, hundreds of people \n     nationwide have been seriously injured or killed due to \n     exposure to carbon monoxide poisoning from portable \n     generators. From 1990 through 2003, 228 carbon monoxide \n     poisoning deaths were reported to the Consumer Product Safety \n     Commission.\n       (3) Virtually all of the serious injuries and deaths due to \n     carbon monoxide from portable generators were preventable. In \n     many instances, consumers simply were unaware of the hazards \n     posed by carbon monoxide.\n       (4) Since at least 1997, a priority of the Consumer Product \n     Safety Commission has been to reduce injuries and deaths \n     resulting from carbon monoxide poisoning. Although the \n     Commission has attempted to work with industry to devise \n     voluntary standards for portable generators, and despite \n     Commission staff statements that voluntary standards were \n     ineffective, the Commission has not promulgated mandatory \n     rules governing safety standards and labeling requirements.\n       (5) The issuance of mandatory safety standards and labeling \n     requirements to warn consumers of the dangers associated with \n     portable generator carbon monoxide would reduce the risk of \n     injury or death.\n\n     SEC. 3. SAFETY STANDARD.\n\n       Not later than 180 days after the enactment of this Act, \n     the Consumer Product Safety Commission shall promulgate \n     regulations, pursuant to section 7 of the Consumer Product \n     Safety Act (15 U.S.C. 2056), requiring, at a minimum, that \n     every portable generator sold to the public for purposes \n     other than resale shall be equipped with an interlock safety \n     device that detects the level of carbon monoxide in the areas \n     surrounding such portable generator and automatically turns \n     off power to the portable generator before the level of \n     carbon monoxide is capable of causing serious bodily injury \n     or death to people.\n\n     SEC. 4.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue code of 1986 to modify \nthe definition of compensation for purposes of determining the limits \non contributions to individual retirement accounts and annuities, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, today I am joined by Senator Smith in \nintroducing the IRA Equity Act of 2005, which would allow the disabled \nand those who temporarily leave the workforce to continue to save for \ntheir retirement.\n  We should be encouraging responsible behavior. When those whose \nincome is slashed because they become disabled--or because they take \ntime off to care for a child, volunteer for a good cause, or go to \nschool--want to continue to save for retirement, that is commendable, \nit is responsible, and we ought to do everything we can to make it \neasier.\n  Yet today, people who are injured and have their income replaced by \nworkers' compensation or Social Security disability suddenly are no \nlonger able to contribute to their IRAs. That's because under current \nlaw, income contributed to IRAs must be ``compensation,'' or earned \nthrough work. Under the current rules, disability income doesn't \nqualify.\n  We know that those who become disabled will still need to support \nthemselves in their old age; we know that they may even need to spend \nmore because of their disability; and we know that because of their \ndisability, they have less earning power and that makes it harder to \nsave. So why in the world would we further penalize them for being \ndisabled by taking away one of the most effective savings tools they \nhave? It just doesn't make any sense.\n  My legislation would fix this problem by allowing wage replacement \nincome, including Social Security disability and workers' compensation, \nto be contributed to IRAs. Additionally, my legislation would permit \nthose who take up to two years away from the workforce to contribute \nearnings from prior years to their IRAs so that they can continue to \nsave. Federal law should not force people to break good savings habits.\n  In the name of fairness and retirement security, I urge my colleagues \nto support this common-sense legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CHAMBLISS:\n  S. 2087. A bill to amend the Immigration and Nationality Act to \nprovide for the employment of foreign agricultural workers, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Agricultural \nEmployment and Workforce Protection Act. My home State of Georgia is \none of the most diversified agricultural producing States east of the \nMississippi. The livelihood of many of my constituents and many \nAmericans across the country depends on the quality of the crop, the \nbounty of the harvest, and the health of the livestock.\n  In drafting this legislation I am introducing today, I was guided by \nfour principles:\n  1. Prevention--if we do not stem the tide of illegal immigrants \ncoming into our country then there is no point in Congress attempting \nto have a positive impact on our immigration policy. Strict enforcement \nof our immigration laws is essential and we should demand no less.\n  2. Protection--the United States has always been a welcoming country \nto immigrants, and many non-immigrants are admitted for temporary \nperiods to perform necessary jobs--particularly in the field of \nagriculture--that employers cannot fill. However, any temporary worker \nprogram must provide adequate protections for American jobs. Employers \nshould not view alien workers as a way to get cheaper labor--it is not \nfair to Americans willing to work hard and looking for a well-paying \njob and it is not fair to the aliens who are exploited by working for \nsub-standard wages.\n  3. Accountability--if Congress, through reform legislation, provides \nemployers with an avenue to obtain legal temporary workers, there \nshould be no tolerance for employers who hire illegal aliens. We all \nknow that many illegal immigrants come to the United States seeking \nemployment. Employers who flaunt the rule of law by hiring illegally \nare hampering our efforts to secure the border by providing incentives \nfor people to illegally come to the United States, and they must be \nheld accountable.\n  4. Compassion--We are a Nation of immigrants and immigrants have made \nmany wonderful contributions to our country--not the least of which is \nhelping ensure there is a stable supply of food in the grocery stores \nfor all Americans. We need to ensure that those workers who come to the \nUnited States on a temporary basis to perform agricultural work are not \nexploited and are treated with fairness and respect. The best way to \nshow compassion for illegal immigrants is to stop illegal immigration.\n  I know the Senate is planning to take up debate on comprehensive \nimmigration reform early next year, and I think it is important that we \nengage in this discussion. The purpose of my legislation is to ensure \nthat reform for the agricultural community is included in whatever \nreforms Congress considers. The agricultural sector of our economy has \nbeen historically plagued by illegal immigration. We already have an \navenue for agricultural employers to obtain legal temporary workers--\nthe H-2A program. However, many agricultural employers do not use the \nprogram because its bureaucracy is difficult to navigate, it is costly, \nand it is litigious. In addition, it excludes certain occupations from \nagriculture. My legislation provides needed reforms to the H-2A \nprogram, provides for the creation of a temporary blue card program, \nestablishes an H-2AA worker program for cross-border commuter workers, \nand, above all, provides for increased border security.\n  First, it mandates that the Department of Homeland Security establish \nand present to Congress a comprehensive plan for increased border \nsecurity and stricter enforcement of our Nation's immigration laws, \nincluding detailed strategies, timelines, and estimated costs. Until \nsuch time the Secretary presents and Congress approves the plan, some \ninterim measures would apply.\n  Second, the legislation streamlines and modernizes the H-2A program. \nH-2A is not a new guestworker program. It has been around for many \nyears, but underutilized because of its high costs, red tape, and risks \nof drawn out litigation. To increase the use of the program, the bill \nexpands the definition of ``agriculture'' to include industries that \nhave been excluded from use of the program previously--industries such \nas poultry, seafood, and meat processors, landscapers, and \nreforestation contractors. The bill also bases the definition \n``temporary'' on the duration a worker is allowed to be in the\n\n[[Page S13505]]\n\nUnited States rather than tying it to seasonality. Some agricultural \noccupations, like poultry producers and dairy producers, do not follow \nseasons but require workers year round. If these employers in \noccupations previously excluded from the H-2A program were offered a \nviable alternative to an illegal workforce, I have no doubt they would \nseize it.\n  Third, my legislation creates a cross-border commuter worker program, \ncalled the H-2AA program. This program is modeled after the H-2A \nprogram, but recognizes that many farms located close to the Canadian \nand Mexican borders seek to employ workers who prefer to live in their \nhome countries and simply come to the U.S. each day. The H-2AA program \nexempts farmers who employ these H-2AA workers from the housing and \ntransportation requirements of the H-2A program, and requires those who \nuse it to enter and exit the United States each day. It allows these \nagricultural operations to attract workers who live close to the \nborders but do not desire to move to the United States.\n  Finally, my legislation establishes a blue card program. This is a \ntemporary program that provides for the transition of employees who are \ncurrently here in an undocumented status filling needed jobs. To \nqualify for a blue card, aliens must have worked at least 1600 hours in \nagriculture in 2005, have never been convicted or a felony or a \nmisdemeanor in the United States, and must have a petition filed on \ntheir behalf by their employer. Only after a background check is \nconducted by the Department of Homeland Security would these blue card \nworkers be allowed to work in the United States for a period of 24 \nmonths before they must return to their home country. The blue card \nallows employers who are currently utilizing an illegal workforce to \ntransition their workforce into a legal one by having their employees \nleave the country and return on the legal H-2A temporary worker program \nwithout experiencing a complete work stoppage. There is no amnesty with \nthe blue card program--all workers must return to their home country.\n  The underlying premise of any guestworker program and explicitly \nprovided for in my proposed legislation is that United States employers \nshould not be allowed to utilize a guestworker program unless and until \nthey have actively recruited American workers and are unable to find \nenough to fill needed jobs. We don't want to stifle American businesses \nbut more importantly we don't want to disadvantage American workers.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting practical needed \nreforms for the agricultural community and I look forward to the time \nearly next year in which this vital issue will be debated here in the \nUnited States Senate.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ALLARD (for himself and Mr. Enzi):\n  S. 2088. A bill to assist low-income families, displaced from their \nresidences in the States of Alabama, Louisiana, and Mississippi as a \nresult of Hurricane Katrina, by establishing within the Department of \nHousing and Urban Development a homesteading initiative that offers \ndisplaced low-income families the opportunity to purchase a home owned \nby the Federal Government, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nBanking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Hurricane Katrina \nRecovery Homesteading Act of 2005. Modeled on the United States' 19th \ncentury homesteading initiatives and similar urban programs in the \n1970s, this legislation will help us begin to rebuild the Gulf Coast \nareas destroyed by the hurricane and flooding, providing a fresh start \nfor families victimized by this tragedy.\n  The new urban homesteading proposal will serve several purposes. \nFirst, it is an initial step towards rebuilding and revitalizing the \nhurricane ravaged Gulf Coast. While we have spent recent months \nappropriately focusing on rescue and clean up, we must now examine the \nlong term need to rebuild and revitalize.\n  Second, the new urban homestead initiative will be one way to begin \nto address the housing needs of those displaced by Hurricane Katrina. \nBut I want to make it clear that this program is not being introduced \nas the sole answer to all of the housing problems faced by hurricane \nvictims. Getting all of those individuals back on their feet will \nrequire multiple efforts on a significant scale. This is one component \nof a comprehensive response to the housing needs of the Gulf Coast \nregion. I believe the initiative is a very good start.\n  Third, the Hurricane Katrina Recovery Homesteading Act is a \nproductive way of dealing with government owned properties. Through the \nFederal Housing Administration (FHA), Veterans' Administration (VA), \nand other programs, the Federal Government holds title to thousands of \nproperties in the Gulf Coast region. Vacant government owned properties \nhave the potential to be a blight on their neighborhoods, diminishing \nproperty values and acting as a magnet for crime and vandalism. \nFollowing Hurricane Katrina, vacant properties can also present health \nand safety dangers. Unless the properties are rebuilt and have families \nliving in them, they will likely be a significant drag on the efforts \nto rebuild the region. The homesteading initiative will address the \nhealth and safety concerns and further the revitalization effort while \nputting the property to productive use.\n  I would like to briefly describe how the initiative will work. I am \npleased that it is based on a Federal-local partnership, as well as a \npartnership between government, non-profits, and the private-sector. \nHUD will identify potential government owned property for transfer \nwithout cost to units of local government. The local government would \nestablish an equitable procedure for selecting low income families \naffected by the hurricane for participation. HUD and the local \ngovernment would work with partners, such as Habitat for Humanity, \nmortgage lenders, and others, to help the new urban homesteaders find \nresources to construct their new homes.\n  Participating families must agree to occupy the property for five \nyears as their principal residence, to bring the property up to health \nand safety codes within one year, and to build a house to applicable \ncode standards within three years. They must also agree to periodic \ncompliance inspections. In exchange, the family would receive title to \nthe property.\n  I would like to thank President Bush, Department of Housing and Urban \nDevelopment Secretary Alphonso Jackson, and House sponsor \nRepresentative Jindal for working with me on this effort. I look \nforward to continuing to work with them, long with the rest of my \ncolleagues, to enact the Hurricane Katrina Recovery Homesteading Act of \n2005.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BAUCUS:\n  S. 2092. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to \nauthorize review by the Joint Committee on Tax of Federal income tax \nreturns of United States Supreme Court nominees, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. The Greek philosopher Plato warned, ``where there is an \nincome tax, the just man will pay more, and the unjust man will pay \nless on the same amount of income.'' This phrase is telling.\n  The way people fill out their tax returns is an important window into \ntheir private ethical conduct. And it is a good barometer of their \nintegrity, character, and suitability for office. Paying one's fair \nshare of the tax burden is one of an American's most important \npatriotic duties. Americans from all walks of life pay their taxes out \nof obligation and fidelity to their country. Isn't it fair to know \nwhether individuals who have been nominated for lifetime positions to \nthe highest court in the land have faithfully paid their taxes?\n  The legislation that I introduce today, The Supreme Court Tax \nAccountability Act of 2005, would require that nominees to the Supreme \nCourt--including Judge Samuel Alito--provide 3 years of tax returns for \nan independent review to ensure compliance with the law. Specifically, \nthe legislation would require the nonpartisan Joint Committee on \nTaxation to review a Supreme Court nominee's returns and report on the \nnominee's tax compliance to the Judiciary and Finance Committees. The \nbill does not extend the power to inspect tax returns to any persons \nwho do not currently\n\n[[Page S13506]]\n\nhave such authority. And the bill ensures that private taxpayer \ninformation is not shared unscrupulously. Certainly, these returns \nwould not be released to the public.\n  This approach has precedent. Thirty years ago, Supreme Court Justice \nWilliam O. Douglas retired from the bench. Within days, President Ford \nnominated John Paul Stevens for the vacancy. The President hoped that \nthe nomination of a moderate who had been given the American Bar \nAssociation's highest rating would help restore confidence in \ngovernment in the wake of the Watergate scandals. As the confirmation \nhearings drew near, six members of the Senate Judiciary Committee wrote \nChairman Eastland requesting ``the most thorough practicable \ninvestigation of the nominee.'' The Senators' letter requested full \ndisclosure of Stevens' personal health and finances, including a \ncomplete and thorough review of his Federal and state tax returns. \nStevens promptly complied.\n\n  When the full Senate took up the nomination, Chairman Eastland urged \nthe confirmation of Stevens saying, ``his personal integrity, as \nreflected in his financial statements and income tax returns, is of the \nhighest order.'' The Senate confirmed Stevens by a vote of 98 to 0 and \nhe took the oath of office 2 days later at the age of 55.\n  Washington is now under a similar ethical cloud. But the White House \nhas resisted my efforts to have the Joint Committee on Taxation review \nthe tax returns of Chief Justice John Roberts, Ms. Harriet Miers, and \nJudge Samuel Alito. The administration's decision to put its Supreme \nCourt nominees' tax returns off limits is consistent with its penchant \nfor secrecy.\n  Its refusal to heed this most basic document request, however, is a \nbarrier to the rigorous due diligence process required for prospective \nGovernment officials that come before the Senate Committee on Finance. \nAll nominees, from Cabinet secretaries to Tax Court judges, have their \ntax returns scrutinized. On more than one occasion, the Finance \nCommittee has admonished the administration for failing to do a better \njob of determining a candidate's compliance with the tax laws. In some \ncases, tax issues have contributed to the withdrawal of nominees who \nwere before the Senate.\n  Despite these warnings and withdrawals, the administration still \ndoesn't do a particularly good job of catching nominees' tax problems. \nTherefore, it is vital to the constitutional process of advice and \nconsent for the Senate to have the information necessary to ensure \nfitness to serve. The Senate must not rely on the executive branch to \nprovide oversight.\n  Finally, I am introducing this bill today to apply to all nominees--\nthose nominated by Democratic Presidents and Republican Presidents. \nCareful oversight of nominees to the highest Court in the land should \nnot be a partisan issue. It was Ronald Reagan who famously said, \n``trust, but verify.'' This bill aims to embody President Reagan's \nmaxim. Trust in government is an issue that Republicans, Democrats, and \nIndependents value.\n  The noted Supreme Court justice Louis Brandeis said that ``secrecy \nnecessarily breeds suspicion.'' The American people have a right to \nknow that public officials--particularly those appointed for life--have \nfaithfully and fully paid their taxes. Blocking Congressional access to \nSupreme Court nominees' returns creates questions that can breed public \ndistrust in government. Providing access to those returns can help to \nprovide the transparency and trust Americans deserve in the Supreme \nCourt nomination process. I look forward to working with my colleagues \nto get this bill enacted.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BIDEN:\n  S. 2095. A bill to ensure payment of United States assessments for \nUnited Nations peacekeeping operations in 2005 and 2006; to the \nCommittee on Foreign Relations.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, today I introduce legislation to ensure \nthat the United States does create new arrears at the United Nations. \nAt a time when our Government is seeking important reforms at the \nUnited Nations, it would be a mistake for us to fall short on our dues \nat the U.N. But unless Congress acts promptly, that is what we are \nabout to do.\n  Here's why.\n  In 1994, Congress passed a law limiting U.S. payments for U.N. \npeacekeeping at 25 percent after 1995. At the time, the United States \nwas assessed by the U.N. at a rate of about 31 percent for \npeacekeeping. Thus, the United States incurred arrears because of the \n25 percent limitation--that is, the gap between the 25 percent and 31 \npercent.\n  In 1999, Congress approved the Helms-Biden law. It authorized the \nrepayment of U.S. arrears to the U.N. conditioned on certain reforms in \nthe U.N. system. One of those reforms was a negotiated reduction in the \nUnited Nations of the U.S. peacekeeping rate down to 25 percent. \nThrough negotiations in 2000, U.S. Ambassador Holbrooke succeeded in \nreducing the U.S. assessments for peacekeeping to just over 27 percent.\n  In 2001, Congress amended the Helms-Biden law to allow the arrears \npayments to be provided to the U.N. at the higher rate--27 percent--\nthat Ambassador Holbrooke negotiated. But the original 1994 law \nlimiting our payments to 25 percent was never repealed.\n  In the past few years, Congress has amended the 1994 law on a \ntemporary basis by raising the 25 percent limitation to conform it to \nthe rate negotiated by Ambassador Holbrooke. That temporary change in \nlaw lasted through fiscal year 2005. But it has now expired.\n  Therefore, the law today is this: the United States may not pay more \nthan 25 percent for peacekeeping--even though the United Nations \nassesses the United States at the rate of roughly 27 percent. In the \ncoming weeks, we are scheduled to pay a bill of about $344 million that \nhas come due since October 1. Under U.S. law, we will only be able to \npay about $319 million, leaving a shortfall of about $25 million. At a \ntime when our diplomats are in the final stages of negotiating \nimportant reforms in the U.N. system, it would be a mistake \nunilaterally to withhold payments to the U.N. Rather than encourage \nreform, it may cause an adverse reaction by other nation and undermine \nour reform agenda.\n  Earlier this year, the Bush administration recognized this coming \ntrain wreck. On March 1, the Department of State transmitted to \nCongress its official request for the Foreign Relations Authorization \nAct for fiscal year 2006 and 2007. Section 401 of that legislation \nwould amend current law and raise the limitation on U.S. payments to \n27.1 percent through calendar year 2007. The summary of the request \nsaid as follows: ``Without further relief, the U.N. peacekeeping cap \nwould revert to 25% and the United States would go into arrears. The \nproposed section would . . . enable the United States to pay U.N. \nassessments at the rate assessed by the U.N. up to a rate of 27.1% . . \n. [t]his would allow the United States to pay its peacekeeping \nassessment in full, including funding for a new peace support operation \nin Sudan . . .''\n  Since then, however, the administration has done little to secure \nenactment of this provision. On December 1, 2005, the Secretary of \nState requested by letter to the chairman of the Committee on \nAppropriations several ``critical legislative proposals that are of a \ntime sensitive nature and warrant enactment prior to the Congress' \nadjournment in mid-October.'' The request contains four provisions but \ndoes not include the provision required to assure full payment of U.N. \npeacekeeping assessments.\n  Mr. President, I realize that the Congress has a lot on its agenda in \nthe final days of the first session. But we have a responsibility to \nensure payment of our obligations to the United Nations--and to ensure \nthat we do not undermine the negotiations on U.N. reform now underway.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/12/13/senate-section/article/S13506-1", "month": "12", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13506-S13507]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AUTHORITIES FOR COMMITTEES TO MEET\n\n\n                      Committee on Armed Services\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 4340) to implement the United States-Bahrain \n     Free Trade Agreement.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceed to consider the bill.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, the Bahrain free-trade agreement is a very \nimportant agreement that reflects in this post-9/11 environment the \nrecommendation that had been made in terms of facilitating trade to \nnations such as Bahrain. I am delighted we were able to both debate it \nearlier today and ultimately pass this important free-trade agreement.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I reluctantly oppose the legislation \nimplementing the U.S.-Bahrain Free Trade Agreement. I have nothing \nagainst expanded trade with Bahrain, and I know that there is plenty in \nthis FTA that is appealing to the U.S. business community. However, \nthis agreement is another example of the misplaced priorities in the \nBush administration's flawed trade policy, which can best be described \nas a policy of ``fiddling while Rome is burning.''\n  If you were to ask Americans to list their top trade priorities, I \nthink they would suggest the following: dealing with the enormous trade \ndeficit, on pace to exceed $700 billion this year; addressing the rise \nof China; meeting the challenges of outsourcing and globalization; \nenforcing our existing agreements and rules for fair trade; and perhaps \nglobal negotiations in the World Trade Organization. A trade agreement \nwith Bahrain would be nowhere near the top of the list; it probably \nwould not even be on the list at all.\n  Yet, here we are, with the Bahrain FTA as the big trade item to close \nout the year. The U.S. has a trade deficit with China that is on pace \nto exceed $200 billion this year--more than a quarter of the entire \nU.S. trade deficit. Last year, China passed the U.S. as the largest \nexporter of high-tech information technology and communications \nproducts. There is no doubt that the rise of China presents an \nextraordinary challenge to the United States. Yet, the Bush \nadministration has essentially no policy dealing with China's currency \nmanipulation and the accompanying U.S. indebtedness to the government \nof China, rampant piracy of U.S. intellectual property, WTO violations, \nforced technology transfer requirements, and industrial policy in areas \ncritical to the U.S. like semiconductors and automobiles.\n  Instead, we have the Bahrain FTA, which involves .03 percent of total \nU.S. trade.\n  The Bush administration has proposed no policies in the face of \noutsourcing and the revolution of globalization to ensure that America \nkeeps good-paying jobs and remains the most competitive economy in the \nworld. They basically say, ``Don't Worry, Be Happy.''\n  Instead, the U.S. uses the scarce resources of the U.S. Trade \nRepresentative to negotiate an FTA with Bahrain, which has an economy \none-tenth-of-one percent the size of the U.S. economy.\n  When it comes to enforcing our current agreements, the Bush \nadministration has been asleep at the wheel. While the Clinton \nadministration brought on average 11 WTO cases per year to knock down \nforeign barriers to U.S. exports, the Bush administration has filed \nfewer than three cases per year.\n  Instead, they have focused their energies on negotiating an FTA which \nis so small that the independent ITC has stated, ``the effect of the \nFTA on total U.S. exports is likely to be minimal.''\n  Meanwhile, the WTO negotiations have delayed and floundered. Ironic \nmay not be the right word, but it is a fitting testament to this \nadministration's skewed priorities that Senators are stuck in \nWashington debating the Bahrain FTA this week, and so were not able to \ntravel to Hong Kong to provide oversight on the WTO negotiations--which \ncould have an impact thousands of times larger than a trade agreement \nwith Bahrain.\n  Looking at the merits of the Bahrain FTA in isolation, let me note \nthat I applaud the Government of Bahrain. It has been a good U.S. ally \nand is an important moderate Arab and Islamic country. I wish the \npeople of Bahrain well and hope that the U.S. and Bahrain will continue \nto enjoy good relations, including trading relations. I also note that \nthere are many good provisions in this agreement to ensure protection \nfor U.S. intellectual property rights, to prevent expropriations of \nU.S. investments, to reduce barriers to U.S. exports, and to expand the \naccess of U.S. service providers to Bahrain's market.\n  It is regrettable, though, that the Bush administration followed its \nflawed model in this FTA. In short, the interests of the business \ncommunity are taken care of, but the interests of the average American \nare not. I certainly understand that many of the businesses that care \nabout these FTAs make important contributions to the U.S. economy and \nare a critical source of employment, exports, and innovation. I value \nthose contributions and think for the most part the chapters and \nprovisions of the FTA important to the U.S. business community make \nsense. What I do have a problem with, however, is the fact that our \ntrade agreements provide short shrift to areas of interest to human \nbeings, including workers' rights and environmental protection.\n  When it comes to transparency in government regulation, \ntelecommunications regulation, financial services regulation, other \nservices regulation,\n\n[[Page S13508]]\n\nand e-commerce, we include provisions that force our trading partners \nto change their laws. When it comes to protection for intellectual \nproperty rights, our trade agreements have provisions that force our \ntrading partners to adopt some of the highest levels of IP protection \nin the world. In each case, if a country violates the rules in the FTA, \nit is subject to trade sanctions.\n  Yet, when it comes to respect for the most basic, internationally-\nrecognized worker rights and respect for the environment, our trade \nagreements say, ``You don't need to change your laws, just enforce \nwhatever you have.'' If our trading partners violate even this weak \nrule, then they pay a fine; and the fine gets turned around and given \nright back to them. Somehow, trade sanctions imposed to vindicate the \ninterests of business are just ``tough enforcement,'' but trade \nsanctions for worker rights or the environment are ``protectionism.''\n  Worse, our FTAs would allow a country to weaken its laws related to \nworkers' rights and the environment, and the United States would have \nabsolutely no effective recourse. If Bahrain turns around and allows \nchild labor, or turns around and prohibits its guest workers in export \nindustries from joining unions, then the best the U.S. can do is seek \nconsultations with Bahrain. This is a step back from what the Clinton \nadministration negotiated, which would have allowed the U.S. to pursue \nfull dispute settlement on all of the labor provisions in the FTA. It \nis also a step back from existing U.S. trade preferences programs, \nwhich allow the U.S. to impose sanctions on countries that are not \nadequately protecting basic workers rights.\n\n  What is it about worker rights and environmental protection that \nwarrants this disparate treatment? The same people who argue that these \nprovisions do not belong in trade agreements bemoan U.S. labor \nstandards and environmental rules, arguing that they hurt U.S. \ncompetitiveness and add to our trade deficit. It is absurd and \ndishonest to say on the one hand that these rules affect competition, \nand then on the other that they do not belong in an agreement that is \ndesigned to set the terms of competition.\n  I want to take a moment to acknowledge the good work done by \nDemocrats in the other chamber, who pushed and pushed and got Bahrain \nto agree to make important reforms to its labor laws to bring them into \nconformity with internationally-recognized standards. And, to its \ncredit, USTR agreed to monitor Bahrain's implementation and enforcement \nof these changes as part of the FTA. I applaud the efforts of these \ncongressmen. Their hard work on this and other FTAs should shame anyone \nwho has tried to discredit their cause by calling it protectionist or \nxenophobic. I regret that I will not be joining them in support of this \nagreement, however. The bottom line is that this agreement does not \ncontain binding, enforceable rules that treat respect for workers' \nrights and the environment on the same footing as respect for corporate \ninterests, so I will oppose it.\n  Separately, I want to address Bahrain's boycott against Israel. For \ndecades now, the United States has had a policy to oppose the Arab \nLeague boycott against Israel. There is an entire office in the \nDepartment of Commerce tasked with implementing this anti-boycott \npolicy. Congress has also directed USTR to ``vigorously oppose'' WTO \nadmission for countries that engage in the boycott. In my view, it is \nan implicit corollary of this latter rule that the U.S. should not \nenter into bilateral trade agreements with countries that participate \nin the boycott.\n  Bahrain continues to participate in the boycott, however. To its \ncredit, Bahrain has terminated participation in the secondary and \ntertiary aspects of the boycott. And, Bahrain has stated in a letter to \nUSTR that ``the Kingdom of Bahrain recognizes the need to dismantle the \nprimary boycott of Israel and is beginning efforts to achieve that \ngoal.'' That said, it is worth noting that even the primary boycott can \nhurt U.S. producers. The primary boycott prohibits imports with Israeli \ncontent. So, U.S. companies that use Israeli inputs could be barred \nfrom exporting a mostly U.S.-made product to Bahrain.\n  USTR and supporters of this agreement argue that the quoted statement \nconstitutes a binding commitment by Bahrain to eliminate the primary \nboycott. I hope they are correct, but I am not so sure. First, the \nlower house of Bahrain's parliament--the only democratically elected \nbody in Bahrain's national government--recently voted resoundingly to \nkeep the boycott in place. Second, it is not as clear as I would like \nthat the statement at issue has the character of a legal obligation \nrather than a statement of unilateral intent. While I hope that Bahrain \nhas officially committed itself to eliminating the primary boycott \nagainst Israel once and for all, there is certainly no way for the U.S. \nto bring an enforcement action against Bahrain if it fails to do so.\n  I think the antiboycott policy we have had in place for decades now \nis the correct one. We should not be entering into trade agreements--\nwhether bilaterally or through the WTO--with countries that enforce the \nboycott against Israel--primary, secondary or tertiary. It is \ndisturbing to me that the Bush administration has been quietly moving \naway from this policy--here in the FTA today, as well as in its support \nfor Saudi Arabia's WTO accession this week.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

We will vote on three of those \nmotions--the Baucus motion on Medicaid, the Carper TANF motion, and the \nHarkin food stamp motion--during tomorrow's session. These votes will \nstart somewhere between 11:45 and noon. We will finish the remaining \nmotions to instruct on Thursday.\n  Over the course of this week, we will be very busy, as I pointed out \nearlier this morning. We will begin voting around midday tomorrow, and \nin all likelihood we will be voting Thursday afternoon as well. We will \nbe stacking votes Thursday afternoon. We will be voting on Friday and \nmay well go into this weekend if we are unable to finish our business \nby late Friday. That means possibly Saturday and then maybe into next \nweek. We have a whole slew of bills that we need to address, that we \nhave been doing and will be doing over the next several days.\n  Tomorrow I will have more to say about the schedule.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/12/13/senate-section/article/S13510-3", "month": "12", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13510]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             IRAQ ELECTIONS\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, elections are currently underway in Iraq. \nIt is very exciting. The election formally in Iraq itself will be \nThursday, although in the United States those Iraqi citizens are \nvoting. They are actually voting in Tennessee at one of those distant, \nremote locations, remote from Iraq.\n  That is a powerful statement to the progress made in Iraq over the \nlast 2\\1/2\\ years, that this is the third election in the last year. At \nthe first election in January, about 8.5 million turned out; at the \nnext election in mid-October, over 10 million people turned out; at the \nthird election, we will have to wait and see, but it looks as though \nthere will be record numbers of individuals voting in Iraq.\n  Two-and-a-half years ago, we had a country that had no representative \ngovernment whatsoever and had a tyrant, Saddam Hussein, oppressing the \npeople there. This morning, several of us had the opportunity to talk, \nby teleconferencing, with our Ambassador in Iraq, as well as General \nCasey. They did review with us a number of the real advances that have \nbeen made. When you look at issues such as Iraqis who are currently \nparticipating, they cited several statistics. In August 2004, there \nwere five Iraqi army battalions actually in the fight. There are \ncurrently 97 Iraqi battalions in the fight. In July 2004, there were no \nready operational divisional headquarters. Today there are at least 7 \noperational divisional headquarters and 31 operational brigade \nheadquarters.\n  There has been huge progress over the last year, year and a half. In \nNovember 2004, there were about 110,000 fully trained and equipped \nIraqi security forces. Today there are almost double that, a year \nlater, 214,000 trained and equipped security forces.\n  Does all of this make a difference? One of the fascinating statistics \ncited and brought to my attention was compared to last year, or at some \npoint last year, how many tips were being provided by the Iraqi people. \nIn many ways it reflects the confidence the Iraqi people have in law \nenforcement and security. In March, there were just under 500 tips to \nthe Iraqi Armed Forces. In September 2005, there were 4,700 tips by \nIraqi citizens to Iraqi and coalition forces. Therefore, information is \nflowing much more freely, which reflects, I believe, the confidence the \nIraqis have in their security forces. One tip resulted in the \ndisruption of an IED factory and the capture of 4,000 pounds of \nexplosives and about a dozen 500-pound bombs. That shows the importance \nof the improved security by the Iraqi people and what it allows to \nflow, in terms of information.\n  Mr. President, 75,000 Iraqi policemen are patrolling Iraqi cities, \nand another 5,700 are in training. I think we are seeing real progress \nthere. There is much progress to make, but the progress being made \ncurrently, as we speak, and will be made over the next several days is \ntruly exciting in terms of an operational, permanent government being \nformed. Lastly, as I mentioned earlier, it won't be until actually \nApril that the new government is in place. The elections are occurring \nnow. Certification takes place in December, and the final is in early \nJanuary. From that point, the government takes root. So the government \nitself won't be formed until April of next year.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/12/13/senate-section/article/S13510-4", "month": "12", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13510]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 9:45 A.M.
