Mr. President, I would like to spend a few minutes this \nmorning speaking about a subject that is extremely important to the \nState I represent, the State of Louisiana, and to the gulf coast and \nalso to call attention to a small but important victory we achieved \nthis week that I hope will signal a turning or a course correction that \nCongress should take to help prevent the destruction we have seen on \nthe gulf coast in the last several weeks.\n  Mr. President, you are from Kansas, and you know the power of \ntornadoes and Mother Nature. There is not anything we can do to prevent \nthe fury of nature, but we can minimize the damage. We most certainly \ncan use our intelligence that God has given us and our talent that God \nhas given us and the wisdom that He gives us to make wise investments \nand smart choices and try to set priorities that help us make good \nchoices for the people we represent so that we can minimize their pain \nand their suffering and we\n\n[[Page S12554]]\n\ncan maximize their hopes and their dreams for the future. I believe \nthat is why we are here. I know I have talked with you personally, Mr. \nPresident, about the reasons you came to the Senate and I came to the \nSenate, and I think most of our colleagues share that view.\n  I wish to speak for a few minutes this morning to remind the Nation \nand my colleagues about the devastation and the destruction that \noccurred only 10 weeks ago in one of the greatest cities in the United \nStates of America, and that is the city of New Orleans and the \nsurrounding parishes.\n  New Orleans is our largest city in Louisiana, with 450,000 people, \nbut it sits right next to Jefferson Parish of 450,000, right next to \nSt. Bernard parish of about 60,000, and right next to Plaquemine, which \nis about 30,000. So it is a metropolitan area of close to 1.5 million \nto 2 million people.\n  We have never in the history of the Nation seen destruction such as \nthis. It is unprecedented. It was not, we now know and as I said 2 days \nafter the hurricanes, the hurricanes that got us, Katrina and Rita--a \ndouble hit, one to the southeastern part of our State, a category 4 and \n5, and one to the southwestern part--but it was our own failings, if \nyou will, that got us stuck. It was the breaching of a levee system \nthat has successfully protected this city for over 300 years. But \nbecause of a lack of investment, because we have not set the right \npriorities in the last several years and over some time, and because we \nhave our focus abroad and not at home, this is the destruction that has \noccurred, not just in New Orleans but in the region, in the \nsouthwestern part of our State as well, and throughout the gulf coast \nof Mississippi.\n  Let me show another chart that does not have the same kind of \npicture, but in a more graphic form it shows the number of people who \nhave been affected by this storm and the breaching of the levee systems \nwhich occurred throughout south Louisiana primarily.\n  Not many levees were breached to the north, but there were levee \nsystems that were breached. In Louisiana, 3 million people were \naffected; in Texas, 802,000; in Mississippi, 1.7 million; and in \nAlabama, 829,000 people. Six million people were hit directly by a \nstorm. Again, Katrina and Rita could not have been avoided, but I \npromise you, Mr. President, we could have minimized the damage and \nmaximized hope if we had set better priorities and invested our money \nbetter right in this Congress with a different choice, a different \ncourse than the one set by this administration. What do I mean by that? \nI will get to that in a minute.\n  I also want to show the significance of this region. There were 6 \nmillion people affected in this region, but it is not just any region \nin the country. Forgive me, I represent this area, so I am quite \npartial to it. I do know every other area of this country is \nspectacular and wonderful, and I have visited many places, but I think \nanybody looking at this chart can understand there is something special \nabout Louisiana, Texas, Mississippi, and Alabama.\n  What is special about it is we are the Nation's only energy coast. \nMost of the domestic production comes off the shores, basically, of \nTexas, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama. Yes, we have some important \nproduction in the West in shallow plays of oil and gas, but we have \nvirtually shut down drilling in other parts of the country--in my \nopinion, not on very good data, but nonetheless that is a choice that \nhas been made.\n  The point is that we have continued to supply this Nation at a time \nwhen it needs oil and gas and needs energy production. Louisiana has \nnot sat down on the job, Texas has not sat down, Mississippi has not \nsat down, and Alabama has not sat down. But what has happened is this \nadministration and some parts of this Congress have sat down on the job \nof helping Louisiana and this energy coast protect itself from the \nkinds of storms that we have seen.\n\n  How? By not investing in the wetlands restoration, which serves as a \nnatural barrier to the great city of New Orleans and its surrounding \nareas and by not investing in the critical infrastructure of levees and \nnavigation channels and appropriate dredging that would help manage \nwater.\n  Water can be a very powerful force for good. You can see here the \nmighty Mississippi River. Our country, in large measure, became a \nnation because of the securing of the mouth of the Mississippi River, \nthe Louisiana Purchase by President Jefferson--when he made a very \nsmart strategic investment. He did not waste his money on things that \nwould not return a benefit to our country, but made the Louisiana \nPurchase for 3 cents an acre, the best real estate deal ever done. But \nwe purchased the mouth of this river, secured it for national security \nbut also secured it for commerce.\n  Mr. President, it is impossible to get grain out of Kansas, your \nState, or Nebraska, or throughout the great Farm Belt in the Midwest of \nthe United States, without using the Mississippi River and its \ntributaries. Yes, we can manage to get some of it over here to the east \ncoast and out to our trading partners to the east, but moving it out \nhere, down south to our trading partners in the south and also trade \nroutes to the east and the west would be impossible without the \nMississippi River.\n  You would think this Congress would pay attention, particularly this \nadministration that talks about energy independence would pay attention \nto this energy coast.\n  In addition to an energy coast, you can see here the red dots are our \nports. These are parts of the largest port system in the country--two \nof the largest. All of the south Louisiana ports and Houston. If you \ncombined all of the ports in Louisiana from New Orleans to the Baton \nRouge port, to south Louisiana, that port and the other ports, our port \nsystem is larger than any port system in the North American Continent \nand one of the largest port systems in the world. You would think that \nwe would pay attention to infrastructure such as this and invest wisely \nand take some of the money out of this Treasury and invest in \nprotection of the wetlands and in a strong and robust levee system.\n  But we have not done that. In fact, we have done the opposite. This \nchart is a startling summary. It is startling to me. It is hard to \ngrasp. This is ``Civil Works Capital Investment as a Percentage of \nGross Domestic Product,'' since 1929 to the year 2001. When we in \nAmerica, the America I grew up in, talk about the great investments \nafter the war, you can see what we are talking about. You can see a \nNation that was focused on its future. Why? Because it was investing in \nroads and bridges and levees and dams and infrastructure necessary to \nlay down the framework for the greatest explosion of entrepreneurship \nand scientific discovery that before had not been seen in the world; \nalmost unequaled in its breadth and its scope. But what happened? Look \nhere. Starting in the 1980s, there were new priorities set in \nWashington. They have been very damaging priorities, indeed--slashing \ncritical investments in infrastructure, cutting back on \n``nonessentials,'' trying to ``conserve.'' This is not conservation. \nThis is akin to taking a gun and shooting yourself in the head, when \nyou take money out of civil works projects, away from cities, away from \nsuburbs, away from communities, and spend it on either tax cuts for \npeople who do not need them or on other priorities that are not as \nimportant or on wars that we cannot win. It is this low line here, \nright down here to the lowest percentage, under one-half of 1 percent \nof the GDP, that results in devastation such as this.\n  You do not have to have a Ph.D. in economics to understand this. This \nis not complicated. I am going to show it to you again. This is 20 \nyears of disinvestment, disengagement, pretending that these problems \ndo not exist, pretending we have surpluses when we do not, and \nunderfunding critical infrastructure. When that happens, this is the \nresult.\n  The 450,000 people who lived in the city of New Orleans at one time \nand the 450,000 people who lived in Jefferson Parish and the 200,000 \npeople who lived in St. Tammany Parish and the 60,000 people who lived \nin St. Bernard and the 30,000 people who lived in Plaquemines Parish--\nand that is not mentioning the other parishes along the western part of \nour coast, Cameron, that is completely destroyed, and Calcasieu Parish, \nthat suffered, and Washington Parish, that had not every tree fall but \nevery house collapsed or destroyed in some way or affected in some way \nby the falling of the trees--\n\n[[Page S12555]]\n\nask these people whom I represent, was it smart to cut off investments? \nI don't think so.\n  The sad thing is, we have had an answer. I am not coming to complain. \nI am coming to offer a solution which our delegation has offered, now, \ndecade after decade. We have pleaded, we have held hearings, we have \nhad field trips to Louisiana, we have done fly-overs, we have formed a \nnational alliance, we built a coalition of 4,500, an alliance of \nindustry and environmentalists. We have done it all. But what we cannot \nseem to do is get the attention of this administration and enough \nmembers of the Republican leadership to understand that smart \ninvestments make a difference: They save lives, they build hope, they \nbuild communities, and they make a nation stronger. What I have asked \nfor and my delegation has asked for--and I know my time is running out, \nand I will take 2 more minutes--what we have asked for is to redirect a \nportion of offshore oil and gas revenues that have been generated off \nof our coast, off of this coast where all these people have been \ninjured.\n  There it is. With the oil and gas being drilled--and has been drilled \nsince 1955--off of this coast, we are generating about $6 billion a \nyear that comes into the general fund. It would be a smart thing and a \nwise thing right now, a wise action and a smart action, to redirect a \nportion of those revenues to invest in a levee system, in the \nrestoration of this Gulf Coast area and the wetlands that protect the \nNation's great energy port and trade port.\n  That is my message. We can do better. We must do better. We must make \nsmarter investments with the money that is in the National Treasury. We \ndo not have to raise additional taxes to do this. We have to redirect \nsome of the taxes already flowing into the Treasury to invest to \nprotect the people along the gulf coast. If we needed to share those \nrevenues with other coastal communities--since by the year 2020, two-\nthirds of the continental United States will live within 50 miles of \nthe coast--we most certainly are able to do that. But for Heaven's \nsake, let's get our priorities straight.\n\n  We can do better. We can make better decisions. That is what this \neffort is about. We are going to continue on, not complaining but \noffering solutions. We are not offering to raise taxes but to redirect \nsome of the taxes that we have to make better choices to build a \nstronger Nation and stronger communities. I ask my colleagues to join \nus in this effort because I know we can get this job done. I thank the \nSenator from Illinois for yielding some time this morning for me to \ndiscuss this important issue.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from the great State of \nIllinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, let me thank the Senator from Louisiana. \nShe has been through an ordeal, as well as her colleague, Senator \nVitter, with the Katrina damage and what followed. She has been on this \nfloor every day and in private meetings every single day, exhorting \nthis Senate, both Democrats and Republicans, not to forget what \nhappened to her home State. It is a tragedy that none of us would like \nto see befall our own States, and we owe it to her to work with the \nPresident, on a bipartisan basis, first, to help the evacuees and \nvictims; second, to make sure the great city of New Orleans is back and \nrunning as quickly as possible; third, to make the changes that are \nnecessary to give them peace of mind and security for generations to \ncome.\n  I have listened to her time and again come to the floor and talk \nabout health care and education, the basics that people need to \nsurvive. I worry, as I am sure she does, that we are going through \nKatrina fatigue, that we have heard it for so long we want to turn the \npage and talk about other things. Thank you for reminding us every \nsingle day we cannot turn that page. I have met with those victims. \nSome have come to Illinois. I tell you but for the generosity and \ncompassion of churches, charities, and local community groups, I do not \nknow how some of these families would have survived.\n  What has happened in farflung communities in Illinois is that these \nevacuees have been embraced--and thank goodness that happened because \notherwise they tell me they wouldn't have known where to turn. When the \nGovernment should have been there, it was not there. Sadly, we have to \nstep back now and take an honest evaluation of why that happened.\n  I know the Senator from Louisiana shares my belief that if we had an \nindependent, nonpartisan commission--which we have been begging for for \nweeks now--to take a look at what happened, not so much that we can \nfigure out who to blame but so that we make sure we never do it again. \nWe hear complaints about FEMA--a few weeks ago in Florida and \ncomplaints in Texas. We can do better. When it comes to disasters \nfacing America, natural and otherwise, we can do better. I think we \nneed to come together in an independent, nonpartisan way to make that \nhappen.\n\n\n                             Ahmed Chalabi\n\n  It is almost hard to believe, and impossible to explain, what is \ngoing on in Washington today as we honor and fete Ahmed Chalabi. Who is \nAhmed Chalabi? He enjoys the rank of Deputy Prime Minister in the \nnation of Iraq. But he enjoys a very questionable reputation otherwise.\n  Ahmed Chalabi, it turns out, was one of the key advisers to the Bush \nadministration before the invasion of Iraq. He was so important to the \nBush administration that they paid his organization, through the \nDefense Intelligence Agency, $335,000 a month to sustain his life and \nhis office. Overall, the Bush White House gave his Iraqi National \nCongress $39 million over the last 5 years, $39 million to this Ahmed \nChalabi. Ahmed Chalabi is an expatriate from Iraq, now returned with \nSaddam Hussein being removed from power, and he has been bankrolled by \nour Government as long as President Bush has been in office. His Iraqi \nNational Congress was a major source of misinformation and \ndisinformation about the situation in Iraq before our invasion. He was \nthe one who was producing the evidence that led the administration to \ntell the American people there were weapons of mass destruction.\n  There were people who were skeptical of Ahmed Chalabi from the start. \nFormer Secretary of State Colin Powell said, on June 12, 2003, ``I \ncan't substantiate Chalabi's claims. He makes new ones every year.''\n  This skepticism was shared by other agencies of our Government, but \nit did not stop the leaders of our Government, under President Bush, \nfrom bringing Ahmed Chalabi into the highest level meetings concerning \nAmerica's national security and our policies in Iraq.\n  On September 18, 2001, Richard Perle convened a 2-day meeting of the \nDefense Policy Board, a group that advises the Pentagon. Chalabi, who \nwas a guest speaker at this meeting, made a presentation on the threat \nfrom Iraq.\n  It turns out that Chalabi was producing information from so-called \ndefectors on a regular basis to the highest levels of the Bush \nadministration--most of which turned out to be false.\n\n       Chalabi's defector reports were . . . flowing from the \n     Pentagon directly to the Vice-President's office [Mr. Cheney] \n     and then on to the President, with little prior evaluation by \n     intelligence professionals.\n\n  That statement was made by State Department intelligence expert Greg \nThielmann in the New Yorker. He went on to say:\n\n       There was considerable skepticism throughout the \n     intelligence community about the reliability of Chalabi's \n     sources, but the defector reports were coming all the time. \n     Knock one down and another comes along. Meanwhile, the \n     garbage was being shoved straight to the President.\n\n  Ahmed Chalabi was the source of this so-called intelligence garbage \nabout the situation in Iraq.\n  And then there was the notorious source named ``Curve Ball.''\n  He should have been given that name because his information turned \nout to be so wrong, so bad, and so misleading. He was another one of \nthe so-called defectors who provided this information. He was a \ndiscredited INC defector to Germany, code named ``Curve Ball,'' and the \nchief source of information on Iraq's supposed fleet of mobile germ \nweapons factories which turned out to be a hoax. ``Curve Ball'' was the \nbrother of a top lieutenant to Ahmad Chalabi.\n  Chalabi did not stop with reaching the highest levels of our \nGovernment and misleading them about the situation in Iraq. He had his \nfriends in the\n\n[[Page S12556]]\n\nmedia. Chalabi was the source of discredited news stories about Iraq, \npenned by New York Times reporter Judith Miller. In 2001, Miller wrote \na front-page story about claims that Saddam had 20 secret WMD sites \nhidden in Iraq. It is amazing, the exclusive story came ``just three \ndays after the source had shown deception in a polygraph test \nadministered by the CIA at the request of the Defense Intelligence \nAgency.''\n  So when they confronted Ahmad Chalabi and asked, how could you \nmislead the United States with all of this bad information, leading to \nour invasion of Iraq, 160,000 American soldiers risking their lives, \nover 2,000 killed, he said ``we are heroes in error.'' He boasted to \nthe international media that even if he had misled the United States, \nhe had achieved his goal. He got the United States to invade Iraq and \ndepose Saddam Hussein.\n  And then what happened? The tables turned on Mr. Ahmad Chalabi last \nyear. In May of last year, the Iraqi officials, with the cooperation of \nthe United States, raided Ahmad Chalabi's offices in Iraq. Why? I will \ntell you. In June 2004 Chalabi came under investigation for allegations \nthat he passed secret intelligence data to Iran. Remember Iran, one of \nthe axes of evil? Chalabi is accused of telling the Iranian Government \nthat the United States had broken the code it used for secret \ncommunications. National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice promised \nCongress a full investigation into these allegations.\n  The Wall Street Journal reports:\n\n       There is little sign of progress in a Federal investigation \n     of allegations that Chalabi once leaked United States \n     intelligence secrets to Iran.\n\n  If he did this, it is clear he endangered the lives of our troops, he \nendangered America's national security.\n  Just this week, the Wall Street Journal came out with a story about \nAhmad Chalabi. They went to the FBI and said some 18 months later, what \nis the status of Ahmad Chalabi? Let me quote FBI spokesman John Miller, \nwho strongly denied that the Chalabi investigation is languished. He \nsaid:\n\n       This is currently an open investigation and an active \n     investigation.\n\n  He added:\n\n       Numerous current and former government employees have been \n     interviewed.\n\n  Here we have a man who misled the leaders of our Government. Here we \nhave a man who conceded and boasted that although he misled them, he \nachieved his purpose of getting the United States to invade Iraq. Here \nwe have a man accused of selling secrets to the enemy, to Iran, and \nendangering American troops. And where do we find Ahmad Chalabi today? \nHe is being hosted and feted by this administration. This man is in \nWashington with his motorcade moving around town, having appointments \nwith Treasury Secretary Snow and the Secretary of State, Condoleezza \nRice. Today, he is going to share his wise view of the world with the \nconservative think tank, the American Enterprise Institute.\n  This is a hard story to explain. Hard to explain to the American \npeople; harder still to explain to American troops. How can a man who \nhas been accused and is under investigation for passing secrets from \nthe United States to the Iranians and endangering the lives of our \ntroops and national security now be the toast of the town in \nWashington, DC? How can a man under active investigation by the Federal \nBureau of Investigation, a man who has not been called for any \nstatement or any testimony, be this guest at the highest levels of our \nGovernment?\n  Congressman George Miller has been involved in this inquiry, as I \nhave. He has made it clear, and I agree with him, when it comes to \nAhmad Chalabi we shouldn't be serving him lunch, we ought to be serving \nhim with a subpoena. We shouldn't treat him like a hero, we should \ntreat him like a suspect in a case that may have endangered the lives \nof our troops.\n  I don't understand it. We need to call on the Intelligence Committee \nas well as the Department of Justice to use the tools they have to \nsubpoena Ahmad Chalabi to make certain he answers the hard questions \nabout how he misled our Government into invading Iraq and what he did \nto endanger the lives of our troops and our national security. Nothing \nless should be allowed when it comes to protecting our troops.\n  How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Isakson). There is 2 minutes 10 seconds.\n\n\n                              OIL PROFITS\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I close by saying we also have coming to \nCapitol Hill today a group of oil company executives. They couldn't \nhave come at a better time.\n  Someone said this is simply theater. I hope it isn't. It is time to \nask hard questions of these oil companies which have over the past 6 \nmonths dramatically increased the price of energy for people across \nAmerica. People living in Illinois and across our Nation--families, \nsmall businesses, farmers--have been dealing with this oppressive \nincrease in prices.\n  A lot of blame was pointed, when it came to OPEC, that it is the \nSaudis; they are running up the price of oil. Well, they did, but that \nwas not the reason the price at the gasoline pump went to $3. It went \nto $3 because of this: Oil companies are making record profits, record \nprofits over the increased prices they are charging to consumers across \nAmerica. This chart is an indication of the billions of dollars they \nare making.\n  ExxonMobil reported record quarterly profits of $9.9 billion, up 75 \npercent from last year. Put the nozzle in the tank and watch the \nnumbers spin on the gas pump; the money from your credit card is going \ndirectly to the boardrooms of these oil company executives.\n  Senator Maria Cantwell of Washington has the right idea: We need to \nput the oil company executives under oath today, ask them the hard \nquestions as to whether they have been profiteering at the expense of \nthe most vulnerable people in America, people who get up and go to work \nevery day and cannot afford to fill their gas tanks; businesses that \nare languishing, that cannot hire the people they need, cannot reach \nprofitability, because of the profiteering of oil companies. And \nfarmers, already hard pressed in many parts of our country by bad \nweather and bad prices, find their input costs going through the roof \nbecause of the high cost of energy.\n  The oil company and lobbyists are all over Capitol Hill. They are \nswarming because several Senators, including some Republicans, have \ncalled for a windfall profits tax. I support that. Take the money back \nfrom these oil companies, give it to consumers across America, fully \nfund LIHEAP, our program to provide heating sources for the poor in \nAmerica. Make certain we tell these oil companies no, and stand up for \nthe consumers who paid these outrageous prices.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The balance of morning business is controlled \nby the majority.\n  The Chair recognizes the Senator from Kentucky.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/11/09/senate-section/article/S12556-1", "month": "11", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12556-S12558]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RATIFICATION OF IRAQ CONSTITUTION\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, normally I don't get an opportunity to \nhear my good friend from Illinois, but I am glad I was here as he gave \none of his appraisals of the situation in Iraq. As Paul Harvey often \nsays, I would like to provide the rest of the story; arguably, a more \nbalanced view of what is going on in that very important country.\n  In fact, freedom has taken another giant step forward in Iraq. On \nOctober 15 the Iraqi people voted overwhelmingly to ratify their \nConstitution. Iraqis turned out in stunning numbers to embrace \ndemocracy, tolerance, and a just rule under law. In fact, they turned \nout in greater numbers than we turned out here last November, which was \na very high turnout by U.S. standards--and, of course, most Americans \nwere not afraid they would get shot when they went to the polls.\n  Iraqis created a constitutional republic in the heart of the Middle \nEast. This is an unequivocal victory in the war on terror. It is the \nonly way we can assess it. With their votes, millions of brave Iraqis \nrejected dictatorship and created a republic. They rejected rule by \nfear and terror and embraced rule by the consent of the governed. They \nstood together as a country under one motto: ``we the people.''\n  Nearly 10 million Iraqis turned out to vote, a turnout rate of 63 \npercent. That\n\n[[Page S12557]]\n\nwas up from 60 percent last January when they elected their interim \ngovernment. That was 3 percent higher than our own turnout here last \nNovember, 60 percent, which was 10 percent higher than our turnout here \nin 2000, which was 50 percent. Again, I say, those Iraqis, many of \nthem, might have been concerned about their safety when they went to \nvote. That was the first free election in Iraq in over 50 years last \nJanuary.\n  Furthermore, and very significantly, turnout among Sunni Arabs \nincreased dramatically. This is a testament that the policy of \ncontinued political outreach to influential Sunni leaders during the \nconstitutional drafting process was a success.\n  For instance, in the heavily Sunni province of Salahaddeen in the \ncity of Ishaqi, only 300 people voted last January in the interim \nelection vote. This time around, on the Constitution, on October 15, \n10,000 Iraqis voted. Three hundred in January, 10,000 in October, \nlargely Sunnis. This is only one city, but the turnout was up \ndramatically. Many in the Sunni population obviously decided their \ninterests are best served not by fighting an armed insurgency but by \njoining the political process.\n  Not only did Iraqis turn out in record numbers, they also voted to \nratify their new organizing document in overwhelming numbers. The final \nresults show over 78 percent of Iraqi voters said yes to the \nConstitution. Of Iraq's 18 provinces, 12 voted yes with majorities \nexceeding 94 percent. Three more provinces voted yes with solid \nmajorities, including the province of Baghdad. In the Baghdad province, \n77 percent ratified the Constitution.\n  The Iraqi Government decided that for the Constitution to fail, at \nleast three provinces had to vote ``no'' with at least two-thirds of \nthe vote. Only two provinces did that, the Anbar province and the \nprovince I mentioned earlier, Salahaddeen.\n  The democratic process in Iraq will continue to move forward. Iraqis \nare now preparing for another nationwide election pursuant to the \nConstitution they ratified. That election on December 15 will be for \nthe first permanent democratic government in Iraq's history. They will \nchoose 275 members of a council of representatives to serve all the \npeople of Iraq.\n  It is odd to me that at such a moment of triumph in that country, \nthere are still those who call for America to get out while we can in \nthe midst of this triumph that is occurring there. They believe our \ntroop withdrawal should be arbitrarily based on the calendar rather \nthan on achieving results. In short, they want to cut and run. And \nuntil we do, they will endlessly criticize our troops' efforts but \noffer no alternatives of their own.\n  It is important to remember to withdraw prematurely from Iraq, as the \ncut-and-run crowd suggests, would play right into the hands of the \nterrorists. The terrorists themselves have already told us that. They \nhave told us what they have in mind. In a letter our intelligence \nforces intercepted, written by Ayman al-Zawahiri, the No. 2 terrorist \nin the al-Qaida hierarchy, and sent to lead Iraqi terrorist Abu Musab \nal-Zarqawi, we learn that the terrorists' foremost goal is to drive \nAmerica out of Iraq. No great surprise.\n  Here is how al-Zawahiri instructs his partner in villainy:\n\n       [T]he Jihad in Iraq requires several incremental goals.\n       The first stage: Expel the Americans from Iraq.\n\n  No surprise.\n       The second stage: Establish an Islamic authority . . . in \n     order to fill the void stemming from the departure of the \n     Americans, immediately upon their exit and before un-Islamic \n     forces attempt to fill this void.\n       The third stage: Extend the Jihad wave to the secular \n     countries neighboring Iraq.\n\n  So they clearly not only want Iraq, they want to spread this plague \ninto the countries surrounding Iraq.\n  Al-Zawahiri goes on to say:\n\n       The mujahedeen must not have their mission end with the \n     expulsion of the Americans from Iraq . . . their ongoing \n     mission is to establish an Islamic state, and defend it, and \n     for every generation to hand over the banner to the one after \n     it until the Hour of Resurrection . . . Americans will exit \n     soon, God willing.\n\n  Those are chilling words from our enemies.\n  Their plans are laid bare for all of us to see. They want us to cut \nand run. Worse still, they expect it. And then they will turn Iraq into \na terrorist haven.\n  Al-Zawahiri realizes that the terrorists can never hope to defeat \nAmerica on the battlefield. The only way they can defeat us is by \nundermining our resolve with continued suicide bombings, gruesome \nbeheadings performed for the camera, and guerilla sneak attacks, all \nbrought to American living rooms through the media.\n  The terrorists believe they can shape American policy--policy \ndetermined, in part, by this chamber--by killing Americans, because \nthey have successfully done so before. In 1983, terrorists killed 241 \nAmericans in Beirut, and American forces were withdrawn from Beirut as \na result.\n  And America did not take the threat of terrorism seriously after the \nfirst bombing of the World Trade Center in 1993, nor did we take it \nseriously after the destruction of our embassies in Tanzania and Kenya \nin 1998, nor did we take it seriously after the attack on the USS Cole \nin 2000.\n  The terrorists believe that our determination to fight them now, \nafter 9/11, is the exception rather than the rule. They believe that \neventually we will tire, falter, and fail in this fight.\n  We must make plain for them--in a language they can understand--that \nthey are gravely mistaken.\n  America is not going to cut and run before the job is done. For our \nown security, for the security of the Iraqi people, and for the \nsecurity of the world, we must defeat the terrorists and leave behind a \nstrong, stable, and secure democratic Iraq.\n  The terrorists are rightfully scared because America is fighting and \nwinning the war on terror. We have made incredible progress in Iraq in \n2\\1/2\\ short years.\n  I think we ought to take a look at the progress that has been made.\n  Taking note of this chart, Saddam Hussein came to power in 1979 and \nwas in power from 1979 to 2003. What were the hallmarks of those 24 \nyears for the people of Iraq? Over 4,000 political prisoners were \nsummarily executed--one of his great accomplishments; 50,000 Kurds \nkilled, many of them with chemical weapons; 395,000 people were forced \nto leave Iraq during that 24-year period.\n  They had to get out or be killed.\n  Iraq had no free elections and no free newspapers, and Saddam Hussein \nstood above the law.\n  What has happened in the 2\\1/2\\ years since Saddam Hussein's fall \nfrom power? Iraqis are now innocent until proven guilty. They have a \nlegal system. Seventy-five Kurds have been elected to the legislature, \nas compared to 50,000 Kurds getting killed during Saddam's regime. Over \n270,000 of those Iraqis who had to leave the country--of the 395,000 \nwho were forced to flee Iraq--have come back home to build a new free \nIraq, and 9.8 million people voted on the constitution on October 15. \nThey weren't any free elections for 24 years under Saddam. They have \nover 100 free newspapers--100 free newspapers in Iraq now. They have \nmore competition probably than we do, with freedom of speech breaking \nout all over Iraq.\n  Hussein, who stood above the law, now is on trial, subject to the law \nin Iraq.\n  That sums up the progress that has been made. The 24-year period of \nterror is over and a new democratic, free Iraq is emerging.\n   Before I leave the floor, I want to offer my colleagues some words \nof bravery from ordinary Iraqis, as an antidote to the al-Zawahiri \nletter I read earlier. These are the people who defied al-Zawahiri and \nal-Zarqawi to vote for the free future of their country. What these \ncourageous people have to say should convince anybody that the Iraqis \nunderstand and are willing to pay the price of freedom.\n  Here is what one fellow had to say:\n\n       `I have not forgotten the mass graves and the torture and \n     the killings,' said Abdul Hussein Ahmed of Najaf. `Five \n     members of my family were killed by Saddam and his people. \n     But now, with this constitution, everyone is equal under the \n     law.'\n\n  Munthir Abbas Elaiwi of Baghdad agrees.\n\n       `[The constitution] will bring all that is good for the \n     people, such as stability, democracy and peace. With such a \n     charter, we will show the world that we are a civilized \n     nation, not a bunch of ignorant and bloodthirsty extremists.'\n\n\n[[Page S12558]]\n\n\n  That is from one of the Iraqis participating in the progress. And if \nany terrorists think the people of Iraq do not hold their new republic \ndear, let them heed the words of Munthir's older brother, Naseer Abbas, \nalso of Baghdad. He states quite simply: ``We are ready to defend this \nconstitution with our blood.''\n  Iraqis are our partners in the war on terror, and they understand the \nmagnitude of our shared cause. They realize the power a thriving \ndemocracy in the heart of the Middle East can have as a counter-example \nto tyrannical regimes like Iran, whose President recently called for \nIsrael to be ``wiped off the face of the Earth.'' The Iraqis have \nembraced liberty, and rejected the homicidal urgings of terrorists. I \nhope my colleagues will join me in saluting them and their commitment \nto freedom.\n  Tyrannical leaders who repress their people much as Saddam Hussein \nonce did the Iraqis should make no mistake: The people in your country \nare looking at Iraq and wondering, ``Why not here? Why not now?''\n  The terrorists do not have the right answers to those questions. \nAmericans, and Iraqis, do.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cornyn). The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/11/09/senate-section/article/S12558-1", "month": "11", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12558]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             REVOLUTIONARY WAR TOMB OF THE UNKNOWN SOLDIER\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, before I talk about the situation in \nIraq, I want to mention something that has gone on in my City of \nPhiladelphia which I think deserves recognition during Veterans Day; \nthat is, a situation with the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier from the \nRevolutionary War. That is a memorial which was erected in Philadelphia \nin 1954. There was an eternal flame added to that memorial back in 1976 \nduring our bicentennial year. About 10 years ago that flame went out, \nand for 10 years the City of Philadelphia and the government of the \nCity of Philadelphia refused to relight it--- to fix the flame.\n  It wasn't until the efforts of Larry Mendte, a journalist for the CBS \nstation WKYW television in Philadelphia, and the work he did in \nbringing this issue to light--other journalists have brought this to \nlight in the past--but to Larry's credit, he did not give up. And they \ncontinued to run story after story and hound the city of Philadelphia \nto try to finally fix this monument and fix this eternal flame.\n  I wish to give thanks to the veterans community in Philadelphia, to \nWKYW, to Larry, and ultimately I have to congratulate Mayor Street. \nAfter an enormous amount of pressure put on his administration, Mayor \nStreet finally decided to fix the flame.\n  Once the flame was fixed, the National Park Service took that flame \nover and will make sure that the flame at the Tomb of the Unknown \nSoldier in the Revolutionary War, where so many died in the city of \nPhiladelphia, will burn as an eternal flame.\n  As we all know, this Friday is Veterans Day, a day when Americans pay \ntribute to the brave men and women who have served in our armed forces. \nThere is no group of Americans to which we owe more than those who have \nfought to protect the freedoms that are the very heart of our Nation.\n  The truth is that our veterans, both past and present, should be \nhonored every day of the year. We would not be here today, enjoying all \nthe blessings we have if it were not for the sacrifices of those who \ntook up arms to defend America. And so, I rise today to recognize the \nefforts of the residents of my home state who have fought to ensure \nthat those who passed away in service to our country are remembered, \nday in and day out, with the reverence they deserve.\n  The city of Philadelphia, so central to the American Revolution, \nbecame the final resting place for thousands of Revolutionary soldiers. \nMany of these brave men, America's first patriots, were laid to rest in \nmass, unmarked graves throughout the Philadelphia region. To honor \nthese soldiers, and the millions more who have fought for our Nation \nsince its inception, a war memorial was erected in Philadelphia in \n1954. Ever since, this monument, known as the Tomb of the Unknown \nSoldier, has stood as a tribute to those who first made the ultimate \nsacrifice in the name of America.\n  During the bicentennial celebration in 1976, an eternal flame was \nadded to the monument. This flame, a symbol of the enduring spirit of \nthe soldiers that passed, was to burn continuously in their honor. Yet \nover time, the flame was neglected and allowed to die out. For the last \nfew years, this monument has stood incomplete, and as a tribute to our \nsoldiers, insufficient.\n  Thankfully, Philadelphia is a city filled with conscientious, \nconcerned citizens. On June 6 of this year, Mr. Larry Mendte, a \njournalist for the CBS station WKYW, reported that the flame had gone \nout. The response from viewers was immediate. The next night, a veteran \nof the gulf war traveled to the monument and lit her own flame, a flame \nthat would certainly not wane due to neglect, thus beginning a \ncandlelight vigil that would be joined by many others.\n  Mr. Mendte, along with his colleagues at CBS, would not let this \nstory disappear. He tracked down city officials, demanded an \nexplanation, and refused to accept their attempts to brush him off. On \nJune 13, merely seven days after the initial story was broadcast, the \ncity began the repair process. Thanks to the efforts of Mr. Mendte, \nWKYW, and the many concerned Philadelphia residents who responded to \nthis story, over 100 individuals were able to witness the reigniting of \nthe eternal flame on June 29.\n  An inscription on the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier reads, ``Freedom is \na light for which many men have died in darkness.'' Freedom is a light, \na light that still shines bright throughout the world thanks to the \neffort and sacrifice of American soldiers. Today in Philadelphia, a \ndifferent light is shining, once again, in recognition of these \nsoldiers and what they have given for us.\n  I commend Mr. Mendte and his colleagues at WKYW for bringing \nattention to this issue and pushing for its resolution, as well as the \nresidents of Philadelphia who responded, in force, with their support. \nMost of all, I thank America's veterans, who have given more than we \ncan ever repay, and deserve to be honored and recognized at every \nopportunity. The eternal flame at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier is a \nfitting tribute, and I am proud to represent such dedicated, patriotic \ncitizens who worked so hard for its restoration.\n  Congratulations to all involved in the city of Philadelphia.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/11/09/senate-section/article/S12558-2", "month": "11", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12558-S12560]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 U.S. SERVICE MEMBERS' SUCCESS IN IRAQ\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I congratulate the Senator from Texas, \nSenator Hutchison, for her tremendous effort in organizing Members to \ncome to the floor to tell the other side of story in Iraq.\n  It started with a series of e-mails that I received from different \npeople, from constituents to folks who weren't constituents, who \ncomplained to me--these are soldiers in-country--that they were \nbecoming frustrated because every day they would be out there on the \nfrontlines in-country, serving, sacrificing for our country and \naccomplishing great deeds and then would have to turn on CNN and other \nnews shows and read the clips from the American newspapers and see a \nwar being described which they were not seeing. They were not seeing \nthe war as being an IED every day but seeing, every day, hundreds of \nthousands of Iraqis working with our American military forces to make \nIraq a more stable and safe place.\n  I, along with Senator Hutchison and my colleagues, have decided it is \ntime to start going around the mainstream media and telling the other \nside of the story.\n  I came from a press conference downstairs where I had four civilian \nindependent military bloggers. These are people who have been in-\ncountry--one is going to be in-country in the next couple of weeks, one \nwho is the wife of someone who is heading to Iraq--talking about the \nmilitary blog, talking about all of the information that is now \npopulating the Internet, of people who are actually there in-country, \ntelling their stories, people who are making a difference every single \nday in the lives of Iraqis.\n\n[[Page S12559]]\n\n  One such person is Captain Jim Bentzley, who is from suburban \nPhiladelphia, who wrote to me a month and a half ago. He said:\n\n       The reason I'm writing to you about this mission is because \n     I do not believe that the American public realizes how well \n     we are working with the new Iraqi military. In my own shop, \n     the mission could not be accomplished without the help and, \n     cooperation of my Iraqi troop-employees. Likewise, I help \n     them by guiding them through the U.S. military's logistics \n     system. I'm also trying to educate them past the military \n     logistics by introducing them to some of my civilian-\n     experience and U.S. business logistics practices: lean \n     logistics and six sigma. Efficiency is a new concept for them \n     . . . but I believe I can get through to them so that when \n     we, Americans, leave this place, the Iraqis will pick up the \n     mission seamlessly.\n       I would like you to visit my operation so that you can see \n     the way we work with the Iraqis and so that the American \n     people can also see. There are a lot of good things going on \n     over here and most of them deal with people and the close \n     relationships that are being formed--this is definitely not \n     seen by America; America only seems to see the darker side of \n     Iraq. Friendships that will last a lifetime are starting \n     here, and they are friendships between former enemies. I \n     realize I've only been here, in Iraq, for a couple of weeks, \n     but already I consider my Iraqi counterparts close friends.\n\n  Corporal Mindo Estrella, from Erie, PA said:\n\n       I like working with the [Iraqi Army] and teaching them our \n     tactics. I think that they've learned what we are teaching \n     them and one day will be able to take over operations.\n\n  Corporal Estrella reenlisted. in the Marine Corps this past October, \nshortly after his battalion arrived: in Iraq. He said:\n\n       I like what I do, It gets rough at times, but nobody made \n     me come out here. I signed the contract knowing what I was \n     getting myself into.\n\n  He reenlisted last month. He said he likes what he does. He feels he \nis making a difference in transforming the country of Iraq.\n  LCpl Dan Williams said the same thing. He arrived in mid-March and \nhas worked in-country, in Fallujah, to identify lots of insurgents and \nis working with the people now. He says he is getting the intelligence \nfrom the people in the community, where originally they were hesitant \nto work with them. Now most of the intelligence they are gathering is \nfrom Iraqi civilians who realize that it is now in their best interests \nfor their country that they want to fight for to cooperate not with the \nAmerican military but also with the Iraqi military in rooting out \ninsurgents in their country.\n  We are making tremendous, positive steps.\n  I am going to be working, over the next several months, to make sure \nthat the stories of the people who are on the frontline, who are \nfighting the war in the trenches, have their stories told to the \nAmerican public and not people sitting in editorial rooms in New York \nCity trying to spin what is going on in the mainstream of Iraq.\n  For example, news comes that America has suffered the loss of 2,048 \nbrave servicemen and women in Operation Iraqi Freedom. The loss of any \nsoldier in the cause of freedom grieves us all; especially the parents, \nwives, husbands and children of each deceased loved one. As elected \nofficials, we don't know these soldiers as numbers, but as people, with \nhopes and dreams, family and friends. Knowing them as we do, it is hard \nto imagine the loss of any of them.\n\n  As great as the loss is, it can only compound a family's sadness to \nhear some say that the loss of their loved one was neither for the \nprotection of America or the freedom of man. Yet we hear it regularly. \nCritics say Iraq posed no threat, as there was no link in Iraq to the \nwar on terror. Or that securing freedom in the Middle East is \nimpossible or isn't worth one American life.\n  To those who have lost their loved ones, don't believe these critics. \nDon't let those poisoned words take root in your heart.\n  As you hear of the 2,048th soldier lost, there is another number that \ndemonstrates the protection of Americans here, and the preservation of \nfreedom around the world. And that number, as best we can ascertain, \nstood at 450 last month.\n  Over 450 suicide bombers have attacked in Iraq. That is over 450 \nsuicide bombers who did not strike at America's homeland, did not \nstrike at our embassies, our ships, our civilians around the globe. It \nis your sons and daughters who have protected America from these 450 \nplus suicide bombers.\n  The suicide bomber represents that greatest threat to America, to \ndemocracies, to civilized society, and to peace. Stopping suicide \nbombers from attacking America and our allies is the foremost goal of \nthe War on Terror. Without terrorists, planes, trains, boats, cars, and \nbuses are moving gifts to society. Add a single terrorist, and they are \ntransformed into weapons of mass death and destruction.\n  With one suicide bomber, a stolen van filled with explosives cost the \nU.S. Embassy in Beirut 63 lives, including 17 Americans. With one \nsuicide bomber, a delivery truck took out the Marine Barracks in \nBeirut, costing the lives of 241 U.S. Marines. With just two suicide \nbombers, a small boat hit the U.S.S. Cole, killing 17 sailors. With \njust four suicide bombers, the London subway and buses became the final \ndestination for 52 civilians. With just 19 suicide bombers, four \nairliners made for one of America's darkest days by killing nearly \n3,000 innocent people.\n  The suicide bomber is the foremost weapon of terrorism today. So how \ncan anyone say that 450 ex-suicide bombers in Iraq has not protected \nAmerican lives?\n  Critics of this war insist that it is America's presence in Iraq that \nhas created the 450 plus suicide bombers in Iraq. Did America's \npresence in Iraq cause the attack on the World Trade Center in 1993? \nDid our presence in Iraq compel terrorist to attack us on 9/11? The \nanswer is no. It was our existence in the world that compelled the \nterrorists to attack us, time and again. These suicide bombers existed \nand attacked America before, on, and after 9/11, and well before \nOperation Iraqi Freedom.\n  Frankly, I am stunned that after 9/11 that anyone in a position of \npower would assume the peaceful intentions of one suicide bomber, much \nless each and every one of the 450 ex-suicide bombers in Iraq.\n  So I believe that 450 fewer suicide bombers does make America safer, \nand our brave men and women in uniform serving in Iraq have protected \nAmerica from these cowards.\n  On the Marine Corps website is a story about Lance Corporal Dan \nWilliams, a 22-year-old intelligence analyst from Murrysville, PA with \nthe 1st Battalion, 6th Marine Regiment currently conducting security \nand stability operations in and around Fallujah. Part of Lance Corporal \nWilliams' mission is to piece together fragments of data on terrorist \nidentities, connections, and locations. This information is used to \ndetermine where and when to apprehend these individuals, and what type \nof threat they may face upon arrival. Since his unit arrived in Iraq in \nmid-March 2005, Lance Corporal Williams and his fellow Marines have \nhelped to apprehend dozens of insurgent supporters and to unearth \nseveral weapons caches in the area.\n  As for this fight for freedom, we now have a democratically-elected \nconstitution in place in Iraq. Will freedom and democracy take root and \nflourish in Iraq?\n  We cannot say right now. But, when we laid to rest the 1,500 American \nsoldiers that perished on D-Day in the grave at Normandy, no one could \nsay whether freedom would take in post-Nazi Germany. When we laid to \nrest those 6,891 fallen soldiers at Iwo Jima, no one could say that \nmilitaristic Japan would become a democratic nation. None of those tens \nof thousands who fought and died in the hot chapter of the Cold War \nknew that freedom would ever arise behind the Iron Curtain, much less \nsurvive. And even here in America, as we buried the 4,435 lost in total \nat Concord, Lexington, Bunker Hill, Trenton, Princeton, Bennington, \nCowpens, and Yorktown, no one could say for certain that a government \nof, for, and by the people would take. But it did.\n  Each of those who died in all these battles never knew if freedom and \nliberty would result from their sacrifice. Rather, they died for the \nhope and dream that it might exist and flourish, both here and \nelsewhere for our fellow man.\n  It is so unfortunate that so often critics of this war fail to tell \nthe stories of success coming out of Iraq; the stories which prove that \nour U.S. servicemembers are working with the\n\n[[Page S12560]]\n\nIraqis to help them to sustain this newfound freedom by helping the \nstrengthen their armies.\n  The stories of success from our soldiers and sailors in Iraq need to \nbe told. Our soldiers need to know that their bravery and hard work in \nIraq is not in vain.\n  This new chance for freedom in this part of the world is due entirely \nto the sacrifice of our soldiers and sailors, and their families.\n  I say to our servicemen and women and your families--Our nation owes \nyou our gratitude, and we honor you for bestowing the immeasurable gift \nof freedom. We thank each and every one of you.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Pennsylvania \nfor talking about what our people with boots on, on the ground in Iraq, \nare saying and what they are seeing.\n  I think it is important that we talk to them about the feelings in \nAmerica because some people might get a misimpression if they listened \nto people who actually put forward the idea that we would cut and run \nfrom something that was started for all the right reasons--to protect \nAmericans.\n  The President, knowing what happened on 9/11, was determined that he \nwas not going to have another terrorist attack on America with weapons \nof mass destruction. That is why we went into the Middle East. We took \non Saddam Hussein, who was known to have, from many different sources, \nweapons of mass destruction.\n\n  So we are there, and our troops are doing a great job. We are \nbuilding the confidence in Iraq. You can see it from the people who are \nvoting with their feet. They are walking to the polls and voting. Even \nunder threat of death, they are working to establish a democracy. They \nare defying the terrorists. They know what the terrorists are doing to \ntheir country, and they are fighting back. And we are going to stand \nand fight with them, as we promised we would do.\n  I want to talk about this picture. It says more than any words ever \ncould. Michael Yon is a former Green Beret who has been out of the \nservice for years. He is also a gifted photographer and writer. He was \nembedded in Iraq for 9 months earlier this year. He learned about the \narea, the people, the unit in which he was embedded, and the situation \nin Iraq. His photographs capture an honest and inspiring message about \nour soldiers' service in Iraq, the mindset of the terrorists we are \nfighting, and what this war is all about.\n  I would like to read Michael's own words describing what happened on \nSaturday, May 14, 2005, in Mosul, just before he took this \nheartbreaking picture:\n\n       Major Mark Bieger found this little girl after the car bomb \n     that attacked our guys while kids were crowding around. The \n     soldiers have been angry and sad for two days. They are angry \n     because the terrorists could just as easily have waited a \n     block or two and attacked the patrol away from the kids. \n     Instead, the suicide bomber drove his car and hit the Stryker \n     when about twenty children were jumping up and down and \n     waving at the soldiers.\n       Major Bieger, I had seen him help rescue some of our guys a \n     week earlier during another big attack, took some of our \n     soldiers and rushed this little girl to our hospital. He \n     wanted her to have American surgeons and not go to the Iraqi \n     hospital. She didn't make it. I snapped this picture when \n     Major Bieger ran to take her away.\n       The soldiers went back to the neighborhood the next day to \n     ask what they could do. The people were very warming and \n     welcomed us into their homes, and kids were actually running \n     up to say hello and to ask soldiers to shake hands.\n       Eventually, some insurgents must have realized we were back \n     and started shooting at us. The American soldiers and Iraqi \n     police started engaging the enemy and there was a running gun \n     battle. I saw at least one Iraqi police who was shot, but he \n     looked okay and actually smiled at me despite the bullet hole \n     in his leg. I smiled back.\n       One thing seems certain: The people in that neighborhood \n     share our feelings about the terrorists. We are going to go \n     back there, and if any terrorists come out, the soldiers hope \n     to find them. Everybody is still very angry that the \n     insurgents attacked us when the kids were around. Their day \n     will come.\n\n  Mr. President, it is stories like this one that reaffirm why \nAmericans are so proud of our troops and proud of the Iraqi people for \nembracing democracy and supporting our efforts to defeat terrorism. \nU.S. troops are not seen as occupiers, as some in our country would \nhave you believe. Our soldiers are standing beside Iraqi forces, and \ntheir sacrifice to win the war on terror will never be diminished.\n  We are fighting an enemy who is willing to make a point of killing \ninnocent children. There will be no freedom if we cut and run. We know \nwhy we are there, and we will complete the mission.\n  This story shows so much about how our troops feel. And if any person \nin this country talks to troops who have returned from Iraq, they will \ntell you similar stories about the feelings of the Iraqi people. Iraqis \noften are under threat of death if they are talking to American \nsoldiers or trying to do something productive that would move their \ncountry forward, such as voting on a constitution, which they did in \ndroves. They are standing firm despite the threats.\n  Our troops are going through the process of teaching the Iraqi police \nand the Iraqi soldiers how to help themselves, how to work the \nequipment, and how to counter insurgents who would wait until children \nare in the picture before choosing to blow themselves up.\n  This is an enemy that we must not let stay on this Earth. We must \neradicate it wherever it is. And we must make sure that it does not \ncome to America because if this enemy would wait until children are \nsurrounding our soldiers to do their heinous crimes, what would they do \nif they came back to America to attack our people? How heinous would \ntheir crimes be here?\n  Our President is trying to make sure they do not have that \nopportunity, that they will not be able to perpetrate their horrible \nand indecent acts against the people of America on our soil. Our \nPresident is taking every step to assure that Americans are secure.\n  So I think it is time for us to stop the partisan bickering. No one \nin their right mind would suggest that this is a time for America to \nturn and run. So let's try to work together to make sure we are doing \neverything possible to help the Iraqi people get on their feet, hold \ntheir elections, and begin the process of self-government.\n\n       Nothing will eradicate terrorism more quickly than showing \n     that democracy and self-governance can work. That is what our \n     President is leading our country and our troops in the field \n     to provide: Safety and security for the Iraqi people so they \n     can govern themselves. The Iraqi people are moving forward \n     with a constitution they have written and they have voted \n     for, which will be followed by more elections of a parliament \n     and leaders who will take this constitution and make the laws \n     that will give freedom to every Iraqi. Freedom is something \n     which they have not known--many of them--in their lifetimes. \n     It is a worthy cause because it will also assure the security \n     of the American people in future generations.\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/11/09/senate-section/article/S12560-1", "month": "11", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12560]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, may I ask what the regular order is right \nnow, what the pending amendment is?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending amendment is the Ensign amendment \nNo. 2443.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2440\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside the \nEnsign amendment, and I send to the desk my amendment No. 2440 and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report.\n  The journal clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oklahoma [Mr. Inhofe], for himself and Mr. \n     Frist, proposes an amendment numbered 2440.\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n    (Purpose: To ensure by law the ability of the military service \n  academies to include the offering of a voluntary, nondenominational \n               prayer as an element of their activities)\n\n       At the end of subtitle G of title X of division A, add the \n     following:\n\n     SEC. 1073. PRAYER AT MILITARY SERVICE ACADEMY ACTIVITIES.\n\n       (a) In General.--The superintendent of a service academy \n     may have in effect such policy as the superintendent \n     considers appropriate with respect to the offering of a \n     voluntary, nondenominational prayer at an otherwise \n     authorized activity of the academy, subject to such \n     limitations as the Secretary of Defense may prescribe.\n       (b) Service Academies.--For purposes of this section, the \n     term ``service academy'' means any of the following:\n       (1) The United States Military Academy.\n       (2) The United States Naval Academy.\n       (3) The United States Air Force Academy.\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, even though the Founding Fathers were very \nclear and spoke of ``Nature's God'' and of the ``Creator'' in the \nDeclaration of Independence, the Federal courts are increasingly trying \nto drive every vestige of faith from public life.\n  On April 30, 2003, came an example from the Fourth Circuit Court of \nAppeals.\n  As the Boston Globe reported it:\n\n       Judges bar prayer at public colleges. In a precedent-\n     setting ruling against prayer at a State college, a Federal \n     appeals court has barred the Virginia Military Institute from \n     writing and reciting a prayer before cadets eat their evening \n     meals.\n\n  VMI and then the Citadel down in South Carolina have scrapped their \nprayers since that Federal court ruling, though Justice Stevens \ndeclared:\n\n       There is no injunction presently barring VMI from \n     reinstituting the supper prayer.\n\n  The Naval Academy in Annapolis has also been reviewing its policy. \nThe ACLU, the American Civil Liberties Union of Maryland, is calling on \nthe academy to review its practices of leading the students in prayer.\n  Jeff Jacoby is a columnist for the Boston Globe who wrote in 1996:\n\n       Have you heard about the Virginia politician who wanted \n     references to God injected into the Declaration of \n     Independence? Or about the activist from Massachusetts who \n     urged making the Fourth of July a quasi-religious holiday? \n     These proposals were made 220 years ago. Today they would be \n     swiftly denounced by the ACLU, the Democratic Congressional \n     Campaign Committee, and a slew of editorial pages.\n\n  It was just last year that the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled \nto have ``under God'' taken from our Pledge of Allegiance.\n  We go around, as I do in my State of Oklahoma, spending a lot of time \ntalking to people. I know what we do up here is significant. We pass \nlaws. We have a lot of rules and regulations coming out of the White \nHouse, out of the various committees, including the one I chair, the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee, but when you are on the street, \nit is the legislating from the bench that bothers people more than \nanything else. And certainly taking ``under God'' out of our Pledge of \nAllegiance is right at the top of that list.\n  Now, I agree with my friend in the other body, Congressman Walter \nJones, who has led this fight in the House of Representatives, when he \nasks the question:\n\n       How much longer will we stand by and allow others to ignore \n     the very God upon whom our Nation was founded?\n\n  I also agree with the position of the Concerned Women for America \nthat:\n\n       Prayer is essential to the protection of our families, our \n     communities and our nation. We believe that the men and women \n     who put themselves in harm's way have the right to give \n     public thanks to God and ask for His blessings. But some are \n     trying to take this right away.\n\n  Ronald Ray and Linda Jeffrey of Concerned Women for America recap:\n\n       On July 11, 2005 the Marine Corps Times announced the Anti-\n     Defamation League's reissued call to cease the traditional \n     noon-meal prayer at the Naval Academy, and the Academy's \n     refusal to surrender. The ADL's demands echo the April of \n     2003 complaint by the ACLU, which could not find a \n     plaintiff to pursue a lawsuit.\n\n  This is kind of interesting. The ACLU was trying to find one cadet at \nthe Naval Academy to act as a plaintiff. They couldn't find one.\n  Take a good look at this painting by Arnold Frieberg of ``The Prayer \nat Valley Forge.'' Since the time of George Washington and the founding \nof our country, there is unbroken historic precedent of leader-led \nprayer sustaining American fighting men on the battlefield through \nevery American war. In his Farewell Address, George Washington said:\n\n       I consider it an indispensable duty to close this last \n     solemn act of my official life by commending the interests of \n     our dearest country to the protection of Almighty God and \n     those who have the superintendence of them into his holy \n     keeping.\n\n  On the 4th of July, John Adams of Massachusetts said:\n\n       It ought to be commemorated as the day of deliverance, by \n     solemn acts of devotion to God Almighty.\n\n  The centrality of prayer for the protection of those in peril upon \nthe sea and acknowledgment of divine providence is an official tenet of \npreparation of the American military. America's dependence upon prayer \nexhibits itself before, and in the Declaration of Independence, and in \nthe Inaugural Address of every President. Congress opens each day with \na prayer. The tradition of prayer continued on June 6, 1944, when \nPresident Roosevelt led the entire Nation in prayer during his radio \naddress, lifting up our assault forces and the families of those who \nwould give the supreme sacrifice in the D-Day invasion. The President \ndid that before the invasion.\n  During World War II, GEN George Patton led the famous prayer for \nfavorable weather during the crucial 1944 Battle of the Bulge, and the \nweather dramatically improved. Patton issued 3,200 training letters to \nofficers and chaplains in the Third Army to ``urge, instruct, and \nindoctrinate every fighting man to pray as well as to fight.'' That is \nGeorge Patton.\n  In one of the largest social science research projects in history, \nthe Social Science Research Council reported after World War II that \nsoldiers selected prayer most frequently as their source of combat \nmotivation. From 1774 until today, more than 67 Armed Forces prayer \nbooks have been widely and efficiently distributed to our fighting \nforces during war, from the American war for independence to the war on \nterror we are fighting today.\n  A sampling of just two prayer books distributed during World War II \nand the Korean war contain recommended prayers from 34 senior uniformed \nmilitary authorities, including Bradley, Eisenhower, MacArthur, \nMarshall, and Patton.\n  Former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, Admiral Thomas Moorer, \nconcludes:\n\n       Prayer for the common good and acknowledgment of Divine \n     Providence is a central, official and historic tenet of the \n     combat leadership preparation for the American Military, \n     particularly officer training and particularly in times of \n     national peril or war.\n\n  Our Constitution demands the freedom to worship freely, and our \nfuture leaders, our men and women in military academies across the \ncountry, may soon be denied that freedom for which many have died to \nensure that freedom for all of us.\n  Last year, 2004, the Supreme Court decided not to hear the ACLU \nchallenge to cadet-led prayers at Virginia Military Institute. VMI, \nthat is where it all started. That decision allowed the Fourth Circuit \nCourt of Appeals decision to stand which prohibited VMI from sponsoring \na daily supper prayer. Right after that, the Citadel followed their \nlead.\n  Supreme Court Justice Stevens pointed out in his decision for the \nmajority not to hear the case that, in contrast, the Sixth and Seventh \nCircuit Courts have rejected challenges to nondenominational prayer at \nthe college level, reasoning that ``college-age students are not \nparticularly susceptible\n\n[[Page S12562]]\n\nto pressure from peers towards conformity.''\n  It is important to acknowledge here that the Sixth and Seventh \nCircuits, as well as the Fourth Circuit, all agree that there is not a \nproblem in our colleges and universities. The VMI prayer was voluntary. \nStevens states that there is no ``direct conflict among Circuits,'' \nrelying on the factual differences between the cases in the different \ncircuit courts.\n  Justice Scalia writes, however, that ``the basis for the \ndistinguishing--that this was a separate prayer at a state military \ncollege, whereas other cases involved graduation prayers at state \nnonmilitary colleges--is, to put it mildly, a frail one.''\n  Scalia continues:\n\n       In fact, it might be said that the former is more, rather \n     than less, likely to be constitutional since group prayer \n     before military mess is more traditional than group prayer at \n     ordinary state colleges.\n\n  That is the state of the law today. Currently, they are not praying \nat VMI and at the Citadel. There is some problem at the Naval Academy.\n  Frustrated by the failure to find anyone in the Naval Academy to \nserve as a plaintiff, the ACLU now asks the Armed Services Committee of \nthe Congress to take action. My amendment is designed to send an \nunsubtle signal to any court that entertains an ACLU suit against the \nmilitary academies. It will stand as an indication of congressional \nintent on the matter. That is important. A lot of times congressional \nintent is not. However, when it is stated, when a decision is being \nmade on a matter like this, it is significant. It is that intent that \nwe want to have as an amendment to the bill today.\n  Judges inclined to back mealtime prayer will be able to point to this \nlegislation as an argument for judicial deference to the will of \nCongress and the executive branch.\n  My amendment's language was in the House-passed version of last \nyear's National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 2005. This \nyear I want to see a recorded vote in the Senate to make clear exactly \nwho agrees with this provision and who does not and to show the \nstrength of support for this provision. While debating this National \nDefense Authorization Act, and hereafter, let us honor our heroes and \nthose who have returned home and those who sacrificed their lives by \nstanding against those liberals who would seek to challenge their God-\ngiven right to pray to a living Lord.\n  What I would like to do is yield the floor. First, I ask unanimous \nconsent that Senator Allard be added as a cosponsor of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Graham). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I understand Senator Warner, our distinguished chairman, \nwants to speak, as well as Senator Brownback.\n  I yield the floor and retain the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I commend our colleague. This is a very \nsignificant and important step that he has taken. I ask unanimous \nconsent to be added as a cosponsor on the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. The Senator from Kansas asked for a moment or two to \nspeak. I shall yield the floor at this point and then follow with my \nremarks. I first ask the Presiding Officer with regard to the time \nremaining for the proponents of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The proponents have 17 minutes 15 seconds \nremaining.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues from Oklahoma and \nfrom Virginia for allowing me to speak on this important amendment. \nThis morning, I started my day in the Senate as the Presiding Officer. \nI started it standing next to Chaplain Black, who is a Navy chaplain. \nHe gave the opening prayer for the Senate. We have had an opening \nprayer for many years. I found it inspiring, encouraging. I found it \nuplifting and important that we open this body with a prayer. We do so \non a daily basis. As I sat as Presiding Officer, I looked at the door \nopposite me. Right above it, on our mantlepiece, we have ``In God We \nTrust,'' as we have on our coinage and in our beliefs and hearts. To \nmany Americans, we are one Nation under God, indivisible, with liberty \nand justice for all.\n  It is with this in mind that I rise in support of the amendment of \nthe Senator from Oklahoma, No. 2440, that protects the ability of \nsuperintendents of military service academies to set appropriate \npolicies for the offering of voluntary nondenominational prayers at \nauthorized events. This is basic. It is important. It is the protection \nof the practice of religious liberties at our military institutions.\n  Prayer in military environments, as well as in public settings \ngenerally, has come into question in recent years. This amendment has \nspecific relation to the 2004 Supreme Court decision not to hear a case \nregarding the challenge by the American Civil Liberties Union to \nmealtime prayers at Virginia Military Institute.\n  This follows on a series of cases for 40 years now of an attempt by \nthe hard left in America to have a naked public square, to have no \nrecognition of a divine authority, to have no recognition of seeking a \ndivine authority or guidance, but a naked, sterile public square. That \nwas not contemplated in our Constitution. It called for a separation of \nchurch and state, but not the removal of church from state which is \nwhat this seeks to perpetuate.\n  The mealtime prayer at Virginia Military Institute was a respected \nand time-honored practice, a military institution that has played a \ncritical role in training U.S. military leaders for over 160 years. \nSadly, the majority decision of the Supreme Court not to hear the case \nallowed a decision by the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals to stand \nwhich prohibited VMI from sponsoring a daily supper prayer.\n  However, other circuit courts have rejected challenges to \nnondenominational prayer at the college level. And we should, too; we \nshould allow this prayer to take place. We shouldn't have a naked \npublic square. We should have a robust one that lifts up faith and \nlifts up the seeking of those to a higher moral authority.\n  Freedom of religion as protected in the U.S. Constitution does not \nrequire the removal of all religion from public settings. Such \nsecularity is not what our Founding Fathers envisioned when they \nestablished religious liberty as one of the basic tenets of the \nRepublic. I support the Senator from Oklahoma in his effort to clarify \nto the judicial branch and the military Congress's understanding of \nthis fundamental constitutional right with regard to military \nacademies. This is important. It is one of those things, as we try to \nstop this onslaught of the removal of religious liberty, which is what \nthe move is about and what the Senator from Oklahoma is trying to \nprevent, the removal of religious liberties, to allow the robust \npractice of religion, nondenominational, nonsectarian, yet seeking that \nGod in whom we trust.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, before the distinguished Senator from \nKansas leaves the floor, I want to speak to him about another matter. I \nask unanimous consent to go off this amendment for a brief period and \ncharge the time to me from the bill time so I may have a colloquy with \nmy good friend and colleague from Kansas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. The Senator has submitted to me an amendment which is in \nour allocation of 12 amendments regarding the notification that you \ndeem important with military families, should they seek to access a \nmilitary hospital for the performance of an abortion by a young person \nin that family. Am I generally correct about that?\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. That is correct.\n  Mr. WARNER. In studying the amendment over the night--now it is not \nthe pending amendment, but I want to bring these issues to the \nattention of the Senator, in fairness. The Senator, though, appreciates \nthat so many of these families, particularly those abroad, are often \nseparated because a spouse, male or female, as the case may be, the \nserving member in uniform, could be detached from the family homesite \nand sent into other areas of the globe for periods of time to\n\n[[Page S12563]]\n\nperform missions. For example, there is a number of families resident \nin Europe whose spouses are then part of cadres of individuals going \ninto the Iraq situation, some into the Afghan situation. That poses \nsome difficulty, as I see it, in trying to work out a communication \nbetween family members, which communication is relative to life and \ndeath, and very important.\n  I am concerned that we are reaching down to a very small number of \nindividuals, i.e., the military families, and could be imposing upon \nthem, should this amendment be adopted and become law, a difficult \nsituation. I am of an open mind, but I am concerned about having that \ntype of legislation on this bill.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. If I could respond to my colleague----\n  Mr. WARNER. And then if the Senator would address also the issue of \nthe U.S. Federal district court being a participant in this situation.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. This is a simple parental notification bill which we \nbrought up last time on the Department of Defense authorization bill \nand agreed to take it on last year because of desires to move the bill \nforward. We have worked on it a great deal. What it is about is if a \nchild, a dependent of military personnel, seeks an abortion, they have \nto get parental notification, which most Americans support. Most \nAmericans believe if their child is seeking a medical procedure of any \ntype, they should have parental notification take place.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, if I could interject at this time, \npersonally, my own philosophy is in agreement with the objective. My \nonly concern as manager of the authorization bill of the Department of \nDefense is that I cannot let my personal beliefs override my judgment \nas to how best to treat these families of our military.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I understand that my colleague from Virginia and I, \ntoo, have major military bases in our States. Fort Riley is growing in \nsize as an army unit. It is a place that has troops all the time in \nIraq and Afghanistan, so I see this on a personal basis in my State. \nBut I also see on a personal basis, if you are deployed there and you \nhave a minor child who is seeking an abortion, that you as the father \nor mother want to be notified about that, and we provide this to be \ndone telephonically so a person does not have to be present. The court \nitself would have to establish witness or evidentiary standards if they \nwant somebody to be present to be able to determine that this person is \nthere, is the actual one who is seeking this.\n  We also provide a system in here that a guardian is appointed if \nneeded, and that can be done by the district court without the approval \nof the parents, but they have to go through that procedure to be able \nto get this done.\n  We have worked to try to make this work with personnel. I think it is \ngoing to happen in a limited number of settings, but it will happen. It \nis a Federal issue because it is Federal property, Federal employees, \nand it is something I think we should do for military personnel so they \nare in charge of their child's upbringing, and particularly on \nsomething such as this of a significant medical procedure of an \nabortion. So we try to take into consideration the very legitimate \nconcerns of the Senator in putting this forward.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, again, I strongly support the principle \nand the goals the Senator is seeking, but I have to be mindful of the \npracticalities of military life. It is so different than the families \nwho are in our several States, wherever they may be, and that, of \ncourse, brings up another question. Suppose this particular military \nfamily's members are residents of a State, which State thus far has not \naddressed this issue. This State has no requirement for the parental \nconsent in that State, yet they are now being subjected to a Federal \nlaw which, of course, would have supremacy over the State law. But is \nthat not an invasive practice in the States rights?\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Again, it is a legitimate question the chairman asks \nin these troubling areas. We don't seem to have difficulty with this in \nany other medical procedure a minor child would ask for, that they have \nto get their parents' notification. If a child literally in many places \nhas even very minor surgery, they have to get parental notification. \nAnd yet because of the social difficulty and how much we wrestle with \nthe issue of abortion, they don't there, and they are using Federal \nfacilities to do this. I think this is wholly appropriate given the use \nof Federal facilities.\n  Remember, too, what we are protecting here is the right of the parent \ntoward their minor child. If the minor child has a very difficult \nrelationship with their parents, they can actually take it separately \nto the court and not have the parent get approval to do this. If I were \na military person, I would want something such as this, that I am in \ncharge of my minor child's upbringing, and particularly when it comes \nto surgery and something that is so important and difficult as an \nabortion. This is for the personnel.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I engaged my colleague to set forth my \nconcerns to other Members who are trying to evaluate their positions on \nthis amendment, should it come forward, and I anticipate at the \nappropriate time the Senator will be introducing it. I question is \nthere any precedent in Federal law for requiring parental notification, \nfor example, in Medicare, Medicaid, or Federal employee health \nprograms?\n  I have to move on to this amendment, but it is a series of very \nimportant fundamental questions that has to be addressed in the context \nof the Senator's amendment, despite my own personal view that I \nassociate myself with the Senator about the parental consent. \nConsistently I have voted for that here, but I have an overriding \nresponsibility for the men and women in the military, and this is very \nunique.\n  So I put this aside at this time, Mr. President, and return to the \nInhofe amendment. I thank my colleague.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. If I could respond to the last question. No, not \nFederal employees involved in Medicare and Medicaid, the other \nsituation. We are talking about Federal employees on Federal military \nfacilities. We are trying to protect the parents' rights in this, which \nthe chairman did not dispute, but others may dispute, and we still need \nto provide another procedure for the child to go outside the parents' \nrights. I think this is important, and we have tried to make it \nworkable within the military system.\n  I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank my colleague. We are going to move swiftly today, \nand issues could be brought up with very short time limitations on \ndebate. That has allowed me the opportunity to express my serious \nconcerns that I will have to address in the context of this amendment \nas the day progresses.\n  I ask unanimous consent we go back to the amendment by the Senator \nfrom Oklahoma, Mr. Inhofe.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2440\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I want to again thank my colleague from \nOklahoma. I think it is a very important amendment.\n  Mr. President, this is an issue that must be carefully balanced, the \nconstitutional guarantee of free exercise of religion and the \nconstitutional prohibition against the establishment of religion. But \nit is a longstanding tradition at these academies, and I think the \namendment is carefully drafted to strike a balance in those two \nimportant considerations.\n  Moreover, this amendment deals with the particular circumstances and \nenvironment that exist at our service academies, those honored \ninstitutions with long and storied traditions that have the mission of \ntraining our next generation of military leaders. A part of that \nmission is now and always has been the development of moral character \nand the appropriate respect for religious beliefs and needs of others \nwho are entrusted with their leadership.\n  I must draw a little bit on my modest experience in service on active \nduty in periods of two wars. I can tell you my own observation of the \nimportance of religion to individuals, particularly those serving \noverseas, and the hardships they endured either from family separation \nor combat situations or other difficult problems. It is a very deep \nfeeling these many individuals have about their respective religious \ntraditions and family traditions in religion, and it has often been a \nmatter of life and death to some individuals. Clinging to those strong \nbeliefs has\n\n[[Page S12564]]\n\npulled them through difficult situations.\n  I also stop to think about our academies. I have had the privilege \nover the years to visit all of them. I think particularly of the Naval \nAcademy and its magnificent chapel. People come from all over the world \nto see the chapel at the U.S. Naval Academy. Just this year I was \nprivileged to be the keynote speaker at the dedication of a new small \nentrance at the Naval Academy where those of the Jewish faith can go \nand quietly exercise their religion and share their prayers. I \nencourage anyone in that area to go and look at these two edifices. To \nme they symbolize the importance of religion in our military life.\n  I commend the Senator from Oklahoma.\n  I have been informed by the distinguished ranking member that there \ncould be an amendment in the second degree and that individual who \nwould bring it forth is due here in about 20 or 30 minute is my \nunderstanding, at which time I hope we could finish addressing this \namendment such that the Senate could vote presumably on the second-\ndegree amendment and then the underlying amendment prior to the noon \nperiod, although we will not stop consideration of the bill at the time \nbut would continue. But I hope that amendment could be agreed to.\n  I see the distinguished ranking member.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I appreciate the chairman's comment. I do \nhope and believe that Senator Reed will in about half an hour be able \nto address the issue. I can't commit to a vote, however, as indicated \nby the chairman. I believe there is some scheduling issue on this side \nwhich may preclude a vote at the time hoped for by the chairman. But \nlet me work that issue the best I can as to when the vote would come on \nthis amendment.\n  I believe Senator Craig may have an amendment----\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, before we depart, I hope the Senator could \nshare with me and the Republican leadership, with the understandable \nimpediments our two leaders have, with regard to votes and scheduling \nthem. We want to try to----\n  Mr. LEVIN. I hope we could stack votes at some point, including a \nvote on the Inhofe amendment with a second-degree possibility and \nalso----\n  Mr. WARNER. And the Ensign amendment.\n  Mr. LEVIN. And the Ensign amendment as well. I have talked to Senator \nCraig and you have apparently.\n  Mr. WARNER. I have. It is such that you and Senator Craig can discuss \nthat amendment.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, may I inquire as to the order appropriate \nthat we would discuss and bring up this amendment?\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending amendment be \nlaid aside to consider amendment No. 2437.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Reserving the right to object, let me ask the author of \nthe request what the intention is because I want to continue with my \ndiscussion. About how much time does the Senator want to take for \nconsideration of the amendment?\n  Mr. CRAIG. I think less than 2 minutes could solve this issue and we \ncould return to the Senator's amendment.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I have no objection.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Senator Cornyn be added as a cosponsor \nof my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, we have a technical problem we have to \naddress with regard to the UC request; that is, we are operating this \nbill under a UC, 12 amendments each side. This is not 1 of the 12.\n  Mr. CRAIG. That is correct.\n  Mr. WARNER. Therefore, I think we could go on the bill time for the \npurpose of discussing the Senator's amendment in the hopes what \ndifferences remain could be reconciled so this amendment could be \nincluded as part of the managers' agreed-upon package.\n  Mr. President, let the record reflect we are not calling this \namendment up within the context of the UC which controls the overall \nprocedure of this bill but that the two Senators are simply having a \ncolloquy, which is fine.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, that is, of course, the order. I thank the \nchairman for correcting us in that because we are operating on the \nbroader bill, the underlying bill, under a UC.\n  This amendment was brought forth with the hope that both sides could \naccept it. Our side has accepted it. I worked with the ranking member, \nSenator Levin, to resolve a couple of issues in it that I think can be \naccepted. In that case, I hope it will appear in the managers' \namendment.\n  We would include in the amendment--and we are discussing those who \nare eligible to be buried in military cemeteries. We have a prohibition \nnow against those with a Federal capital offense lying at rest in our \nmilitary cemeteries. We found this summer that an individual who had \nbeen convicted of murder in two instances in Maryland, serving his life \nsentence in a Maryland prison, died and was buried in Arlington. We \nwant to correct that by saying that Federal or State law, where the \nfinal decision--he is found guilty even under appeal--it has to be a \nfinal decision in that instance, and that under extraordinary \ncircumstances, even though he might be convicted, a Governor or a \nPresident would commute the sentence. That would be the exception.\n  I would be willing to agree to those two items to be included in the \namendment if that is acceptable to all parties, and we would so craft \nit that way.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Idaho. The two \nchanges we have proposed to the amendment make it clear that the \nconviction of a capital offense, as referred to, could either be State \nor Federal, would have to be a final conviction so there is no appeal \npending or a pending court challenge. And it provides for the \npossibility of a commutation of that sentence by a Governor or the \nPresident.\n  With those two changes, it will be acceptable to us, and we can agree \nit will be part of a managers' package. There was no intent that this \nbe 1 of the 12.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, may I inquire of the proponent of the \namendment, I heard him use the term ``military cemeteries.'' There are \nState and Federal cemeteries. This amendment is directed at Federal \ncemeteries?\n  Mr. CRAIG. It is the only one over which we have jurisdiction; that \nis correct.\n  Mr. LEVIN. As I understand it, national cemeteries, Federal \ncemeteries are governed by the amendment. With those changes, we will \nnot object to the amendment. In fact, I think there will be good \nsupport for it. Senator Mikulski, as I understand, is a supporter of \nit.\n  One other comment, Mr. President. It is my understanding that both \nthe veterans organizations and the Veterans' Affairs Committee support \nthis amendment; is that accurate?\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, that is correct. Full disclosure here: \nThere is always concern when you restrict access for purposes of \nburial, but because we have already established that in Federal law and \nthis appeared to be a loophole, which it was, and an individual, as I \nso stated, who was convicted of murder in two instances in Maryland was \nburied this summer in Arlington Cemetery, they understand that clearly, \nthey appreciate that correction. And I am very specific in my \ndiscussions with the Senator from Michigan that we are talking about \ncapital offenses--not all felonies, capital offenses of this kind.\n  I thank both of my colleagues for helping us work out this issue. I \nhope this could be included in the managers' amendment.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield further, we have \nhad a discussion, and I received the assurance from Senator Craig, \nwhich I very much welcome, that it is not his intent that this lead to \na broadening of this prohibition to include all felonies, but it is his \nintent, both in the amendment and his personal view, that this should \nbe limited to the capital offense as identified in the amendment.\n  Mr. CRAIG. That is correct.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I would like to join Senator Craig as a \ncosponsor on this amendment.\n  This is an example which other Senators may wish to access as to how \nthe\n\n[[Page S12565]]\n\ntwo managers are willing to work in open colloquy on areas where there \nare amendments outside the framework of the 12 on each side which could \npossibly be reconciled, and a part of that reconciliation process would \nbe the need for an open colloquy. This is a format the Senator from \nMichigan and I are pleased to entertain where there are other \namendments that a colloquy in open session would be helpful in trying \nto reach a reconciliation.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I thank the chairman of the full committee \nand the ranking member for their accommodations.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, we thank the Senator from Idaho for \nbringing this to the attention of the Senate and for making this \ncorrection.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, it is also important, with my colleague on \nthe floor, that we are bound by this UC, 12 amendments on each side, \nand as we bring up amendments, I carefully designate, as the Senator \nfrom Michigan does, that they are within the 12 each side has.\n  Mr. LEVIN. If the chairman will yield on that point because I wish to \naffirm and confirm what he has just said, that these colloquies, which \nare necessary for clearance of amendments, are very useful. We are used \nto this, all of us in the Senate, engaging in these kinds of \ncolloquies, and there is no intent, for instance, in this last \ncolloquy, that amendment be listed as 1 of the 12 amendments on the \nRepublican side.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, how much time remains on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 8 minutes 55 seconds remaining.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I don't know of anyone who is going to be \nwanting time to speak against this amendment. I inquire of the ranking \nmember if he knows of anyone who is going to be speaking in opposition \nto this amendment?\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I do believe there is at least one Member \non this side who will be offering or considering a second-degree \namendment.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Or another first-degree amendment. That is fine. In \nopposition to this amendment, though.\n  Mr. LEVIN. The second-degree amendment--however one wants to \ncharacterize it--I do understand there is a second-degree amendment \npossible.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I understand there is 8 minutes remaining; is that \ncorrect?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. LEVIN. So we do not mislead our friend from Oklahoma, there may \nvery well be Senators of whom I am not aware who would want to speak in \nopposition.\n  Mr. INHOFE. In that there is no one on the floor right now, if it is \nall right with the chairman and ranking member, I will conclude my \nremarks.\n  Mr. President, I have always enjoyed one-sentence amendments because \none can't misinterpret one sentence. I had one the other day that had \nto do with the appropriations process. I did one in 1994 that ended up \nbeing a major, significant reform in the other body.\n  I will read this so people don't misunderstand it:\n\n       The superintendent of a service academy may have in effect \n     such policy as the superintendent considers appropriate with \n     respect to the offering of a voluntary, nondenominational \n     prayer at an otherwise authorized activity of the academy. . \n     . .\n\n  Some people asked a question about denominational prayer. Let me \nshare with you--and I think I can read it in this period of time--an \nentire piece by John Adams. John Adams was the first Vice President of \nthe United States and the second President of the United States. This \nis what he said on this subject:\n\n       When the Congress met, Mr. Cushing made a motion that it \n     should be opened with prayer. It was opposed by Mr. Jay of \n     New York and Mr. Rutledge of South Carolina, because we were \n     divided in religious sentiments, some Episcopalians, some \n     Quakers, some Anabaptists, some Congregationalists, so that \n     we could not join in same set of worship. Mr. Samuel Adams \n     rose and said, that he was no bigot, and could hear a prayer \n     of any gentleman of piety and virtue, and at the same time a \n     friend to his country. He was a stranger in Philadelphia, but \n     had heard that Mr. Duche deserved that character and \n     therefore he moved that Mr. Duche, an Episcopalian clergyman, \n     might be desired to read prayer to Congress to-morrow \n     morning. The motion was carried in the affirmative.\n       Accordingly he . . . read several prayers in the \n     established form, and then read . . . the 35th Psalm. You \n     must remember this was the next morning after we had heard \n     the rumor of the horrible cannonade of Boston. It seemed as \n     if Heaven had ordained that Psalm to be read that morning.\n       After this, Mr. Duche, unexpectedly to everybody, struck \n     out into extemporary prayer, which filled the bosom of every \n     man present.\n       Here was a scene worthy of a painter's art. It was in \n     Carpenter's Hall, in Philadelphia. . . . Washington was \n     kneeling there, and Henry, and Randolph, and Rutledge, and \n     Lee, and Jay; and by them stood, bowed in reverence, the \n     Puritan patriots of New England, who, at that moment had \n     reason to believe that armed soldiery was wasting their \n     humbled households. It was believed that Boston had been \n     bombarded and destroyed. They prayed fervently for America, \n     for Congress. . . .\n\n  I think that is very significant.\n  I read an article the other day that was very interesting. It was an \narticle by a military historian who said that the Revolutionary War \ncould not have been won. He goes back and talks about the same thing \nthat John Adams was talking about, about this tremendous army, the \ngreatest military force on the face of this Earth marching up to \nLexington and Concord. Our soldiers at that time were not really \nsoldiers; they were hunters and trappers, and they were armed with just \nbasic and crude equipment. We remember the story that most of them \ncouldn't read or write.\n  So in training, I say to my friend from Texas, they put a tuft of hay \nin one boot and a tuft of straw in another boot, and they marched to a \ncadence of ``hay foot straw foot.'' As they stood there and heard the \nground shaking as the greatest army on the face of this Earth \napproached Lexington and Concord, they knew by resisting they were \nsigning their own death warrant. They knew when they heard the shot \nheard round the world they were going to win in spite of these odds, \nnot even knowing that a tall redhead stood in the House of Burgesses \nand made a speech for them and for us today, when he asked: How could \nthis frail group of patriots defeat the largest army on the face of \nthis Earth? He made a very famous speech, but there are three sentences \npeople have forgotten. They are:\n\n       Sir, we are not weak if we make a proper use of those means \n     which the God of nature has placed in our power. Three \n     millions of people armed in the holy cause of liberty, and in \n     such a country as that which we possess, are invincible by \n     any force which our enemy can send against us. Besides, sir, \n     we shall not fight our battles alone. There is a just God who \n     presides over the destinies of nations, and who will raise up \n     friends to fight our battles for us.\n\n  And they fired the shot heard round the world, and we won.\n  We were a nation under God, and we depended upon God to win that \nfight and every fight since then. That is why I think it is so \nimportant today, as a part of this reauthorization bill, that we \nreaffirm our ability to train our people at our academies to look to \nAlmighty God in the way they deem appropriate, in a way to use that \npower to defend America in their careers.\n  I retain the remainder of my time, Mr. President. I understand there \nis 3 minutes remaining.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 2 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, the distinguished Senator from Texas \ninquired of the managers if he could address an issue that is \ntangential to our national security. I ask unanimous consent that he be \nallowed to speak as in morning business, thereby not taking time off \nthe bill, and that would be for not to exceed 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Texas is recognized for 10 minutes.\n\n\n                     United States-India Relations\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished chairman of the \nSenate Armed Services Committee and the distinguished ranking member \nfor this accommodation. This is an important matter that does relate \ndirectly to our national security and that has to do with the \nremarkable progress that United States-India relations have made over \nthe last several years and the path that lies ahead.\n  As my colleagues know, Prime Minister Singh visited Washington in \nJuly for a historic state visit. This event marked a critical milestone \nin our improving relationship, but the Congress\n\n[[Page S12566]]\n\nneeds to help ensure that this relationship reaches its full potential. \nPresident Bush has made it a fundamental foreign policy objective to \nmove United States-India relations to a new level and plans to visit \nIndia in the near future.\n  India is the world's largest democracy, and our two great nations \nshare many common values and common beliefs. It is only appropriate, \nthen, that the United States and India become true strategic partners \nas we move into the 21st century. Fortunately, the days of the Cold War \nwhen the United States and India were at odds are long past. Today, the \nUnited States and India share a common vision for the future as we \nbattle terrorism together and the proliferation of weapons of mass \ndestruction, HIV/AIDS, and a host of other challenges that face our \nworld.\n  The United States is fortunate to have many Indian Americans who have \nhelped bring our two nations closer together. There are 2 million \npeople of Indian origin in the United States, approximately, many of \nwhom are now U.S. citizens. There are about 200,000 Indian Americans in \nmy State of Texas alone. Nearly 80,000 Indian students are studying in \nour Nation's colleges and universities. Their contributions to our \nNation and our relationship have been remarkably positive.\n  I will spend just a moment talking about an important agreement that \nwas reached last July between President Bush and Prime Minister Singh \nthat will require congressional approval to implement. This agreement, \nknown as the Civil Nuclear Cooperation Initiative, will help India with \nits energy needs and help bring India into the mainstream of \ninternational nuclear nonproliferation efforts, both of which are \nworthwhile goals.\n  While it is true that the agreement on civil nuclear cooperation is a \nsignificant departure from previous U.S. policy, still it represents a \npositive step as we grow in our strategic relationship with the nation \nof India. For more than 30 years, the United States and India have \ndisagreed over India's decision not to sign the Nuclear Non-\nProliferation Treaty. As such, the United States has not cooperated \nwith India on the issue of civilian nuclear power.\n  In short, we have been at a stalemate, which has neither served our \nnonproliferation goals nor helped India's need for energy resources. \nFortunately, a civil nuclear cooperation agreement will allow us to \nmove forward in a way that serves both the interests of the United \nStates and the interests of India.\n  In order to implement this agreement, Congress will need to approve. \nThe fundamental question before Congress will be why should we allow \ncivilian nuclear cooperation with India when they refuse to sign the \nNuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty? And will we not be somehow \nundermining our own nonproliferation efforts?\n  The fact is, this agreement will enhance our nonproliferation \nefforts. It is correct that India is not a signatory to the NPT. They \nhave decided, for their own national security reasons, that they will \nnot become a party to the treaty, and no amount of international \npressure, persuasion, or cajoling will convince them to do otherwise. \nThis is a reality which we face, but the status quo for another 30 \nyears is not acceptable either.\n  Recognizing this reality, we must ask ourselves what we can do to \npromote nonproliferation efforts with India and bring them within the \ninternational nonproliferation regime. The civil nuclear cooperation \nagreement provides the answer. Despite not signing the NPT, the Nuclear \nNon-Proliferation Treaty, India has an excellent nonproliferation \nrecord. They understand the danger of the proliferation of weapons of \nmass destruction, and that is why India has agreed to adhere to key \ninternational nonproliferation efforts on top of their own stringent \nexport control regime.\n  This is a significant step forward, which has been welcomed by the \nInternational Atomic Energy Agency Director, Mohamed El-Baradei, who \nunderstands that India will not come into the NPT through the normal \nroute. This agreement brings India's growing civilian nuclear \ncapabilities within international export control regimes. India will \nnow assume the same nonproliferation responsibilities that other \nnations have with civil nuclear energy. Specifically, India has agreed \nto identify and separate civilian and military nuclear facilities and \nprograms and file with the IAEA a declaration with regard to its \ncivilian facilities. It has agreed to place voluntarily its civilian \nnuclear facilities under IAEA safeguards. It has agreed to sign and \nadhere to an additional protocol with respect to civilian nuclear \nfacilities. And it has agreed to continue its unilateral moratorium on \nnuclear testing.\n  Furthermore, it has agreed to work with the United States for the \nconclusion of a multilateral fissile material cutoff treaty. It has \nagreed to refrain from the transfer of enrichment and reprocessing \ntechnologies to states that do not have them and support efforts to \nlimit their spread.\n  Finally, India has agreed to secure nuclear materials and technology \nthrough comprehensive export control legislation and adherence to the \nMissile Technology Control and Nuclear Suppliers Group.\n  Each of these commitments represents a positive step forward. India, \nwhich is no stranger to international terrorism itself, is motivated by \nits own security needs to fight proliferation of nuclear weapons. The \nsame is true of the United States. Both nations, as well, are dependent \non oil imports to satisfy the needs of their economies and to create \njobs for their people. Both nations, therefore, see in civilian nuclear \nenergy cooperation an opportunity to satisfy these growing energy needs \nwithout environmental hazards of relying solely on fossil fuels. In \nshort, this agreement is important to our growing international \nstrategic partnership and for India's domestic energy needs.\n  Although the administration's negotiations with the Indians are \nongoing regarding the implementation of these commitments, I am \nconfident that we are on the right track. I look forward to the role \nthat Congress will play in this important process.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I believe we are on the Inhofe amendment \npending before the Senate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2440\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise to address some of the issues that \nhave been presented by the amendment of Senator Inhofe. I do so with \nsome perspective on issues of prayer at service academies. I spent 4 \nyears as a cadet at West Point, 2 years as a faculty member at West \nPoint, and today I am the chairman of the board of visitors at West \nPoint. I am the first to recognize the importance of prayer, not only \nin the life of the service academies but in the life of people \neverywhere.\n  Over the course of 200-plus years of history, prayer has become an \nimportant aspect of life, not only at West Point but at Annapolis and \nother institutions.\n  Interestingly enough, when I was a cadet, there was a much more \nsignificant structure of religious participation. We were actually \nordered to go to chapel, ordered to participate in activities. That was \nstruck down in 1972 as an unconstitutional infringement.\n  This is a very difficult issue because it does implicate serious \nconstitutional concerns, as well as the desire to maintain the \ntraditions and the customs of the military and the service academies. \nInterestingly enough, my perspective now, after about 30 years, is that \nthe faith communities at West Point are even more vital and vibrant \ntoday than years ago when cadets literally were ordered to participate \nin religious activities. In fact, last summer, as part of the \noperations of the board of visitors, I asked that the chaplains come \ntogether on an informal basis, and we talked about religious \nparticipation at West Point. What I heard from the chaplains is that it \nis alive and well, that it is something important to the individual \nlives of cadets and to the community at West Point. That is why\n\n[[Page S12567]]\n\nI think, as we try to legislate these activities from the perspective \nof the U.S. Congress, we might be inviting more problems than we are \nsolving.\n  As I look at the amendment of Senator Inhofe, it speaks of voluntary, \nnondenominational prayer at otherwise authorized activities of the \nacademy, subject to the limitations of the Secretary of Defense, more \nor less. The real problem in the context of military activities is, \nwhat is voluntary? There is a strong sense that there is not much that \nis voluntary in the military. Anyone who has served on active duty \nunderstands that even in some cases volunteering isn't voluntary. I \nknow I had a first sergeant in the 82nd Airborne Division who would \nwalk in and pick three people and inform them they had just \nvolunteered. That is a cultural aspect and a legal aspect of military \nservice. So even though this speaks to voluntary, nondenominational \nprayer, the real issue in the context of the military is, Is it \nvoluntary?\n  That issue is now being debated. One of the reasons prompting this \nparticular legislative amendment is the fact that the Naval Academy has \nbeen questioned about a prayer at their luncheon meal. Whether it is \nnondenominational is not the point. The question is whether it is \nvoluntary. I do not think we are going to escape that analysis and that \nissue by passing this legislation. In fact, my fear is by passing this \nlegislation we are going to essentially invite litigation about a whole \nseries of religious expressions at service academies, not just prayer \nin the mess hall at lunch but prayer at graduation ceremonies, at \npromotion ceremonies--all of that.\n  Frankly, on a practical basis, this legislation is not necessary. \nFirst, the superintendents already have the authority to prescribe what \nis happening at the academies--either explicitly or implicitly the \ncurrent religious expression at the academies is being authorized by \nthe superintendents.\n  Also, I think, given the fact that they are doing this and it seems \nto be working fairly well, this legislation does not give them any more \nauthority than they have already. As I suggested previously, it raises, \ncertainly, the profile, so it might engender the kind of controversies \nthat will lead to seriously questioning and perhaps cutting back \nexisting religious expression at these service academies. So I do not \nthink, as a matter of either policy or of good sense, this legislation \nis in order or necessary.\n  In addition, what is happening at the academies now is not so much \nthe sole issue of the propriety of prayer or religious expression at \ndifferent authorized activities. There is another big issue out there \nthat we have to recognize. It comes from the recent activities at the \nAir Force Academy, where there have been serious reports about \nproselytization, of superior officers using their rank and position to \ntry to proselytize cadets, to try to insert in the activities of the \nacademy a pronounced and sectarian religious approach. I think we are \nall familiar with many of the stories from the Air Force Academy.\n  As a result, the Secretary of Defense has issued interim guidance \nwith respect to proselytization and other religious activities. I would \nnote that the language of Senator Inhofe recognizes the right of the \nSecretary of Defense to do that. In fact, I would assume it lends \nfurther support and credence to the guidance that he is developing and \nwill issue because, as the language says, ``subject to such limitations \nas the Secretary of Defense may prescribe.''\n  I think what we are seeing, in terms of this legislation, is several \nresults which might be unintended by those who are supporting it. \nFirst, I think rather than clarifying and settling the issue of \nreligious expression at the service academies, it will prompt further \ndiscussion, debate, and perhaps even litigation. Second, it does \nspecifically recognize that there is an ongoing process by the \nSecretary of Defense to redefine appropriate modes of religious \nexpression at the academies. And, as I read it, it does give sanction \nto those activities--in fact, legal sanction to those activities.\n\n  So for many reasons I think the legislation is not the most \nappropriate way to deal with this issue. Ultimately, my sense is that \nthese issues, because they are dominated by constitutional concerns, \nwill be settled in court, not by legislative enactment. There is \nnothing we could do legislatively to correct such constitutional \nfaults. I think to try to do that misconstrues what we are about and \nwhat we could practically do.\n  As a result, I hope this legislation could be withdrawn, but I \nsuspect that is not the case. So I think we should make some changes in \nthe legislation in that at least reflects the fact that all of us are \nbound by the Constitution of the United States.\n  Again, I have been involved with these academies since I was 17 years \nold. I have seen personally the important role that prayer and religion \nplay in the lives of cadets, soldiers, and officers. I recognize and \ncherish the customs of these academies, and these traditions. I think \nit is unfortunate that we may unwittingly be starting a dynamic that \nwill seriously erode these customs and traditions, and I think perhaps \nto the detriment of the academies and to the military service and to \nthe young men and women who proudly wear the uniform of our Armed \nForces. So I hope we can avoid that.\n  But I think, also, we have to recognize that we are all governed, \nparticularly when it comes to issues of prayer in the public space, by \nthe Constitution of the United States, and that there is nothing, as I \nsaid before, that we can do that can insulate activities within the \nmilitary from the Constitution. There is nothing we should do. I think \nwhatever language we adopt today has to more explicitly reflect that \nclear, and I think obvious, fact.\n  As I mentioned before, the Secretary of Defense is dealing today with \nthe issue of religious activities at the Air Force Academy. He has also \nindicated that, if his interim guidelines are practical, workable, and \nappropriate in his view, that he intends to extend those to the other \nservice academies, effectively doing what this legislation is proposing \nto do. I think we should give the Secretary of Defense a chance to do \nthat. I think he is working in a way that is evenhanded, appropriate, \nrecognizing that soldiers are bound by the Constitution. That is their \nduty. That is their obligation.\n  I say if we march down this road, I think we are raising serious \nissues that are going to complicate the facts even more than they are \ntoday. So I hope we could wait. I hope we could wait until these \nguidelines have been fully vetted by the Secretary and he has made a \ndecision with respect to their propriety, their appropriateness. \nIndeed, once again, as the amendment suggests, ultimately whatever the \nsuperintendents of the academies do will be subject to the guidance of \nthe Secretary of Defense. Frankly, that guidance today, if you look at \nit, is drawing mixed reviews from both the proponents of the separation \nof church and state and those who want a much more aggressive posture \nwhen it comes to religious expression in public places. Maybe that is a \ngood sign. Maybe the Secretary has struck that balance between the \nconstitutional demands of separation of church and state and the \nindividual's desires and needs to express themselves to the Divine.\n  I hope we could forbear on this one. If not, then I think we have to \nmake some changes in the text to reflect the overarching constitutional \nimperatives that are at the heart of this debate.\n  I retain the remainder of my time and yield the floor.\n  Mr. INHOFE. If the Senator will yield, I inquire of the Senator, he \nhas used some of the time in opposition speaking to this amendment. Is \nthe Senator's desire to have another amendment on the same subject to \nbe introduced separately from this?\n  Mr. REED. My preference would be to try to amend the Senator's \namendment.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, we have a problem.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I yielded to the Senator. Would he like to \nuse his time? I retain the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I understand I only have a couple of \nminutes left, so let me very quickly say right now: There is a problem. \nIn the Air Force all they have is a 20-second period of silence. I \ndon't call that a prayer. At West Point they do not even have a period \nof silence. They say you can pray, but everyone else is talking. This \nis not a prayer. I think a problem is there.\n\n[[Page S12568]]\n\n  I think the argument that this might raise the profile is not a valid \nargument. I have heard it before. In 2003 the ACLU requested \nspecifically that the prayers stop. In 2005 the Anti-Defamation League \ndid the same thing. The attack is there.\n  This is a very simple, one-sentence solution to the problem. At the \nappropriate time, in fact, right now, I urge the adoption of this \namendment and ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. MURKOWSKI). Is there a sufficient second? \nThere is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. It is not my intent to proceed until we start several \nvotes at a later time, I say to my good friend from Rhode Island.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, we need to inquire as to the issues of \nthe proponent of the amendment, as to the allocation of time. What is \nhis desire on that?\n  Mr. INHOFE. I would say to the chairman, I think the allocation of \ntime has already taken place. I have used my time. I have not yielded \nback the remainder of my time. I probably only have 30 or 40 seconds \nleft. It is my desire to get a vote on this amendment, if the \ndistinguished Senator from Rhode Island has an amendment that we get a \nvote on his amendment, and whatever the allocation of time is at that \npoint, we will exercise that.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, that sounds like a reasonable request. \nCan the Senator from Rhode Island advise the Senate?\n  Mr. REED. Let me understand. Is it in order now for me to propose a \nsecond-degree amendment which would then require just a short \nexplanation and debate, and then we can move to a vote on the second-\ndegree amendment, and then on the underlying amendment?\n  Mr. WARNER. That would be the desire of the manager.\n  I wish to inquire of the proponent. Does he agree to the course of \naction?\n  Mr. INHOFE. Would the Senator please repeat that course of action?\n  Mr. REED. We are agreeing, as I understand it, that as soon as the \nSenator yields his remaining time, it would be in order for me to offer \na second-degree amendment. I will do so. I will speak briefly on the \nsecond-degree amendment, and I think it would be in order to either \nentertain additional debate by the Senator from Oklahoma and others or \nto set a time for a vote.\n  Mr. INHOFE. My preference would be to go ahead and have this as a \nfirst-degree amendment, offering the amendment of the Senator from \nRhode Island as a first-degree amendment, and if he desires to have a \nvote on his first, I would have no objection.\n  Would that satisfy the Senator from Rhode Island?\n  Mr. REED. I think the most efficient course is simply to allow my \nsecond-degree amendment, allowing Members to vote essentially on my \namendment first, then voice vote the amendment of the Senator from \nOklahoma--if it succeeds, then the underlying amendment. That was my \npreference.\n  Mr. INHOFE. There would be side-by-side amendments.\n  Mr. REED. No. My preference is that we entertain a second-degree \namendment and vote, and if the second-degree amendment is agreed to, \nthen the underlying amendment would be voted on. There would be a \nseries of votes. Mine would be voted on first.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I object to that course.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I have read the suggested change that \nthe distinguished Senator from Rhode Island has to my amendment. If it \nis his intention not to offer another amendment on this subject matter \nbut merely to amend mine, I will accept that. I would yield the \nremainder of my time, and we would have one vote to take care of it.\n  Mr. REED. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REED. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REED. Madam President, the Senator from Oklahoma has offered to \nmodify his amendment the way I suggested and then, having modified the \namendment, schedule votes. I have no objection to that.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, that seems very acceptable to me.\n  I will read the modification on page 2 of the amendment. On line 2, \ninsert the following: ``the United States Constitution and . . . '' I \nhave no objection to that.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 2440, as Modified\n\n  I send this amendment to the desk and ask unanimous consent that it \nbe so modified.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 2440), as modified, is as follows:\n\n    (Purpose: To ensure by law the ability of the military service \n  academies to include the offering of a voluntary, nondenominational \n               prayer as an element of their activities)\n\n       At the end of subtitle G of title X of division A, add the \n     following:\n\n     SEC. 1073. PRAYER AT MILITARY SERVICE ACADEMY ACTIVITIES.\n\n       (a) In General.--The superintendent of a service academy \n     may have in effect such policy as the superintendent \n     considers appropriate with respect to the offering of a \n     voluntary, nondenominational prayer at an otherwise \n     authorized activity of the academy, subject to the United \n     States Constitution and such limitations as the Secretary of \n     Defense may prescribe.\n       (b) Service Academies.--For purposes of this section, the \n     term ``service academy'' means any of the following:\n       (1) The United States Military Academy.\n       (2) The United States Naval Academy.\n       (3) The United States Air Force Academy.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I thank my two colleagues.\n  Have the yeas and nays been ordered?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  I am about to propound a unanimous consent request which I understand \nis cleared on both sides.\n  I ask unanimous consent that at 2:45 today, the Senate proceed to a \nvote in relation to the Inhofe amendment No. 2440, as modified, to be \nfollowed by a vote in relation to the Ensign Amendment, No. 2443; \nprovided that there be 6 minutes for debate equally divided in the \nusual form prior to the first vote and 6 minutes equally divided for \ndebate prior to the second vote, with no second degrees in order to \neither amendment prior to the vote.\n  Mr. DAYTON. Madam President, reserving the right to object.\n  Mr. WARNER. I think we are cleared.\n  Mr. DAYTON. We need to discuss the amount of time on the Ensign \namendment.\n  Mr. WARNER. I think everything has been cleared.\n  Mr. DAYTON. No objection.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Madam President, prior to having the 6 minutes prior to \nthe vote but between now and the time that votes will occur, will there \nalso be time to debate my amendment?\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I presume there will be an opportunity. \nWe are making progress. But there are junctures at which time Senators \ncan address various aspects of the bill, including the distinguished \nSenator from Nevada.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Madam President, may I ask unanimous consent it be \nmodified so that at least 15 minutes between now and the vote would be \nreserved for debate on the Ensign amendment?\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I am willing to accede to that. Would \nthat time be equally divided?\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Yes.\n  Mr. WARNER. Fifteen minutes between now and 2:45 be reserved for a \ndebate on the Ensign amendment, 15 minutes equally divided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. I ask the Presiding Officer if that is in place, as \nmodified with the 15 minutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank the Chair.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1563, As Further Modified\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that the previously agreed to amendment No.\n\n[[Page S12569]]\n\n1563 be further modified. I send that modification to the desk. There \nwas a technical error in the preamble. There is no change in the \nsubstance of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 1563), as further modified, is as follows:\n\n       On page 357, after line 20, insert:\n\n                       PART II--NAVY CONVEYANCES\n\n     SEC. 2851. LEASE OR LICENSE OF UNITED STATES NAVY MUSEUM \n                   FACILITIES AT WASHINGTON NAVY YARD, DISTRICT OF \n                   COLUMBIA.\n\n       (a) Lease or License Authorized.--\n       (1) In general.--The Secretary of the Navy may lease or \n     license to the Naval Historical Foundation (in this section \n     referred to as the ``Foundation'') facilities located at \n     Washington Navy Yard, Washington, District of Columbia, that \n     house the United States Navy Museum (in this section referred \n     to as the ``Museum'') for the purpose of carrying out the \n     following activities:\n       (A) Generation of revenue for the Museum through the rental \n     of facilities to the public, commercial and non-profit \n     entities, State and local governments, and other Federal \n     agencies.\n       (B) Administrative activities in support of the Museum.\n       (2) Limitation.--Any activities carried out at the \n     facilities leased or licensed under paragraph (1) must be \n     consistent with the operations of the Museum.\n       (b) Consideration.--The amount of consideration paid in a \n     year by the Foundation to the United States for the lease or \n     license of facilities under subsection (a) may not exceed the \n     actual cost, as determined by the Secretary, of the annual \n     operation and maintenance of the facilities.\n       (c) Use of Proceeds.--\n       (1) Deposit of proceeds.--The Secretary shall deposit any \n     amounts received under subsection (b) for the lease or \n     license of facilities under subsection (a) into the account \n     for appropriations available for the operation and \n     maintenance of the Museum.\n       (2) Availability of amounts.--The Secretary may use any \n     amounts deposited under paragraph (1) to cover the costs \n     associated with the operation and maintenance of the Museum \n     and its exhibits.\n       (d) Additional Terms and Conditions.--The Secretary may \n     require such additional terms and conditions in connection \n     with the lease or lease of facilities under subsection (a) as \n     the Secretary considers appropriate to protect the interests \n     of the United States.\n\n                    PART III--AIR FORCE CONVEYANCES\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, we are making progress on this bill. I \nthank all Senators for their cooperation. It is my hope that in the \nintervening period between now and the hour of 2:45, subject to the \nunanimous consent of 15 minutes, that other Senators can come to the \nChamber and address the managers regarding the timing of the remaining \namendments under the unanimous consent providing 12 amendments on each \nside.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. DAYTON. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that Senators \nBurns, Thomas, Enzi, Dorgan, and Hatch be listed as original cosponsors \nof amendment No. 2448, which was agreed to yesterday by unanimous \nconsent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DAYTON. I thank the Chair.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2443\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, relative to the amendment of the Senator \nfrom Nevada, I had one question. Section 1 of Executive Order 11850 \nstates the following:\n\n       The Secretary of Defense shall take all necessary measures \n     to ensure that the use by the Armed Forces of the United \n     States of any riot control agents and chemical herbicides in \n     war is prohibited unless such use has Presidential approval \n     in advance.\n\n  Is there anything in the Senator's amendment which purports or is \nintended to modify or change in any way that executive order?\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Madam President, I say to my friend from Michigan, our \namendment seeks to clarify and to reinforce the Executive Order No. \n11850, including section 1, as well as the examples in (a), (b), (c), \nand (d), used as examples where the riot control agents are able to be \nused.\n  It is very clear that our military is allowed to use riot control \nagents based on this Executive order in these particular examples as a \ndefensive mode to save civilian lives, for example.\n  We are trying to clarify for our military and ask the Defense \nDepartment to lay out clear guidelines and clear training so the \naverage person on the ground knows exactly when they can and when they \ncannot use these riot control agents.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I agree with that purpose. I want to be absolutely certain \nthat all parts of the Executive order, including the specific \nrequirement of section 1, continue and are not purported in any way to \nbe changed by the Senator's amendment.\n\n  Mr. ENSIGN. The Senator is correct; we are not trying to change any \npart of the Executive order. All we are trying to do is to clarify it \nso the average soldier, marine on the ground knows exactly when they \ncan and when they cannot use it.\n  We are calling on the Defense Department to clarify for them so this \nvery valuable tool to save lives, both civilian and military, can be \nemployed for a defensive purpose.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I believe that is a very useful purpose. I support that \npurpose. I support the Senator's amendment with that assurance. I don't \nknow whether the Senator requested a rollcall, but if so we will \nsupport that rollcall.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Have the yeas and nays been ordered?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. They have not been ordered.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. I yield the floor.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 2473 to Amendment No. 2433\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, there is a pending amendment offered by \nSenator Chambliss numbered 2433 which I am going to seek to amend.\n  With the permission of the Presiding Officer, I would speak to that \nissue at this moment. We are working with the Parliamentarian on the \nexact number of this amendment we will be offering. There is no \nagreement at this time. If I might, I want a few minutes to speak to \nthe amendment I am offering, if that would meet with the approval of \nthe Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. I have spoken to the manager of the bill, and he would \nlike to accommodate the ability of the Senator to have the secondary \namendment offered before all time is yielded back. When the Senator is \nready--I have spoken to the chairman and he is willing to work on that.\n  Mr. DURBIN. For the information of my colleagues, the amendment we \nare going to offer to the Chambliss amendment is designated as 2473.\n  Madam President, most Senators are probably unaware of the real \ndifferences between the military retirement system for Reserve \ncomponents compared to Active components of our military forces. A \nperson who joins the active-duty military and has 20 years has the \noption to retire at that point and draw half their pay. A young person \nat age 18, with 20 years in service--age 38, still relatively young, \nmoves on to a new career, new source of income--still receives half of \ntheir military pay.\n  For a member of the Guard and Reserve, it is different. As you might \nexpect, retirement pay from a part-time career is lower than at the end \nof a full-time active-duty career. It makes sense.\n  The major difference, however, lies in the length of time the \nreservist retiree must wait to start to receive retirement pay. Under \nthe current system, a person who completes 20 years in the Reserve \ncomponent becomes eligible to receive retired pay but cannot begin to \ndraw the pay until they reach the age of 60. In the Reserves, a young \nperson age 18 can enlist, complete 20 years of dedicated service to our \ncountry, and at the end of 20 years reach the age of 38 and retire. But \nthat person has to wait 22 years before receiving the first penny of \nretirement pay.\n  That is entirely too long. Many have recognized the system needs to \nbe changed. The Military Officers Association, Reserve Officers \nAssociation, National Guard Association, Enlisted Association, the \nNational Guard, all have called for Reserve retirement age to be\n\n[[Page S12570]]\n\nreduced from age 60 to 55. There have been several Senate proposals to \naccomplish it.\n  I offered this bill in the last Congress. Senators Corzine and Graham \nintroduced bills in the current Congress. I am a cosponsor of both \nbills. All are worthy approaches to accomplish our goal.\n  Unfortunately, the plan that has been offered in the form of the \namendment by the Senator from Georgia, Senator Chambliss, falls short \nof being a good age 55 Reserve retirement proposal. In fact, I have \nsome concerns and I offer an alternative approach. The Chambliss \namendment offered a modest reduction in the retirement age and then \nonly offers it to about half the members of the Guard and Reserve. \nUnder the Chambliss amendment, half of all reservists still draw no \nretirement pay until the age of 60. It rewards only those who are \ncalled up. There is little or no incentive to stay. This amendment \nlowers the retirement age for those called up for an extended period in \nsupport of major military operations and then only reduces the \nretirement age by 3 months for every 3 months the member spends on \nduty.\n  At this point, more than 450,000 reservists have been mobilized since \nSeptember 11, 2001. Over 330,000 have been deployed overseas. But we \nmust remember, there are roughly 860,000 members in the select Reserve. \nThat is, members of the National Guard and Reserve who dedicate a \nminimum in service in the Reserve of 1 weekend each month plus 2 weeks \neach year to maintain military readiness. So while roughly half of our \nreservists have been called up for duty, about half of them have not. \nThey have continued to perform every weekend, gone to their annual \ntraining periods.\n  For this segment of our dedicated force, I am afraid the Chambliss \namendment does nothing at all. A retirement system should create an \nincentive to serve. The Chambliss amendment rewards mobilization but \ndoes nothing to create the incentive for further service. It simply \nprovides a future benefit to those who get called up. We want to honor \nthe members of the Guard and Reserve who are selected in order to go \noverseas. Yes, we want to reward service that takes members of the \nGuard and Reserve away from their families and careers for a year and \nputs them in harm's way. But we must ask ourselves if such a modest \nadjustment in the retirement pay eligibility age is the best way to do \nit.\n\n  With recruiting targets being missed by our Reserve components and \nretention holding steady, but under severe pressures, what we need to \ndo is to revise the retirement system so that it is both fairer to \nmembers of the Guard and Reserve and a more powerful incentive to \ncontinued service. We should make changes to the system which reward \nlong and continued service, not just volunteering--or being \ninvoluntarily selected--for a mobilization.\n  We can do better for our men and women in uniform.\n  The amendment I offer is a substitute approach. Under my amendment, \nmembers of the National Guard and Reserve are encouraged to stay in the \nforce by offering them a 1-year reduction in the retirement age for \nevery year of service beyond 20 years. That is an incentive to stay in \nthe force. A reservist can begin to draw retirement pay as early as age \n55, but in order to do so, they would need to serve an additional 5 \nyears.\n  By providing a way for reservists to draw retirement pay at age 55 \nrather than being forced to wait until age 60, this amendment brings \nthe retirement age for reservists down to the Federal civil service \nretirement age, as was intended when the reservist retirement age was \nset 50 years ago. Our reservists make tremendous sacrifices. They risk \ntheir lives in combat zones. And, in far too many instances, they give \ntheir lives for our country. At the very least, they should have the \nsame retirement age as Federal civil servants.\n  By replacing the current, inflexible approach with a sliding scale \nthat provides earlier receipt of retirement pay in exchange for more \nyears of service, we can create a powerful system of incentives to \nretain our personnel and maintain a strong Reserve.\n  This is the approach my amendment takes.\n  Many of my Republican and Democratic colleagues who, like me, are \ncosponsors of S. 337, the Guard and Reserve Retention Act, introduced \nearlier this year by my friend and distinguished colleague, the Senator \nfrom South Carolina, will no doubt recognize this concept. The \nmechanisms are very similar.\n  I invite my colleagues from both sides of the aisle to join me in \nmaking a meaningful reform of the Reserve retirement age--one that \nencourages long and continued services, not simply rewarding after \nmobilization; one which will incentivize all of the force to stay in \nservice longer, not just the half--roughly, 50 percent--who are tapped \nfor a callup.\n  The amendment is endorsed by some significant groups: the National \nGuard Association of the United States, the Military Officers \nAssociation of the United States, the Reserve Officers Association, the \nEnlisted Association of the National Guard of the United States.\n  I ask my colleagues, as you consider the Chambliss amendment and my \nmodification to that amendment, keep in mind the organizations that \nrepresent the men and women in uniform in the Reserve, who are \nliterally serving our country and risking their lives, believe the \napproach I am suggesting is preferable. I hope my colleagues will feel \nthe same.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the letter from Stephen \nKoper, retired brigadier general from the U.S. Air Force, who serves as \npresident of the National Guard Association of the United States, be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         National Guard Association of the United States, Inc.,\n                                 Washington, DC, November 8, 2005.\n     Senator Richard Durbin\n     Dirksen Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Durbin: I am writing on behalf of the members \n     of the National Guard Association of the United States \n     (NGAUS) in support of your amendment to reduce the age at \n     which reserve component members receive their retirement \n     pension.\n       An active component member retiring at 20 years of service \n     may receive a pension immediately upon retirement. A reserve \n     component member serving the same amount of years cannot. \n     Reducing the age from 60 to 55 will be a big step in \n     mitigating this disparity. A more equitable retirement \n     program will aid greatly in recruiting and retaining members \n     in the National Guard. When the age limit for receipt of \n     retired pay by National Guard members was set decades ago, \n     the National Guard was not relied upon the way it is today.\n       The objective of NGAUS is to support the reduction of the \n     age for retirement eligibility from its current level.\n       I look forward to working together in support of a strong \n     and viable National Guard. Again, on behalf of the members of \n     NGAUS, thank you for all your hard work on our behalf.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Stephen M. Koper,\n                       Brigadier General, USAF, (Ret.), President.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, if there is no one prepared at this time \nto speak on the Durbin amendment, I ask unanimous consent that the \nSenator from Wisconsin be permitted to speak as in morning business for \n5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Kohl pertaining to the introduction of S. 1979 \nare printed in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. KOHL. Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nDorgan be allowed to proceed as in morning business for 5 minutes, and \nthat then Senator Dorgan be recognized to offer an amendment relative \nto--I think he is calling it a Truman-like commission. I have talked to \nSenator Ensign, and that is agreeable with the majority.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S12571]]\n\n  The Senator from North Dakota.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Dorgan are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2476\n\n(Purpose: To establish a special committee of the Senate to investigate \n  the awarding and carrying out of contracts to conduct activities in \n        Afghanistan and Iraq and to fight the war on terrorism)\n\n  (Mr. THUNE assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I have an amendment to offer, an amendment \nI have shared with both sides. It is, in fact, an amendment that we \nhave previously debated. It deals with the subject of contracting \nabuses, especially contracting abuses in the reconstruction in Iraq--\nthe money that is paid by American taxpayers, through our Government, \nto major contractors that are given no-bid contracts, spending billions \nof dollars, and the stories about contracting abuse are horrifying. Yet \nnothing seems to happen.\n  I have described previously something that happened in the 1940s. \nHarry Truman was in the Senate. Harry Truman was a Democrat. A member \nof his party was in the White House, Franklin Delano Roosevelt. He \ncouldn't have been very happy about Harry Truman because Truman came to \nthe floor of Senate and said: I have substantial evidence of \nwrongdoing, of contracting, of military waste with respect to defense \ncontracts and defense spending. I think it needs to be investigated.\n  They began holding a series of hearings. He finally was able to get a \ncommittee together called the Truman Committee. They began a series of \nhearings. It lasted a number of years. At a time when a member of his \nown political party was President, it was probably embarrassing for \neverybody that Harry Truman was leading the charge while FDR was in the \nWhite House. But they uncovered a substantial amount of abuse and waste \nand fraud. Good for them. The memory of the Truman Committee lives on \ntoday as an example of what should be done with respect to oversight by \nthe Congress.\n  We spend a dramatic amount of taxpayer money. The question is, Is it \nspent wisely? If it is not, when it is wasted or stolen or subject to \ncheating of the taxpayers, shouldn't somebody know it? Shouldn't \nsomebody see it and do something about it? That is the issue.\n  I have held a number of hearings as chairman of the Policy Committee \non this subject, only because no one else is holding any substantial \nhearings on it. We will have a couple people come to the floor and say: \nWe have held a good number of hearings. That is not true. Very few if \nany hearings have been held on this issue.\n  I wish to go through a few examples of the hearings that we have \nheld, along with some of the headlines. I wish to say this before I get \ninto this too far: Some of this deals with a company called \nHalliburton. The minute you mention the company Halliburton on the \nfloor of the Senate, they say: Aha, this is a criticism of Vice \nPresident Cheney because he used to be president of Halliburton. It is \nnot about Vice President Cheney. Vice President Cheney is not now \npresident of Halliburton. He left that job when he became Vice \nPresident. This is not about him.\n  All of these actions have occurred after Vice President Cheney left \nthe Halliburton Corporation. But this is about Halliburton and some \nother companies--Halliburton being the largest--that have gotten big, \nfat, multibillion-dollar contracts, no-bid, sole-source contracts, and, \nwith all of the evidence in front of us, have been charging American \ntaxpayers for services they have not delivered or overcharging the \ntaxpayers for other services.\n  We need to aggressively root out that waste, fraud, and abuse. Let me \ngive some examples. The committee that I chair, the Policy Committee, \nhad a hearing. We heard from a man named Rory Mayberry. Rory Mayberry \nis the former food production manager for KBR, which is a Halliburton \nsubsidiary. Halliburton has gotten billions of dollars to deliver all \nsorts of things to our troops in Iraq, including feeding the troops.\n  Here is what Mr. Mayberry, who was the food service supervisor, told \nus:\n\n       Food items were being brought in to our military base that \n     were outdated or expired by as much as a year and we were \n     told by the food service managers, feed them anyway, use them \n     anyway. So the food was fed to the troops, expired food with \n     expired date stamps. For trucks that were hit by convoy fire \n     and bombings we were told to go into the trucks, remove the \n     food items and use them after removing the bullets and any \n     shrapnel from the bad food that was hit. And we were told \n     then to remove the bullets and turn them over to the managers \n     of the food service operation as souvenirs.\n\n  We had hearings at which Bunnatine Greenhouse testified. Bunny \nGreenhouse was the top civilian official at the Corps of Engineers. She \nrose to the very top, the highest civilian official in the Corps of \nEngineers. That is the area of the Pentagon where they actually do the \ncontracts for these firms. In that position, she was responsible for \nreviewing all contracts worth more than $10 million. After she objected \nto special treatment given Halliburton on a number of occasions, \nincluding an occasion where the company was brought into the meeting at \nwhich the contract was being discussed, the specs developed, and who it \nwas going to be awarded to, after objecting to all that, she was forced \nto either resign or face demotion.\n  This is a woman who was the highest civilian official in the Corps of \nEngineers, given stellar performance reviews always, an outstanding \nemployee. But then she started raising questions with the good old boy \nnetwork about giving billions of dollars of sole-source contracts under \nthe buddy system. She said:\n\n       I can unequivocally state that the abuse related to \n     contracts awarded to KBR [Halliburton] represents the most \n     blatant and improper contract abuse I have witnessed during \n     the course of my professional career.\n\n  That is pretty strong.\n  Now let me go through a couple of headlines. Boston Globe, June of \nthis year: Internal Pentagon audits have flagged about $1.4 billion in \nexpenses submitted by Halliburton for services the firm is providing in \nIraq. Charges include $45 for a case of soda, $100 per bag for laundry \nservice, and several months preparing at least 10,000 daily meals that \nthe troops didn't need and ultimately went to--by the way, in this meal \nissue, there is another complaint. The other complaint is they were \ncharging for 42,000 meals a day and preparing 14,000 meals a day. That \nmeant they were charging the taxpayers for 28,000 meals they were not \nserving the troops.\n  ``Ex-Halliburton Workers Allege Rampant Waste: They say the firm \nmakes no efforts to control costs, overspending taxpayers' money in \nIraq and Kuwait.'' One former employee: ``They didn't want to control \ncosts at all. Their motto was don't worry about cost. It's a cost plus \ncontract.''\n  The supervisor described an arrangement in which Halliburton provided \n10 percent of additional payment on its phone calls to a Kuwaiti \ncompany for providing cellular phones although nothing in the contract \nbetween Halliburton and the company called for the payments.\n  They just added 10 percent.\n  Well, I won't go through it at great length, but $7,500 a month to \nrent ordinary cars and trucks; $85,000 new trucks left on the side of \nthe road because they had a flat tire, to be trashed and torched. Yes, \nthe taxpayer paid for them. How about a fuel pump that was plugged. \nLeave the truck on the side of the road. It gets torched. It is all \nover. The taxpayer pays for it. It is all cost plus.\n  ``Millions in U.S. Property Lost in Iraq, Report Says; Halliburton \nClaims Figures Only `projections'.''\n  ``Halliburton Unable to Prove $1.8 Billion in Work, Pentagon Says.''\n  ``Halliburton Faces Criminal Investigation,'' Houston Chronicle. \n``Pentagon Proving Alleged Overcharges for Iraq Fuel.''\n  ``Uncle Sam Looks Into Meal Bills; Halliburton Refunds $27 million as \na Result.''\n  You would think with all of this you would have committees in the \nCongress saying: Wait a second, we are going to pull back the curtain. \nWe are going to have tough investigations to evaluate what is \nhappening, what is happening to the American taxpayer, what is \nhappening with contracts that are given without any competition, soul-\nsource, no-bid contracts.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a comment?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Of course.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. I want to inform the Senator from North Dakota that, \nhopefully, when we come back for a couple\n\n[[Page S12572]]\n\ndays in December, as the chairman of the Readiness Subcommittee, I plan \non holding hearings on exactly this. I plan on pulling that curtain \nback. I plan on getting into the investigation in the same way as Harry \nTruman. If it happens to be it is embarrassing to the administration, \nwe are going to find out the truth on this--just like Harry Truman went \nafter those cost-plus contracts in those days. It is not only the soul-\nsource aspect, it is also the fact they are cost-plus contracts.\n  We are going to do a thorough investigation through the subcommittee, \nand I am committing to the Senator that the things he is talking about \nright now will be fully investigated by our committee, and we are going \nto uphold our oversight responsibility of this administration.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, that gives me some hope, and I hope as a \nresult of that the Senator would support my amendment as well. The fact \nis, we have not had many oversight hearings. We have now been in this \nconflict for several years, and a substantial amount of money has been \nspent. A very substantial amount of it has been wasted, regrettably.\n  But I think anything that any committee or subcommittee does to shine \na spotlight on this makes some sense. I must say, however, as my \ncolleague knows, there is substantial brushback from the \nadministration. They do not want anything to do with this. And I \nunderstand why. But the fact is, what happened here was wrong. A top \ncontracting official gets demoted because she blows the whistle on bad \npractices, and the taxpayer takes a bath to the tune, I think, of \nbillions of dollars.\n  So whatever subcommittee or committee wants to dig into this, I think \nthat would be great, and I certainly will commend my colleague if he \nconvenes these hearings. But I would say this: I think there are \nsubstantial pressures on many of our committees and subcommittees by \nthe administration not to move too far. We had an example of that on \nthe issue of intelligence recently, and I won't explore that more, but \nthere has been a lot of foot dragging in a lot of areas.\n  The point of this on behalf of myself, Senator Durbin, Senator \nLautenberg, Senator Boxer, and others, the point of it is to establish \nwhat we know works, and what we know works is the Truman committee. \nYes, it is an old model, but it is a model that really did work--\nnonpartisan, bipartisan. Take a hard look at what is going on. Don't \ncare where the chips fall, investigate it all. If somebody is cheating \nthe American taxpayer, hold them accountable for it. I mean how do you \nmiss 28,000 meals, overbilling somebody by 28,000 meals a day? I come \nfrom a town of 300 people, so we had a small restaurant. You can \nunderstand somebody missing a cheeseburger or two but 28,000 meals a \nday? That is cheating. And it ought not take twice to learn the lesson. \nDo business with companies that cheat. Cut them off. Shut it down.\n  I am not going into this at great length, but I can give the example \nof companies that in the same week that they were paying multimillion \ndollar penalties for cheating and defrauding the Government, in that \nsame week they were signing new contracts for new business with this \nGovernment. Are we that lamebrained that we can't understand when \nsomebody cheats you once you don't need a second chance?\n\n  In my hometown, again, a town of 300 people, you wouldn't need to \nlearn that lesson twice. You do business with somebody who cheats you, \nyou don't do business with them again. Not in this town. It is a slap \non the wrist, a pat on the back. Atta boy. That is not the way it ought \nto work.\n  I could spend a lot of time on this. I will not do it now, but I \ncould spend a lot of time talking about the abuses--the taxpayer pays \nto air-condition a building under reconstruction in Iraq. Well, that \ncontract that goes to a subcontract, that goes to a local subcontract \nand pretty soon it is all done. We pay it. It is like an ice cube; it \nmelts in your hand like money does as it goes through to--guess what--\npay for air-conditioning, and it is a ceiling fan in a room in Iraq \nsome place. Cheating? You bet it is.\n  I want to show you a picture of two million dollars. Incidentally, \nthis guy wearing the striped shirt, he worked in this area. These are \nhundred-dollar bills wrapped in Saran Wrap. What would they be doing \nwith a pile of bills wrapped in Saran Wrap? He testified: I was over \nthere with the Coalition Provisional Authority, which is really us, as \nyou know.\n  He says: We were telling people that when you come to pick up the \ncash for your contracts and so on, understand it is going to be in \ncash, so bring a bag. We deal in cash. He said we actually threw these \naround as footballs from time to time in the office, hundred-dollar \nbills wrapped in Saran Wrap.\n  I don't know how that would feel. But you can look at what it looked \nlike, how they appeared. He said: Bring a bag. We deal in cash. He \nsaid: It was like the Old West\n  I have spoken at some length about this with a company called Custer \nBattle. A couple guys show up in Iraq, and they decide: We are going to \nbe contractors. Pretty soon they are contractors. Pretty soon they have \nmillions of dollars, millions of dollars in contracting, and then they \nstart setting up offshore subsidiaries and selling to them, cheating \nthe Federal Government. A couple of their employees decide that is not \nright and they are going to disclose it. Then their lives are \nthreatened.\n  There is so much going on that it is just almost unbelievable to me.\n  The inspector general for the Coalition Provisional Authority issued \na report about the use of funds that actually belong to the Iraqis. It \ncame from the oil revenues which was under our control then. There were \n8,206 guards at one Iraqi ministry, 8,206 guards at one of the \nministries. And that is what we were paying for through this $9 \nbillion. It turns out, in paying 8,206 security people, there were only \n602 of them. But 8,206 were paid. Where did the money go? If we could \nhave dyed all that money purple and walked around to see who had purple \npants pockets, we could have figured it out. This is a massive cheating \nand abuse scandal.\n  This is like a Rip Van Winkle operation. We sort of doze through it \nall, don't offend anybody, upset anybody.\n  I am delighted to hear my colleague is going to hold some hearings in \nDecember, but I am telling you this is a cesspool of trouble, digging \ninto this.\n  The guy who used to buy towels for our troops, from K.B.R. \nHalliburton, bought hand towels--you know, the little hand towels. He \ntold us how he ordered the hand towels. Need some thousands and \nthousands and thousands of hand towels for the troops? Well, you just \norder them, don't you? Oh, no, no. His supervisor said you don't just \norder hand towels, you order hand towels embroidered with the company's \nlogo on it so it can double the price. You think when the troops are \nwashing their hands and face they are going to want just a plain towel? \nNo, they are going to want one with our company logo on it, so order \nthe more expensive one.\n  The sky is the limit. It is all cost plus. Don't worry. Be happy. We \nare all making money--except the taxpayer is taking a bath.\n  I have raised this issue now for about 2 years on the floor of the \nSenate, to dead silence.\n  There was a silence back in the forties when Harry Truman raised it. \nThey empowered a committee to take a look and they discovered billions \nof dollars of waste, fraud, and abuse. The taxpayer was taking a bath \nand the Congress did something about it. The question is, Will it now?\n  We haven't received one answer from the Pentagon about all these \nissues. We haven't received one single answer. This has all been \ntransmitted to the Pentagon, all of the testimony from five or six \nhearings. It is just unbelievable.\n  By the way, do you want 50,000 pounds of nails? I know where 25 tons \nof nails are. They are laying in the sand in Iraq, 25 tons of nails, \n50,000 pounds ordered for reconstruction of Iraq. But they are the \nwrong size, and it does not matter, I guess, so they throw them on the \nground and they reorder. It is just the taxpayers' money. It is all \ncost plus. Order 50,000 pounds of nails the wrong size. Don't sweat it. \nWe are all going to get paid.\n  What a mess. So the point is, Congress has the responsibility. \nCongress has a responsibility to legislate, and Congress has a \nresponsibility for something called oversight--oversight with respect \nto the funds that the Congress appropriates. These funds, after all, \ncome in from the American taxpayers\n\n[[Page S12573]]\n\nand then are used to be expended on various operations, various \nprojects, in this case reconstruction in Iraq or contractors that are \ncontracting to provide assistance to the troops in Iraq. Some of that \nassistance to the troops manifests itself in food that is expired, \nmanifests itself in charging for food that wasn't delivered.\n  Now, Mr. President, I was tempted to go through the whole list of \nthose who have testified. I shall not do that in deference to my \ncolleague who is on the floor ready to speak. But I think the point is \nmade. The Congress can continue to decide, No, we don't want to do \nanything about this, and vote against this amendment. They have done it \npreviously. But it is pretty hard, it seems to me, to look in the \nmirror and think you have done a good job for the people in this \ncountry, the taxpayers who pay the taxes, if you don't believe this \ndeserves your special attention and you don't believe that Congress has \nfailed in its responsibility of oversight. If you don't believe that, \nthen you should vote against my amendment. But if you understand the \nresponsibility for oversight and understand there has been virtually \nnothing done except for the hearings I chair in the Policy Committee \nand with those hearings have uncovered dramatic examples of massive \nwaste, fraud, and abuse, if you believe that is a real serious problem, \nthen you ought to support this amendment.\n  I hope every Senator will ask questions of the Pentagon about \nBunnatine Greenhouse, the highest ranking civilian in the Pentagon with \noutstanding performance reviews, outstanding reviews all along the way \nuntil she began to say: You can't do this. You are violating the \nregulations of the Pentagon in the way you are proceeding with respect \nto no-bid contracts, no-bid, sole-source, cost-plus contracts, the \nminute she started telling those at the top of the Corps of Engineers \nwho wanted to award these kinds of contracts to say: Look, you are \nviolating the very rules that exist. The minute she started doing that, \nher career took a dramatic turn for the worse. At that point, she was \ntold you are either going to be fired or demoted.\n\n  If the Congress does not care about that, then it does not care about \nanything. If those who have the courage to speak up and tell the truth, \nas they see it, are told the consequences for that will be their \ncareer, then this Congress doesn't care much about those who have the \ncourage to stand up and speak out when it is necessary. There has been \na deafening silence, with the exception of a few Members of Congress, \non that point as well.\n  This woman fights on alone. Why? Because not enough people here seem \nto care, not even to care to ask the basic question of those who run \nthe Pentagon. Mr. President, I send the amendment to the desk on behalf \nof myself, Senator Durbin, Senator Lautenberg, and Senator Boxer, and \nask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from North Dakota [Mr. Dorgan], for himself, \n     Mr. Durbin, Ms. Boxer, and Mr. Lautenberg, proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2476.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I inquire, how much of the 30 minutes \nallowed to the proponent of the amendment has been used?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Twenty-two minutes.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time. \nSenator Durbin, I know, wishes to speak on this amendment. I reserve \nthe remainder of the time on this amendment.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2433\n\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Chambliss \namendment and in opposition to the amendment filed by my friend from \nIllinois, Senator Durbin. I am pleased that the Durbin amendment has \nbeen filed because it is good to see others share my idea that the \nretirement system for our Guard and Reserve soldiers needs to be \nupdated to meet the new role these soldiers are playing as part of our \nNation's military.\n  By way of introduction, let me say I think it is a very good thing we \nare debating this issue at this time in the Senate today because not \nonly is this an important issue we need to talk about as policymakers \nin the Congress, but today we have a majority of the men and women \nserving in the theater in Iraq who are members of the Guard and \nReserve. It is critically important that as we utilize these soldiers, \nwe provide them with benefits that compare to the active-duty soldiers.\n  I would like to compare the military personnel system to a finely \ntuned machine because that is what it is. The Department of Defense and \nthe individual military services have staffs that devote significant \ntime and energy to determining how to recruit, retain, promote, \nseparate, and retire people in their respective services. The \nDepartment recommends incentives, which we in Congress consider and \nauthorize, which shape this process of recruiting and retention \naccording to the needs of the services. It is a fact that any change in \nthe military personnel system will change the process and the \nincentives in question and could change them in ways that are \ndetrimental to the military services.\n  I have crafted my amendment, the underlying amendment, with these \nfactors in mind. However, in my assessment, the Durbin amendment has \nnot received the same scrutiny along these lines and will, indeed, \nshape the personnel system in unintended ways that are detrimental to \nthe military which we simply cannot afford from a cost perspective.\n  The effect of this amendment will be to create an imbalance in the \npersonnel system which will likely result in an increase in end \nstrength and result in people in the higher ranks of the enlisted and \nofficer corps clogging the system and not allowing the people beneath \nthem the opportunity for promotion. This amendment also rewards and \nretains people who, generally speaking, are already being retained at \nthe required rate. In my assessment, this amendment solves a problem \nthat does not exist.\n  The Durbin amendment simply rewards longevity of service. It does not \nreward those members of the Reserve components who disrupt their lives \nin support of a contingency operation, and does not provide an \nincentive or reward for soldiers deployed in harm's way in defense of \ntheir country.\n  Both amendments target soldiers who have sacrificed, but my amendment \ntargets the ones who have put their lives in harm's way, and we should \nbe giving them a real incentive to stay in the military.\n  From a cost perspective, the Durbin amendment has a 1-year reward for \nas few as 22 days of Reserve duty. That is a 17-day reduction in the \nage a reservist could collect retirement for every 1 day of service, \nwhereas my amendment is far more equitable. It is a one-for-one \nreduction.\n  The Durbin amendment scores at $4.8 billion over 5 years. My \namendment scores at $320 million over 5 years. I agree that cost should \nnot be the sole determining factor, but we are in a real budget world \ntoday where we are struggling to find dollars to buy weapons systems \nand to provide for these quality-of-life issues for our men and women. \nI had an amendment last year that was too expensive. We have come back \nthis year with a much more realistic amendment that is affordable and, \nin my opinion, is more rewarding to those who deserve it at this point \nin the life of our military. The scoring of Senator Durbin's amendment \nis roughly 8 times, almost 10 times as expensive as my amendment.\n  In summary, while length of service is one area which I do believe we \nshould incentivize for our Guard and Reserve soldiers, it is not the \nonly behavior or even the primary behavior we need to reward. Rather, \nit is our reservists who have truly sacrificed, who have left their \nhomes, their jobs, and their families and put themselves in harm's way \nwho need to be rewarded\n\n[[Page S12574]]\n\nand incentivized to stay in the Reserve. That is exactly what my \namendment does and does it in a fair and cost-effective way. We \nincentivize voluntarism, not just incentivize longevity of service.\n  I urge my colleagues to reject the Durbin amendment and to support \nthe underlying amendment.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sununu).

Mr. President, this has been cleared with the majority.\n  I call up the Durbin amendment No. 2473.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Michigan [Mr. Levin], for Mr. Durbin, for \n     himself, Mr. Corzine, and Ms. Landrieu, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 2473, as modified.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN.

The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2476\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I joined with Senator Dorgan of North \nDakota in offering amendment numbered 2476. It is an amendment on which \nwe both worked. Over the years we have shared billing on it because we \nboth believe it is essential. It is an amendment which calls for the \ncreation of a Truman-like commission to make certain we are spending \nour defense dollars effectively, we are not wasting money, and that the \nmoney spent is for the security of America and the protection of our \ntroops.\n  In a report on defense logistics issued in March of this year, the \nGovernment Accountability Office found that U.S. troops experienced \nshortages in seven of the nine items that the GAO reviewed. The report \nreads:\n\n       These shortages led in some cases to a decline in the \n     operational capability of equipment and increased risk for \n     troops.\n\n  The items included generators for assault vehicles, armored vehicle \nparts, lithium batteries, meals ready to eat, truck tires, body armor, \narmored vehicles, and add-on armor kits. The GAO Comptroller, David \nWalker, testified in a Senate subcommittee hearing that the Department \nof Defense doesn't have a system to be able to determine with any \ndegree of reliability and specificity how we spend tens of millions of \ndollars.\n  Mr. Walker then went on to say:\n\n       Trying to figure out what appropriated funds were being \n     spent on is like pulling teeth.\n\n  Shortchanging the taxpayers is not acceptable. Shortchanging our \ntroops, especially when they are risking their lives for America, is \nabsolutely inexcusable. We have been talking about personal and vehicle \narmor shortages for months.\n  I will never forget my first visit to Walter Reed to see the first \ninjured veteran from Iraq, a member of the Ohio National Guard, who had \nlost his left leg below the knee. I asked him what happened. He said: \nIt is those humvees. They don't have any armor plating on them.\n  This soldier told me he couldn't wait to get his new leg so he could \nget back in combat. That is the kind of fighting spirit which we love \nto see in the men and women who are serving this country. Shouldn't we \nhave the same fighting spirit when it comes to providing them with the \nequipment they need so they can come home safely with their mission \naccomplished, truly accomplished? If we waste money with profiteers and \nthose who try to gouge the Federal Government at the expense of our \ntroops, we are not doing our soldiers any favor.\n  These shortages, especially of armor, have sent young men to Walter \nReed for a long time, with missing arms and legs, and other serious \ninjuries. I have met them. I don't know how we can face them and \nhonestly say we have not tried to do everything within our power to \nmake certain their fellow soldiers are protected. Our current system \ndoes not work.\n  In 1941, Senator Harry Truman, a Democrat from Missouri, introduced a \nresolution creating a special committee to investigate the national \ndefense program. Who was the President at the time? Franklin Roosevelt, \na Democrat from New York. We had a Democratic Senator calling for an \ninvestigation of the War Department of a Democratic President. Those \nwere the days--and you have to search the history days to remember \nthem--when there was real oversight in Congress, regardless of the \nparty affiliation.\n  We find exactly the opposite today. The Republican majority in \nCongress refuses to accept the responsibility of oversight because they \nmight embarrass the Republican administration in\n\n[[Page S12575]]\n\nthe White House. This is not about protecting the President from \nembarrassment. This is about protecting our troops.\n  This Truman Commission cost very little money in those days, but it \nsaved us billions of dollars. It is a valuable lesson for today. Then, \nas now, skyrocketing contract costs, rapid allocation of funds meant we \nwere wasting money. Harry Truman stated when he came to this Senate, \nthe same Chamber, almost 64 years ago:\n\n       I'm calling the attention of the Senate to these things \n     because I believe most sincerely they need looking into. I \n     consider public funds to be sacred funds and I think they \n     ought to have every safeguard possible to prevent their \n     misuse or being mishandled.\n\n  Senator Truman went on to say:\n\n       I think the Senate ought to create a special committee with \n     authority to examine every contract.\n\n  The National Archives describes the Truman Committee:\n\n       The committee earned a high reputation for thoroughness and \n     efficiency. After the end of the war the committee turned its \n     analysis to wartime experiences in order to make \n     recommendations that improved postwar and future national \n     defense programs.\n\n  It was a real national service. We continue to offer this amendment \non the Democratic side of the aisle and we cannot find a single \nSenator, or very few, I should say, on the Republican side even \ninterested in talking about it. Why? Why wouldn't they be interested in \nmaking certain the taxpayers' dollars are well spent in the Department \nof Defense? Why wouldn't they want accountability when it comes to the \nequipment to protect our troops?\n  I joined with Senator Dorgan with this amendment to create a new \nTruman committee to oversee contracting awards in Iraq, Afghanistan, \nand the war on terrorism. We need this committee. As Goldman Sachs \nInternational Vice President Robert Hormats stated:\n\n       There is nothing more corrosive of support for a war \n     anywhere in the world, the war against terrorism or dealing \n     with the problems in Iraq, than the concern that taxpayer \n     money is not being used well.\n\n  The simple fact is we need better oversight. We need this committee. \nWe need to identify the weaknesses in our current system. We need the \nbest practices to be followed by our Department of Defense.\n  We learned earlier this year that $8.8 billion that was managed by \nthe Coalition Provisional Authority in Iraq simply disappeared. We \nbrought back Mr. Bremmer, the head of that Coalition Provisional \nAuthority for the United States, and gave him a gold medal. I wish we \nhad found the $8.8 billion before we gave him a gold medal. Reports \nindicate that payrolls in Iraqi ministries under the control of that \nauthority were inflated with thousands of ghost employees. The United \nStates Inspector General for Iraqi reconstruction has said:\n\n       We believe the CPA management of Iraq's national budget \n     process and oversight of funds was burdened by severe \n     inefficiencies and poor management.\n\n  The list goes on and on.\n  We owe our troops and our taxpayers better oversight of their money. \nThis bipartisan special committee called for in the Dorgan-Durbin \namendment will accomplish that.\n  So many Members come to the Senate today and say not one penny is \ngoing to be spent for Hurricane Katrina or to safeguard America against \navian influenza unless we offset it. We are watchdogs when it comes to \nnew programs. Why not be watchdogs for existing programs? If Congress \nis not exercising its power of oversight, for goodness sake, let us \ncreate a Truman-like commission that will. Let's ask the hard question \nand get the right answers. Let's protect our troops and protect the \ntaxpayers.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time and urge my colleagues on both \nsides of the aisle to support the Dorgan-Durbin amendment numbered \n2476.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \npending amendments be set aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \npending amendments are set aside.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2478\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and \nask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Jersey [Mr. Lautenberg] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2478.\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To prohibit individuals who knowingly engage in certain \n  violations relating to the handling of classified information from \n                     holding a security clearance)\n\n       On page 286, strike lines 1 through 3, and insert the \n     following:\n\n     SEC. 1072. IMPROVEMENTS OF INTERNAL SECURITY ACT OF 1950.\n\n       (a) Prohibition on Holding of Security Clearance After \n     Certain Violations on Handling of Classified Information.--\n       (1) Prohibition.--Section 4 of the Internal Security Act of \n     1950 (50 U.S.C. 783) is amended by adding at the end the \n     following new subsection:\n       ``(f) No person who knowingly violates a law or regulation \n     regarding the handling of classified information in a manner \n     that could have a significant adverse impact on the national \n     security of the United States, including the knowing \n     disclosure of the identity of a covert agent of the Central \n     Intelligence Agency to a person not authorized to receive \n     such information, shall be permitted to hold a security \n     clearance for access to classified information.''.\n       (2) Applicability.--Subsection (f) of section 4 of the \n     Internal Security Act of 1950, as added by paragraph (1), \n     shall apply to any individual holding a security clearance on \n     or after the date of the enactment of this Act with respect \n     to any knowing violation of law or regulation described in \n     such subsection, regardless of whether such violation occurs \n     before, on, or after that date.\n       (b) Clarification of Authority To Issue Security \n     Regulations and Orders.--\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, the amendment I offer today is \nsomething I believe is urgently needed because of security concerns \nraised constantly these days, particularly as a result of a recent \nindictment we are all aware of. The amendment is relatively simple, \nstraightforward. It clarifies part of the intelligence law to be clear \nthat those who compromise classified information cannot hold a \nclearance. The indictment describes conduct by a White House official \nthat must not be tolerated. Certainly, an irresponsible and reckless \nofficial should not be allowed to continue to hold a clearance to see \ntop-secret information.\n  The person at issue is identified in the recent indictment I spoke of \nearlier as ``Official A.'' According to the Washington Post, White \nHouse staff have confirmed that Official A is Mr. Karl Rove. He is the \ndeputy chief of staff to the President. The indictment says this \nofficial gave classified information to a journalist. Any official who \ndoes such a thing should certainly not continue to hold a clearance.\n  It is quite clear what President Bush's intent was when he said he \nwanted to clear the air about any leakage of classified information. I \nthink we should follow his pledge or remind him of his pledge to remove \nanyone involved with leaking information. We know the information given \nto the journalist Robert Novak was, indeed, published, and a CIA \noperative was exposed.\n  The actions taken by the White House staff have damaged our national \nsecurity. Thusly, an indictment has come about. It has destroyed an \noperative's covert cover, compromised intelligence-gathering \noperations, and endangered the safety of other CIA employees and their \ncontacts.\n  The amendment I offer today is similar to one that was offered \nearlier in the year by Senator Reid in July. My amendment has one \nsignificant difference. It includes the words a ``knowing'' standard so \nthat someone who unknowingly does it doesn't get included in our \namendment. We wanted to narrow the field and say, if you talk about \nthese things and know it, you ought to pay for it. The payment is \nfairly simple. My Republican colleagues reacted to the Reid amendment \nby talking about it as an open-ended standard. In deference to the \nconcerns of our colleagues on the other side, I have added\n\n[[Page S12576]]\n\na ``knowing'' standard--in other words, if you don't know it, then that \nis one thing; if you do know it, it is quite something else--which is \nmore than fair to someone who reveals our national security secrets.\n  I see my colleague and friend from Virginia on the other side. I am \nreminded when both of us wore a uniform some years ago, it was ``loose \nlips sink ships.'' The lights were darkened all along the coast. You \ncouldn't even tell your family where you were at the time. As a matter \nof fact, I was in an area in Belgium that was quite dangerous. I did \nfind a place that sold a postcard that was written in the language of \nthe area. It was Flemish. I sent it to my mother to give her an \nindication where I was. I kind of had to sneak by the censors.\n  We are at war. People are at war with us. Terrorists are liable to \nattack us at any time. They are certainly doing what they can to even \ninjure or kill our service people who are abroad. We ought to make sure \nwe are as diligent about covering our security as we can be. We should \nask nothing less than total obedience to the rules. I am here with the \nconsent and support of Senator Reid of Nevada, Senator Levin, and \nothers who believe we should do this. I hope my colleagues across the \naisle can agree that if somebody gives information they shouldn't, by \ngolly, what we are saying is the penalty is that you should lose that \nsecurity clearance and that person should be treated as the President \nsuggests, removed from the security scene.\n  It is plain common sense. I urge my colleagues to support the \namendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Martinez). The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I say to my colleague, I recall that \nperiod very well. There were times when the Nation's capital had \nblackouts. At that time my father was a doctor actively practicing \nmedicine in this city, and he had to take the headlights on his car and \nput a black screen over the headlight with about a 1-inch slit so he \ncould respond to emergency measures during the blackout. Where our home \nwas at that time we had blackout curtains. We regularly went out to \nmake sure there was no leakage of the light because at that time the \ncity lights, if they had been on, silhouetted U.S. and other allied \nshipping such that they were the target of then German submarines off \nthe coast. Indeed, it is hard to believe this, but the coastline from \nFlorida all the way up to New England was strewn with the damage of \nships that were torpedoed.\n  I remember well that period of time, and I remember the phrase. I am \nsurprised you, as an Army man, used a Navy phrase that loose lips sank \nships. But we have a very serious amendment here, deserving of equally \nserious attention. It has just been handed to us. I am sure the Senator \nwould appreciate that we would need some time to study this to \ndetermine exactly how we should respond.\n  I am reading the first paragraph: ``No person who knowingly \nviolates,'' that would mean he would have to know that, A, his material \nis classified, and, B, that he has to have a knowledge of the law and \nregulation? Are those the two elements of that?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Yes, the Senator is correct. And what we say is, if \nyou do it, the least that ought to happen is you ought to learn enough \nof a lesson that we are going to remove any access to classified \ninformation if you do it knowingly.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. I understand what the consequences are. But I want to \nmake certain the Senator was trying to draw this up in such a way that, \nno matter how misfortunate, if it is unintentioned, then that would not \nbe a violation.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Right.\n  Mr. WARNER. I find it difficult to believe anyone who has a security \nclearance would not understand the basic law and regulation prohibiting \nor controlling its use. You can almost impute to the person knowledge \nof the statute and law.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. We tried our best to clarify it and remove the \nconcern that was exhibited when Senator Reid offered it last July. This \nwas added because colleagues on the other side made an observation that \nwas sensible; that is, if someone does something unknowingly, you can't \npunish them. But on the other hand, if someone has a job that includes \nsecurity, I would have to say they would know this is a violation to \nbetray any of the rules they are subjected to. But this clarifies it. \nThere is no intention here to pull the wool over anybody's eyes or \nanything such as that. It is to make sure we prevent any leakage as \nmuch as we can of security information. We are so sensitized to it that \nthe country is at times locked up in concerns with these warnings being \ngiven out, and we ought to try to restrict that from happening as much \nas possible.\n  It can be careless. The Senator can well remember the time, a very \nunfortunate time, when an informant, someone working with the CIA in \nLatin America--Guatemala, I believe it was--was assassinated after \ntheir identity was revealed. We don't want that to happen. We have our \nfriends and relatives overseas now.\n  Mr. WARNER. Let me interrupt. I want to make certain that time used \nduring the colloquy is divided equally, that when I speak, it is \ncharged to my time, and the Senator from New Jersey, as he speaks, the \ntime will be charged to him; is that agreeable?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Certainly.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. The standard you have is ``could have a significant \nadverse impact.'' Do you have any criteria for ``significant''? As you \nand I both know, having dealt in these areas for many years, we often \nlook at things that are classified and we say to ourselves: Why in the \nworld would they be classifying this document? Unfortunately, the broad \nbrush of classification sometimes is utilized on things that I don't \nthink need to be classified.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I think current law describes that. We will use that \nas the standard. Again, there is no intention here to bypass the rules. \nIt is to confirm clearly that if you talk about this, we are not saying \nyou go to jail. We are not saying anything else. But you certainly \nshould no longer have access to classified information.\n  Mr. WARNER. Would the Senator be able to supply for the record the \nreferences that he says would define further the word ``significant''? \nYou said it is defined in law. Could you cite those laws upon which you \nrely?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Yes. We will certainly try to do that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. WARNER. I think I still have the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, again, this amendment has just been given \nto the majority side. We will, in due course, have further response to \nthe Senator. At this time it becomes the pending amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It is the pending amendment.\n  Mr. WARNER. Fine. I thank my colleague.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I thank the Senator. I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, are we not at this point in time guided by \nthe standing order we just entered?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct. The question is on \nagreeing to the Inhofe amendment, as modified.\n  Mr. WARNER. Have the yeas and nays been ordered?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. They have been ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER.

The next question is on the Ensign amendment.\n  There are 2 minutes equally divided. Who yields time?\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I ask that Senator Allard be added as \ncosponsor to my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, very simply, this amendment seeks to \nclarify what the policy of the United States has been since 1975, that \nour military would be able to use riot control agents--in this case \ntear gas--for defensive purposes. That has been the policy of the \nUnited States. But because of some interpretations, our military is not \nable to use tear gas. They do not take it with them, they do not train \nwith it, and in many cases tear gas--just as police forces use it all \nover the world--would save civilian lives as well as lives of the \nmembers of our military.\n  This is absolutely a critical amendment to save lives of Americans \nand for those civilians who, when our military kills them--and \nunfortunately these things happen--it makes us look bad as a country.\n  This is a critical amendment that we need to adopt.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I wish to indicate to my colleagues that I \nhave carefully studied this. I support the Ensign amendment. I defer to \nmy colleague, Senator Levin.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the Senator from Nevada has assured the \nSenate that this amendment does not seek, in any way, to change current \npolicy, including Executive Order 11850, relative to the use of riot \ncontrol agents. I note that the President has provided the Presidential \napproval required by that Executive order for use of riot control \nagents in Iraq. We look forward to consulting with the administration. \nThe amendment of the Senator from Nevada is an appropriate amendment. \nIt could be very helpful, and we support the amendment.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, as I stated on the floor yesterday, I am \nable to support Senator Ensign's amendment because it now includes \nseveral important modifications that were requested by the \nadministration. As a result of those modifications, the amendment more \naccurately reflects current U.S. policy and law regarding the use of \nriot control agents by members of the Armed Forces. I thank Senator \nEnsign for agreeing to those modifications. I will take into account \nthe views and recommendations of the administration as we continue our \nwork on this issue and the bill in conference.\n  The resolution of ratification for the Chemical Weapons Convention, \nCWC, passed by this body contained a condition requiring the President \nto certify that the United States is not restricted by the CWC in its \nuse of riot control agents in certain specified circumstances. In \naddition, the condition required the President not to eliminate or \nalter Executive Order 11850, which prohibits the use of riot control \nagents in war ``except in defensive military modes to save lives.''\n  In response to questions from myself and Senator Levin on the floor \nyesterday and today, Senator Ensign confirmed that he does not seek \nthrough this amendment to amend, expand or reinterpret Executive Order \n11850 in any way. It is on that understanding that I can support his \namendment.\n  The Senator from Nevada has raised the question of whether the U.S. \nArmed Forces currently have sufficiently clear authority with respect \nto riot control agents. I have looked into this matter and consulted \nwith representatives of the Department of Defense, including \nrepresentatives of our commanders in the field.\n  They have informed me and my staff that, in their view, the use of \nriot control agents is a very complex matter. It is not clear that \ncommanders in the field want to use ``RCAs'' widely. However, there are \na number of cases where RCAs could be very useful to avoid unnecessary \nloss of life. I have been assured that, consistent with the Executive \nOrder, U.S. Armed Forces have authority to use riot control agents. \nFurthermore, I am informed that DoD will examine whether any confusion \nexists about RCA use, and will take all steps necessary to ensure that \nU.S. Armed Forces have the clear guidance that they need and deserve.\n  I am confident that the DoD and the administration will ensure that \nour men and women in uniform have every tool available to them \nconsistent with U.S. and international law.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I rise today to share my views on the \namendment offered by Senator Ensign regarding the use of riot control \nagents, RCAs, by members of our Armed Forces in war. As one of the \nprincipal proponents of Senate ratification of the CWC, along with my \nranking member, Senator Biden, I feel it important to provide my views \nin relation to this amendment.\n  I will vote in favor this amendment, and I do so because I believe \nthat it in no way modifies, changes, reinterprets, or otherwise revises \nthe laws of the United States regarding the use of RCAs in war to save \nlives, nor in any way affects U.S. compliance with our international \nobligations. This amendment creates no new law, and changes no U.S. \npolicy.\n  When the Senate approved a resolution of advice and consent to \nratification of the Convention on the Prohibition of Development, \nProduction, Stockpiling and Use of Chemical Weapons and on Their \nDestruction--The Chemical Weapons Convention or CWC in 1997, it made \nthe conditional on maintaining U.S. law in effect at that time. \nCondition 26(B) of that resolution of ratification stated:\n\n       The President shall take no measure, and prescribe no rule \n     or regulation, which would alter or eliminate Executive Order \n     11850 of April 8, 1975.\n\n  Senator Ensign's amendment mentions both this Executive order and the \nSenate-approved condition.\n  Senator Ensign's amendment cannot modify that condition, and because \nit merely restates authority the President already has regarding the \nuse of RCAs in war, I believe that voting for the amendment will not \nharm U.S. leadership in preventing the proliferation of chemical \nweapons nor will it reverse the will of the Senate at the time it \napproved the CWC. I look forward to working with Chairman Warner, \nSenator Levin, and the administration as this provision is considered \nin conference with the House, and in efforts to improve it in that \nconference.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I will vote in favor of the Ensign \namendment to this bill, relating to the use of riot control agents, and \nI want to make clear to my colleagues why a steadfast supporter of the \nChemical Weapons Convention can do so in good conscience. Senator \nEnsign is concerned that current interpretation of U.S. policy and of \nU.S. obligations under international law might be hampering U.S. forces \nin Iraq. I gather that not everybody shares that belief, but I do not \ndoubt that some people have this concern, and I appreciate Senator \nEnsign's desire to make sure that people in the\n\n[[Page S12578]]\n\nmilitary fully understand what they can and cannot do when it comes to \nusing riot control agents in Iraq.\n  What is important about the Ensign amendment, in my view, is that it \nwill in no way modify either U.S. policy or U.S. international \nobligations regarding the use of riot control agents. The statement, in \nsubsection (a) of the amendment that ``riot control agents are not \nchemical weapons'' is fully consistent with the Chemical Weapons \nConvention, in which ``riot control agent'' is defined as a chemical, \nnot listed in any of the Convention's three lists of chemical weapons \nor their precursors, ``which can produce rapidly in humans sensory \nirritation or disabling physical effects which disappear within a short \ntime following termination of exposure.'' That definition is quite \ndifferent from the definition of a ``toxic chemical'' in a chemical \nweapon, ``which through its chemical action on life processes can cause \ndeath, temporary incapacitation or permanent harm to humans or \nanimals.'' So the Ensign amendment is correct in that a riot control \nagent, as defined in the Chemical Weapons Convention, would not be a \nchemical weapon as defined in that convention.\n  Similarly, the Ensign amendment now before this body accurately \nreflects U.S. policy as established by President Gerald Ford in \nExecutive Order 11850 of April 8, 1975. That Executive order, signed by \na Republican President and implemented by six subsequent Presidents of \nboth parties over the last 30 years, states: ``The United States \nrenounces, as a matter of national policy . . . first use of riot \ncontrol agents in war except in defensive military modes to save lives. \n. . .'' It goes on to give four examples of such defensive military \nmodes, only two of which relate to combat zones:\n  ``(b) . . . in situations in which civilians are used to mask or \nscreen attacks and civilian casualties can be reduced or avoided''; and\n  ``( c) . . . in rescue missions in remotely isolated areas, of downed \naircrews and passengers, and escaping prisoners.''\n  Executive Order 11850 then orders implementation, as follows:\n  ``Sec. 1. The Secretary of Defense shall take all necessary measures \nto ensure that the use by the Armed Forces of the United States of any \nriot control agents and chemical herbicides in war is prohibited unless \nsuch use has Presidential approval, in advance.\n  ``Sec. 2. The Secretary of Defense shall prescribe the rules and \nregulations he deems necessary to ensure that the national policy \nherein announced shall be observed by the Armed Forces of the United \nStates.''\n  As far as I can tell, Senator Ensign does not intend that anything in \nExecutive Order 11850 be changed, nor that there be any change in the \nU.S. policy and obligation to fully obey the Chemical Weapons \nConvention, which binds each state party ``not to use riot control \nagents as a method of warfare.'' It is standing U.S. policy that if \nsomebody is using human shields, as occurred in Somalia in the early \n1990s, our Armed Forces may use riot control agents ``in defensive \nmilitary modes to save lives'' without violating our obligations as \nstate party to the Chemical Weapons Convention.\n  In light of my view that the Ensign amendment will not change U.S. \npolicy and will not call into question the requirement to comply with \nour international obligations under the Chemical Weapons Convention, I \nsee no reason to oppose this amendment. I do urge, however, that the \nlimited nature of this amendment be made more explicit in conference.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has been yielded. The question is on \nagreeing to the amendment. The yeas and nays have been ordered, and the \nclerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Mr. President, let me say at the outset that Senator Bayh \nand I are offering this amendment. It turns out that we have had the \nsame basic concept and idea. We kind of came at it a little \ndifferently. I spoke to him on the telephone a few moments ago. I am \ngoing to defer to him in allowing him to be the lead sponsor on this \namendment because together we might have a better chance of success, \nand that, of course, is the ultimate test of the wisdom of this \nconcept.\n  I especially salute Robert Preiss of my staff, who is a fellow \nserving in my office who has come to us from the military and has \nworked night and day in trying to make certain that we help those who \nare in the Guard and Reserve and Active military. He has put an awful \nlot of time into this amendment. When some procedural questions came up \nthat were important to be resolved, we turned it over to Robert Preiss, \nand he did an excellent job. That is the reason we can come before you \ntoday with confidence that this amendment can be considered under this \nimportant Defense authorization bill. It is critically important. I \nwould like to explain it for my colleagues to understand why Senator \nBayh and I decided to offer it and now offer it together.\n  The Department of Defense status of forces survey of Reserve \ncomponent members, released in September 2004, revealed that 51 percent \nof our National Guard and Reserve said they suffer a loss in income \nwhen mobilized for long periods of active duty because their military \npay is less than what they were receiving in their civilian job. The \naverage reservist says that he or she loses $368 a month, but 11 \npercent report losing more than $2,500 a month. Imagine that you joined \nthe Guard and Reserve, volunteered to serve the country, and then you \nare activated. You leave your job and family, go overseas and risk your \nlife and worry about coming home safe. Many of our Guard and Reserve \nmembers are also worried about what is happening to the family back \nhome. There is less money for the monthly budget, less money for the \nmortgage, less money to pay gasoline bills. It all adds up.\n  If you take a look, this is kind of an illustration that 51 percent \nof the reservists lose income when mobilized, and 11 percent lose more \nthan $2,500 per month. This income loss represents a disparity in the \nranks and poses on reservists a burden not experienced by many Active-\nDuty troops. Many Active-Duty troops experience increases in income \nduring deployments due to tax advantages, hazardous duty pay, family \nseparation allowances, and other special pay enhancements. Those \nreservists with incomes higher than the deployed military suffer a \nloss. Their ongoing financial commitments continue for their children, \nfor their families, for their homes, their automobiles. You know the \nlist as well as I do. Their basic expenses are based on civilian \nincome, but when they are activated, they are receiving military \nincome. The resulting financial problems on the homefront can distract \na man or woman who has said: I am ready to serve my country and even \nrisk my life.\n  The amendment I offer with Senator Bayh allows reservists mobilized \nfor extended periods to receive up to $3,000 per month in extra pay to \nmake up for differences between their military and civilian salaries. \nTo qualify, a reservist must have a pay gap of at least $50 a month.\n  The language I offer today is identical to that in the House bill, \nwith one exception. This amendment provides these income replacement \npayments for Reserve component members mobilized for 6 months or more. \nThe House\n\n[[Page S12580]]\n\nbill says that you have to be called up for 18 months or more to \nqualify for this income supplement. That is entirely too long. It is \nrare that a reservist is going to be called up for 18 months. So the \nbill as it comes from the House really doesn't do much. This is \nentirely too long, to expect a reservist to wait 18 months before we \ngive them some income supplement. Indeed, with most callups currently \nlasting around 18 months, the practical effect of a qualification \nperiod that long would be that few reservists would ever get a dime of \nhelp. We can do a lot better than that. America can do better for its \nmen and women in uniform. I urge my Senate colleagues to pull together. \nThe House plan is good, but the qualification period is unrealistically \nlong. We can make it better.\n  This language was proposed by Congressman McHugh. He is the \nRepublican chairman of the House Armed Services Committee Subcommittee \non Personnel. He originally proposed a 12-month qualification period. \nIt was extended to 18 months through hasty action in the committee that \nmay not have been carefully considered. As I have said, the language I \noffer today with Senator Bayh is the same with the exception that this \nversion we offer calls for a 6-month qualification period.\n  According to an Army Times article about this provision, Chairman \nMcHugh said something needs to be done. I agree with him. He said: ``We \nhave a crisis.'' I agree with that. He repeated that the extended \ndeployments are raising this issue time and time again for many of the \nvery best who serve our country. I have to agree with Chairman McHugh \n100 percent. We have made a sound proposal because we do, indeed, have \na crisis. Recruiting numbers are down for our military. That is a fact \nof life. With the Reserve components missing their recruitment targets, \nwe must look to the retention of existing members to keep up force \nstrength.\n\n  So far, retention has been pretty good. I salute the men and women \nfor staying on in the military even though we ask more and more of them \neach day. But the existence of this income loss is going to hurt us \nwith retention. Let's be honest about it. Of the top 10 reasons cited \nin the status of forces survey for leaving the National Guard and \nReserve, income loss was No. 4. The others are obvious: family burden, \ntoo many activations and deployments, activations are too long, and \nloss of income. We ask a lot of sacrifice from the men and women in \nuniform. They march off and do their duty, whether it is responding to \nHurricane Katrina at home or going over to risk their lives in Iraq or \nAfghanistan. We understand that we can do something about the income \nloss. That is what this amendment seeks to do.\n  I urge my colleagues on both sides to support this measure. Pass this \namendment and include it in our Senate bill language so that when we \nget together with the House of Representatives, we can ensure that \nsomething does get done this year to eliminate or at least reduce the \nincome loss suffered by families of some of our guardsmen and \nreservists. By standing behind a qualification period of 6 months, we \nlay down a clear marker that we in the Senate stand for more than just \nsymbolism. We really want to help. We stand for real help in addressing \nthe pay gap for the good of the members of our Reserve components, for \nthe good of their families, for the long-term good of the force, and \nfor the good of our Nation.\n  I urge my colleagues, if they think this is a worthy amendment and \nwill join us in it, Senator Bayh and I would welcome their support. \nThis should be a bipartisan amendment. I don't know how we can argue \nover whether we should protect the income of the men and women who \nfight for us. If they are going to be away from their families and \nseparated, not there for the important decisions that are being made by \ntheir families, the least we can do is make sure they don't face some \nunreasonable hardship because of income loss.\n  I see Senator Landrieu is here. I salute her. She has done so many \nthings recently on Hurricane Katrina and other issues. But she has been \none of the strongest voices in the Senate for the Guard and Reserve and \nour military. She and I spoke the other day about this issue. She said: \nWe have to have an amendment to help Guard and Reserve. I am glad she \nhas come to the Chamber at this moment because it is timely. We are \ntrying to make sure this bill doesn't leave the Senate without a \nprovision in it that is going to help these men and women in uniform.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I am happy to yield.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I know the Senator is wrapping up his remarks, but I \nwould like to ask the Senator, is he aware that a complementary \namendment we have worked on for a couple of years, giving a tax credit \nto employers who are filling that pay gap, is the Senator aware that \nhas still not passed this Congress?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I was aware of it. I say to the Senator from Louisiana, a \nlot of people are not aware of it. They think we have already done \nthese things. We make these proposals on the floor of the Senate. Some \nof them pass the Senate, then they disappear in conference committees. \nWe all pat ourselves on the back and say we are standing up for the men \nand women in uniform. At the end of the day, there is no law for the \nPresident to sign.\n  A lot of our colleagues, myself included, will be at Veterans Day \nevents this week. I will be traveling all over Illinois. We are going \nto stand there. We may be holding the flag. We will say we are for our \nsoldiers and our veterans. But the real proof is in our votes. That is \na good one to say to employers: If you are willing to stand behind that \nman or woman in uniform who is leaving your employment for a short \nperiod to do their duty for our country, why shouldn't we stand behind \nyou with the Tax Code?\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I thank the Senator from Illinois. I ask him, is there \nany reason he could believe or think the American people wouldn't put \nthe Guard and Reserve at the top of the list for a tax cut or a tax \ncredit? Is there any other group you can think of that is more \ndeserving than the men and women who leave their homes, put on the \nuniform, leave their jobs, leave their businesses, and go to the \nfrontline to take the bullets? Would the Senator be able to identify \nany other group that would be more worthy of a tax credit or a tax cut \nif we had extra money to give?\n  Mr. DURBIN. From my point of view, absolutely none. But it is \ninteresting, what a timely question. We are about to consider a tax \nbill. This tax bill will give a break to millionaires. If you happen to \nbe a millionaire in America, we think you need a tax break of $35,000 a \nyear. Poor souls. If you happen to be making between $50 and $200,000, \nthe tax break turns into $112 dollars; under $50,000, $6. The point is, \nwe are going to spend billions of dollars giving tax breaks to the \nwealthiest people and not giving a helping hand to the men and women in \nuniform and the employers who patriotically stand behind them.\n  I say to the Senator from Louisiana, she couldn't have a more timely \nobservation.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I thank the Senator from Illinois. I would just like to \nadd my few remarks to support his amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana is recognized.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, the Senator from Illinois has come to \nthe floor again this afternoon and has spent literally hours over the \nlast 2 years, in particular, speaking about the importance of \nsupporting our Guard and Reserve.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, will the distinguished Senator from \nLouisiana allow me to propound a question to the distinguished Senator \nfrom Illinois before he departs the floor?\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I will be happy to yield to the \nchairman.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  Mr. President, I have just gotten this amendment and I am looking it \nover. It is not unlike similar provisions that have been before the \nSenate. As a matter of fact, it has been passed by the Senate but \ndropped in conference.\n  Here is the problem based on, again, very modest military experience \nof my own, but a lifetime of association with the men and women in the \nmilitary. I have come to learn the importance of\n\n[[Page S12581]]\n\npay. Pay to an individual is a tremendous symbolism. I remember when we \nadvanced from private to private first class or, in my case, from \nseaman to seaman second class, seaman first class, and so on. I got $4 \na month in one pay increase, I remember, in World War II. And then the \nwife at home often is struggling to make ends meet. Boy, that pay is \nimportant.\n  Picture that today we have a total force concept. It is not Reserves \nserving over here and regulars serving over here. Fortunately, we mix. \nThe units are merged together. When we go to Iraq, as all of us go now, \nwe will find Reserves and regulars performing the same duties \ncommensurate with their rank and their technical experience. Reserves \nand regulars are subject to the same threat to life and limb from an \nIED, from the missiles coming in, subject to the same arduous hardships \nand living conditions both in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n  Then along comes this amendment, no matter how well-intentioned, and \nsuddenly the Reservist gets a significant amount of money in addition \nto his monthly pay to the regular who is serving right with him, living \nin the same tent, eating the same food, and taking the same risks.\n  For those of us who have had the opportunity to serve in the ranks, \nthat begins to breed tension and inequities. You don't want those types \nof tensions as these young men and women are courageously performing \ntheir military duties. This is my concern.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, may I respond to the Senator?\n  Mr. WARNER. Yes, of course.\n  Mr. DURBIN. First, I have the greatest respect for the Senator from \nVirginia, who served his country not only in the Navy but as Secretary \nof the Navy, and also as the longest serving Senator in Virginia. \nDidn't the Senator from Virginia break the record recently?\n  Mr. WARNER. I am No. 2 for life.\n  Mr. DURBIN. And very popular in the State of Virginia.\n  I say to him, consider two things. Let's assume the Senator is in a \nunit that is in combat and he learns the fellow next to him who has \nbeen activated as a Guardsman used to work for Sears Roebuck, a \nChicago-based company. And because Sears Roebuck is such a good and \npatriotic corporation, they have decided they are going to protect his \nincome. They are going to give him more than his military pay. They are \ngoing to keep him at the same level of pay he received before he was \nactivated.\n  Will I think less of that fellow soldier because he is receiving some \nmoney from Sears and think maybe we shouldn't eat at the same mess \ntable, or stand together and fight together? I don't think so. I think \npeople will say that is good fortune for you.\n  The second point I would like to raise is this: A person who is \nactive military--I have a nephew who just enlisted in the Marine \nCorps--a person who is in the active military knows what his or her \nlife is going to be and builds his or her life accordingly in terms of \nexpenses incurred. A person in the Guard and Reserve has a civilian \nlife and civilian financial obligations that he or she knows may come \nwhen they are activated and a hardship may come from separation. But \nthey are in different circumstances as they go into this field of \ncombat. One comes from an active military life with a family budget \naccordingly, and the other comes from the private sector with another \nfamily budget.\n  It seems to me what I am asking is, since we now rely more than ever \non the Guard and Reserve, shouldn't we be more sensitive to that? \nShouldn't we say that if you are willing to sacrifice your time and \nyour life for your country, we are willing to sacrifice, too, to make \nsure there is no unnecessary economic hardship?\n  I don't think the two observations I made are unreasonable. The \nSenator from Virginia knows better than I because he has been in the \nmilitary and I have not served. But I would think in a unit, people \nwould be more sensitive to that. To think that soldier who left that \njob in the private sector or the Federal Government is next to me \nworried because they missed the second mortgage payment back home \nwouldn't make me feel any better about my unit and wouldn't make me \nfeel any better to know that is going on.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I think we have different perspectives. \nBut pay is a very significant thing in every military person's life. We \nhave to adjust. We certainly have to recognize.\n  What you are in a sense doing, Sears has opted as an employer to do \nas you state, not let their employee accept the consequences, and there \nis a category of persons coming in from the Reserve and Guard who \nsimply do not have employers such as Sears Roebuck; for whatever reason \ntheir employer won't do it.\n  I don't know, I am concerned about building tensions into these young \npeople in these units.\n  Mr. DURBIN. May I ask the Senator, in this colloquy through the \nChair, consider this whole question about retention. That is a big \nissue now. We need these men and women in the Guard and Reserve, even \nactive duty, who have developed the skills, understand the mission, can \nbe combat ready in an instant. We need them to stick around. We need \nthem to reup. If they have been through a bitter experience--personal \nexperience, financial experience, separated from their family--we know \nit lessens that likelihood. If we want the very best to continue \nserving, I think this is an incentive for that to happen.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, the Senator is absolutely correct. I could \neven take it a step further. If we didn't have the Guard and Reserve, \nwe would have to carry in peacetime, as well as wartime, a much larger \nactive force. We are fortunate that in wartime conditions, we have \nthese men and women who will respond, and do so willingly and subject \ntheir families. The Senator from Illinois is correct on that point.\n\n  I have to dwell on this amendment. I just read it. I wanted to have \nthis colloquy, and I appreciate the courtesies the Senator always \nextends.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. WARNER. The Senator from Louisiana has the floor.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Will the Senator from Louisiana yield for a question to \nSenator Durbin?\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I would like to ask the Senator from Virginia a \nquestion before he leaves the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER. I will be here when the Sun comes up tomorrow.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, it is my recollection that the Senate \nalready passed an amendment in one of the previous bills where we made \nup the difference for Federal employees; is that not correct?\n  Mr. DURBIN. That is correct. We passed it for the third or fourth \ntime. It goes into this strange world of conference committees and \ndisappears.\n  Mr. LEVIN. In which all of us have participated. We have seen the \nparts that emerge and the parts that do not, and it is always a little \nmystery as to what emerges and what does not emerge.\n  My understanding is that clearly is a precedent for treating all \nemployees. Everybody is activated the same way as Federal employees. \nThat is No. 1. So I think that is a good argument for the amendment. \nBut also the cost of this amendment, it seems to me, given the \nqualification period of 6 months, as I understand it, the cost over 5 \nyears would be $295 million which would be a little under $60 million a \nyear; is that correct?\n  Mr. DURBIN. That is correct.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I point out, yes, the Senate has passed \nit, but for various reasons, conferences have not accepted it, so it is \nnot in law today.\n  Mr. LEVIN. That is correct.\n  Mr. DURBIN. That is true.\n  Mr. WARNER. We do not have any of these.\n  Mr. DURBIN. The Senator might say it is pending in the Defense \nappropriations conference.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Will the Senator from Virginia yield?\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, the distinguished Senator from Louisiana \nhad the floor. She very graciously allowed me to intervene. I am happy \nto take a question.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I do so through the Chair. I first say how much I \nappreciate the exchange between the Senator from Virginia and the \nSenator from Illinois. I hope we can find a way to move forward on this \nvery important issue because it is so crucial to\n\n[[Page S12582]]\n\nthe security of our Nation, to the security of these Guard and Reserve \nfamilies. It seems the right thing for us to do.\n  My question to the Senator from Virginia, because he has so much \nexperience in warfighting as the Secretary of the Department of Navy \nand as the chairman of the Committee on Armed Services, is: When we \ncreated the Guard and Reserve Force, did we anticipate that so many \nwould be called up for such a long period of time? That is an important \nanswer to have because my sense of it is that we didn't completely \nanticipate these numbers and these lengths of deployment.\n  I ask the Senator, several decades ago, did we foresee this \ndependency?\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, the Senator raises a very interesting \nhistorical perspective. During World War II, the National Guard was \nmobilized early on and amalgamated with the regular forces. The \nReserves likewise were brought in. So everybody was in World War II for \nthe duration.\n  The next major conflict was Korea, in which I had minor \nparticipation, modest though it may be. The units I served in were \nquickly made an amalgamation of Reserves and regulars. I remember \nvividly the squadron I served in as a ground officer. The Reserve \npilots, even though they had been called, some of them had only been on \nactive duty 60 days, barely getting retraining and were flying missions \nwith the regulars who had been on active duty for a number of years. \nThere was no distinction between any of us. We were all treated the \nsame. I was a Reservist called up at that time.\n  Then along came Vietnam, and for whatever reasons, when I was \nSecretary of the Navy, we didn't employ the Guard and Reserve. We \nrelied on the draft. I would have to research some of the reasons why \nwe didn't do it.\n  This country has fluctuated back and forth. But in direct answer to \nthe Senator's important question, in this conflict, more than ever \nbefore, we have relied on the Guard and Reserve. I believe about 60 \npercent of the uniformed personnel in Iraq tonight, some 150,000 plus, \n60 percent of them are Guard and Reserve.\n  So the Senator from Louisiana is very correct in her observation.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I thank the Senator from Virginia. I would like to add \nto that comment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana is now recognized.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I would add to this discussion that it \nis important for us as leaders to be open to change and to adopt new \nstrategies. The one thing that is certain about life is change. Those \nwho adapt survive, and those who do not, do not survive. I believe when \nit comes to creating policies that secure our Nation and support our \narmed services, we always need to be open to those things that we need \nto do differently because circumstances are different, because the \nchallenges are different.\n  I would argue this is one of the issues that is at the heart of how \nwe sustain a skilled, able, versatile, agile, and quick-to-deploy force \nwithout implementing a draft and having the ability to muster a large \nand effective force when necessary. This is at the heart of it. That is \nwhy Senator Durbin continues to come to this floor and why I come to \nthis floor, why the Senator from Indiana, Mr. Bayh, and others on the \nRepublican side have come to the floor. Because we need to make some \nchanges. We need to adapt to the reality.\n  Let me submit for the Record the reality of this situation. Since the \nBerlin crisis of 1961 through the Vietnam war, we only called from the \nReserve and Guard about 200,000. From 1961 through the Vietnam war, \nbasically to the early 1990s--I know Vietnam was over before then--but \nbasically to the 1990s, we called up 200,000. But as the chairman \nknows, because he is the great distinguished chairman of our committee, \nhe is correct, since 1990, the Persian Gulf war to the present, we are \n150,000 troops strong in Iraq and we have called up 744,000 Guard and \nReserve members.\n  As the Senator from Illinois so beautifully pointed out, these are \ncitizen soldiers. They live in the community. Their budgets are based \non their civilian jobs. Their children, their spouses, and their \nfamilies have dreams and aspirations based on their civilian payrolls. \nThey do not enter the military and decide: We are only going to make \n$40,000, $50,000, $60,000 the rest of our life, but the benefit is we \nget a discount on food. We get our health insurance. We will move \naround every 2 years. We get a housing allowance. It is the life we \nhave chosen. We understand the sacrifices we are making, and we budget \naccordingly.\n  These are business owners, policemen, nurses, doctors, engineers, \nscientists who answer the call, put the uniform on, and sometimes \nanswer that call in 24 hours, literally, or in just a few weeks. They \nkiss their children goodbye--maybe the wife is the spouse who is \nleaving. Maybe it is the husband. They tell everyone goodbye. They \nleave and they are gone for 18 months.\n  Under our current rules, which are not working, not only does that \nsoldier make the sacrifice but our Government is asking that family in \nsome cases to take a 30- to 40-percent decrease in pay. I just cannot \nunderstand it. Nothing about it makes sense. It defies common sense. \nHow can we recruit Guard and Reserve, then send them to long \ndeployments, sometimes without even the equipment they need--which is a \nwhole other issue--but ask their families to take a 30- and 40-percent \ndecrease? I do not understand it.\n  I know we have not done this in the past, but this Senator from \nLouisiana thinks it is time to do it for the future. I hope we can \nagain take bipartisan action on this Senate floor, as we have done so \nmany times before, to support the amendment offered by the Senator from \nIllinois, at least in the Federal employ, our own engineers, our own \nscientists, our own nurses, our own doctors, our own office \nadministrators, when we ask them to put the uniform on and go to the \nfrontline to take the bullets, that as an employer we do not say: And \nalso, by the way, we would like your spouse and your children to live \non 30 percent less income while you are away.\n  If the country was in crisis in terms of no money for anyone and we \nwere all on rations and we were all sacrificing financially and we did \nnot have the money, I think these families would say: Look, we are all \nin the same boat. We are serving the country. We will take the 30-\npercent cut in pay. But what gets me, what galls me, what makes me so \nangry is, this Congress is giving other families who do not put the \nuniform on, other families who are making upwards of $350,000, \n$400,000, $500,000, tax cuts, and we cannot seem to find the will, the \nenergy, or the focus to help the small group of families that one could \nargue are bearing the entire burden in some cases--let me repeat, the \nentire burden of the war on terror. I do not understand it. Senator \nDurbin does not understand it. Senator Bayh does not understand it. The \nSenators have voted now unanimously.\n  What happens to this amendment when it goes to the House of \nRepresentatives? What should I tell the Guard and Reserve families who \nwent to Iraq, over 6,000 of them--3,000 of them just came home and a \nthird of the ones who just came home came home to no house, no school, \nand no church. Now I have to go home and say that Congress is going to \nget ready to pass another spending bill, another tax bill, and I am \nsorry, yes, you have, once again, been left out. I do not even know how \nto explain it because it cannot be explained.\n  Senator Durbin's amendment simply says, let the Federal Government be \nthe leader. Let the Federal Government set the pace as an employer. Let \nus at least do what other States and other employers are doing, fill \nthe gap, stand in the gap for them. They are taking the bullets. They \nare taking the risk with their lives. Why would we ask our Federal \nemployees to take a serious pay cut? I do not think we should. Again, \nif we did not have any money at all, if we were just flat broke, then \nmaybe we would have to. We give money away to everybody, but we cannot \ngive it to our Federal employees who are serving this country twice: as \npublic servants so they do not get a very high salary normally, and \nthen they go to the frontlines and take the bullets and get a salary \ncut even lower, and we think that is perfectly fine.\n  Well, this Senator does not think it is fine. This Senator thinks we \ncan do\n\n[[Page S12583]]\n\nbetter. This Senator thinks we need to have better priorities. This \nSenator believes we need to have different priorities that support our \nNation, support our services, support our Guard and Reserve, and it \nwould ultimately support the country. And, frankly, it is the right \nthing to do.\n  I see the Senator from Michigan.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, this is an important amendment. It has been \noffered on behalf of Senator Bayh, by Senator Durbin. Senator Landrieu \nis a very passionate and persuasive supporter of this amendment. I \nthink Senators Bayh, Durbin, and Landrieu are right; that we basically \ndesigned the Guard and Reserve force to be a strategic reserve. As a \npractical matter, now they are effectively part of our operational \nforces. We have to change this arrangement so they do not take such a \nsevere hit as they are being called up, and they are now in for longer \nand longer periods. I do not have the statistics on how long the \naverage period of callup is now, but I am quite confident that if we \ncould compare the length of the callup, say, during the last few years \nto the periods between 1973, when we ended the draft, that we would see \nthere has been a dramatic increase in the length of the callup.\n  I support the amendment. I think we can make some real progress--I \nhope we can--this year in conference on this matter. It is a reasonable \ncost, a fair cost. It is something on which we can do better, and the \ntroops deserve that we do better.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, first I commend all Senators who have \nparticipated in this debate. Each time I listen to the distinguished \nSenator from Louisiana, I say to my ranking member, she was a very \nvalued member of our committee before she went AWOL.\n  Mr. LEVIN. She is still part of the Guard and Reserve, though.\n  Mr. WARNER. Yes, proceeding to the Appropriations Committee, where \nsome think all power resides in the Senate.\n  Nevertheless, to think that the Senator found time to work on this \namendment, as she has on a number of personnel issues through the \nyears--I remember the last authorization bill. Does the Senator from \nMichigan remember that?\n  Mr. LEVIN. I do, indeed.\n  Mr. WARNER. One of the last amendments we were dealing with was on \npersonnel issues. Anyway, the Senator from Louisiana found time to be \nhere, given the tremendous burdens that she has in connection with the \ntragic suffering in her State, past, present, and possibly the future. \nI point out to my colleagues a provision comparable to this is in the \nHouse bill now in conference, therefore, that we go to.\n  Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, I rise today for a cause that is essential \nto preserving our Nation's security by ensuring the Guard and Reserve \nremain a vital component of our national security structure. I also \nrise to defend our moral obligation to do right by our fellow citizens \nwho bear the burden of battle and by their loved ones who make it \npossible for them to do that by supporting them here at home.\n  No one should be forced to choose between doing right by their family \nand their loved ones and doing right by their country, but too often \ntoday we have placed thousands of our fellow citizens in exactly that \nposition. That is what this amendment is designed to correct.\n  We now have 145,000 guardsmen and reservists serving who have been \ncalled to active duty. Fully 35 percent of our troops in Iraq are \nguardsmen and reservists, many of them putting their lives in harm's \nway. Just this last week, I took the liberty of spending a couple of \nhours out at Walter Reed Army Hospital. Many of the most grievously \ninjured there have served in the Guard and Reserve. We owe it to do \nright by them.\n  Their deployments are lasting longer than before. Since the Korean \nWar, it is our practice to only have them called to active duty for no \nmore than 6 months. But today, it is routine, not at all uncommon, for \nthem to be called to active duty for more than a year and sometimes \nmultiple calls.\n  Mr. President, 51 percent of these individuals whose lives we are \ndisrupting, 51 percent who are serving, many of them in harm's way, \nsuffer a substantial loss of income, what I have referred to as the \n``patriot penalty.'' The average loss of income is about $4,400 per \nsoldier--a material amount of money for many Americans. Our amendment, \nwith the support of Senator Durbin, Senator Landrieu, the active \nsupport of Senators Warner and Levin, would help to correct this \nsituation by providing up to $3,000 per month in making up lost income \nfor our Reserve and Guard men and women.\n  This is important to maintaining the Guard as a critical component of \nour national security structure. We are currently running, in the Army \nGuard, about 24 percent below our recruiting goals. The commander of \nthe Reserve not too long ago described his force as ``a broken force.'' \nAt a time when we are relying upon the Guard and the Reserve more than \never before, we must ensure that we act to maintain our recruiting \ngoals and to ensure the morale of the force.\n  Many laudable private firms have risen to the challenge by providing \nfor their employees but, regrettably, not all do so. About 29 percent \nof employers are currently doing that, but that still leaves the bulk \nof our Guard men and women and our reservists without, so we have acted \nto make up that gap. It is not a burden they could have reasonably \nanticipated, given the difference in callups today versus before.\n  I again thank my distinguished colleagues, the Senator from Virginia \nand the Senator from Michigan. Once again, I thank my colleague Dick \nDurbin, who has been extremely gracious and who has been a strong \nleader in this capacity.\n  I will conclude by saying the true test of a strong society is not \nonly the armaments we purchase but how we support those who bear the \nburden of battle and their loved ones here at home. If we can help them \npay the mortgage or keep food on the table while they are serving us in \nIraq and Afghanistan and elsewhere, it is not only the intelligent \nthing to do, it is the morally responsible thing to do. That is what \nthis amendment would accomplish.\n  I thank my colleagues for their graciousness and their support.\n  Mr. WARNER. I urge adoption of this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is all time yielded back?\n  Mr. LEVIN. I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 2483) was agreed to.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. WARNER. I say to my colleagues, this is a matter that we will \ncarefully review in conference. It has failed to survive in previous \nconferences, but I think this time it may, particularly because of the \nquestion of recruiting and the difficulty of the Reserves and Guard and \nthe adjustment to family life. As the Senator pointed out, hundreds \nupon hundreds of thousands--700,000 I believe--have been involved in \nthis conflict.\n  Mr. LEVIN. If the Senator would yield on that?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. It seems to me, the fact that there is a provision in both \nbills does increase the opportunity and the likelihood this time around \nthat we will come out of conference with something. All we can do is \ncontinue to try, but I am a little more optimistic now that this \namendment passed. Again, we thank the Senators from Indiana, Illinois, \nand Louisiana for their leadership.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana is recognized.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I see the lead sponsor of the amendment on the floor, \nso let me be brief so he can close out. I thank the leadership for \naccepting this amendment. I know they will fight hard to keep this in \nconference as we move forward because it really is an important part of \nour strategic alignment for the future. I thank the chairman and the \nranking member for their\n\n[[Page S12584]]\n\nleadership not just today but over time, for doing the right thing by \nour troops and always being willing to think about new ways of making \nour military stronger and better.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. WARNER. If I can make one comment before our distinguished \ncolleague from Louisiana leaves the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. WARNER. There comes a time every now and then to reflect on the \npast with a sense of humor. When I was a young Senator many years ago, \none of the Senator's predecessors was Russell Long. His expertise was \nin the area of taxes. How many times, I ask my good friend from \nMichigan, would I hear him in these vigorous floor debates come over \nand say: We will drop it in conference; accept it?\n  Mr. LEVIN. Usually with his arm around you.\n  Mr. WARNER. With his arm around you shaking you like a tree. But we \nare not saying that.\n  I just thought maybe that little bit of color might remind \nLouisianans of his proud record in the Senate.\n  Mr. President, this is another example of how the managers, in the \ncourse of colloquies, can work out amendments. I strongly urge \ncolleagues to come forward because we are getting down to the few \namendments that are remaining in the hopes that this bill can be acted \non for final passage tomorrow, as early as possible in the day.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, my understanding is that at 5:30 there will \nbe two votes. I am wondering if Senator Lautenberg's amendment has \nbeen--I know it has been offered. I am wondering whether there is \nfurther debate on the Lautenberg amendment.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I wish to say to my colleague at the \npresent time I am drafting an amendment in the second degree. As soon \nas I have it, I will be prepared to debate it on the floor and let the \nmatter go to a vote.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I think it is very helpful that Senator Lautenberg be \ninformed that there is a plan to offer a second-degree amendment so \nperhaps he can then be prepared to come to the floor and debate \nwhatever that second-degree amendment is.\n  Mr. WARNER. I would propose to do it. I would have to check. There \nare three amendments, and actually the fourth is the pending amendment. \nI will see if he cannot possibly bring up his amendment right after the \ntwo votes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Perhaps during those two votes, if the chairman so \ndesires, we could try to line up the rest of the business for tonight.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank my partner, who has been most helpful in getting \nthis bill passed. We are going to try and facilitate that.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, I have many of my colleagues to thank for \ntheir graciousness and for their attention to an issue of significant \nimportance to our country. I would like to start with my friend and \ncolleague, Dick Durbin from Illinois, who has cared about this issue \nfor many years, particularly with regard to our Federal employees who \nare bearing the burden of battle today on our behalf just as they work \nfor us in their civilian capacities here at home.\n  Senator Durbin has been a model of comity and accommodation and in a \nbody that is too often driven by other interests. I thank him profusely \nfor his consideration here today.\n  I also thank Senator Landrieu for her longstanding interest in this \nissue. She has had a somewhat different approach, but it would achieve \nthe same objective--helping our Guard men and women and their families \nwhile they are serving our country.\n  I also express my appreciation to the two leaders on the Armed \nServices Committee, Senators Warner and Levin, for their courtesy. I \nthank you for accepting our amendment. I know you share our conviction \nabout doing right by our brave men and women in the Guard and Reserve, \nand I wish to express my personal appreciation for your accommodation \nin this regard. I know there are occasionally differences of opinion \nabout some aspects of this, and the fact that we could work through \nthem at this moment means a great deal to me, as I know it does to the \nfamilies of the Guard men and women we are attempting to help.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, the distinguished Senator from Indiana has \nhad a lot on his mind here recently with the tragic natural disaster in \nhis State, and I thank him for finding the time to come to the Chamber \nand offer this amendment. I recall, during the markup of the Armed \nServices bill, he, being a very valued member of the committee, had \nthis general concept in mind. The Senator advised the committee as a \nwhole in the markup session that at the time this bill reached the \nfloor, he would have formulated his thoughts and done his research and \ngathered his colleagues and would present this bill. That he has done, \nand in that he has succeeded. This is a matter we will take up in \nconference with careful consideration.\n  I thank our colleague.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, let me add my thanks to the Senator from \nIndiana for his eloquent, passionate portrayal of the needs and \nresponsibilities we have to carry out toward our guardsmen and \nreservists.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, it is just a matter of minutes before we \nstart the votes. Perhaps the distinguished Senator from Georgia would \nlike to make some explanation about the vote coming up?\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2433\n\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, these next couple of votes involve an \namendment I filed and an amendment the Senator from Illinois, Mr. \nDurbin, has filed. I think the significant thing about both amendments \nis that we are finally starting to recognize that, because we are \ncalling up our Guard and Reserve folks on an all too regular basis \nthese days, and because today, as we enjoy the freedoms that we \nsometimes take for granted in this country, we have troops serving in \nIraq, 60 percent of whom are Guard and Reserve troops, it is necessary \nthat we continue down the path we have been down for the last several \nyears under the leadership of Senator Warner and Senator Levin, trying \nto increase the benefits to our Guard and Reserve and the families of \nthose brave men and women. Both these amendments seek to do that.\n  There is a fundamental difference in the two amendments, though. My \namendment, the underlying amendment, provides for a reduction in \nretirement age from 60 to 55 for reservists, based upon the activation \nof those reservists and Guard men and women into contingency areas. For \nevery 3 months they have been activated and sent into a conflict, they \nreceive a 1-for-1 or 3-month reduction in the retirement age, from 60 \ndown to the minimum or lower level of 55. The Durbin amendment simply \nwould not make that kind of 1-to-1 offset but would treat the Guard and \nReserve the same as the Active-Duty folks. Unfortunately, the \ndifference between the two is we cannot afford the Durbin amendment.\n  What my amendment does is to ultimately allow the reduction down to \nage 55 for those Reserve and Guard people who are activated. It has a \ncost, over 5 years, of about $320 million. The Durbin amendment has a \ncost of about $4.8 billion over that same 5-year period. That is such a \nsignificant difference that, in my opinion, we will never get that \ndone.\n  My amendment can be done. It is a movement in the right direction, to \nrecognize that we are calling up these folks on a more regular basis \nand that we should continue to provide them and their families with \nsome security measures from the standpoint of incentivizing them to go \ninto the Guard and Reserve and stay in the Guard and Reserve.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n\n[[Page S12585]]\n\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. The Durbin amendment would not do that. Mine would.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the vote be \ndelayed by 5 minutes so the Senators may have a minute or 2, I can have \na minute or 2, and the Senator from Michigan can have a minute or 2.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, if we are going to call on these brave \nvolunteers, we need to incentivize them, and my amendment does that. It \nseeks to call on the individual from a volunteer standpoint. It doesn't \nseek to protect the top level, the officers and the uppercrust, the \nenlisted personnel. It seeks to protect all members of the Guard and \nReserve from the enlisted standpoint and give them an opportunity to \nreduce their retirement age from 60 down to 55.\n  I think it is fair. I think it is reasonable. And I think it is \nsupportable.\n  I ask my colleagues to support my amendment and to vote against the \nDurbin amendment.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Senator Hagel be added as a cosponsor of \nmy amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I likewise ask to be added as a cosponsor \nof the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I strongly support the Chambliss \namendment.\n  I want to bring to the attention of colleagues that a minute ago we \naccepted another amendment which will go to conference, and I am quite \nconfident that out of that conference will come a package of further \ncompensation to the men and women for the Guard and Reserve for other \nreasons. But in this bill we are adding enormous benefits for the men \nand women in the Armed Forces, all of which are justified in many \nareas. The Senator has picked out an area which has been under \nconsideration for some period of time. But I point out that the cost of \nthe Durbin second degree, which vote will follow this one, must be \nconsidered in the area of $1 billion for their 2006 and $10 billion \nover the next 10 years. That is 10 times, according to my calculation, \nthe cost to the Federal taxpayer of the amendment of the Senator from \nGeorgia.\n  Am I correct?\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. That is correct.\n  Mr. WARNER. So I urge my colleagues we must show some restraint as we \nare going through a number of valid and important increments in pay and \nbenefits for the men and women in the Armed Forces. In essence, the \nChambliss amendment is an adaptation of the Durbin amendment but at \none-tenth the cost because I think you are more equitably treating \nthose who have served in periods of active service.\n  I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I support very much the Chambliss \namendment. I think it makes an important statement, as well as taking \nan important step toward greater equity relative to retirement. The \nSenator from Georgia has described his amendment, and I will not \ndescribe it again because he has accurately described it.\n  I commend him for this amendment. It is an important amendment.\n  I ask the Presiding Officer whether there is time between the vote on \nthe Chambliss amendment and the Durbin amendment for an explanation of \nthe Durbin amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 2 minutes equally divided.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I will be in a position of supporting the Chambliss and \nDurbin amendments. While the Chambliss amendment takes an important \nstep, the Durbin amendment takes three or four important steps in the \nright direction allowing earlier retirement. Where there has been 25 \nyears of service, for instance, retirement would be allowed at age 55. \nWhere there has been 24 years of service under the Durbin amendment, \nretirement would be allowed at age 56. There is a greater cost. I think \nit is justified. We will talk more about that in the minute which has \nbeen allowed on the Durbin amendment.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a letter \nfrom the Naval Reserve Association in support of my amendment be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                    Naval Reserve Association,\n\n                                 Alexandria. VA, November 8, 2005.\n     Sen. Saxby Chambliss,\n     Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Chambliss: I am writing on behalf of the \n     members of the Naval Reserve Association in support of your \n     amendment to reduce the age at which reserve component \n     members receive their retirement pension.\n       An active component member retiring at 20 years of service \n     receives a pension immediately upon retirement. A reserve \n     component member serving the same number of qualifying years \n     cannot. Reducing the age from 60, will be a positive step in \n     mitigating this disparity. A more equitable retirement \n     program will aid greatly in recruiting and retaining members \n     in the Navy Reserve, and all reserve components. When the age \n     limit for receipt of retired pay by reserve component members \n     was set decades ago, the Navy Reserve, and other reserve \n     components, was not relied upon the way it is today.\n       The objective is to support the reduction of the age for \n     retirement eligibility from its current level to one that is \n     consistent with today's utilization of the reserve component. \n     Your new legislation which links that reduction to duty in a \n     recalled to active duty status accomplishes that goal.\n       I look forward to working together in support of a strong \n     and viable Navy Reserve, and all reserve components. Again, \n     on behalf of the members of the Naval Reserve Association and \n     members of the Navy Reserve, thank you for all your hard work \n     on our behalf.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Casey W. Coane,\n                               RADM, USN (Ret) Executive Director.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I also ask for the yeas and nays on the \nDurbin amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment of the Senator from \nGeorgia. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from New Jersey (Mr. Corzine) \nis necessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Vitter). Are there any other Senators in \nthe Chamber desiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 99, nays 0, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 314 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--99\n\n     Akaka\n     Alexander\n     Allard\n     Allen\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Bennett\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Bond\n     Boxer\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Burr\n     Byrd\n     Cantwell\n     Carper\n     Chafee\n     Chambliss\n     Clinton\n     Coburn\n     Cochran\n     Coleman\n     Collins\n     Conrad\n     Cornyn\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     Dayton\n     DeMint\n     DeWine\n     Dodd\n     Dole\n     Domenici\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Frist\n     Graham\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Harkin\n     Hatch\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Inouye\n     Isakson\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Kyl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     Martinez\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Mikulski\n     Murkowski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Obama\n     Pryor\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Roberts\n     Rockefeller\n     Salazar\n     Santorum\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stabenow\n     Stevens\n     Sununu\n     Talent\n     Thomas\n     Thune\n     Vitter\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n     Wyden\n\n                             NOT VOTING--1\n\n       \n     Corzine\n       \n  The amendment (No. 2433) was agreed to.\n  Mr. WARNER. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are now 2 minutes of debate equally \ndivided on the upcoming amendment.\n  The Senator from Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, we have this vote. We are making great \nprogress on this bill. I will be consulting with the leadership. There \nis a\n\n[[Page S12586]]\n\npossibility we would like to continue tonight, but with regard to \nfurther rollcall votes, we will have to consult our respective leaders \nto determine that. We will do that as quickly as possible so as to \nconvenience Senators. But this bill will go on tonight. It may well be \nwe debate amendments and stack them for the morning.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Is there any way of determining that now?\n  Mr. WARNER. Well, I have to get my leader, I have to tell you. I know \nhe came on and off the floor.\n  Mr. President, the managers wish to advise the Senate that this will \nprobably be the last rollcall vote tonight. But we will continue to \ndebate amendments and stack them for a time agreed upon by the two \nleaders for tomorrow morning.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 2473, as Modified\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time on the amendment?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, if I could have the attention of the \nChamber for 60 seconds.\n  The last amendment by Senator Chambliss received 99 votes. We all \njoined in supporting it. It was a good amendment. This amendment, which \nI am offering, I think is better. Here is why.\n  Under the amendment offered by Senator Chambliss, you could reduce \nthe age at which you are eligible as a reservist to start receiving \nyour retirement based on the time you spent mobilized, activated. This \namendment says you could reduce it by the time served in the Reserve.\n  Right now, no matter when you start, how long you serve, you cannot \ndraw the first dollar in retirement until you are 60 years old. Under \nmy amendment, if you have served 25 years in the Reserve, you could \nstart drawing it at age 55, which is the common retirement age for \ncivil servants, for Federal employees.\n  My amendment is endorsed by the National Guard Association, the \nMilitary Officers Association, and the Reserve Officers Association.\n       Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to add Senators \n     Corzine and Landrieu as cosponsors.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Who seeks time in opposition?\n  The Senator from Georgia is recognized.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, as I said earlier, while I sympathize \nwith the Senator from Illinois, because this is a critical issue, it is \nsimply a matter of not being able to provide the funding for this \nparticular retirement bill.\n  We had this issue up last year, and we did not get the funding for \nit. My bill takes a more reasonable approach. It rewards those men and \nwomen who are serving in Iraq today.\n  I ask that we render a ``no'' vote against this amendment so we can \nmake a strong move to include my amendment in the conference report \nthat will be forthcoming.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment. \nThe yeas and nays have been ordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from New Jersey (Mr. Corzine) \nis necessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \ndesiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 40, nays 59, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 315 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--40\n\n     Akaka\n     Bayh\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Byrd\n     Cantwell\n     Clinton\n     Dayton\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Harkin\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     Mikulski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Obama\n     Pryor\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Rockefeller\n     Salazar\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Stabenow\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--59\n\n     Alexander\n     Allard\n     Allen\n     Baucus\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Burr\n     Carper\n     Chafee\n     Chambliss\n     Coburn\n     Cochran\n     Coleman\n     Collins\n     Conrad\n     Cornyn\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     DeMint\n     DeWine\n     Dole\n     Domenici\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Frist\n     Graham\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Hatch\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Isakson\n     Kyl\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     Martinez\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Murkowski\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Roberts\n     Santorum\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Sununu\n     Talent\n     Thomas\n     Thune\n     Vitter\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n\n                             NOT VOTING--1\n\n       \n     Corzine\n       \n  The amendment (No. 2473), as modified, was rejected.\n  Mr. WARNER.

Mr. President, I see the distinguished Senator from \nMissouri and the Senator from Connecticut. This is one of the \namendments in the 12 on this side of the aisle. I would like to have \nthis amendment move forward.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2477\n\n  Mr. Talent. Mr. President, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To modify the multiyear procurement authority for C-17 \n                               aircraft)\n\n       Strike section 131 and insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 131. C-17 AIRCRAFT PROGRAM AND INTER-THEATER AIRLIFT \n                   REQUIREMENTS.\n\n       (a) Multiyear Procurement Authorized.--The Secretary of the \n     Air Force may, in accordance with section 2306b of title 10, \n     United States Code, enter into a multiyear contract, \n     beginning with the fiscal year 2006 program year, for the \n     procurement of up to 42 additional C-17 aircraft.\n       (b) Certification Required.--Before the exercise of the \n     authority in subsection (a), the Secretary of Defense shall \n     submit to the congressional defense committees a \n     certification that the additional airlift capacity to be \n     provided by the C-17 aircraft to be procured under the \n     authority is consistent with the quadrennial defense review \n     under section 118 of title 10, United States Code, to be \n     submitted to Congress with the budget of the President for \n     fiscal year 2007 (as submitted under section 1105(a) of title \n     31, United States Code), as qualified by subsection (c).\n       (c) Additional Explanation of Inter-Theater Airlift \n     Requirements.--\n       (1) Inclusion in quadrennial defense review.--The Secretary \n     of Defense shall, as part of the quadrennial defense review \n     in 2005 and in accordance with the provisions of section \n     118(d)(9) of title 10, United States Code, carry out an \n     assessment of the inter-theater airlift capabilities required \n     to support the national defense strategy.\n       (2) Additional information.--In including the assessment \n     required by paragraph (1) in the quadrennial defense review \n     as required by that paragraph, the Secretary shall explain \n     how the recommendations for future airlift force structure \n     requirements in that quadrennial defense review take into \n     account the following:\n       (A) The increased airlift demands associated with the Army \n     modular brigade combat teams.\n       (B) The objective to deliver a brigade combat team anywhere \n     in the world within four to seven days, a division within 10 \n     days, and multiple divisions within 20 days.\n       (C) The increased airlift demands associated with the \n     expanded scope of operational activities of the Special \n     Operations forces.\n       (D) The realignment of the overseas basing structure in \n     accordance with the Integrated Presence and Basing Strategy.\n       (E) Adjustments in the force structure to meet homeland \n     defense requirements.\n       (F) The potential for simultaneous homeland defense \n     activities and major combat operations.\n       (G) Potential changes in requirements for intra-theater \n     airlift or sealift capabilities.\n       (d) Maintenance of C-17 Aircraft Production Line.--In the \n     event the Secretary of Defense is unable to make the \n     certification specified in subsection (b), the Secretary of \n     the Air Force should procure sufficient C-17 aircraft to \n     maintain the C-17 aircraft production line at not less than \n     the minimum sustaining rate until sufficient flight test data \n     regarding improved C-5 aircraft mission capability rates as a \n     result of the Reliability Enhancement and Re-engining Program \n     and Avionics Modernization Program have been obtained to \n     determine the validity of assumptions concerning the C-5 \n     aircraft used in the Mobility Capabilities Study.\n  Mr. TALENT. Mr. President, Senator Lieberman and I are offering an \namendment that we believe is crucial to providing our Armed Forces with \nthe air transport capabilities they\n\n[[Page S12587]]\n\nneed. The amendment has been cosponsored by Chairman Warner and \nSenators Stevens, Boxer, Feinstein, Cornyn, Chambliss, and others. In \naddition, we have worked closely with the chairman and Senator Levin \nand committee staff, and the amendment has been cleared on both sides. \nI am grateful to the managers of the bill for their work on this \nimportant legislation.\n  The Defense Department's current intertheater airlift requirement was \nestablished by the Mobility Requirement Study, called MRS-05, which was \nreleased in December 2000. That study identified the airlift necessary \nto conduct high-priority missions in support of two major theater wars. \nThat was the national military strategy at the time, to be able to \nconduct two major theater wars at the same time.\n  Even back in 2001, recently retired TRANSCOM Commander, GEN John \nHandy, identified the Department's pre-September 11 intertheater \nairlift requirements as inadequate. He characterized that study, which \nwas a pre-9/11 study, shortly after its release as a historical \ndocument, not of great value, because in his judgment it significantly \nunderestimated the true airlift requirements of the Department even at \nthat time. I will expand on this point in a few minutes.\n  We are now learning that the Department's most recent study has \ncompletely failed to readjust the airlift requirement in light of all \nthe different missions in which the United States is now and will be \nengaged for years to come--the global war on terror, international \nhumanitarian relief missions, expanded special operations and training, \nto say nothing of our need to support the underlying national military \nstrategy needs.\n  The C-17 is the primary intertheater air transport used by the United \nStates to deploy and sustain forces overseas. It has delivered 70 \npercent of the cargo airlifted into Iraq. It has turned in stellar \nperformances in theaters from Kosovo to Afghanistan to the global war \non terror in all its various locations. In addition, the C-17 played a \nkey role in several recent humanitarian relief missions, including the \nresponse to the gulf coast hurricanes and the earthquake in Pakistan.\n  The Chief of Staff for the Air Force, GEN Michael Moseley, recently \nsaid that the C-17 has ``proven its worth in gold.''\n  The real question before the Senate is not whether we need additional \nintertheater airlift but how much more airlift is required. The Air \nForce's longstanding position, reiterated time and again over the last \nfew years, has been at least 222 C-17s--42 more than the planned \nprocurement of 180 aircraft--are needed to meet growing airlift \nrequirements. General Handy repeatedly testified that 222 C-17s would \nbe the minimum necessary to meet our airlift requirements and that even \nmore may be needed, and this is in addition to other programs for \nincreasing the lift capabilities of the Department.\n  The Department's decision regarding future C-17 production is, we \nbelieve, imminent. Senator Lieberman and I believe if we do not procure \nadditional transports, our intertheater airlift capabilities will be \ninadequate to meet our military's needs. We will lack the lift \ncapability needed to deploy and adequately sustain forces overseas.\n  While our primary responsibilities must be to our military personnel \nand national security, there is also a significant economic stake for \nmany States. C-17 production generates approximately $8.4 billion in \neconomic activity and is supported by 702 suppliers in 42 States. This \nis a major industrial base issue. St. Louis is one of the essential \nsuppliers of components for the C-17. I have had the privilege of \nvisiting workers who build parts for the plane.\n  There are over 1,800 people throughout Missouri who help build the C-\n17, which generates more than $776 million in economic impact. States \nsuch as California, New York, Illinois, Iowa, Connecticut, Florida, and \nWashington have over 491 C-17 suppliers that generate over $5.5 billion \nof economic activity in these States alone.\n  Despite the facts I recited before about airlift, it has been \nreported that the draft version of the new Mobility Capabilities Study \nrecommends no further C-17 production beyond 180 aircraft, at least 42 \ntransports short of the minimum number required. Incredibly, the new \nMobility Capabilities Study calls for the same transport force \nstructure planned before 9/11, and it sets forth the same airlift \nrequirement in the pre-9/11 days. Again, even before 9/11, the head of \nTRANSCOM, General Handy, said the Department's estimate of its airlift \nrequirement was out of date. Yet the draft study doesn't increase that \nrequirement, even given the undeniable additional needs since the \nglobal war on terror began.\n  The Talent-Lieberman amendment would accomplish three objectives to \nprotect the lift capability needed to deploy and sustain forces \noverseas.\n  First, it would authorize a multiyear contract for the purchase of up \nto 42 additional C-17 aircraft.\n  Second, the amendment urges the Secretary of the Air Force to sustain \nthe production line by procuring a minimum sustaining production rate \nof C-17s per year at least until further assessment of airlift needs \nare completed.\n  Third, it requires the Secretary of Defense to certify whether there \nis a need for additional C-17s by assessing the additional intertheater \nairlift requirements generated by seven factors which have to be \nconsidered but which were not considered, we believe, in the flawed \nmobility study, including the Army's shift to brigade combat teams, its \ngoal of deploying a brigade anywhere in the world in 4 to 7 days, and a \ndivision anywhere in the world in 10 days, our increased involvement in \ninternational humanitarian relief missions and deployment back to the \nUnited States of forces as part of the Global Posture Review.\n  We cannot pull back from forward bases around the world. We cannot \nadapt increased requirements for being able to move substantial forces \nof the Army around the world. We cannot fight a global war on terror \neverywhere and perform humanitarian relief functions around the world. \nWe cannot do these things without adequate lift.\n  What is at stake is the ability of the United States to project its \nmilitary power on the world and to project aid where necessary on a \nhumanitarian basis around the world. It is this airlift which enables \nus to do the other transformational things in the military which are \nthe way we hope to sustain an adequate military force while also having \nsome economies.\n  Senator Lieberman and I offer this amendment because intertheater \nairlift is the means by which our forces deploy on short notice \nanywhere in the world and a primary means by which we sustain deployed \nforces. When the Chief of Staff of the Air Force, the recently retired \nhead of TRANSCOM, and others who understand the central importance of \nairlift for our services tell us about how vital this aircraft is to \nthe military's air transport needs, we believe it is prudent to take \ntheir word for it and plan accordingly.\n  It is my understanding this amendment has been agreed to on both \nsides. We are certainly grateful for that. I appreciate the leadership \nof the floor managers in being able to reach that agreement.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks time? The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise to speak in favor of the \namendment that I am privileged to cosponsor with my friend from \nMissouri. He spoke very comprehensively and eloquently about it. I will \nsay a few words and associate myself with everything he has said.\n  This is all about strategic airlift. It is all about the ability to \ndeploy our forces and the equipment and materials to sustain them to \nbattlefields around the world. The C-17, a remarkable aircraft, has \ndone that with enormous efficiency, reliability, and skill.\n  I have been around here long enough now that I remember when the \nmilitary was pleading with us in Congress to authorize and appropriate \nfor the development of a new strategic airlift capacity. It became the \nC-17. I remember the arguments. The strategic airlift is like the long \npole in a tent. If the pole is gone, the tent collapses. If you cannot \nget your forces, material, and equipment to support them to the field \nof battle around the world--the fields of battle are not only dispersed \naround the world but in very different circumstances often without \ntypical or\n\n[[Page S12588]]\n\nconventional airfields on which to land--then you can't fight the \nbattle.\n  From that plea over a period of years came the design and \nconstruction of the C-17. I remember the first day I saw the first C-17 \nfly into an airfield in East Hartford, associated with Pratt & Whitney \nwho, I am proud to say, builds the engines for these planes. It is \nremarkable. It is an enormous plane. The pilots flew it with an ease \nand mobility that made it seem like a much smaller plane.\n  It has performed admirably over the years. Time after time, members \nof the Armed Services Committee, on which the Senator from Missouri and \nI are privileged to serve, have heard our warfighting commanders tell \nus that they don't have enough strategic airlift.\n  I am privileged to serve as the ranking Democrat on the Airland \nSubcommittee of the Armed Services Committee. We authorize strategic \nairlift, and here, too, we have heard over and over, one, about the \nneed and, two, about the enormously impressive performance of the C-17.\n  It is the heart of our strategic airlift. The Air Force, as my friend \nfrom Missouri, Senator Talent, has said, has contended over and over--\nand this reaches a level of a plea also--that we need 222 C-17s. That \nis a position held by the U.S. Transportation Command, which is \nresponsible for the planning and providing of strategic transportation \nfor our military.\n  Here is the problem and what brings Senator Talent and I and a very \nbroad group of Senators of both parties to offer this amendment.\n  A study has recently been completed by the Department of Defense \ncalled the Mobility Capabilities Study. It concludes, uniquely--no one \nelse has--that the need now is only for 180 C-17s; again, at odds with \nthe Transportation Command. Here is the problem. If that position holds \nand we stop production of the C-17 at 180, that would mean production \nwould end in 2008 and the production line would close. It is hard to \nstart it up again--impossible to start it up again. A lot of people \naround the country, including in Connecticut, will lose their jobs.\n  There is a fundamental flaw to the Mobility Capabilities Study. It is \nsimply that the case has not been made that we are going to adequately \nsupport our military with 180 of these planes. We need 222.\n  The Mobility Capabilities Study has serious limits and flaws. The \nfirst point is that it started several years ago, and its conclusions \nare based on assumptions that I contend are no longer valid.\n  Among these that concern me most are the assumptions that the \nplanning scenarios in place during the study, the war situation \nscenarios, need situation scenarios, are still valid. Also, that there \nwill be no increase in demand from revisions in those planning \nscenarios, that there will be no increase in what we call intertheater \ndemand--within the theater--demand for strategic airlift, and there \nwill be no significant increase in concurrent demand associated with \nhomeland defense at the same time there are major combat operations \noverseas underway.\n  Senator Talent pointed out that recently the C-17s were used to bring \ncritically important materials into the gulf coast area after Hurricane \nKatrina struck.\n  I say that all of these assumptions of the Mobility Capabilities \nStudy, which reached this unique conclusion that we will be safe with \n180 C-17s, are suspect. The fact is, the Department of Defense is now \nlooking at some very different military planning scenarios which would \noccasion very significant demand for the C-17 strategic airlift \ncapacity.\n  We know that in-theater demand for this capacity has obviously \nincreased in Iraq because of the danger of ground movement, and the C-\n17s have met that need brilliantly and reliably.\n  Subsequent insurgencies, the kinds of unconventional conflicts and \nthreats we are likely to face in the years ahead, will also require the \nkind of unique capacity that this aircraft has to carry an enormous \namount of material or personnel and land in very unconventional and \ndifferent topographies.\n  There is now, as we know, a Quadrennial Defense Review underway. That \nis done every 4 years within the Pentagon to sketch out--more than \nsketch out--to define and delineate the strategic and specific materiel \nneeds of our military to execute the national military strategy. That \nQDR is underway and probably will address these issues. I personally \nbelieve that the QDR will increase the requirement for strategic \nairlift, not decrease it, as the Mobility Capabilities Study suggests.\n  This amendment is protection against the implementation of the \nMobility Capabilities Study numbers prematurely, of the shutting down \nof these production lines, of the loss of jobs, and of the inability to \nmeet the strategic airlift needs of our military.\n  The amendment says the Secretary of the Air Force may execute a \nmultiyear contract for the 42 more airplanes that would bring us to the \n222 standing requirement, that the Department of Defense must \nreconsider the validity of those Mobility Capabilities Study \nassumptions during the QDR, and that the production line for the C-17s \nand all component parts must be kept operating at least at a minimum \nsustaining rate until we are confident of what we need.\n  This is a hedge against a precipitous and, I would say, dangerous \ndecision made based on a single study done within the Pentagon.\n  I am grateful for the encouragement and, I hope and believe, support \nof the chairman of the Armed Services Committee and the ranking \nDemocrat. I thank Senator Talent for all the work he has done to bring \nthis forward. It has been a pleasure working with him.\n  I ask my colleagues to support the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I strongly endorse the amendment by our \ncolleagues, both the Senator from Missouri and the Senator from \nConnecticut. They have carefully discussed with us the process by which \nthey arrived at this conclusion. I must say, putting aside a little \nmodesty, years and years ago, I was the one who on several occasions \nworked with others in this Senate to save the C-17 from even coming \ninto being. We could see the needs into the future.\n  This plane has been an absolute, rock-solid performer in our \ninventory of airlift. I think this amendment comes at a critical time, \nexpressing the desires of the Congress. It gives flexibility to the \nSecretary of the Air Force and the Secretary of Defense to proceed. I \nstrongly support it.\n  At this time, it may be necessary to put in a quorum call so the \nmatter can be discussed. Is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that my friend \nand colleague from Connecticut, Senator Dodd, be added as an original \ncosponsor of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. He has been a steadfast and I would go so far as to \nsay a fervent supporter of the C-17 over the years of the existence of \nthis program, and on behalf of Senator Talent, I ask that when a vote \nis taken on this amendment, it be taken by rollcall.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, we support this amendment. The Secretary's \ncertification that is involved should not be related to the mobility \ncapability study because that will not make any recommendations for \nchanging airlift requirements. The certification should be related to \nthe Quadrennial Defense Review because if there are changes in the \nnational military strategy that affect airlift requirements, those \nshould be reflected in the QDR.\n  If the Air Force does not buy any more C-17 aircraft after 2007, \nBoeing may have to close down its production line after delivering the \nlast of 180 C-17s. That would be before we have the testing data on the \nC-5 upgrades because that data will not be available until 2008.\n  Given the fact there are some risks those upgrades will not achieve \nthe mission-capable rates the DOD expects and then make it possible for \nus to meet our lift requirements, this is a positive amendment. It \ngives some real flexibility and discretion to the Secretary of Defense.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n\n[[Page S12589]]\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, do I understand the Senators desire a \nrollcall vote?\n  Mr. TALENT. That is correct.\n  Mr. WARNER. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. We will schedule this vote at a time in consultation with \nour respective leaders. There may be some other matters that we have.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri is recognized.\n  Mr. TALENT. Mr. President, I again thank the chairman and ranking \nmember for their hard work. The Senator from Connecticut and I talked \nabout it. We thought this measure, going to the heart of such an \nimportant requirement, was worthy of a rollcall vote. I do appreciate \nthe chairman's patience on that.\n  Mr. WARNER. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. DeMint). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. The Senate is now in session on the bill; is that \ncorrect?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2478\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I want to amend my amendment, No. \n2478, which I introduced earlier, to include another paragraph to \nclarify exactly what we mean. I listened to recommendations that we use \nother language that again further clarifies the intent here.\n  The intent, very simply, is to say if someone violates the rules for \ntransferring classified information knowingly, then we think they \nshould lose that opportunity for access to that.\n  That was the sole purpose. I offer it.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to second-\ndegree my amendment. I send it to the desk for consideration.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Parliamentary inquiry.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Parliamentary inquiry: It is my understanding the Senator \nhas a right to send a second-degree amendment to the desk without \nconsent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator may second-degree his own \namendment without consent.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, my understanding of the parliamentary \nsituation is that the ruling of the Chair is correct, that a Senator \nmay send an amendment in the second degree. But under the underlying \nunanimous consent agreement on which we are operating on this bill, all \ntime has to be yielded back before the second-degree amendment may be \noffered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey asked consent to \nsecond-degree his amendment. The amendment is not currently the pending \nquestion, nor has all time expired on the first-degree amendment, so it \nis appropriate to ask consent at this time.\n  Is there objection?\n  Mr. WARNER. Objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n    amendments Nos. 1316, as Modified; 1329, as Modified; 1382, as \nModified; 1410, 1438, 1444, 1469, as Modified; 1471, 1534, 1543, 1544, \n as Modified; 1550, as Modified; 1559, as Modified; 1560, as Modified; \n  1562, 1567, as Modified; 1885, 2484, 2485, 2486, 2487, 2488, 2489, \n  2490, 2491, 2492, 2493, 2494, 2495, 2496, 2497, 2498, 2499 to 1396; \n         2500, 2501, 2502, 2503, 2504, 2505, and 2506, en bloc\n\n  Mr. WARNER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that time until \n11:30 a.m. tomorrow be equally divided in the usual form, and that at \n11:30 the Senate proceed to a vote in relation to the Dorgan amendment \nNo. 2476, to be followed by a vote in relation to the Talent amendment \nNo. 2477, with no second degrees in order to those amendments prior to \nthe votes; further, that there be 3 minutes equally divided between the \nvotes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. No objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the Senate will soon vote to approve the \nfiscal year 2006 Defense authorization bill. The passage of this \nlegislation is important to all Americans who are now serving in the \nU.S. Armed Forces, but especially to those who are serving in harm's \nway.\n  Our troops in Iraq and Afghanistan require all the support that our \nNation can give them until the day that they can return to their homes. \nOur military prides itself in being the most capable and the best \ntrained fighting force in the entire world. The Constitution places in \nCongress the responsibility to ``raise and support armies'' and to \n``provide and maintain a navy.'' It is therefore of the greatest \nimportance that Congress provide our troops with the equipment that \nthey need for their dangerous missions.\n  The wars that continue in Iraq and Afghanistan are unlike the \nconflicts that the United States has fought in the past two decades. In \nthe first Persian Gulf War or Kosovo, our military depended on high-\ntech aircraft and smart bombs to quickly overwhelm our enemies. Today, \nin Iraq, our awesome airpower is of limited use. The wars in Iraq and \nAfghanistan are, by and large, the wars of the soldier and the marine. \nThese are the wars of the foot soldier, carried out in the hostile \nstreets of foreign cities. These troops do not enjoy the near-\ninvulnerability of stealth aircraft or cruise missiles. Our troops do \nnot see the enemy as a blip on a radar screen, because often the enemy \nis seen eye to eye.\n  With this being the reality of urban warfare, there must be a new \nfocus on providing our ground troops with the equipment that they need \nto fight and survive in the urban combat environment. The Defense \nauthorization bill reported by the Armed Services Committee makes steps \nin this direction. It authorizes $1.4 billion in spending to protect \nour troops serving overseas. This figure includes $500 million to \ndetect and destroy roadside bombs, $344 million for up-armored HMMWVs, \nand $118 million for body armor.\n  But more must be done to provide our troops with the next generation \nof weapons that will help our troops prevail in ground combat. More \nneeds to be done to apply the technology that allows our military to \ndominate the air and the seas to build a new generation of weapons that \nwill allow our troops to dominate the ground. One such technology that \ndeserves investigation is the SPIKE missile system currently being \ndeveloped by the Navy. The SPIKE missile is designed to be a low-cost, \nlightweight, precision-guided rocket that would allow our troops to \naccurately engage enemies at great range. If this technology is \nsuccessful, it could provide our ground troops with the same sort of \nrevolutionary advantage that precision-guided munitions provided to our \nadvanced aircraft a decade ago.\n  There are also emerging opportunities for the use of unmanned aerial \nvehicles to support the warfighter on the ground. While important UAVs \nlike Global Hawk provide intelligence about what is going on in large \nsections of a country, our ground troops often need to know what is \nhappening on the other side of a hill. Smaller UAVs can provide our \ntroops with a decisive advantage in urban environments. Important \nprojects like SWARM, being developed by Augusta Systems in Morgantown, \nare exploring ways to allow small UAVs to work together to seek out our \nenemies on the battlefield, eliminating the chance that our troops \ncould be taken by surprise. The next step is to use small UAVs as ways \nto strike first, before our ground troops come into the range of our \nenemy's weapons. Our military is only beginning to tap the growing \npotential of UAV technology to support our troops on the ground.\n  The Department of Defense is currently engaged in the Quadrennial \nDefense Review, a top-to-bottom study of our military strategy, \nposture, and equipment that will guide this Nation's defense research \nand development and procurement policies for the next 4 years. With \nthis review underway, it is an ideal opportunity to place a new \nemphasis on bringing cutting-edge technology to our troops on the \nground in Iraq and Afghanistan. I urge the Secretary of Defense, the \nChairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and the other Pentagon officials \nwho are carrying out this study to broaden their view of what our \ntroops require.\n  The QDR should propose new technologies to protect our troops from \nthe threats that they face in combat, and it should also accelerate the \ndevelopment of new weapons systems that allow our soldiers to dominate \nthe battlefield in urban environments. The Department of Defense should \nplace these efforts on the top of its priorities: we should not wait \nfor the next war to give our troops the advantage of new, high-tech \nweapons. Instead, the Pentagon and Congress should make every effort to \narm our troops with the next generation of technology, today. For so \nlong as our troops are serving in\n\n[[Page S12596]]\n\nharm's way, we must give them not only the armor and protection, but \nalso the weapons, that they need to ensure that they will come home \nsafely.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, last night the Senate passed an \namendment that I offered to this bill that represents another step \ntoward enhancing and strengthening transition services that are \nprovided to our military personnel and builds upon an amendment that I \noffered to this bill last year. I want to thank the chairman and the \nranking member of the Armed Services Committee for working with me to \naccept this amendment.\n  As the Senate conducts its business today, thousands of our brave men \nand women in uniform are in harm's way in Iraq, Afghanistan, and \nelsewhere around the globe. These men and women serve with distinction \nand honor, and we owe them our heartfelt gratitude.\n  We also owe them our best effort to ensure that they receive the \nbenefits to which their service in our Armed Forces has entitled them. \nI have heard time and again from military personnel and veterans who \nare frustrated with the system by which they apply for benefits or \nappeal claims for benefits. I have long been concerned that tens of \nthousands of our veterans are unaware of Federal health care and other \nbenefits for which they may be eligible, and I have undertaken numerous \nlegislative and oversight efforts to ensure that the Department of \nVeterans Affairs makes outreach to our veterans and their families a \npriority.\n  While we should do more to support our veterans, we must also ensure \nthat the men and women who are currently serving in our Armed Forces \nreceive adequate pay and benefits, as well as services that help them \nto make the transition from active duty to civilian life. I am \nconcerned that we are not doing enough to support our men and women in \nuniform as they prepare to retire or otherwise separate from the \nservice or, in the case of members of our National Guard and Reserve, \nto demobilize from active-duty assignments and return to their civilian \nlives while staying in the military or preparing to separate from the \nmilitary. We must ensure that their service and sacrifice, which is \nmuch lauded during times of conflict, is not forgotten once the battles \nhave ended and our troops have come home.\n  Earlier this year I introduced legislation, the Veterans Enhanced \nTransition Services Act, VETS Act, which would help to ensure that all \nmilitary personnel have access to the same transition services as they \nprepare to leave the military to reenter civilian life, or, in the case \nof members of the National Guard and Reserve, as they prepare to \ndemobilize from active-duty assignments and return to their civilian \nlives and jobs or education while remaining in the military.\n  I have heard from a number of Wisconsinites and members of military \nand veterans service organizations that our men and women in uniform do \nnot all have access to the same transition counseling and medical \nservices as they are demobilizing from service in Iraq, Afghanistan, \nand elsewhere. I have long been concerned about reports of uneven \nprovision of services from base to base and from service to service. \nAll of our men and women in uniform have pledged to serve our country, \nand all of them, at the very least, deserve to have access to the same \nservices in return.\n  I am pleased that the VETS Act is supported by a wide range of groups \nthat are dedicated to serving our men and women in uniform and veterans \nand their families. These groups include: the American Legion; the \nEnlisted Association of the National Guard of the United States; the \nNational Coalition for Homeless Veterans; the Paralyzed Veterans of \nAmerica; the Reserve Officers Association; the Veterans of Foreign \nWars; the Wisconsin Department of Veterans Affairs; the Wisconsin \nNational Guard; the American Legion, Department of Wisconsin; Disabled \nAmerican Veterans, Department of Wisconsin; the Wisconsin Paralyzed \nVeterans of America; the Veterans of Foreign Wars, Department of \nWisconsin; and the Wisconsin State Council, Vietnam Veterans of \nAmerica.\n  I introduced similar legislation during the 108th Congress, and I am \npleased that a provision that I authored which was based on that bill \nwas enacted as part of the fiscal year 2005 Defense authorization bill.\n  In response to concerns I have heard from a number of my \nconstituents, my amendment, in part, directed the Secretaries of \nDefense and Labor to jointly explore ways in which DoD training and \ncertification standards could be coordinated with Government and \nprivate sector training and certification standards for corresponding \ncivilian occupations. The Secretaries of Defense and Labor submitted \ntheir report, ``Study on Coordination of Job Training Standards with \nCertification Standards for Military Occupational Specialties,'' in \nSeptember of this year. It is my hope that this report will serve as a \nuseful tool as the Departments seek to help military personnel who wish \nto pursue civilian employment related to their military specialties to \nmake the transition from the military to comparable civilian jobs.\n  In addition, this amendment required the Government Accountability \nOffice, GAO, to undertake a comprehensive analysis of existing \ntransition services for our military personnel that are administered by \nthe Departments of Defense, Veterans Affairs, and Labor, and to make \nrecommendations to Congress on how these programs can be improved. My \namendment required GAO to focus on two issues: how to achieve the \nuniform provision of appropriate transition services to all military \npersonnel, and the role of post-deployment and predischarge health \nassessments as part of the larger transition program. GAO released its \nstudy ``Military and Veterans' Benefits: Enhanced Services Could \nImprove Transition Assistance for Reserves and National Guard'' in May \n2005, and it plans to release its study on health assessments in the \nnear future.\n  In July of this year, GAO provided testimony on its transition \nservices report to the House Committee on Veterans Affairs Subcommittee \non Economic Opportunity. That hearing could not have been more timely. \nWe owe it to our men and women in uniform to improve transition \nprograms now as we continue to welcome home thousands of military \npersonnel who are serving our country in Iraq, Afghanistan, and \nelsewhere. I commend the Departments of Defense, Veterans Affairs, and \nLabor for the steps they have taken thus far to improve these important \nprograms. We should not miss an opportunity to help the men and women \nwho are currently serving our country, and I am pleased that the \nchairman and the ranking member agreed to accept a number of provisions \nfrom my legislation as an amendment to the fiscal year 2006 Defense \nauthorization bill.\n  Under current law, the Department of Defense, together with the \nDepartments of Veterans Affairs, VA, and Labor, provide preseparation \ncounseling for military personnel who are preparing to leave the Armed \nForces through the Transition Assistance Program/Disabled Transition \nAssistance Program, TAP/DTAP. This counseling provides servicemembers \nwith valuable information about benefits that they have earned through \ntheir service to our country such as education benefits through the GI \nBill and health care and other benefits through the VA. Personnel also \nlearn about programs such as Troops to Teachers and have access to \nemployment assistance for themselves and, where appropriate, their \nspouses.\n  My amendment would ensure that National Guard and Reserve personnel \nwho are on active duty for at least 180 days are able to participate in \nthis important counseling prior to being demobilized. In its recent \nreport on transition services, GAO found that ``[d]uring their rapid \ndemobilization, the Reserve and National Guard members may not receive \nall the information on possible benefits to which they are entitled. \nNotably, certain education benefits and medical coverage require \nservicemembers to apply while they are still on active duty. However, \neven after being briefed, some Reserve and National Guard members were \nnot aware of the timeframes within which the needed to act to secure \ncertain benefits before returning home. In addition, most members of \nthe Reserves and National Guard did not have the opportunity to attend \nan employment workshop during demobilization.''\n\n  In response to these findings, GAO recommended that ``DoD, in \nconjunction with DoL and the VA, determine\n\n[[Page S12597]]\n\nwhat demobilizing Reserve and National Guard members need to make a \nsmooth transition and explore options to enhance their participation in \nTAP.'' GAO also recommended that ``VA take steps to determine the level \nof participation in DTAP to ensure those who may have especially \ncomplex needs are being served.''\n  In addition to ensuring that all discharging and demobilizing \nmilitary personnel are able to participate in TAP/DTAP, we should take \nsteps to improve the uniformity of services provided to personnel by \nensuring that consistent transition briefings occur across the services \nand at all demobilization/discharge locations. In its report, GAO noted \nthat ``[t]he delivery of TAP may vary in terms of the amount of \npersonal attention participants receive, the length of the components, \nand the instructional methods used.'' We should make every effort to \nensure that those who have put themselves in harm's way on our behalf \nhave access to the same transition services no matter their discharge/\ndemobilization location or the branch of the Armed Forces in which they \nserve. I look forward to reviewing the Department's progress on GAO's \nrecommendations in this area.\n  In order to improve the breadth of information provided to Members \nduring TAP/DTAP, my amendment would require preseparation counseling \nprograms to include the provision of information regarding \ncertification and licensing requirements in civilian occupations and \ninformation on identifying military occupations that have civilian \ncounterparts, information concerning veterans small business ownership \nand entrepreneurship programs offered by the Federal Government, \ninformation concerning employment and reemployment rights and veterans \npreference in Federal employment and Federal procurement opportunities, \ninformation concerning housing counseling assistance, and a description \nof the health care and other benefits to which the member may be \nentitled through the Department of Veterans Affairs.\n  In addition to the uneven provision of transition services, I have \nlong been concerned about the immediate and long-term health effects \nthat military deployments have on our men and women in uniform. I \nregret that, too often, the burden of responsibility for proving that a \ncondition is related to military service falls on the personnel \nthemselves. Our men and women in uniform deserve the benefit of the \ndoubt, and should not have to fight the Department of Defense or the VA \nfor benefits that they have earned through their service to our Nation.\n  Since coming to the Senate in 1993, I have worked to focus attention \non the health effects that are being experienced by military personnel \nwho served in the Persian Gulf war. More than 10 years after the end of \nthe gulf war, we still don't know why so many veterans of that conflict \nare experiencing medical problems that have become known as gulf war \nillness. Military personnel who are currently deployed to the Persian \nGulf region face many of the same conditions that existed in the early \n1990s. I have repeatedly pressed the Departments of Defense and \nVeterans Affairs to work to unlock the mystery of this illness and to \nstudy the role that exposure to depleted uranium may play in this \ncondition. We owe it to these personnel to find these answers, and to \nensure that those who are currently serving in the Persian Gulf region \nare adequately protected from the many possible causes of gulf war \nillness.\n  Part of the process of protecting the health of our men and women in \nuniform is to ensure that the Department of Defense carries out its \nresponsibility to provide post-deployment physicals for military \npersonnel. I am deeply concerned about stories of personnel who are \nexperiencing long delays as they wait for their post-deployment \nphysicals and who end up choosing not to have these important physicals \nin order to get home to their families that much sooner. I am equally \nconcerned about reports that some personnel who did not receive such a \nphysical--either by their own choice or because such a physical was not \navailable--are now having trouble as they apply for benefits for a \nservice-connected condition.\n  I firmly believe, as do the military and veterans groups that support \nmy bill, that our men and women in uniform are entitled to a prompt, \nhigh quality physical examination as part of the demobilization \nprocess. These individuals have voluntarily put themselves into harm's \nway for our benefit. We should ensure that the Department of Defense \nmakes every effort to determine whether they have experienced, or could \nexperience, any health effects as a result of their service. Thus I am \npleased that the fiscal year 2005 defense authorization bill included a \nprovision to tighten the requirement for a predischarge/post-\ndemobilization health assessment.\n  It is vitally important that these assessments include a mental \nhealth component. Our men and women in uniform serve in difficult \ncircumstances far from home, and too many of them witness or experience \nviolence and horrific situations that most of us cannot even begin to \nimagine. I have heard concerns that these brave men and women, many of \nwhom are just out of high school or college when they sign up, may \nsuffer long-term physical and mental fallout from their experiences and \nmay feel reluctant to seek counseling or other assistance to deal with \ntheir experiences.\n  Some Wisconsinites have told me that they are concerned that the \nmultiple deployments of our National Guard and Reserve could lead to \nchronic post-traumatic stress disorder, PTSD, which could have its \nroots in an experience from a previous deployment and which could come \nto the surface by a triggering event that is experienced on a current \ndeployment. The same is true for full-time military personnel who have \nserved in a variety of places over their careers. I am pleased that the \nSenate has already accepted an amendment offered by the Senator from \nLouisiana, Ms. Landrieu, that will require that personnel receive \nmental health screenings prior to deployment into a combat zone, not \nlater than 30 days after return from such a deployment, and not later \nthan 120 days after return from such a deployment.\n  We can and should do more to ensure that the mental health of our men \nand women in uniform is a top priority, and that the stigma that is too \noften attached to seeking assistance is ended. One step in this process \nis to ensure that personnel who have symptoms of PTSD and related \nillnesses have access to appropriate clinical services, through DoD, \nthe VA, or a private sector health care provider. To that end, my \namendment would require that the health care professionals who are \nassessing demobilizing military personnel provide all personnel who may \nneed followup care for a physical or psychological condition with \ninformation on appropriate resources through DoD or the VA and in the \nprivate sector that these personnel may use to access additional \nfollowup care if they so choose.\n  I commend the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs for \nissuing in March 2005 a memorandum to the Assistant Secretaries for the \nArmy, Navy, and Air Force directing them to extend the Pentagon's \ncurrent post-deployment health assessment process to include a \nreassessment of ``global health with a specific emphasis on mental \nhealth'' to occur 3 to 6 months post-deployment. At a hearing of the \nSenate Armed Services Committee's Personnel Subcommittee earlier this \nyear, the Assistant Secretary stated that the services were in the \nprocess of implementing a program that would include a ``screening \nprocedure with a questionnaire and a face-to-face interaction at about \nthree months'' post-deployment. He also noted that the idea for this \nprogram came from ``front line people'' and that he ``asked them . . . \n`do you think we should make it mandatory?' and the answer was: yes.'' \nThis sentiment makes it even more important that the initial post-\ndeployment mental health assessment be strengthened and that it be \nmandatory as well so that health care professionals have a benchmark \nagainst which to measure the results of the followup screening process. \nI am pleased that the Pentagon has undertaken this effort, and I \nbelieve that the provisions in Senator Landrieu's amendment and in my \namendment will further enhance this process and help to ensure that we \nare properly caring for the mental health of our men and women in \nuniform.\n  In addition, in order to ensure that all military personnel who are \neligible\n\n[[Page S12598]]\n\nfor medical benefits from the VA learn about and receive these \nbenefits, my amendment would require that, as part of the \ndemobilization process, assistance be provided to eligible members to \nenroll in the VA health care system.\n  Finally, my amendment will require the Secretary of Defense, in \nconsultation with the Secretaries of Labor and Veterans Affairs, to \nreport to Congress on the actions taken by those Departments to ensure \nthat the Transition Assistance Program is functioning effectively to \nprovide members with timely and comprehensive transition assistance. As \npart of the report, the Secretary will be required to include a review \nof transition assistance that has been/is being provided to members \ndeployed as part of Operation Iraqi Freedom, Operation Enduring \nFreedom, in support of other contingency operations, and members of the \nNational Guard who were activated in support of relief efforts \nfollowing Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. I look forward to reviewing this \nreport.\n  Again, I thank the chairman and the ranking member for their \nassistance on this important issue.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise to bring my colleagues' \nattention to a provision in sections 231-235 in the Defense \nauthorization bill titled ``High Performance Defense Manufacturing \nTechnology Research and Development.''\n  I introduced this legislation with my colleague Senator Collins to \naddress erosion in our defense manufacturing base that threatens our \nnational security and ultimately our economy overall. We are running \nmajor deficits with China in defense critical manufacturing areas, such \nas computer hardware--$25 billion--and electronics machinery and \nparts--$23 billion--as U.S. production drifts offshore. We are \ntransferring major portions of our circuit board, semiconductor, \nmachine tool, and weapon system metal casting manufacturing to China \nand other nations because of lower wage and lower production costs. \nWithout productivity breakthroughs, the U.S. defense manufacturing base \nwill continue to erode.\n  In the high-tech sector, manufacturing needs and research and \ndevelopment needs are highly correlated. As a result, research and \ndevelopment, R, centers are often located near manufacturing \nfacilities. If we continue to lose the manufacturing base, we may well \nlose over time critical research and development capabilities and \ndamage our ability to innovate. And if we hurt both of those we may \nalso lose our military technical leadership. This ultimately puts our \nwarfighters in harms way. Clearly, the Department of Defense (DOD) has \na huge stake in rebuilding the defense manufacturing base.\n  The DOD needs advanced manufacturing technologies and processes to \nachieve productivity breakthroughs to drive down costs in mature \ndefense supply sectors. But it also needs advanced manufacturing \ntechniques to spark the next generation of advances in defense related \ntechnologies; technologies that our warfighters deserve. This \nlegislation proposes four basic things.\n  One, it calls, in section 231, for a R effort focused on developing \nnew advanced manufacturing technology and information technology, IT, \noperating models. The Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, \nTechnology, and Logistics, acting through the Director of Defense \nResearch and Engineering and with other appropriate defense programs \nand agencies such as the Manufacturing Technology Program, the Defense \nAdvanced Research Projects Agency, DARPA, and other defense research \nactivities, is to undertake research and development to develop \ncritical manufacturing productivity breakthrough approaches and the \ntechnologies and systems to support them--section 231(b)(1). These \ncould include such breakthrough opportunity areas as distributed and \ndesktop manufacturing, quality inspection that is built into the \nproduction process, small lot manufacturing that is as cost-efficient \nas mass production, use of revolutionary materials and methods of \nfabrication, and the ability to manufacture devices and machines at the \nnanoscale. Productivity breakthroughs will ultimately help reduce \nweapon systems costs and support surge capacity.\n  The legislation also directs the Under Secretary of the Defense for \nAcquisition, Technology, and Logistics to undertake R to develop a \nnew model, an extended production enterprise--section 231(b)(2)--using \nIT and new business models, that integrates services, design, and \nmanufacturing stages, to achieve major new efficiencies and cost \nsavings. Included as part of this research effort, the development of \nthe interoperable software for the extended production enterprise, and \nthe corresponding interoperability standards behind it should also be a \nfocus working with the defense industries to develop the organizational \nmodel required.\n  Two, the legislation directs DOD's Manufacturing Technology Program, \nManTech, to undertake technology transition including prototyping and \ntest beds--section 232(a) and (b)--for new manufacturing processes and \ntechnologies that emerge from this R effort. Collaboration \nestablished through a memorandum of agreement--section 232(a)(2)--\nbetween DDRE, ManTech, and other appropriate DOD organizations is \nneeded to ensure an efficient transition of manufacturing technologies \nfrom the research stage described above to ManTech, which will \nundertake the development of prototypes and testbeds--section 232(b). \nManTech currently is funded at $237 million for fiscal year 2005, all \nof which is directly tied to the near term needs of the Services. The \nJoint Defense Manufacturing Technology Panel, which has coordination \nresponsibility for manufacturing research in DOD, does not have funding \nindependent of the Services to initiate new efforts focusing on longer \nterm, higher risk, higher payoff technologies and processes. Thus, the \nprograms currently underway at ManTech are short-term focused projects \naddressing immediate needs. ManTech needs to balance the current \nshorter term portfolio by including a focus on longer term, higher risk \nmanufacturing processes and technology development that are industry \ngame changers and yield big efficiencies and cost savings to DOD.\n  Additionally, the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, \nTechnology, and Logistics should coordinate activities within ManTech--\nsection 232(b)(2)--with activities under the Small Business Innovation \nResearch Program, SBIR, and the Small Business Technology Transfer \nProgram, STTR. Executive Order 13329, entitled ``Encouraging Innovation \nin Manufacturing,'' requires all SBIR/STTR Programs to give priority to \nresearch programs that help to advance innovation in manufacturing. \nManTech could benefit significantly from this work currently underway.\n  Working with industry, ManTech should develop a new program to \nutilize these new manufacturing improvements and processes in the \ndefense manufacturing base--section 232(c). A key way for ManTech to \nachieve this would be by collaboratively developing and issuing a new \nperformance threshold--a new benchmark system--to ensure ongoing \nquality and continuous focus on improved and innovative manufacturing \nprocedures developed through the R and prototyping described above. \nResults from the R on manufacturing technologies and processes and on \nthe extended production enterprise would be incorporated into the new \nperformance threshold which could become a new DOD acquisition \nstandard--section 232(c)--for procurement. Similar to the quality \nfocused initiative, 6 Sigma, a program aimed to improve process \nreproducibility and reliability by eliminating defects and process \noutput variation, this new standard would be disseminated into industry \nwhere similar efficiencies and productivity gains could be realized. In \norder to encourage full adoption of the new manufacturing improvements \nand processes, including a new performance standard, incentives for \ncontractors in the defense manufacturing base to incorporate and \nutilize the manufacturing enhancements should subsequently be developed \nby ManTech--section 232(d)(4).\n  Third, it establishes mechanisms to efficiently disseminate \ntechnological developments to the broader defense manufacturing base--\nsection 232(d)--including outreach through the Department of Commerce's \nManufacturing Partnership program, section 232(d)(2), an established \nprogram proven to be effective in assisting small and mid-sized\n\n[[Page S12599]]\n\nAmerican manufacturers, including numerous defense manufacturers and \nsuppliers. It has traditionally focused on providing technical \nassistance in manufacturing operational efficiency and quality and is \nnow evaluating additional roles in providing tools and assistance to \npromote innovation. DOD could use this existing mechanism to help it \nreach its defense manufacturing base with these advances.\n  The Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and \nLogistics should also consider outreach through public-private \npartnerships--section 232(d)(1). Because the prototyping and \nengineering development stages are extremely expensive, collaborative \nfacilities and testbeds--section 232(b)(1)--should be established to \nseverely reduce the risk, cost, and time of development for new \ntechnologies important for national defense. These centers should also \neducate and train researchers and employees to help assure smooth \nproduction process implementation. Such shared facilities, cost shared \nwith both large and small participating firms that are world-class \ncenters for production development, could potentially solve a key DOD \nproblem in technology transition.\n  Specifically, in implementing the prototype and testbed provisions, \nsection 232(b), the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, \nTechnology, and Logistics can consider establishing one or more pilot \nmanufacturing centers in manufacturing fields important to the \nproduction of advanced defense technologies. These centers can be \nshared production facilities of the Federal Government and the private \nsector that focus on production development including the invention \nprototyping and engineering development stages. For example, the Under \nSecretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics could \npermit the participation of State and local governments and could carry \nout a competition to determine the optimal private sector participants \nin any manufacturing center.\n  Fourth, the legislation--section 233--directs the Under Secretary of \nDefense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics to identify and \ndevelop a strategy working with industry in a technology area \nbeneficial to the military where a technology development roadmap and \nstrategy is needed to ensure the manufacturing technologies and \nprocesses are available to support this breakthrough technology. \nConsideration should be given to next generation technologies such as \nadvanced micromanufacturing and nanomanufacturing, other emerging \nprocess technologies, model based enterprise, intelligent systems, \nenterprise integration and knowledge applications. A task force should \nbe established, in cooperation with the private sector, to map a cross-\nservice strategy for fabrication processes and technologies needed to \nsupport the roadmaps identified.\n  Importantly, this legislation not only would fund the needed research \nin manufacturing technologies and processes but provides the structure \nto bring the technology to utilization, to avoid the problem of leaving \nvaluable technology ``on the shelf.'' Additionally, it initiates the \ndevelopment of a long-term vision for the Department around \nmanufacturing technologies and processes needed for our military.\n  I would like to point out that this legislation is based on the \nmanufacturing recommendations from the National Innovation Initiative \nreport released by the Council on Competitiveness in December, a report \nsupported by prominent business, academic, and government leaders.\n  Additionally, I received letters from two key manufacturing \norganizations supporting this proposal, the Association for \nManufacturing Technology, AMT, and National Coalition for Advanced \nManufacturing, NACFAM, which stress the critical importance of passing \nthis legislation.\n  And lastly, I would like to reiterate that this legislation is in \nline with the Executive order issued by President Bush to encourage \ninnovation in manufacturing in Federal agencies, including through SBIR \nand STTR to assist the private sector, especially small businesses in \nmanufacturing innovation efforts.\n  This legislation will help move the U.S. defense manufacturing base \nahead of global competition as well as provide support for new \ntechnologies that we are at risk of losing. The aim of this legislation \nis a first step in an overall effort needed to preserve our military \nexcellence and national security.\n  Mr. McCain. Mr. President, I want to speak briefly in favor of a \nprovision in the Department of Defense authorization bill that would \nrequire the Department to study the feasibility of procuring satellite \ncapacity through multiyear contracts. I worked with Chairman Warner and \nRanking Member Levin to address this issue in the underlying bill, and \nwhile I am pleased that the committee's leadership has accepted the \nprovision, I am disappointed that Congress must once again request the \nDepartment to study this issue.\n  Last year, Congress included a provision in the Department of Defense \nauthorization bill to require the Department to scrutinize its \ncommercial satellite capacity procurement practices and report to \nCongress its findings and recommendations. That study was completed, \nalbeit after the statutory deadline and too late for many of the \nrecommendations to be implemented in this year's authorization bill. \nThe study also failed to specifically review the issue of multiyear \ncontracting. Therefore, Congress will be more explicit this year in its \nrequest and will once again await the Department's findings.\n  The study on multiyear contracting is necessary because many in the \nsatellite industry and the Government question whether the Department \nof Defense's general policy of procuring leased satellite capacity on a \nyear-to-year basis is resulting in the best price for the Government \nand the taxpayers. In contrast to the Government, other entities \npurchasing leased satellite capacity for communications services, such \nas CNN and FOX, negotiate multiyear contracts and are receiving lower \nprices for the same services. The Federal Government, with the \nDepartment of Defense as the main buyer, is the world's largest \nconsumer of leased satellite capacity and, as such, the Government \nshould be able to negotiate the lowest price and the most flexible \nterms for leased satellite capacity.\n  Last year, the Government Accountability Office studied the \nDepartment's procurement process for leased satellite capacity and \nfound that the Department's procedures were uncoordinated, frustrating \nfor military commanders, and overly expensive to U.S. taxpayers. Using \nthe results of the GAO study, along with the Department's study \ncompleted this year and the findings on the multiyear contract issue, I \nhope Congress will finally have the necessary information to consider \nwholesale satellite procurement reforms during next year's \nauthorization process.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, when the Senate was considering S. 1042, \nthe National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 2006, earlier \nthis year, there was rather extensive debate over a $4 million funding \nitem called the Robust Nuclear Earth Penetrator, RNEP. This item was a \nfeasibility study to be conducted by the Department of Energy to \ndetermine whether an existing nuclear weapon could be modified so that \nit could destroy hardened and deeply buried targets.\n  Since the time of our earlier debate on this matter, our colleagues \non the Appropriations Committee have completed work on the conference \nreport for Energy and Water appropriations. The conferees have reached \nagreement on appropriations for the Department of Energy and have \nagreed to eliminate funding for continued research on the Robust \nNuclear Earth Penetrator at the request of the National Nuclear \nSecurity Administration.\n  In light of this outcome and the elimination of funding, an amendment \nto S. 1042 has been cleared on both sides which will remove the \nauthorization for the Department of Energy to continue the feasibility \nstudy.\n  I note for my colleagues, however, that the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee received a letter from Gen. James Cartwright, the Commander \nof U.S. Strategic Command, dated November 1,2005, which emphasizes the \nneed for continued work on earth penetrating weapons which can be \neither nuclear or conventional. General Cartwright states his support \nfor research to validate computer models of the impact physics of \npenetrating warheads into hard surface geologies. What the general is \nessentially saying is: Just\n\n[[Page S12600]]\n\nbecause the funds have gone away doesn't mean that the problem has gone \naway.\n  I think the general's statement is very reasonable. I would hope that \nwith the tremendous investment that this Congress directs into defense \nresearch and development, at some point and in some fashion, we could \nwork together to address the military need the general has identified.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, the decisions made by the Base Realignment \nand Closure Commission are final. All around the country communities \nare now forced to deal with the difficult reality of how to approach \nthe redevelopment and transfer of a local military facility that is \nbeing closed. In my State of Wisconsin, the city of Milwaukee is faced \nwith the difficult prospect of what to do after the 440th Airlift Wing \nleaves Mitchell Field. The community, the State, and our congressional \ndelegation fought long and hard to protect the proud men and women of \nthe 440th, but we were not able to convince the Commission that closing \nthe 440th would be a mistake.\n  Senator Snowe offered an amendment that I believe will make the \nprocess of transferring and redeveloping base properties easier and \nfaster. Senator Snowe proposed to allow the property to go directly to \na local redevelopment agent and avoid the current complicated and time \nconsuming process. A faster process means a quicker return to economic \nvitality, and I support that.\n  Senator Snowe also proposed that the local community not have to pay \nfor the land the Federal Government is giving up. It is only fitting \nthat in these communities that have given so much to our military men \nand women that we give something back. Pulling up stakes and removing \nan important economic engine is bad enough, but to then expect the \nredevelopers to pay for the land as well just adds insult to injury. It \nis unfortunate that this amendment that will make the transition \nprocess easier for Milwaukee and communities around the country was not \naccepted.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, U.S. competitiveness in the high-tech \nsector of semiconductors, an important enabler in today's world \nproviding the basis for nearly all electronic products and systems used \nin both consumer and military applications, is at risk. As we all are \naware, global competition is on the rise, U.S. basic research \ninvestment is on the decline, and there is serious concern regarding \nthe U.S. science and technology talent base. These issues have long \nbeen a concern of mine not only for the health of our economy but also \nfor maintaining and preserving our national security. I released a \nwhitepaper back in June of 2003 titled ``National Security Aspects of \nthe Global Migration of the U.S. Semiconductor Industry'' that \ndiscusses and highlights the importance of addressing the accelerating \nshift in manufacturing overseas. Historically, shifts in manufacturing \nresult over time in migration of research and development which, \nunfortunately, means we will be essentially offshoring our innovation \ncapacity itself. In the March 21, 2005, edition of Business Week, the \ncover story article titled ``Outsourcing Innovation'' exactly addresses \nthis issue. The article discusses how Western corporations began \noffshoring manufacturing in the 1980s and 1990s to increase efficiency \nand to focus on research and development and proceeds to say how ``that \npledge has now passed.'' Companies such as Dell, Motorola, and Phillips \nare buying designs of digital devices from abroad, slightly altering \nthe device, and then branding the product with their name.\n  In addition, there is another aspect of the semiconductor industry \nthat cannot be overlooked, the limitation of Moore's Law. There will \nsoon be physical barriers blocking the continued diminution of \ntransistor size, and the financial barriers will become even more \nextraordinary. This situation would inevitably lead to the slowing or \nstopping of chip manufacturer's progress unless we bring nanotechnology \nto fruition in the semiconductor world.\n  I think it is pretty clear that it is more important than ever to \ncreate an environment in the United States which promotes research and \ndevelopment and fosters innovation. The Defense Science Board Task \nForce released to the Congress in April 2005 the final report titled \n``High Performance Microchip Supply'' which was in part a response to \nthe issues I raised in my 2003 report. The report outlines a series of \nrecommendations to help ensure the long-term health of the U.S. \nmicrochip design, development, and manufacturing industries. The report \nemphasizes the importance of maintaining technical superiority in the \nsemiconductor industry in order to lead in the application of \nelectronics to support the warfighter. This lead is critical to the \nfoundation of the next generation of U.S. security strategy network \ncentric warfare superiority. The report specifically stresses the need \nfor trusted and assured suppliers of integrated circuit components and \nemphasizes that ``trust cannot be added to integrated circuits after \nfabrication; electrical testing and reverse engineering cannot be \nrelied upon to detect undesired alterations in military integrated \ncircuits.'' Beyond highlighting the threat of IC device compromise, the \nreport also highlights the risk associated with reliance on foreign \nsuppliers to access high-performance microelectronics in time of war \nwhen quick response or surge capacity is needed and additionally, the \nreport stresses the longer term risk of losing leading edge R in a \ntechnology area central to our economy. This latter point was a \nparticular emphasis of my 2003 report referenced previously and this \nnew report agrees.\n  The DSB report calls for the Department of Defense's senior officials \nto advocate that a strongly competitive U.S. semiconductor base is not \nonly a Department of Defense goal but should also be a national \npriority. Because DSB finds that research and development is closely \ncoupled with a solid manufacturing base, and the U.S. semiconductor \nmanufacturing base is going abroad, the United States will soon start \nto lose its R skill base which is essential for not only U.S. defense \nsystems but general economic competitiveness.\n  Given the low production volume of Department of Defense \nmicroelectronics parts, the report also recommends that the Department \nof Defense, working with the semiconductor industry and fabrication \nequipment suppliers, develops a cost-effective technology for the \ndesign and fabrication of low production volume, leading edge \ntechnology given the low volume demands of the Department of Defense.\n  It states that an overall vision is needed that develops an approach \nto meet Department of Defense needs before a supply source becomes an \nemergency. This requires funding research that will sustain our \ntechnical superiority; the trusted foundry agreements assist in solving \nthe immediate problems, not the longer term. Included in the overall \nvision, a plan is needed specifically for a Department of Defense \nacquisition strategy that encompasses both short- and long-term \ntechnology, acquisition and manufacturing capabilities to assure an \nongoing supply of trusted microelectronic components.\n  Although U.S. leadership in chip design does not in and of itself \nassure the trustworthiness of the microelectronic parts, it does put \nthe Department of Defense in a superior position to potential \nadversaries whose systems rely on U.S. based suppliers. The Department \nof Defense needs to sustain this U.S. leadership by investing in \nresearch programs and ensuring a domestic supply of scientists and \nengineers who are skilled in this area. New programmable chip \ntechnology, which has intricate designs and therefore is more difficult \nto validate, is needed and efforts to develop next generation \ntechnologies in this area should be pursued.\n  This DSB report clearly stresses the need for immediate action and \nlists key recommendations to help the Department of Defense develop not \nonly a short-term plan to address the immediate needs but, importantly, \na longer term vision as well. By the end of 2005, there will be 59 300 \nmm fabrication plants worldwide with only 16 of these located in the \nUnited States. The United States cannot wait much longer; we need to \naddress the global competitiveness issue today.\n  The Department of Defense has been telling us for a year or more to \nwait for the Defense Science Board report. It has now finally arrived \nand an actual Department of Defense ``action plan'' to implement these \nrecommendations\n\n[[Page S12601]]\n\nis needed. This is why I along with Senator Cornyn proposed an \namendment, No. 2446, to the Defense Authorization Act, S. 1042, asking \nthe Department of Defense to develop this action plan. I am pleased to \nsee this amendment has been adopted unanimously by the Senate.\n  The United States historically has lost manufacturing sectors as \nproduct cycles matured but our innovation system always filled that \nvoid by creating new sectors, opportunities, jobs and higher standards \nof living. I want to see that trend continue, and this amendment asks \nthe Department of Defense to form a sound plan in this technology area.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/11/09/senate-section/article/S12601-1", "month": "11", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12601]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. WARNER.

Madam President, we have come from a Commerce-Energy \nCommittee joint hearing with the CEOs of the major energy companies. \nThey came to talk to us about the price of energy.\n  I made the point this morning--I know the Presiding Officer was also \nthere and made the points she wished to make--as we go into the winter \nseason, those who are trying to figure out how they afford home heating \nfuel, natural gas, propane, and so on, take a look at the newspapers \nand see the highest profits in history for the oil companies. They are \nthe ones, the consumers, who will have to bear the pain. Heat your home \nin the winter or try to figure out how you are going to pay the fuel \nbill in the spring if you are a farmer or a rancher. These prices are \ngoing to eat away all the profit that existed, and then some, with \nrespect to family farmers in my State. That is according to estimates \nthat come from the farm organization and from economists who have \nlooked at it.\n  The question for family farmers who are being ripped by these energy \nprices or people who drive to the gas pumps or people who are figuring \nout how to heat their homes is, Is anybody going to do anything about \nit? You have all the gain on this side and all the pain on this side. \nAll the gain with the big energy companies, the big oil companies, the \nmajor integrated oil companies, bigger, stronger, with more raw muscle \npower in the marketplace because of block buster mergers, and all the \npain on the other side, the consumers.\n  Especially in a State that is an agricultural State where we rely on \nfamily farmers as a significant part of our economic base, knowing that \nthose family farmers operate on a thin margin, knowing that they are \ntrying to figure out how to pay energy costs going into spring planting \nand fertilizer costs and so on, knowing that it is going to wipe away \nany net profit they would have, any opportunity for a net profit next \nyear, they are saying to this Congress: Talk is cheap. What are you \ngoing to do? Will Congress take some action? Will Congress take action \nto ease the pain and provide some fairness and restore fairness? I hope \nso.\n  I won't go into great detail about the action I think we should take. \nI have done that many times on the floor with respect to a Windfall \nProfits Rebate Act, to rebate to consumers a portion of these profits.\n  My hope is that in the shadow of the hearings we held today, Congress \nwill be ready to take some action with respect to energy price issues.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/11/09/senate-section/article/S12601-3", "month": "11", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12601-S12602]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          FIRING OF DAVID GUNN\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I have received a press statement, \nissued moments ago, from the Amtrak National Rail Passenger Corporation \nboard of directors. Four members on the board of directors represent \nmembership appointed by the President. Two of them are recess \nappointments not given the stamp of approval by the Senate. The four \nmembers of the board of directors at Amtrak this morning decided to \nfire David Gunn, president of Amtrak.\n  David Gunn is not anybody's crony. He happens to be an appointment \nthat is smart, tough, with experience in the area. He has run Amtrak \nlike a true champion. He ran afoul of the White House when the White \nHouse decided they wanted to shut down Amtrak, shut down long-distance \ntrains and effectively get rid of Amtrak.\n  David Gunn was the president of Amtrak. He and others fought to \nmaintain rail passenger service and fought to persuade this Congress to \nfund Amtrak. The administration recommended zero funding for Amtrak. \nThe Congress didn't agree. So the Congress funded Amtrak in a manner \nthat would allow it to continue to be a national rail passenger system. \nApparently, David Gunn doesn't measure up to the White House, and so \nthey got the board of directors this morning to fire him. Incidentally, \ntwo of the recess appointments on the board of directors, one from New \nJersey, one from Florida, will have some kind of rail passenger service \nno matter what happens to Amtrak. All those folks who live on the east \ncoast, from Boston to Florida, they probably are always going to have a \ntrain running down that little strip on the eastern seaboard. I can \nunderstand these two members of the board, neither of whom were \nconfirmed by the Senate, both of whom were given recess appointments by \nthe President and cannot continue beyond this Congress, I can \nunderstand if the President or somebody in the White House said: Let's \nget rid of this David Gunn. They say: That's all right because even if \nwe get rid of Amtrak, we will have rail passenger service on the east \ncoast.\n  I wish to say what a horrible mistake it was for the board of \ndirectors of Amtrak to do this. I understand where it came from. It \ncame from the White House. It came from the Secretary of \nTransportation. I understand meetings were held in recent days, and the \ndecision was made. That decision was carried out by the President's \nboard of directors.\n  I am saying this: A national rail passenger system, Amtrak, is \nbeneficial to this country. In my State, 100,000 people used Amtrak \nlast year. Many of those people don't have alternative transportation \nopportunities. Yet when Amtrak, the Empire Builder, in this case, runs \nfrom Chicago to Seattle, 100,000 North Dakotans have used it. It is an \nimportant part of our Nation's transportation system. But there is a \ndisagreement about Amtrak. The President wants to shut it down. He \ndoesn't want it. That is why he proposed no funding for it. The \nCongress, the majority from his own party, said: No, we want to fund \nit. We believe Amtrak advances this country's transportation system. We \nbelieve it is worthy, something we should do.\n  The president of Amtrak, David Gunn, is a first-rate executive. He \nhas experience. He has done a great job. I say that as a member of the \ncommittee that authorizes Amtrak, so I have watched this enterprise. I \nhave spent time with Mr. Gunn. I have spent time with Amtrak officials. \nI know what is happening there. This guy is nobody's crony. As a \nresult, he gets fired.\n  The ``you are doing a great job, Brownie stuff,'' I am sick of that. \nI would like to see people who are qualified to run things running \nthings in this Government. They had one running Amtrak. Today he gets \nfired because somebody got their nose out of joint and decided, \napparently, the Congress won't allow us to shut down Amtrak so we will \nfire the president of Amtrak.\n  It is a big mistake for the country. I don't know how others in \nCongress will react, but for me, this is a setback and a setback for \nthose who care about rail passenger service. It was a travesty to treat \nDavid Gunn, an executive who came out of retirement to run Amtrak and \nwho did a first-rate job, this way. Shame on those who made that \ndecision. This is all about politics. It has nothing to do with \nperformance. I thought, especially in the wake of what happened with \nHurricane Katrina, maybe we would get back to performance and decide \nthat when people know how to do things and organize well, they are \nappreciated. That is not the case with respect to the decision by the \nboard of directors at Amtrak this morning.\n  Those of us who feel that way probably won't have a chance to \noverturn this because the board of directors made the decision coming \nfrom the\n\n[[Page S12602]]\n\nSecretary of Transportation, coming from the White House, I guess. But \nI still think it is a setback for the country. I hope others know it as \nwell.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/11/09/senate-section/article/S12602-1", "month": "11", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12602]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            NATALEE HOLLOWAY\n\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss an issue that has \ntroubled me for many months, and that is the disappearance of an \nAlabama teenager, Natalee Holloway, from the island of Aruba. Most \npeople have heard about this. It has been in the news for months.\n  More than 5 months ago, on the early morning of May 30, Natalee \nHolloway disappeared from the island of Aruba. Since the start of the \ninvestigation into Natalee's disappearance, I, along with others, have \nbeen deeply troubled by the process that has taken place in Aruba. From \nthe outset, there has been miscommunication and misinformation from the \nAruban Government. The investigation has been plagued by \ninconsistencies and conflicting information, calling the integrity of \nthe investigation itself into question. Since Natalee's disappearance, \na number of suspects have been arrested, detained, and released without \nthe benefit of any substantive information regarding her disappearance.\n  I have made no secret of my concern regarding the handling of this \ncase and the careless and inappropriate manner in which it appears the \nevidence has been handled. Nevertheless, I continue to believe that \nwithout the will of Natalee Holloway's mother, Beth Twitty, Natalee's \ndisappearance would not have received the level of scrutiny in Aruba \nand around the world we have witnessed.\n  It is disturbing that so many months have passed with no clear \nanswers regarding the circumstances surrounding Natalee's \ndisappearance. To that end, I joined Alabama GOV Bob Riley and others \nyesterday to call for a boycott of Aruba. Today, I call upon my \ncolleagues to join me in that call.\n  I understand this is a drastic measure, but I believe that we as \nAmericans, along with others around the world, should carefully weigh \nour travel options until the Government of Aruba exhibits a good-faith \neffort to solve this case.\n  For the safety, security, and well-being of our citizens, I do not \nbelieve we can trust that we will be protected while in Aruba. Quite \nfrankly, if this can happen to Natalee Holloway, a teenager from my \nhome State of Alabama, it could happen to any of us. That is why I \nbelieve a boycott is the answer. I hope the American people, when they \nthink of traveling to the Caribbean this winter, will look at other \noptions.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/11/09/senate-section/article/S12602-2", "month": "11", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12602]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                     Staff Sergeant Jason a. Fegler\n\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I rise to express my sympathy over the loss \nof U.S. Army SSG Jason A. Fegler. Staff Sergeant Fegler died November 4 \nin Baghdad, Iraq. He was 24 years old.\n  Staff Sergeant Fegler grew up in rural Banner County, NE, and \ngraduated from Banner County High School in 1999. He served more than 4 \nyears in the U.S. Marine Corps before recently transferring to the U.S. \nArmy. He had hopes of joining the Army's Special Forces. Staff Sergeant \nFegler was a member of Company C, 1st Battalion, 502nd Infantry \nRegiment, 101st Airborne Division, Fort Campbell, KY. Staff Sergeant \nFegler will be remembered as a loyal soldier who had a strong sense of \nduty, honor, and love of country. Thousands of brave Americans like \nStaff Sergeant Jason Fegler are currently serving in Iraq.\n  Staff Sergeant Fegler is survived by his wife, Shianne, who is in the \nU.S. Navy, and their son, Aiden, 2, of Virginia Beach, VA. He is also \nsurvived by his mother and stepfather, Rita and Eugene Snyder of \nHarrisburg, NE; and father, Jim Fegler of Sierra Vista, AZ.

Captain Cahill died of wounds suffered on \nNovember 6, while on patrol in Ad Dawr, Iraq. He was 34 years old.\n  Captain Cahill graduated in 1989 from Papillion-La Vista High School \nin Nebraska. Captain Cahill graduated magna cum laude in 1999 from the \nUniversity of Nebraska-Omaha, where he was a member of the ROTC \nprogram. He was a 15-year military veteran and in the midst of his \nfourth tour of combat duty, having served one tour in Iraq and two \ntours in Afghanistan. In 1998, he was awarded the Soldier's Medal for \nselfless action in a noncombat situation. A live grenade accidentally \nlanded next to Captain Cahill's men during training at Fort A.P. Hill, \nVA. Captain Cahill grabbed the grenade and hurled it out of harm's way, \nsaving the lives of his fellow soldiers. Captain Cahill was a member of \nCompany B, 1st Battalion, 15th Infantry Regiment, 3rd Infantry \nDivision, Fort Benning, GA.

Mr. President, on November 1, the Committee on Foreign \nRelations conducted a business meeting to consider several matters.\n  The motion to report the nomination of Roland Arnall to be U.S. \nAmbassador to the Netherlands failed on a 9-to-9 tie. The chairman then \nruled that the nomination was ordered reported by an 8-to-2 vote, which \nreflected the vote of those physically present.\n  With all respect to my friend and chairman, Senator Lugar, I disagree \nwith his ruling, which negated the proxy votes cast by me and several \nof my colleagues; I believe it to be inconsistent with the rules of the \nCommittee on Foreign Relations. So that the record of the proceedings \nat the meeting will be available to all members, I ask unanimous \nconsent that the relevant portion of the transcript of that meeting be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  Business Meeting of the Committee on Foreign Relations, U.S. Senate \n                            November 1, 2005\n\n       The committee met, pursuant to notice, at 2:32 p.m. in Room \n     S-116, The Capitol, Hon.

First of all, on the point about filing \n     lawsuits to delay the nomination, there are a number of \n     individual suits that have been brought regarding some of \n     these matters. I don't premise the position I'm taking on \n     that.\n       I think in effect a screening process has been done by the \n     State attorneys general, and therefore I think it raises the \n     issue to a much higher level, that these State attorney \n     generals are considering bringing charges in this instance.\n       Mr. Arnall asserts that his motto is to do the right thing. \n     That's what we're trying to get him to do in this instance. \n     He owns this company. It's privately held. We had testimony \n     from people that were at the company telling about how \n     intimately he was in its activities, how much he's essential \n     to the sort of direction and the drive, the vitality of the \n     company.\n       He does have an impressive life story and I alluded to that \n     in the course of the hearing and said as much.\n       But you've got a real problem here in terms of these \n     practices, and Mr. Arnall ought to resolve this matter in my \n     opinion before he goes off to the Netherlands in order to \n     assume this ambassadorship.\n       The Chairman.

The Clerk will please report the vote.\n       Ms. Oursler. The vote is nine to nine.\n       The Chairman. Now let me make certain that the committee \n     knows what the reporting requirement is, because I'll ask the \n     Clerk then to give the report on members physically present. \n     Our rule says ``No nomination can be reported unless a \n     majority of the committee members are physically present. The \n     vote of the committee to report a measure or matter shall \n     require the concurrence of a majority of those members who \n     are physically present at the time the vote is taken.''\n       Now, what is the vote among those who are physically \n     present?\n       Ms. Oursler. Of those physically present, eight voted in \n     favor of the nomination and two voted against.\n       The Chairman. Now, the chair believes that Rule 4[c] on \n     reporting would indicate that in this particular instance the \n     nomination be forwarded to the full Senate. But that is--I \n     ask those who may have question about that to refer to Rule 4 \n     on quorums and [c] on reporting.\n       Senator Sarbanes. Mr. Chairman, as I read this rule, in \n     order to report it out you will need a majority physically \n     present, but that doesn't vitiate the proxies voted against. \n     The rule makes no reference to that and those proxies are \n     valid, and therefore we wouldn't--the vote is not carried. \n     This applies of you to try to use proxies to constitute the \n     majority for reporting it out, but it doesn't apply to the \n     use of proxies to negate reporting it out, I respectfully \n     submit to you, and I think that's a fair reading of the rule. \n     And that's the way we've done it here in the past.\n       The Chairman. Well, that is an important reading, but the \n     chair believes that the reading at least gives credence at \n     least to my interpretation, which is that a majority of those \n     voting and physically present, given the fact a majority was \n     here to create the quorum, would lead to a favorable \n     decision.\n       Senator Sarbanes. Well, I think we need to sort this out. I \n     make the point of order a quorum is not present.\n       The Chairman. Well, a quorum is not present, but the quorum \n     was present at the time of the vote and that is what is \n     required, and the chair declared that the vote was in favor \n     of reporting this nomination to the Senate floor.\n       Senator Sarbanes. On what basis is the chairman reaching \n     that conclusion?\n       The Chairman. On the basis that we had a quorum and that a \n     majority of those physically present voted in favor of the \n     nominee.\n       Senator Sarbanes. But the majority of the committee didn't \n     do that. In fact the vote here was a tie vote.\n       The Chairman. Counting in the proxies.\n       Senator Sarbanes. It was a tie vote. Yes, it was a tie \n     vote.\n       You can't bring it out with proxies. The chairman--what \n     this rule is designed to do is the chairman can't come in \n     with a bunch of proxies in his hands and then on the basis of \n     that bring a measure out of the committee. You can be called \n     on that in terms of having a majority.\n       The Chairman. I appreciate the point the chair is making--\n     rather, the Senator is making. I believe that my \n     interpretation is correct and I would just indicate that that \n     at least is what is going to occur. Now, the member may think \n     of a means for appealing that in some fashion.\n       Senator Sarbanes. Think what?\n       The Chairman. Of a means of appealing my decision. But for \n     the time being, my decision is that we had a vote and we have \n     reported the nominee.\n       Senator Sarbanes. Well, I think it's an abuse of the rules \n     and I want to state that to the chairman.\n       The Chairman. I understand.\n       Senator Sarbanes. Absolutely.\n       The Chairman. I thank the members of the committee.\n       [Whereupon, at 3.07 p.m., the committee was adjourned.]\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/11/09/senate-section/article/S12603-1", "month": "11", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12603]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ENHANCEMENT ACT OF 2005\n\n  Mr. SMITH.

Mr. President, This year's intelligence authorization bill \nis a key piece of legislation for all Americans and one that I hope to \nbe able to support. But, as written, the bill is marred by the presence \nof provisions that pose serious concerns for Americans' privacy rights. \nAmong them is one provision that would permit military intelligence \nofficials to conduct covert interviews of U.S. persons on U.S. soil to \nassess them as potential intelligence sources without disclosing their \ngovernment affiliation. With this provision in the legislation, I am \ncompelled to announce my intention to object to any unanimous consent \nrequest to bring S. 1803, the intelligence reauthorization bill, to the \nSenate floor for approval without the opportunity for debate and \nconsideration of amendments.\n  This legislation has been considered by three different Committees: \nThe Senate Intelligence committee, the Senate Committee on Armed \nServices, and the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and \nGovernmental Affairs. Three different committees have reviewed the \nlegislation, but there has not been a single hearing on the expanded \npower the administration is seeking to enable DOD personnel to demand \ninformation of law-abiding U.S. citizens without having to disclose to \nthem who they are, on whose behalf they are seeking personal and other \ninformation or what they intend to do with this information.\n  The CIA already possesses the statutory authority to engage in such \nsurreptitious interrogations of U.S. citizens, and the Department of \nDefense has not in my mind made the case for gaining this new authority \nas well. In fact, the DOD has not provided any evidence that the \nfailure to have this authority has resulted in damage to U.S. national \nsecurity.\n  According to recent press reports, the FBI has gained access to tens \nof thousands of pieces of information about U.S. citizens through \nnational security letters. This information reportedly ranges from \nwhere a person makes and spends money and who they live with to where \nthey travel and who they email. All of this information has been \ndeposited in government data banks, and according to press reports, \nthis personal information is shared widely, without restriction. The \nsame press reports say that tomorrow not only will such information be \nshared within the Federal bureaucracy but it will be made available to \nState, local and tribal entities, and ``appropriate private sector \nentities.''\n  I remain steadfast in my belief that you can protect national \nsecurity without gutting civil liberties; and this legislation, as it \ncurrently is written, is out of balance. A debate on something as \nimportant as protecting the rights of our constituents to their privacy \nand shielding against the surreptitious shakedown of law-abiding \ncitizens is one instance when Americans can and must be invited into \nthe process.\n  Shining sunlight on intelligence information for the benefit of \nAmericans\n\n[[Page S12604]]\n\nand policymakers alike is critical to our security. Congress must work \nto improve information sharing, and we owe it to the American people to \nmake sure that safeguards remain in place to ensure that sensitive \npersonal information is not tossed around inappropriately.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/11/09/senate-section/article/S12604-1", "month": "11", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12604]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   MAYORS SUPPORT THE TERRORIST APPREHENSION AND RECORD RETENTION ACT\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, our Nation's gun safety laws do not go far \nenough to protect our families and communities and may leave us \nvulnerable to an attack by terrorists using military style firearms \nlegally purchased within our own borders. Current law not only allows a \nknown or suspected terrorist to buy firearms in the U.S., it also \nrequires that records pertaining to the sale be destroyed within a day \nof the purchase. Congress should take proactive steps to address these \nshortfalls in our gun safety laws.\n  Federal law requires that anyone seeking to purchase or obtain a \npermit to possess, acquire, or carry firearms undergo a background \ncheck through the National Instant Criminal Background Check System, or \nNICS. This process requires the applicant to provide a variety of \npersonal information including name, date of birth, current residence, \nand country of citizenship which is then compared with data in the NICS \nsystem to determine whether or not the person is prohibited by law from \nreceiving or possessing firearms. Disqualifying criteria includes such \nthings as felony convictions and fugitive or illegal alien status.\n  As part of the background check, applicants are also checked against \nknown terrorist watch lists. However, under current law, membership in \na known terrorist organization does not automatically disqualify an \napplicant from receiving or possessing a firearm. In cases where a \npositive match is made, federal authorities search for other \ndisqualifying information. If no disqualifying information can be found \nwithin three business days, the transaction is permitted to continue. \nIn addition, all records pertaining to a positive match of an applicant \nto a terrorist watch list must, under current law, be destroyed within \n24 hours if no disqualifying information is found.\n  I have cosponsored the Terrorist Apprehension Record Retention Act \nintroduced by Senator Lautenberg. This bill would require that in cases \nwhere an NICS background check turns up a valid match to a terrorist \nwatch list, all records pertaining to the transaction be retained for \nten years. In addition, the bill requires that all NICS information be \nshared with appropriate federal and state counterterrorism officials \nanytime an individual on a terrorist watch list attempts to buy a \nfirearm. This is only common sense.\n  The U.S. Conference of Mayors, which represents some 1,183 cities \naround the country, adopted a resolution strongly supporting the \nTerrorist Apprehension and Record Retention Act at their 2005 annual \nmeeting. The resolution cites a report by the General Accountability \nOffice which found that from February 3, 2004 through June 30, 2004, a \ntotal of 44 firearm purchase attempts were made by individuals \ndesignated as known or suspected terrorists by the federal government. \nThis is an alarming statistic. I ask unanimous consent that a copy of \nthe resolution adopted by the U.S. Conference of Mayors be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       The Terrorist Apprehension and Record Retention (TARR) Act\n\n       Whereas, neither suspected nor actual membership in a \n     terrorist organization by itself prohibits a person from \n     owning a gun under current law; and\n       lWhereas, beginning in November of 2003, the U.S. \n     Department of Justice directed the FBI to revise its \n     procedures to better ensure that suspected members of \n     terrorist organizations who have disqualifying factors do not \n     receive firearms in violation of the law by automatically \n     delaying responses to provide more time to check data; and\n       Whereas, in January of 2005, the U.S. Government Accounting \n     Office (GAO) released a report entitled, ``Gun Control and \n     Terrorism: FBI Could Better Manage Firearm-Related Background \n     Checks Involving Terrorist Watch List Records''; and\n       Whereas, that report found that from February 3 through \n     June 30, 2004, a total of 44 firearm related background \n     checks handled by the FBI and state agencies resulted in \n     valid matches with terrorist watch records, and of this total \n     35 transactions were allowed to proceed because the checks \n     found no prohibiting information, such as felony convictions, \n     illegal immigrant status, or other disqualifying factors; and\n       Whereas, the report states, ``GAO recommends that the \n     Attorney General (1) clarify procedures to ensure that the \n     maximum amount of allowable information from these background \n     checks is consistently shared with counterterrorism officials \n     and (2) either strengthen the FBI's oversight of state \n     agencies or have the FBI centrally manage all valid match \n     background checks. The Department of Justice agreed.''; and\n       Whereas, legislation has been introduced in the U.S. Senate \n     and House of Representatives entitled the ``Terrorist \n     Apprehension and Record Retention (TARR) Act''; and\n       Whereas, the TARR Act amends the Federal criminal code to \n     provide that if the national criminal background check system \n     indicates that a person attempting to purchase a firearm or \n     applying for a State permit to possess, acquire, or carry a \n     firearm is identified as a known or suspected member of a \n     terrorist organization in records maintained by the \n     Department of Justice or the Department of Homeland Security, \n     including the violent Gang and Terrorist Organization File or \n     records maintained by the Intelligence Community: (1) all \n     information related to the prospective transaction shall be \n     automatically and immediately transmitted to the appropriate \n     Federal and State counterterrorism officials, including the \n     Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI); (2) the FBI shall \n     coordinate the response; and (3) all records generated in the \n     course of the check that are obtained by Federal and State \n     officials shall be retained for at least ten years, Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the U.S. Conference of Mayors strongly \n     supports the Terrorist Apprehension and Record Retention Act \n     (TARR), and urges that it be passed by Congress and signed \n     into law by the President.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the U.S. Conference of Mayors recognizes \nthe importance of preserving records of gun purchases by known \nterrorists and the important role they could potentially play in \nuncovering a terrorist attack before it is carried out. We owe it to \nall Americans in this era of heightened risk of terrorist attack to do \nall we can to protect their safety.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/11/09/senate-section/article/S12604-2", "month": "11", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12604-S12605]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  INTEGRITY IN PROFESSIONAL SPORTS ACT\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise to express my support for the \nIntegrity in Professional Sports Act, S. 1960. I am deeply troubled by \nthe accounts of children and professional athletes who use anabolic \nsteroids and other performance-enhancement drugs. The effects of taking \nsteroids are not only physiological, but psychological. Experts have \ntestified before Congress that steroid use creates an increased \npropensity for aggressive and sometimes criminal behavior. It is clear \nto me that the use of performance enhancing drugs reveals a number of \nproblems, one of which is a problem of character.\n  As many of my colleagues may know, for the past 12 years, I have been \ninvolved in a grassroots program to promote character education for our \ncountry's children. The Character Counts program is an important \ngrassroots effort that I am proud to have supported. Most recently, on \nOctober 7, 2005, 28 Senators joined Senator Christopher Dodd and I in \nsponsoring a resolution to designate ``National Character Counts \nWeek.'' The program promotes six fundamental and universal pillars of \ngood character. Those are trustworthiness, respect, responsibility, \nfairness, caring, and citizenship. A central premise of the Character \nCounts program has held that children across the country depend on \nsocial institutions and leaders for the development of good character. \nFor children, these leaders and role models are often found on the \nrosters of professional sports teams. When our children see \nprofessional athletes engaging in the use of steroids, they begin to \nquestion the importance of pillars such as trustworthiness, \nresponsibility, and fairness.\n  Speaking as a former baseball pitcher for the University of New \nMexico and the Albuquerque Dukes, I cannot emphasize enough the \nimportance of trustworthiness and fairness in sportsmanship. As \nathletes, my teammates and I understood that the integrity of the game \ndepended on knowledge that your competitors brought no advantage other \nthan talent and hard work to the playing field. To think that your \ncompetitors used steroids to enhance their athletic performance would \nmean that the game itself was compromised.\n\n[[Page S12605]]\n\n  S. 1960 is important legislation because it makes clear that all \nathletes participating in professional sports will be held to the same \nstandards of fair play. By instituting minimum standards for the \ntesting of steroids, professional sports teams and professional \nathletes can regain the respect and trust of the American people. It is \nimportant that we hold adults to the same standards of character as we \ndo our children. Young people look up to professional athletes as role \nmodels. We owe it to them to make sure that adults behave according to \nthe same standards of trustworthiness, fairness, and respect.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/11/09/senate-section/article/S12605-1", "month": "11", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12605]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           VETERANS DAY 2005\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, today, we as Americans gather to honor \nall those who served, fought and sacrificed to defend our Nation \nthroughout its history.\n  During the 229 year history of our Nation, brave Americans have \nanswered the call to defend their country's freedom and the freedom of \npeople around the globe. Today, as in the past, our servicemen and \nwomen continue to embrace these twin goals.\n  I encourage my fellow New Mexicans and all Americans to take a few \nmoments to remember and honor the gallant men and women of our Armed \nForces past and present.\n  New Mexicans have a long distinguished history of military service. \nDuring the Spanish American War New Mexico guardsmen formed the bulk of \nthe 2nd Squadron of the 1st Calvary Regiment which served with Teddy \nRoosevelt and his Rough Riders at the battle of San Juan Hill. When the \nUnited States entered the First World War, New Mexicans of the 1st \nInfantry Regiment served with the 40th Infantry Division in France. \nWhile participating in the Italian campaign of the Second World War, \nNew Mexicans of the 104th Tank Destroyer battalion were awarded 8 \nSilver Stars, 60 Bronze Stars, and 135 Purple Hearts. Of course no one \nwill forget the contribution to final victory the Navajos from our \nState made as ``code talkers'' or the bravery of the ``New Mexico \nBrigade'' in the Philippines. In the history of our Nation New Mexicans \nhave served with great distinction from the swamps of Cuba, to the \njungles of Vietnam and the deserts of Iraq.\n  It is important that we never forget the sacrifice and dedication of \nthese Americans. They left behind the comfort of home, family and \nfriends to defend our country and its countless blessings. For this, \nmany have paid an immense price, emotionally and physically, some \nenduring years of captivity and suffering, some never to return home. \nWe Americans owe all that we have to these men and women. No praise or \nhonor will ever be too great for these individuals.\n  The service of veterans to our country has never ended with their \ndeparture from the Armed Forces. They have enriched every community in \nwhich they reside with their strength of character, hard work and \ndevotion to family. For this we must also be grateful.\n  Since 9/11, the men and women of our Armed Forces have been called \naway from home, and are today furthering the cause of freedom in Iraq, \nAfghanistan and all over the globe. Many of these individuals are \nNational Guardsmen like the members of the 515th Corps Support \nBattalion that recently returned from Iraq and the servicemen and women \nfrom Holloman, Kirtland, and Cannon Air Force bases. They serve with \nthe same courage and commitment shown by Americans of generations past \nand they, too, deserve our thoughts and prayers. May our United States \ncontinue to be blessed and may America forever remain the land of the \nfree and the home of the brave.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/11/09/senate-section/article/S12605-2", "month": "11", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12605]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/11/09/senate-section/article/S12605-3", "month": "11", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12605]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/11/09/senate-section/article/S12605-4", "month": "11", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12605]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  REPORT RELATIVE TO THE CONTINUATION OF THE NATIONAL EMERGENCY WITH \n  RESPECT TO IRAN WHICH WAS DECLARED IN EXECUTIVE ORDER NO. 12170 ON \n                        NOVEMBER 14, 1979--PM 30\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and \nUrban Affairs.\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) \nprovides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless, \nprior to the anniversary date of its declaration, the President \npublishes in the Federal Register and transmits to the Congress a \nnotice stating that the emergency is to continue in effect beyond the \nanniversary date.

Reservations\n       The advice and consent of the Senate under section 1 is \n     subject to the following reservations, which shall be \n     included in the United States instrument of ratification:\n       (1) The United States of America, pursuant to Articles 4 \n     and 42, reserves the right to require that the conduct result \n     in serious harm, which shall be determined in accordance with \n     applicable United States federal law.\n       (2) The United States of America, pursuant to Articles 6 \n     and 42, reserves the right not to apply paragraphs (1)(a)(i) \n     and (1)(b) of Article 6 (``Misuse of devices'') with respect \n     to devices designed or adapted primarily for the purpose of \n     committing the offenses established in Article 4 (``Data \n     interference'') and Article 5 (``System interference'').\n       (3) The United States of America, pursuant to Articles 9 \n     and 42, reserves the right to apply paragraphs (2)(b) and (c) \n     of Article 9 only to the extent consistent with the \n     Constitution of the United States as interpreted by the \n     United States and as provided for under its federal law, \n     which includes, for example, crimes of distribution of \n     material considered to be obscene under applicable United \n     States standards.\n       (4) The United States of America, pursuant to Articles 10 \n     and 42, reserves the right to impose other effective remedies \n     in lieu of criminal liability under paragraphs 1 and 2 of \n     Article 10 (``Offenses related to infringement of copyright \n     and related rights'') with respect to infringements of \n     certain rental rights to the extent the criminalization of \n     such infringements is not required pursuant to the \n     obligations the United States has undertaken under the \n     agreements referenced in paragraphs 1 and 2.\n       (5) The United States of America, pursuant to Articles 22 \n     and 42, reserves the right not to apply in part paragraphs \n     (1)(b), (c) and (d) of Article 22 (``Jurisdiction'').

The minimum number shall be the same as \n     that provided for by applicable United States federal law.\n       (c) The United States of America declares, pursuant to \n     Articles 7 and 40, that under United States law, the offense \n     set forth in Article 7 (``Computer-related forgery'') \n     includes a requirement of intent to defraud.\n       (d) The United States of America declares, pursuant to \n     Articles 27 and 40, that requests made to the United States \n     of America under paragraph 9(e) of Article 27 (``Procedures \n     pertaining to mutual assistance requests in the absence of \n     applicable international agreements'') are to be addressed to \n     its central authority for mutual assistance.\n       (2) The advice and consent of the Senate under section 1 is \n     also subject to the following declaration: The United States \n     of America declares that, in view of its reservation pursuant \n     to Article 41 of the Convention, current United States \n     federal law fulfills the obligations of Chapter II of the \n     Convention for the United States.

A bill to provide for the establishment of a strategic \nrefinery reserve, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy \nand Natural Resources.\n  Mr. KOHL. Madam President, I rise today to speak briefly about an \namendment Senator Jeffords and I had hoped to offer to the Defense \nauthorization bill. I understand it is not considered relevant, so we \nwon't get a vote. That is unfortunate. I cannot imagine what is more \nrelevant to the defense of our Nation than an amendment that would do \nsomething concrete about high energy prices, about national security, \nand about economic security--all with one vote.\n  Our amendment, which we are introducing today as a freestanding bill \nalong with Senator Feinstein, would authorize the Department of Energy \nto build enough refining capacity to meet the energy needs of the \nFederal Government--primarily the Department of Defense--and also to \nsupply the private market in times of shortages and price spikes.\n  There is bipartisan agreement that increasing refining capacity in \nthe United States would help avoid the kinds of energy price spikes we \nhave seen in the last few months. There also seems to be clear evidence \nthat, despite generous incentives from the Government and soaring \nprofits, the oil companies are not interested in building the new \nrefineries we need. And in a free market, of course, that is their \nchoice.\n  But in a democracy, we in Congress are charged with making a \ndifferent choice. We need to do what is best for our national and \neconomic security. And, in this case, that would be to stop begging and \nbribing the oil companies. By building our own refining capacity, we \nwould be able to supply the fuel needs of the Federal Government at \nwhat it actually costs to make that fuel. And we would also be able to \nhold in reserve refining capacity that we could access to bring down \nthe cost of gas in times when shortages raise prices.\n  Today, the Senate is holding important hearings on energy. I am \nconcerned, however, that instead of offering answers and solutions, the \noil companies will blame OPEC for the high price of gasoline, diesel \nfuel, and home heating oil. We should not let them get away with that \nbecause OPEC is only part of the story.\n  While the price of gasoline rose to record levels in recent months, \nthe oil companies were earning increasingly high profits on each gallon \nof gasoline. One measure is the ``domestic spread,'' the retail \ngasoline pump price minus the cost of crude oil and taxes. During the \n1900s, the domestic spread was about 40 cents per gallon for regular \ngas. This number has grown sharply since 2000. The domestic spread \naveraged above 50 cents per gallon between 2000 and 2004, and has \nreached as high as over 70 cents per gallon in recent months. In other \nwords, the oil companies are earning much more today for a gallon of \ngas, even factoring in the higher price of crude oil.\n  Growing oil company profits also demonstrate this point: Oil industry \nprofits, after tax, increased by $100 billion in the 5 years from 2000 \nto 2004, as compared to the previous 5-year period. ExxonMobil's \nearnings for the first 9 months of 2005--over $25 billion--already \nexceeded its full-year earnings for all of 2004. So obviously, these \ncompanies are doing much more than just passing along higher crude oil \nprices to customers.\n  One major reason for these soaring prices and profits is the oil \nindustry's failure to increase refining capacity in the face of rising \ndemand for refined petroleum products. A new refinery has not been \nbuilt in the United States since the 1970s, and many oil refineries \nhave been closed. In 1985, refining capacity equaled daily consumption \nof petroleum products. By 2002, daily consumption exceeded refining \ncapacity by almost 20 percent.\n  As domestic supply falls short of domestic demand, three very \ndangerous\n\n[[Page S12609]]\n\nthings happen: 1, we are forced to rely on more imports. 2, we pay \nhigher and higher prices for our fuel. And, 3, our economy is \nincreasingly vulnerable to disasters and disruptions--like those we saw \nin the wake of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita.\n  The bill we are introducing would authorize the Department of Energy \nto create a refining capacity equal to 5 percent of current domestic \nconsumption. These refineries would supply the Federal Government's \nneed for petroleum products, estimated to be roughly 2 percent of U.S. \nconsumption. The extra 3 percent of capacity would be available for \nemergencies and market disruptions.\n  This ``Strategic Refining Reserve'' would have a direct effect on \nenergy prices to the consumer. It would get the Federal Government out \nof the private market where its huge demand for energy drives up \nprices. And it would increase the amount of oil that can be refined in \nthis country in times when the oil companies' refining capacity is \ntapped out.\n  We have a duty to protect consumers, our economy, and our national \nsecurity from an industry that often seems focused only on the short-\nterm bottom line. We have a duty to respond with concrete help for the \nfamilies and businesses that tell us daily of the enormous financial \nthreat posed by soaring energy prices. And we have a duty to make sure \nour military has access to a steady, affordable supply of domestically \nrefined fuel.\n  Though we will not be able to offer this proposal as an amendment to \nthe DOD authorization bill, we have introduced it as a bill, and we \nplan to continue to look for opportunities for a vote. We need to take \nsole control of fuel prices away from the oil companies. We need to \ntake charge and bring the price of fuel down by building this \n``Strategic Refinery Reserve.''\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1979\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to provide habitable living quarters for teachers, \nadministrators, and other school staff, and their households, in rural \nareas of Alaska located in or near Alaska Native villages; to the \nCommittee on Indian Affairs.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise to introduce a bill that will \nhave a profound effect on the retention of teachers, administrators, \nand other school staff in remote and rural areas of Alaska.\n  In rural areas of Alaska, school districts face the challenge of \nrecruiting and retaining teachers, administrators and other school \nstaff due to the lack of housing. In one particular year in the Lower \nKuskokwim School District in western Alaska, they hired one teacher for \nevery six who decided not to accept job offers. Half of the applicants \nwho did not accept a teaching position in that district indicated that \ntheir decision was related to the lack of housing.\n  In 2003, I traveled through rural Alaska with then-Education \nSecretary Rod Paige. I wanted him to see the challenges of educating \nchildren in such a remote and rural environment. At the village school \nin Savoonga, the principal slept in a broom closet in the school due to \nthe lack of housing in that village. The special education teacher \nslept in her classroom, bringing a mattress out each evening to sleep \non the floor. The other teachers shared housing in a single home. \nNeedless to say, there is not enough room for the teachers' spouses. \nUnfortunately, Savoonga is not an isolated example of the teacher \nhousing situation in rural Alaska.\n  Rural Alaskan school districts experience a high rate of teacher \nturnover due to the lack of housing. Turnover is as high as 30 percent \neach year in some rural areas with housing issues being a major factor. \nHow can we expect our\n\n[[Page S12610]]\n\nchildren to receive a quality education when the good teachers don't \nstay? How can we meet the mandates of No Child Left Behind in such an \neducational environment? Clearly, the lack of teacher housing in rural \nAlaska is an issue that must be addressed in order to ensure that \nchildren in rural Alaska receive the same level of education as their \npeers in more urban settings.\n  My bill authorizes the Department of Housing and Urban Development to \nprovide teacher housing funds to the Alaska Housing Finance \nCorporation, which is a State agency. In turn, the corporation is \nauthorized to provide grant and loan funds to rural school districts in \nAlaska for teacher housing projects.\n  This legislation will allow school districts in rural Alaska to \naddress the housing shortage in the following ways: construct housing \nunits; purchase housing units; lease housing units; rehabilitate \nhousing units; purchase or lease property on which housing units will \nbe constructed, purchased or rehabilitated; repay loans secured for \nteacher housing projects; and conduct any other activities normally \nrelated to the construction, purchase, or rehabilitation of teacher \nhousing projects.\n  Eligible school districts that accept funds under this legislation \nwill be required to provide the housing to teachers, administrators, \nother school staff, and members of their households.\n  It is imperative that we address this important issue and allow the \ndisbursement of funds to be handled at the State level. The quality of \neducation of our rural students is at stake.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1980\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Rural Teacher Housing Act of \n     2005''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) housing for teachers, administrators, other school \n     staff, and the households of such staff in remote and rural \n     areas of the State of Alaska is often substandard, if \n     available at all;\n       (2) teachers, administrators, other school staff, and the \n     households of such staff are often forced to find alternate \n     shelter, sometimes even in school buildings; and\n       (3) rural school districts in the State of Alaska face \n     increased challenges, including meeting the requirements of \n     the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. \n     6301 et seq.), in recruiting employees due to the lack of \n     affordable, quality housing.\n       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to provide \n     habitable living quarters for teachers, administrators, other \n     school staff, and the households of such staff in rural areas \n     of the State of Alaska located in or near Alaska Native \n     villages.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \na tax credit against residential heating costs; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce legislation that \nwould provide a tax credit for home energy costs to low- and middle-\nincome taxpayers. This legislation will help those who are struggling \nto simply heat their homes as winter approaches and while fuel prices \nremain so high.\n  Home heating oil in Maine is $2.52 per gallon, up 59 cents from a \nyear ago. Kerosene prices average $2.95 a gallon, 75 cents higher than \nthis time last year. Some projections have a gallon of heating oil \nreaching $3.00! And I am told that rolling blackouts on cold days this \nwinter may be a possibility because of a high demand for electricity.\n  According to the National Energy Assistance Directors Association, \nheating costs for the average family using heating oil are projected to \nhit $1,666 for the upcoming winter. This represents an increase of $403 \nover last winter's prices and $714 over the winter heating season of \n2003-2004. Should colder weather prevail, these costs will surely \nincrease, especially for States like Maine.\n  So understandably, my constituents are asking how they will be able \nto afford to pay home heating oil bills that are 30 percent more \nexpensive than last year. This is a crisis that has arrived.\n  Heating one's home is a necessity of life--so much so that 73 percent \nof households in a recent survey reported they would cut back on, and \neven go without, other necessities such as food, prescription drugs, \nand mortgage and rent payments. Churches, food pantries, local service \norganizations--they are all deeply concerned, and the leaves have \nbarely fallen from the trees.\n  In order to help low- and middle-income families heat their homes \nthis winter, I am proposing a tax credit for home energy costs up to \n$500. The credit would be available to married couples earning less \nthan $100,000 and single taxpayers making less than $50,000.\n  My legislation also directs the Treasury Department to assist \nindividuals to adjust their withholding amounts for 2006, which will \nimmediately increase take home pay. Without adjusting their \nwithholding, taxpayers would not benefit from the credit until they \nfile their taxes sometime in 2007, possibly long after energy prices \nhave returned to a normal level. As a result, this is a crucial \nprovision to ensure that these individuals and families get a helping \nhand exactly when they need it most. Finally, any unused credit amount \ncould be carried back to the prior two taxable years or carried forward \nto future taxable years.\n  It is critical that those who would benefit from the home energy \ncredit are not at the same time required to shoulder the burden of the \ncost of the credit through an increase in the national debt. This \ncredit should be paid for, and it makes sense to me that costs of the \ncredit should be financed by those who profit the most by high energy \nprices, namely large oil companies. I am concerned that while many \nindividuals are forced to make the choice of heating one's home or \nmeeting the other basic necessities of life, large oil companies are \nshowing record profits. Therefore, the Home Energy Cost Tax Assistance \nAct includes an offset provision to disallow the tax benefit that large \noil companies with\n\n[[Page S12614]]\n\nrevenues in excess of $1 billion in 2005 receive by use of the Last-In, \nFirst-Out (LIFO) tax accounting method. Instead, these companies would \nbe required to use the First-In, First-Out (FIFO) method of accounting \nfor 2005. Put another way, the proposal would scale back a tax \nprovision that allows oil companies to take an enormous tax deduction \nwhen prices are sky high and allows them to boost after-tax profits \neven further. As big oil companies show record profits on the backs of \nordinary Americans, they have less of a need for such a tax break, and \nI believe it is fair to scale back this tax break in order to lend a \nhelping hand to low- and middle-income workers.\n  It is critical that Congress act to help low and middle income \nAmericans absorb the increased home energy costs associated with the \ndrastic increase in price of fuel. Temperatures are falling, prices are \nrising and we must move swiftly.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1982\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to prohibit certain abortion-related discrimination \nin governmental activities; to the Committee on Health, Education, \nLabor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Abortion\n\n[[Page S12615]]\n\nNon-Discrimination Act of 2005. I am pleased to be joined in this \neffort by Senators Ben Nelson, Inhofe, DeMint, DeWine, Hagel, Coburn, \nGregg, Brownback, Ensign, Martinez, Kyl, Vitter, and Burr.\n  Abortion has been, and continues to be, one of the most divisive \nsocial issues in our Nation. I realize that there are people of good \nwill on both sides of this issue, people who working for the best \ninterests of women, children and families. Despite the great \ndisagreements, there are points of this debate where the vast majority \nof Americans agree, for example the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act, the \nUnborn Victims of Violence Act, and the Born-Alive Infants Protection \nAct. The bill I introduce today is one of these areas of common ground. \nHowever one may feel about abortion, surely we can agree on the \nprinciple that no one should be forced to participate in an abortion in \nviolation of one's conscience.\n  We should all agree that no person or entity should be forced, \nagainst their will or conscience, to provide, refer for, or pay for an \nabortion. No entity should be forced to choose between being involved \nin an abortion or losing its funding, its certification, or its ability \nto exist as a hospital. Healthcare entities including physicians, other \nhealth professionals, hospitals, provider-sponsored organizations, \nhealth maintenance organizations, and health insurance plans should not \nbe coerced into providing abortion services, and they certainly should \nnot be discriminated against because of their objections to providing \nor paying for abortions.\n  Current law, as has been interpreted by some courts, only provides \nprotection for individual physicians, postgraduate physician training \nprograms, and participants in health professions training. This narrow \ninterpretation excludes from protection those who deserve it. The \nAbortion Non-Discrimination Act of 2005 directly addresses these \nconcerns by clarifying and strengthening existing law. This legislation \nmakes clear that other health professionals, hospitals, health \ninsurance plans, and any other kind of health care facility, \norganization, or plan cannot be forced to perform, provide coverage of, \nor pay for an abortion when it conflicts with their conscience. These \nindividuals and organizations deserve the freedom to follow their \nconscience in protecting innocent life. They should not be forced to \nsuffer financial consequences for their choice not to participate in an \nabortion.\n  I am thankful for the Hyde-Weldon conscience protection language that \nwas included in the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2005, but I \nbelieve it is appropriate to codify such conscience protection in \nFederal law. I am hopeful the Senate will act to pass the Abortion Non-\nDiscrimination Act during this Congress.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of this legislation be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1983\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Abortion Non-Discrimination \n     Act of 2005''.\n\n     SEC. 2. ABORTION NON-DISCRIMINATION.\n\n       Section 245 of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. \n     238n) is amended--\n       (1) in the section heading by striking ``AND LICENSING OF \n     PHYSICIANS'' and inserting ``, LICENSING, AND PRACTICE OF \n     PHYSICIANS AND OTHER HEALTH CARE ENTITIES'';\n       (2) in subsection (a)(1), by striking ``to perform such \n     abortions'' and inserting ``to perform, provide coverage of, \n     or pay for induced abortions''; and\n       (3) in subsection (c)--\n       (A) in paragraph (1), by striking ``includes'' and \n     inserting ``means''; and\n       (B) in paragraph (2)--\n       (i) by inserting ``or other health professional,'' after \n     ``an individual physician'';\n       (ii) by striking ``and a participant'' and inserting ``a \n     participant''; and\n       (iii) by inserting before the period the following: ``, a \n     hospital, a provider sponsored organization, a health \n     maintenance organization, a health insurance plan, or any \n     other kind of health care facility, organization or plan''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ALLARD:\n  S. 1986. A bill to provide for the coordination and use of the \nNational Domestic Preparedness Consortium by the Department of Homeland \nSecurity, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Homeland Security \nand Governmental Affairs.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, the events of the past few months remind \nus of the vital role of first responders in responding to natural \ndisasters and terrorists attacks. First responders are just that: the \nfirst to respond. When they arrive on the scene, they often face fluid \nand volatile situations whereupon they are required to make split-\nsecond decisions, each of which has the potential to affect thousands \nof lives. For this reason, it is important that our first responders \nreceive the training and experience needed to make critical life saving \ndecisions under emergency circumstances. I believe that an essential \nelement of preparing our first responders is to provide them with \nhands-on experience in simulated, real-world training environments.\n  The importance of real world training was called to my attention by a \nvisit to the Technology Training Center (TTC) in Pueblo, CO. There, I \nwitnessed first hand the tools at our disposal to equip our first \nresponders with the training they need, specifically in the context of \nrail and mass transit. Already aware of the training facilities at the \ndisposal of our first responders through the Department of Homeland \nSecurity's National Domestic Preparedness Consortium (NDPC), TTC's \npotential to fill a gap in the rail and mass transit environment became \napparent.\n  Congress recognized the need to train first responders in the 1998 \nAppropriations Act, Public Law 105-119, and accompanying report. There, \nCongress stated that, while the Federal Government plays an important \nrole in preventing and responding to these types of threats, state and \nlocal public safety personnel are typically first to respond to the \nscene when such incidents occur. As a result, Congress authorized the \nAttorney General to assist state and local public safety personnel in \nacquiring the specialized training and equipment necessary to safely \nrespond to and manage terrorist incidents involving weapons of mass \ndestruction.\n  On April 30, 1998, the Attorney General delegated authority to the \nJustice Department's Office of Justice Programs (OJP) to develop and \nadminister training and equipment assistance programs for state and \nlocal emergency response agencies to better prepare them against this \nthreat. To execute this mission, the Office of Justice Programs \nestablished the Office for Domestic Preparedness (ODP) to develop and \nadminister a national Domestic Preparedness Program.\n  Upon passage of the Homeland Security Act of 2002, Pub. L. 107-296, \nthe ODP was transferred to the Department of Homeland Security from \nOJP. In 2003, a number of grant programs and functions from other DHS \ncomponents were consolidated with ODP, including the NDPC, under a new \nDHS agency, the Office of State and Local Government Coordination and \nPreparedness (SLGCP).\n  Today, SLGCP is the Federal Government's lead agency responsible for \npreparing the nation against terrorism by assisting states, local and \ntribal jurisdictions, and regional authorities as they prevent, deter, \nand respond to terrorist acts. SLGCP's ODP provides tailored training \nto enhance the capacity of States and local jurisdictions to prevent, \ndeter, and respond safely and effectively to emergency situations.\n\n  ODP draws upon a coalition of ``training partners'' in the \ndevelopment and delivery of state-of-the-art training programs. This \ncoalition is composed of government facilities, academic institutions, \nand private organizations, all of which are committed to providing a \nvariety of specialized training for emergency responders across the \ncountry.\n  ODP's major training partner is the NDPC, through which ODP \nidentifies, develops, tests, and delivers training to state and local \nemergency responders. The NDPC includes: ODP's Center for Domestic \nPreparedness (CDP): CDP provides advanced, hands-on training to members \nof the emergency response community in the areas of command, advanced \nhazmat, and tactical operations. CDP is the only WMD training facility \nthat provides hands-on training to civilian emergency responders in\n\n[[Page S12616]]\n\na toxic chemical agent environment. New Mexico Institute of Mining and \nTechnology (NMIMT): NMIMT, a world leader in explosives research, \nserves as the lead NDPC partner for explosives, firearms, and \nincendiary devices training. New Mexico Tech also delivers a program on \nsuicide bombing prevention. Louisiana State University (LSU): LSU \nprovides training and expertise in the areas of law enforcement, \nbioterrorism, agricultural terrorism, weapons of mass destruction, and \nmass casualty incidents. Texas A University System, Texas Engineering \nExtension Service (TEEX): TEEX develops and conducts national WMD \npreparedness training for all emergency response disciplines, as well \nas courses in incident management/unified command, threat and risk \nassessments, operations for public works, and WMD operations for \nemergency medical services. TEEX also conducts a structural collapse \ntechnician course to build state capabilities for urban search and \nrescue operations. Department of Energy's Nevada Test Site (NTS): NTS \nconducts radiological and nuclear training at NTS and via mobile \ntraining teams. It also develops and delivers radiological/nuclear \nmobile training at the awareness and operations levels and conducts \ntrain-the-trainer courses for first responders across the country.\n  Although it consists of an impressive array of training facilities, \nthe National Domestic Preparedness Consortium is not statutorily \nauthorized and does not include a facility that is uniquely focused on \nemergency preparedness within the railroad and mass transit \nenvironment. Therefore, in addition to specifically authorizing the \nNDPC, this bill incorporates the Transportation Technology Center into \nthe Department of Homeland Security's National Domestic Preparedness \nConsortium, filling a critical gap in its current training agenda.\n  TTC is a federally-owned, 52 square mile multi-modal testing and \ntraining facility in Pueblo, Colorado, operated by the Association of \nAmerican Railroads (AAR). In 1985, TTC established an on site Emergency \nResponse Training Center (ERTC) to train railroad officials to safely \nhandle accidents involving tank cars carrying hazardous materials. The \ntraining proved to be so successful that attendance was opened up to \nother emergency responders. TTC now serves not only the transportation \nservice industry, but also the public sector emergency response \ncommunity, the chemical industry, government agencies, and emergency \nresponse contractors from all over the world.\n  Each year, an average of 1,700 first responders--from Portland, ME to \nPortland, OR--travel to Pueblo, CO, to participate in TTC's training \nprogram. Former participants include over 600 fire departments and \nentities from 45 states; 16 state police agencies from Arkansas, \nColorado, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, Massachusetts, \nMichigan, Missouri, New Jersey, Nebraska, New Mexico, Oregon, Texas, \nand Washington; and numerous government agencies, including the U.S. \nAir Force, Army, Coast Guard, Customs Service, Federal Bureau of \nInvestigations, Environmental Protection Agency, Drug Enforcement \nAgency, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and the \nNational Transportation Safety Board. In its 20 year history, the \nfacility has trained more than 20,000 students worldwide.\n  The ERTC is regarded as the ``graduate school'' of hazmat training \nbecause of its focus on hands-on, true to life, training exercises on \nactual rail vehicles, including tank cars and passenger rail cars. The \nERTC is uniquely positioned to teach emergency response for railway-\nrelated emergencies with 69 railway freight cars, 15 railroad passenger \ncars, 25 highway cargo tanks, van trailers, and intermodal containers, \nand computer work stations equipped with the latest emergency response \nsoftware. The Passenger Railcar Security and Integrity Training \nFacility is currently being developed to test various inspection, \nresponse, and remediation techniques' effectiveness for mitigation to \nincidents involving passenger railcars. This facility focuses on \nchemical, biological, radiological, nuclear, or explosive incidents and \nother activities associated with potential terrorist events.\n  The distinctive environment of TTC allows testing and training \nactivities to be carried out at a remote Colorado location without \ndisruption to the flow of passenger and rail traffic in and around \nurban areas. Its inclusion in the NDPC presents a unique opportunity to \nenhance technology and training that will improve our Nation's ability \nto prevent, minimize, and respond to potential terrorist attacks \nsimilar to those recently seen in London and Madrid.\n  It is for these reasons, among others, that I rise today to introduce \na bill statutorily authorizing the National Domestic Preparedness \nConsortium, as expanded to include the Transportation Technology Center \nin Pueblo, CO, and providing for its coordination and use by the \nDepartment of Homeland Security in training the Nation's first \nresponders.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/11/09/senate-section/article/S12616-1", "month": "11", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12616]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 63--SUPPORTING THE GOALS AND IDEALS OF \n          NATIONAL HIGH SCHOOL SENIORS VOTER REGISTRATION DAY\n\n  Mr. VITTER submitted the following resolution; which was referred to \nthe Committee on Rules and Administration:\n\n                            S.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have exerted very \n     Large demands on the Treasury of the United States and \n     required tremendous sacrifice by the members of the Armed \n     Forces of the United States.\n       (2) Congress has a constitutional responsibility to ensure \n     comprehensive oversight of the expenditure of United States \n     Government funds.\n       (3) Waste and corporate abuse of United States Government \n     resources are particularly unacceptable and reprehensible \n     during times of war.\n       (4) The magnitude of the funds involved in the \n     reconstruction of Afghanistan and Iraq and the war on \n     terrorism, together with the speed with which these funds \n     have been committed, presents a challenge to the effective \n     performance of the traditional oversight function of Congress \n     and the auditing functions of the executive branch.\n       (5) The Senate Special Committee to Investigate the \n     National Defense Program, popularly know as the Truman \n     Committee, which was established during World War II, offers \n     a constructive precedent for bipartisan oversight of wartime \n     contracting that can also be extended to wartime and postwar \n     reconstruction activities.\n       (6) The Truman Committee is credited with an extremely \n     successful investigative effort, performance of a significant \n     public education role, and achievement of fiscal savings \n     measured in the billions of dollar.\n       (7) The public has a right to expect that taxpayer \n     resources will be carefully disbursed and honestly spent.\n\n     SEC.__02.

The aerostat's range and \n     operational capabilities allow it to provide surveillance \n     coverage of the eastern Caribbean corridor and the strategic \n     waterway between Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic, \n     known as the Mona Passage.\n       (4) Including maritime radar on the Lajas aerostat will \n     expand its ability to detect suspicious vessels in the \n     eastern Caribbean corridor.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--Given the above findings, it is \n     the Sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) Congress and the Department of Defense fully fund the \n     Counter-Drug Tethered Aerostat program.\n       (2) Department of Defense install maritime radar on the \n     Lajas, Puerto Rico aerostat.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 2502.
