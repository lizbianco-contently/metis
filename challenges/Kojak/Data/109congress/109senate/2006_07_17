Mr. President, over the next 2 days we will be discussing \nthe issues surrounding stem cell research and discussing a total of \nthree bills over the course of 48 hours. Our discussion over the next 2 \ndays will focus on science and on ethics and how science and ethics \ninterplay.\n  Science: We are in a remarkable era of exciting and rapidly \naccelerating advances in developmental biology. New doors of \nexploration have been thrown wide open by the Human Genome Project and \nby our new knowledge and our new understanding of molecular and \ncellular mechanisms. Some have called this 21st century the century of \ncells--a century that will explode with regenerative medicine so that \nheart surgeon Bill Frist will no longer have to cut out a diseased \nheart and replace that diseased heart with a healthy heart but would \nrather treat a patient with cells requiring no surgery.\n  We are going to be discussing ethics. Although not easy, we do have \nto confront head-on the difficult issues around life's beginnings, all \nof which have large scientific, moral, and religious implications. The \nrapidly advancing science has taken us to today's debate.\n  As we will see in our discussions on the floor of the Senate, it is \nsafe to say that no scientific issue is more divisive today than this \ndiscussion surrounding stem cells. As others have said, you can't do an \nend run around all of these ethical challenges. They are before us, and \nthey are going to come with increasing frequency with advancing \nscience. Our responsibility as policymakers is, through deliberation \nand through dialog and through debate, to frame those moral principles \nwhich protect and defend human dignity and promote scientific advances \nand medical applications that will lead to healing.\n\n  In the last century, we faced ethical controversies over organ \ntransplantation, my field: Who would receive a scarce organ? What are \nthe criteria to determine brain death? We had ethical\n\n[[Page S7568]]\n\ndiscussions and ethical controversies over blood transfusions: Who \nreceives blood transfusions? What are the indications? We also faced \nethical dilemmas over genetic therapy.\n  Well, the 21st century, the current century, brings even more \nprofound ethical questions, and they are going to come with increasing \nfrequency. How we and humanity handle our gathering control over these \nmysteries of cell development and embryo development will reflect who \nwe are as a people and where we are going.\n  Today, the Senate will begin debate on these three important pieces \nof legislation: the Alternative Pluripotent Stem Cell Therapies \nEnhancement Act, from Senators Santorum and Specter; the Fetus Farming \nProhibition Act of 2006, Senators Santorum and Brownback; and the Stem \nCell Research Enhancement Act, the so-called--in the House--Castle-\nDeGette bill, and in the Senate, the Specter-Hatch bill.\n  Many of my colleagues have, like me, spent hours grappling with these \nissues: the future of stem cell research, how we balance pro-life \npositions with the potential for new life and health offered by stem \ncell research. There is, perhaps, an inclination to avoid such \ndifficult issues, to ignore them and to let others debate, but I have \ncome to realize we must participate in defining research surrounding \nthe culture of life. If not, it will define us.\n  Five years ago, on July 18, 2001, I came to the Chamber and laid out \na comprehensive proposal to promote stem cell research within an \nethical framework. I proposed 10 specific interdependent principles. I \nalso said that policymakers and the public must reassess on an ongoing \nbasis the research and the circumstances under which it is conducted \nbecause science will continue to advance. As the 21st century \nprogresses and as science--developmental biology--advances, we will \ncontinually face moral and ethical challenges. It is our \nresponsibility, as individuals and as a body politic, to reassess the \nconstructs governing biomedical research. It will define us. That is \nwhy I brought cord legislation to the floor earlier in the year, and it \nwas passed.\n  As I said then and as I believe now, we must also do all we can to \npursue other alternative strategies that will hold potential for \ndeveloping pluripotent stem cell lines without damaging or destroying \nnascent human life. That is why, in the package before us today, I have \nasked the Senate to consider legislation to enhance support for \nalternatives to embryonic stem cell research. I am extremely pleased \nthat Senator Santorum and Senator Specter worked together to craft the \nAlternative Pluripotent Stem Cell Therapies Enhancement Act. Their bill \nis similar to legislation I worked on with Senator Isakson and others \nof our colleagues last year, and I encourage every Senator to support \nit.\n  This bill would fund alternative methods of potentially deriving \npluripotent stem cells, including extracting from embryos that are no \nlonger living, nonlethal and nonharmful extraction from embryos; \nextraction from artificially created organisms that are not embryos but \nare embryo-like; and reprogramming adult cells to a pluripotent state \nthrough fusion with embryonic cell lines. There is no reason this \nlegislation shouldn't gather the support of every Member of this body. \nIt should unify us.\n  The second bill we will consider is the Fetus Farming Prohibition Act \nof 2006. Specifically, the bill prohibits the implantation and \ngestation of an embryo in a human or animal for the purpose of aborting \nfor research--the manufacture of human life for experimental purposes. \nSenators Brownback and Santorum have proposed legislation that would \ndraw a clear line which should not be crossed. This is a forward-\nleaning pro-life bill, a moral guardrail in place before any inducement \nexists to promote it.\n  Shortly after I originally outlined my principles 5 years ago, \nPresident Bush announced his policy on embryonic stem cell research. It \nfederally funded embryonic stem cell research for the first time. It \ndid so within an ethical framework, and it showed respect for human \nlife.\n  President Bush and I do not differ about the need for strong \nguidelines governing stem cell research. His policy was generally \nconsistent with the principles I set forth a month before his \nannouncement back in 2001. However, as science has progressed over the \nlast 5 years, we have learned that fewer than the anticipated number of \ncell lines have proved suitable for research, and I think the limit on \ncell lines available for federally funded research is too restrictive.\n  H.R. 810, the Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act, addresses this \nrestriction in our current policy. It has many shortcomings, but it is \nclearly consistent with my fifth principle on stem cell research: \n``Provide funding for embryonic stem cell research only from \nblastocysts that would otherwise be discarded.'' In fact, the bill \napplies what I proposed in 2001 verbatim. It allows Federal funding for \nresearch using only those embryonic stem cells derived from blastocysts \nthat are left over after in vitro fertilization and would otherwise be \ndiscarded.\n\n  Mr. President, in closing, all three of the bills the Senate will \naddress beginning at 12:30 today will raise profound ethical questions \nthat are challenging. They merit serious dialogue, and they merit \nserious debate. That is why I am pleased that on an issue of this \nmagnitude, Senators will have the opportunity over the next 2 days to \nhave their ideas considered and voted on separately and cleanly.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, am I correct that we are now in a period of \nmorning business?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 3 \nminutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/07/17/senate-section/article/S7568-1", "month": "07", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7568-S7569]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 ISRAEL\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I rise again today to discuss the situation \nin the Middle East where our Israeli allies are fighting unprovoked \naggression by a terrorist army on their border. To date, over 1,000 \nrockets and missiles have been fired into Israel, killing more than a \ndozen civilians. It was especially disturbing to hear that the missile \nwhich collapsed a three-story building in Haifa earlier today was a \nSyrian model, loaded with ball bearings to cause maximum civilian \ncasualties.\n  At a time when one of our closest allies is threatened by \nindiscriminate attacks on its population centers and our President and \nSecretary of State are overseas, it is incumbent on this body to remain \nunited in standing behind Israel. I am pleased that the leadership is \ndrafting a resolution expressing bipartisan condemnation of Hezbollah's \nattacks and in support of Israel's right to respond in the name of \nself-defense.\n  I am pleased that our allies, too, understand the grave nature of \nthis crisis and its origins. The joint statement released over the \nweekend by the G8 states unequivocally that this violence:\n\n       Results from efforts by extremist forces to destabilize the \n     region and to frustrate the aspirations of the Palestinian, \n     Israeli, and Lebanese people for democracy and peace. These \n     extremist elements and those that support them cannot be \n     allowed to plunge the Middle East into chaos, and a wider \n     conflict.\n\n  Even some Arab governments, including Saudi Arabia, Egypt, and \nJordan, took the commendable step of chastising Hezbollah for its \n``unexpected, inappropriate, and irresponsible acts.''\n  In light of the chaos being precipitated by Hezbollah's rocket and \nmissile capability--a capability being provided directly to Hezbollah \nby the governments of Syria and Iran--I thought it would be appropriate \nto take a moment today to talk about how that threat can be addressed. \nThe estimated 13,000 missiles currently in Hezbollah's arsenal are \nhidden throughout Southern Lebanon, in private homes, caves, and \nfactories. At present, the only way to destroy these systems is to \nsearch them out on foot--a risky and potentially provocative solution. \nAlternatively, Israeli forces can strike at missile launchers after \nthey have fired, meaning that at least one salvo will already be en \nroute. It would be a vast improvement if Israel had the option of \nneutralizing the Hezbollah threat through defensive, rather than \noffensive means.\n\n[[Page S7569]]\n\n  Israel currently has access to Patriot and Arrow missile defense \ntechnologies, great systems which are critical for defending against \nlonger-range missiles, but poorly suited to defend Israeli territory \nfrom the types of rockets and missiles currently being fired by \nHezbollah.\n  It is for this reason that I support the U.S. Missile Defense Agency \nefforts--in cooperation with the Israeli Missile Defense Organization--\nto develop a system for short-range missile defense. Aimed at \nprojectiles with a range of less than 200 kilometers, this system would \nprovide Israel with another way to defend itself, rather than having to \nrely exclusively on offensive action. It is propitious that the Defense \nAppropriations Committee is marking up its bill this week. For more \nthan a year, I have worked with Senators Stevens and Inouye to support \nthe short-range missile defense program. Under their leadership, I \nbelieve that the committee will provide the investment necessary to \naccelerate fielding of the system. Unfortunately, the need for a \nredoubled effort is now clearer than ever.\n  We still do not know how the current crisis is going to end. What we \ncan and should say, however, is that Israel has the full support of \nthis body in its ongoing efforts to fight terrorists, protect its \ncitizens, and create the circumstances for peaceful coexistence with \nLebanon, and all of its neighbors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/07/17/senate-section/article/S7569-1", "month": "07", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7569]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    ORDER FOR STAR PRINT--H.R. 5672\n\n  Mr. KYL.

Under the previous order, the hour \nof 12:30 having arrived, the Senate will proceed to the consideration \nof S. 3504, S. 2754, and H.R. 810, en bloc, which the clerk will \nreport.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 810) to amend the Public Health Service Act to \n     provide for human embryonic stem cell research.\n       A bill (S. 3504) to amend the Public Health Service Act to \n     prohibit the solicitation or acceptance of tissue from \n     fetuses gestated for research purposes, and for other \n     purposes.\n       A bill (S. 2754) to derive human pluripotent stem cell \n     lines using techniques that do not knowingly harm embryos.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I may use \nthis hourglass during the course of the debate.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, it is difficult to characterize the \nimportance of the debate which the Senate is now beginning because the \nmost fundamental aspect of human life is our health. Without our \nhealth, there is nothing we can do. Medical research has performed \nwonders, and stem cells, which came upon the scene in November of 1998, \nhave the most remarkable potential of any scientific discovery ever \nmade with respect to human health. These stem cells have the capacity \nto regenerate disease cells in the human body and have the capacity to \ncure maladies of all sorts, including cancer, heart disease, \nParkinson's, Alzheimer's, spinal cord--the long litany of maladies \nwhich confront mankind.\n  The stem cell debate began with the hearings conducted by the \nAppropriations Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, which \nI chair and on which Senator Tom Harkin is ranking member. We began \nthose hearings within days of the November 1998 announcement and have \nhad some 18 hearings on stem cells to explore all ramifications of the \npotential of stem cells.\n  There is now an avalanche of evidence that the use of stem cells in \nscientific research has boundless potential. The state of the law is \nthat federal funding may only be used for a limited number of obsolete \nstem cell lines.\n  The bill which is the fundamental issue before the Senate today is \nH.R. 810, which Senator Harkin and I introduced as a Senate bill with \nsome 42 cosponsors, which would allow research on embryonic stem cells.\n  There are two other bills at issue. One is S. 2754 which Senator \nSantorum and I have introduced which relates to long-range research not \ninvolving the embryos, but it is totally separate and distinct from \nH.R. 810 in that it does not have the potential that the embryonic stem \ncells have and it is long range.\n  The third bill is S. 3504 which relates to fetus farming prohibition, \nand I believe there will be little controversy about this bill. The \nbill would deal with two unethical activities--the solicitation or \nacceptance of human fetal tissue knowing that a pregnancy was \ndeliberately initiated to provide such tissue and the solicitation or \nacceptance of tissues or cells from a human embryo or fetus that was \ngestated in the uterus of a nonhuman animal. I believe there will be no \ncontest about that.\n\n  I expect relatively little contest about S. 2754, which does not in \nany way relate to the importance of research on embryonic stem cells.\n  The embryonic stem cells are used from many embryos which have been \ncreated for in vitro fertilization. Customarily, a dozen or so are \ncreated, maybe three or four are used, and the others are then frozen \nand ultimately will be discarded. There are some 400,000 of those \nembryos which are frozen today, and the likelihood of their being used \nis nil.\n  Senator Harkin and I introduced legislation to provide for Federal \nfunding to encourage adoption of these embryos. If they could be used \nto create human life, I would not in the remotest way contend that they \nought to be used for scientific research. But the fact is that they \nwill either be used for scientific research or thrown away.\n  When the issue of adoption was raised, as I say, we took the lead in \nthe Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education Subcommittee in the \nyear 2002 and appropriated $1 million and since then have appropriated \nmore in succeeding years.\n  As of May 31, 2006, the Snow Flake Organization, one of the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services' embryonic adoption grantees, \nhad a news conference announcing that there had been 100 births since \n1997. As of May 31, 2006, the National Embryo Donation Center had a \ntotal of 28 deliveries or ongoing pregnancies. Out of the 400,000, even \nwith Federal funding available to encourage adoption, the number is \n128, which makes it conclusive that these 400,000 embryos will either \nbe used for scientific research or thrown away.\n  The bill which Senator Harkin and I have introduced is very carefully \nstructured to be sure that it satisfies the strictest ethical scrutiny.\n  This is the essence of the bill: first, that the stem cells were \noriginally created for fertility treatment purposes; second, are in \nexcess of the clinical need; third, the individual seeking fertility \ntreatments for whom the embryos were created has determined that the \nembryos will not be implanted in a woman; fourth, they will be \notherwise discarded; and fifth, the individual for whom embryos were \ncreated has provided written consent for embryo adoption.\n  This bill does not allow Federal funds to be used for the derogation \nof stem cell lines, a step in the process where the embryo is \ndestroyed--the lines are created and the embryos are destroyed before \nthey are subjected to research which is funded by the Federal \nGovernment under the bill which Senator Harkin and I are promoting.\n\n[[Page S7570]]\n\n  The evidence of the utility of these embryonic stem cells is \nunquestioned, and the need for more stem cell lines similarly is \nunquestioned.\n  On August 9, 2001, President Bush made an Executive determination to \nallow Federal research on some 60 existing stem cell lines. It was \nlater determined that there might be as many as 70 lines. It has since \nbeen determined that there are no more than 20 lines, and perhaps even \nfewer. These existing lines are tainted with mouse feeder cells, which \nis a technical consideration that they can't be used.\n  The experts in the field: Dr. Nabel, Director of the National \nInstitutes of Health (NIH) Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, focused on \nthe unavailability of stem cells for research, noting that only four \nstem cell lines are currently in common use.\n  The enormous advantages of stem cells were outlined in some detail by \nthe various Directors of the NIH.\n  Dr. Zerhouni, Director, NIH, said:\n\n       Embryonic stem cell research holds great promise for \n     treating, curing, and improving our understanding of disease, \n     as well as revealing important basic mechanisms involved in \n     cell differentiation and development.\n\n  Dr. Fauci, Director of the National Institute of Allergy and \nInfectious Diseases, said:\n\n       NIAID believes that embryonic stem cell research could be \n     advanced by the availability of additional cell lines. \n     Individual stem cell lines have unique properties. Thus, we \n     may be limiting our ability to achieve the full range of \n     potential therapeutic applications of embryonic stem cells by \n     restricting research to the relatively small number of lines \n     currently available.\n\n  Dr. Battey, Director of the Deafness Institute, said:\n\n       The more stem cell lines available for study the more \n     likely a cell line will be maximally useful for a given \n     research, and potentially clinical, application . . . the \n     scientific community would be best served by having a greater \n     number of human embryonic stem cell lines available for \n     study.\n\n  Dr. Nabel, the director of the Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, \nsaid:\n\n        . . . we recognize that the limitations of existing cell \n     lines are hindering scientific progress among a community \n     that is very eager to move forward in this promising area. We \n     support the creation of dissemination of newer stem cell \n     lines in the expectation that it will advance this field and \n     hasten progress in basic and clinical research.\n\n  Similar opinions were articulated by Dr. Tabak, director of the \nDental Institute; by Dr. Volkow, director of the National Institute of \nDrug Abuse; by Dr. Collins of the Human Genome Institute; by Dr. \nNeiderhuber, director of the Cancer Institute; by Dr. Rodgers, acting \ndirector of the Diabetes and Digestive Disease Institute; by Dr. \nLandis, director of the Neurology Institute; by Dr. Berg, director of \nthe General Medical Sciences Institute; by Dr. Alexander, director of \nthe Child Health Institute; by Dr. Sieving, director of the Eye \nInstitute; by Dr. Schwartz, director of the Environmental Health \nInstitute; by Dr. Hodes, director of the Aging Institute; by Dr. Li, \ndirector of the Alcohol Abuse Institute; by Dr. Alving, acting director \nof the Center for Research Resources. All concur with the need for \nadditional stem cell lines for research in dealing with the maladies in \ntheir own particular area.\n  By way of a strictly personal note, I had a little root canal work \ndone this morning. The dentist asked me what was going on in the Senate \ntoday. I told him about stem cell research. He said: I hope you win \nyour case because it will help us on root canal work. The embryonic \nstem cells can be injected into the canal with the diseased tissue, and \nyou can have a third set of teeth.\n  Wherever I turn, people in the medical research field--and I regret I \nhave had a lot contacts--extol the enormous virtues of stem cells--that \nthey have the capacity to replace diseased cells. If you deal with a \nheart problem and you have a diseased area, the stem cells can be \ninjected. These embryonic stem cells have remarkable flexibility and \ncapacity to provide a healthy cell to replace the diseased cell.\n  We have had remarkable articulation of support from Members of the \nSenate, as well as Members of the U.S. House of Representatives. The \nHouse bill was passed with a comfortable margin, with some 50 \nRepublicans crossing party lines. In the Senate, we have many Senators \nwho are most actively known in the pro-life community, and while they \nwould not make a woman's right to choose available, they do actively \nsupport stem cell research. It is important to focus on the difference \nthat being against a woman's right to choose has nothing to do with the \nissue of stem cell research. They are entirely separate.\n  Authors of the June 4, 2004, letter to the President on stem cell \nresearch include some of the strongest pro-life Senators in our body, \nincluding Senator Orrin Hatch, Senator Gordon Smith, Senator Lamar \nAlexander, Senator Thad Cochran, Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison, Senator \nTrent Lott, Senator John McCain, and Senator John Warner. There is \nevery expectation there will be more Senators from the strong pro-life \ncommunity who will be supporting embryonic stem cell research.\n  We have support from two of our colleagues who were very active on \nthe pro-life side, former Senator John Danforth and former Senator Ben \nNighthorse Campbell.\n  On the strictly personal level, I have noted the declaration by \nPresident Nixon in 1970 when he declared war on cancer. Had that war \nbeen pursued with the same diligence we pursue other wars, I believe \ncancer would long ago have been cured. Without unduly dwelling on my \nown situation with Hodgkin's, a year of chemotherapy, I think had the \nresearch been fulfilled, I would have been spared that malady.\n  The maladies such as heart disease, cancer, Parkinson's, and \nAlzheimer's disease strike approximately 110 million Americans a year. \nWe all know people close to us who have been stricken with cancer or \nheart failure. My own chief of staff, Carey Lackman, a beautiful young \nwoman of 48, was stricken with breast cancer and died 2 years ago. My \nson's law partner, Paula Klein, a beautiful woman with two young \nchildren, age 55, died of breast cancer. A Federal judge, Edward R. \nBecker, well known to the Senate for his active work for more than 2 \nyears on asbestos legislation, died in May 2006 from prostate cancer \nwhich had metastasized. Those are anecdotal, typical of tens of \nthousands, hundreds of thousands of people who have died or are \nincapacitated from diseases which could be cured with stem cell \nresearch. It is not only the individuals who contract the maladies, it \nis their families. It is their loved ones.\n\n  President Reagan's wife, Mrs. Nancy Reagan, who is a very nonpublic \nretiring person, has taken a public stand in support of embryonic stem \ncell research because of the understanding and impact on her life when \nPresident Reagan had Alzheimer's and she had to care for and watch her \nhusband suffer from that malady. We have had very extensive indicators, \nevidence, that stem cell research could delay the onset of Alzheimer's \nand, perhaps, cure it entirely.\n  The conflict which we have on this issue between ideology and science \nis one which mankind has faced repeatedly in the course of our \nhistorical experience. A century from now, people will look back at \nthis debate on stem cell research and wonder how we cannot possibly \nutilize all of the benefits of science to stop people from dying, to \nstop people from suffering, when we have these embryos which are either \ngoing to be thrown away or used. They are not going to create living \npeople. If they were, no one would be suggesting they be used for \nscientific research.\n  There are a number of striking examples of rejection of scientific \nknowledge at various stages in our human history which, in retrospect, \nare absurd. For example, in 1486, a committee of the Spanish Government \nconcluded that the voyage proposed by Christopher Columbus should not \nbe funded because ``the Western Ocean is infinite and perhaps \nunnavigable . . . [and] . . . so many centuries after the Creation, it \nwas unlikely anyone could find hitherto unknown lands of any value.''\n  Fortunately, Queen Isabella, disagreed.\n  Galileo was imprisoned for his support of Copernicus' theory that the \nplanets revolved around the Sun. This allowed the acceptance of a \ntheory upon which all of modern astronomy and space travel are based \nand what we know from our own experience in the solar system.\n  Michael Servetus has research on human anatomy. Pope Boniface VII \nbanned the practice of cadaver dissection in the 1200s. This stopped \nthe practice for over 300 years and greatly\n\n[[Page S7571]]\n\nslowed the accumulation of education regarding human anatomy. Finally, \nin the 1500s, Michael Servetus used cadaver dissection to study blood \ncirculation. He was tried and imprisoned by the Catholic Church.\n  Anesthesia for women in labor was founded by James Simpson in 1848. \nReporting his discovery that anesthesia could be used to lessen pain \nduring child birth, the Scottish Calvinist Church objected to the use \nof anesthesia during labor because ``pain of child birth was God's \nwill.'' The Scottish Calvinist Church stifled anesthesia use by \nrefusing to baptize any children who were born while a person was \nanesthetized.\n  Thomas Edison, who brought electricity to us, had a similar \nexperience. The Committee on Lighting by Electricity in the British \nHouse of Commons did not believe that electricity was practical, \nsaying:\n\n       There is not the slightest chance of [electricity] \n     competing, in any general way, with gas. There are defects \n     about the electric light which, unless essential changes take \n     place, must entirely prevent its application to ordinary \n     lighting purposes.\n\n  Fortunately, that view did not prevail. Fortunately, since it is 102 \ndegrees today and we have an air-conditioned Senate Chamber.\n  Vaccines, in 1772, in response to the new science of vaccination, \nRev. Edward Massey declared:\n\n       Diseases are sent by Providence for the punishment of sin, \n     and the proposed attempt to prevent them is a diabolical \n     operation.\n\n  Had vaccines been outlawed, millions of lives would have been lost.\n  In the 1820s, Dr. Dionysus Lardner, Professor of Natural Philosophy \nand Astronomy at University College, London, stated, referring to rail \ntravel:\n\n       Rail travel at high speed is not possible because \n     passengers, unable to breathe, would die of asphyxia.\n\n  If it were true, I would not be here today. I would have had to find \nanother way than rail travel to come from Philadelphia to arrive in \ntime for this debate.\n  I go through this list, and it is only an abbreviation of a much \nlonger list to show how attitudes at different times in retrospect look \nfoolish, look absolutely ridiculous.\n  When we see in our everyday existence the enormous suffering from so \nmany maladies, there is just no sensible, logical reason why we should \nnot make use of stem cell research.\n  When I joined the Subcommittee on Health and Human Services in 1981, \nthe budget for the National Institutes of Health (NIH) was a little \nover $3 billion. With the leadership of that subcommittee, those funds \nhave now been increased to almost $29 billion annually. We are being \noutstripped by other countries which are undertaking embryonic stem \ncell research. They are taking our scientists. We have the capacity \nwith the NIH and the Federal funding to make enormous additional \nprogress on medical research to save lives, to save pain and suffering. \nWe ought to do so. We ought to pass the Specter-Harkin bill--the \nSenate's version of the House-passed bill--and seek to persuade the \nPresident of the United States that this is a bill which ought to be \nsigned into law.\n  I know my 30 minutes is up, so I yield to my distinguished colleague \nfrom Iowa, Senator Tom Harkin.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burr). The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, first, I congratulate Senator Specter on \nan exemplary opening statement on this 2-day debate we will be engaged \nin and also thank him, as I will in my formal statement, for his \nleadership over the past several years on so many issues of health \ncare, and this one in particular. I am proud to join him in this \neffort, as I have for the last year, to try to get H.R. 810 to come up.\n  Mr. President, we have waited a long time for this day to come, I \nthink too long. We could have and should have voted on H.R. 810 more \nthan a year ago after it passed in the House with a strong bipartisan \nmajority. So we have lost some valuable time. But more to the point, \nAmerica's best medical researchers have lost valuable time. But be that \nas it may, H.R. 810 has finally come to the Senate floor, and we will \nvote on it tomorrow afternoon.\n  I thank majority leader Bill Frist for brokering the agreement to \nmake this vote possible. It took courage for him to announce last \nsummer that he supports the bill. And it took courage for him to \nschedule this vote. I have already commended him privately, and I \ncommend him publicly as well.\n  Again, I thank Senator Specter for leading the effort to promote stem \ncell research for so many years. He chaired the very first hearing in \nCongress on embryonic stem cells, as he said in his remarks, in \nDecember of 1998. And, again, just repeating what Senator Specter had \nsaid--but for the sake of emphasis--our Labor, Health, and Human \nServices Appropriations Subcommittee has held 18 hearings on this \nresearch since then.\n  Senator Specter and I also introduced the very first bill in Congress \non stem cell research in January of 2000. So Senator Specter and I have \ntraveled a long road together, and I thank him for being such an \nextraordinary leader and partner in this effort.\n  I also thank the other Senate leaders on stem cell research: Senator \nHatch, Senator Feinstein, Senator Smith, and Senator Kennedy. Counting \nSenator Specter and myself, there are three Republicans and three \nDemocrats on the list who have led the effort to bring up H.R. 810 and \npass it, and it has been a truly bipartisan effort all the way.\n  Most of all, I thank the hundreds of thousands of families and \npatients who never gave up, who kept up the pressure to bring this bill \nto the floor, and who are so eager to see H.R. 810 sent to the \nPresident's desk for his signature. They have kept the faith. Now it is \nour job to see they are not disappointed.\n  Under the UC agreement, we will debate and vote on three bills. But \nmake no mistake, the only one that really matters is H.R. 810, the Stem \nCell Research Enhancement Act. This is the one bill that, at long last, \nwill unleash some of the most exciting and promising research of modern \ntimes.\n  So, as we begin this debate, it is a good time to step back and ask: \nWhy is there so much support for H.R. 810? Hundreds of patient advocacy \ngroups have endorsed the bill; so have dozens of Nobel Prize winning \nscientists, dozens of research universities, and, I might add, so has \nthe American public. Polls now show that 72 percent of Americans \nsupport embryonic stem cell research--72 percent--compared with 24 \npercent who oppose it. That is a 3-to-1 margin. So the American \npeople--three out of four--are in favor of embryonic stem cell \nresearch.\n  Why? Well, the answer is very simple. Embryonic stem cell research \noffers real hope--real hope--for people with Lou Gehrig's disease, real \nhope for people with Parkinson's, real hope for people with spinal cord \ninjuries, real hope for people with heart disease, real hope for people \nwith diabetes, real hope for people with cancer, real hope for people \nwho suffer from autoimmune diseases such as lupus. All told, more than \n100 million Americans have diseases that one day could be treated or \ncured with embryonic stem cell research. Here is just a brief list of \nthem: cardiovascular disease, autoimmune disease, Alzheimer's, \nParkinson's, spinal cord injuries, birth defects, severe burns--\nmillions of Americans who could be cured or helped with stem cell \nresearch.\n  But it is not just Members of Congress who are saying it; we have \nasked top scientists. Senator Specter and I sent letters to the \nNational Institutes of Health last week. Senator Specter referred to \nthat in his remarks. We asked their top scientists for their thoughts \non stem cell research. Every single one of them said embryonic stem \ncell research offers enormous potential. We asked 19 NIH scientists--\nheads of the different individual institutes--and all 19 agreed.\n  Here is what Dr. Zerhouni, the NIH director, wrote to us:\n\n       Embryonic stem cell research holds great promise for \n     treating, curing, and improving our understanding of disease.\n\n  This is from Dr. Elizabeth Nabel, the director of the Heart, Lung, \nand Blood Institute. She wrote:\n\n       Embryonic stem cell research has vast potential for \n     addressing critical health [care] needs.\n\n  And it is not just NIH scientists who believe this way. In a letter \nfrom Dr. J. Michael Bishop, who won the Nobel Prize in medicine in \n1989, he writes:\n\n       The vast majority of the biomedical research community \n     believes that human embryonic stem cells are likely to be the \n     source of key discoveries related to many debilitating \n     diseases.\n\n\n[[Page S7572]]\n\n\n  I could go on and on, but I think you get the picture. Scientists \nagree: embryonic stem cell research offers enormous hope--real hope--\nfor easing human suffering.\n  Now, some may ask: I thought the Federal Government already supports \nembryonic stem cell research. What about the speech the President gave \n5 years ago?\n  Well, let me try to explain the President's policy as was enunciated \n5 years ago. He gave the speech on August 9, 2001. I remember it well. \nI was listening to it. I was on the road. I was listening to it on the \nradio.\n  The President, at that time, said that federally funded scientists \ncould conduct research on embryonic stem cells only if the stem cells \nhad been derived prior to 9 p.m., August 9, 2001. Well, I thought to \nmyself at the time--and I have thought since--that is rather odd. It is \nmorally OK to do research on stem cells derived before 9 p.m., but it \nis not morally acceptable to do research on stem cells derived after 9 \np.m.? Well, I thought to myself, why not 9:05? What about 9:15 p.m. or \n9:30 or midnight? Why was 9 p.m. the magic cutoff hour on August 9, \n2001?\n  Well, clearly it was totally arbitrary. That just happened to be when \nthe President gave his speech. But for whatever reason, the President \nsaid only those lines derived by 9 p.m. August 9, 2001, were eligible \nfor federally funded research.\n\n  At the time, after I checked into it, some of us were hopeful that \nthe policy would work. But it has not, and here is why. When President \nBush announced his policy, he said 78 stem cell lines were available. \nMany people thought 78 stem cell lines might be enough, might have \nenough genetic diversity to actually do the kind of research we needed. \nBut as the years progressed, we found that only 21--only 21--of the \napproved lines are actually available for study; not 78, only 21.\n  We found out something else I did not know at the time. All 21 of \nthese lines are contaminated by mouse cells. In other words, the \nembryonic stem cells were grown on mouse cells, so they are \ncontaminated, making it highly unlikely ever to be used for any kind of \nhuman therapy. I ask: Would any of you want to have stem cells used for \nyour illness if they were contaminated with mouse cells? I do not think \nso, and neither do the scientists. And the other thing we found out is \nthat now many of the 21 lines are too unhealthy to use. They have \nactually become sick.\n  Dr. Nabel of the NIH Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute wrote to me \nthat only four of these lines are in common use--four. Dr. Jeremy Berg, \nanother NIH director, director of the general medical sciences, said \nthere are about six lines in common use.\n  So what is happening now is that these policy restrictions are making \nour scientists work with one arm tied behind their back. It is having a \nchilling impact on scientists thinking about entering the field.\n  Dr. Nora Volkow, director of the NIH Drug Abuse Institute, said it is \nstifling interest in research. She said:\n\n       Despite general interest and enthusiasm in the scientific \n     community for embryonic stem cell research, the limited \n     number of available lines has translated into a general lack \n     of research proposals.\n\n  Well, if you are a research scientist at one of our hundreds of \nuniversities around the country, and you are eligible for NIH funding, \nwould you want to do research on only four lines that may not lead to \nanything? Would you put in a proposal to do that? You could be one of \nour budding genius researchers. You might want to put your efforts and \nendeavors into something else rather than a dead-end policy.\n  So I submit that the President's policy is not a way forward, it is a \ndead-end street. It offers only false hope--false hope; not real hope, \nfalse hope--to the millions of people across America and the world who \nare suffering from diseases that could be cured or treated through \nembryonic stem cell research.\n  Meanwhile, hundreds of new stem cell lines have been derived since \nthe President's arbitrary deadline of August 9, 2001. These lines are \nuncontaminated. They are healthy. But they are totally off limits to \nfederally funded scientists. I do not mean just scientists who work at \nNIH; I am talking about all the scientists who work in all of our \nuniversities and research institutions across America. They are off \nlimits--off limits. They cannot use it. It is really a shame.\n  I was listening to Senator Specter earlier talk about some of the \nearlier pronouncements, some by the Catholic Church, back in the Middle \nAges, some by--he mentioned another Calvinist Church--I don't know who \nall he mentioned--but the views at that time and how we look back and \nsay: How could they have been so blind to prohibit certain activities, \nsuch as using cadavers for scientific experimentation to learn how the \nbody works so we could perhaps cure illnesses and diseases?\n  I was listening to that, and I thought: We have new stem cell lines, \nuncontaminated with mouse feeder cells, healthy, ready to go. \nScientists cannot use them. And I thought: We do not require \nastronomers today to explore the skies with 19th century telescopes. We \ndo not tell our geologists to study the Earth with a tape measure. If \nwe are serious about realizing the promise of stem cell research, our \nscientists need access to the best stem cell lines available.\n  And, again, I would not want anyone to take just my word for it. I \nthink Dr. James Battey knows more about stem cell research than anyone \nat the National Institutes of Health. He runs the stem cell task force \nthere, and this is what he wrote when I asked him whether it would help \nour scientists to have access to more stem cell lines. Here is his \ndirect quote:\n\n       The more cell lines available for study, the more likely a \n     cell line will be maximally useful for a given research, and \n     potentially clinical, application. For this reason, the \n     scientific community would be best served by having a greater \n     number of human embryonic stem cell lines available for \n     study.\n\n  That is from a letter to me from Dr. James Battey, chair of the NIH \nStem Cell Task Force, dated July 13, 2006.\n  Dr. Volkow of the Drug Abuse Institute was even more blunt. She \nwrote:\n\n       Access to a wider array of embryonic stem cell lines would \n     definitely increase scientific opportunity and the chances of \n     breakthrough discoveries.\n\n  I should note that scientists in many other countries around the \nworld do not face these kinds of arbitrary restrictions. When you talk \nto researchers in England, for example, our policy makes no sense to \nthem. They cannot understand why stem cell lines derived on one date \nare fine to use, but if they are derived on another date they are off \nlimits. They do not have arbitrary barriers like that in England, and \nthat is a big reason so many of the major advances in stem cell \nresearch are happening there rather than in the United States.\n  So we need a stem cell policy in this country that offers real, \nmeaningful hope to patients and their loved ones. That is what H.R. 810 \nwould provide.\n  Under this bill, federally funded researchers could study any stem \ncell line regardless of the date it was derived as long as strict \nethical guidelines are met. I think it is important to run through some \nof those ethical guidelines.\n  First, the only way a stem cell line could be eligible for federally \nfunded research is if it were derived from an embryo that was otherwise \ngoing to be discarded. As Senator Specter pointed out, there are more \nthan 400,000 embryos in the United States left over from fertility \ntreatments that are currently sitting frozen in storage. The moms and \ndads have had all the children they want; they no longer need any more \nof these embryos, and most of them will be discarded. It happens every \nsingle day at fertility clinics around the country. People have used in \nvitro fertilization, had their children, and they don't want any more. \nRather than continue to pay the facility to store them and freeze them, \nthey call up and say we don't want them anymore. The facility discards \nthem. It happens every day.\n  All we are saying is, instead of discarding them as leftover embryos, \nlet's allow couples, if they wish, to donate them to create stem cell \nlines that can cure diseases and save lives. The choice is this: Throw \nthem away or use them to ease suffering and, hopefully, cure diseases.\n  It is the second choice that I believe is truly moral and truly \nrespectful of human life. Again, I have to emphasize, as I will today \nand tomorrow time and time again, H.R. 810 does not create any new \nembryos. Not one new embryo will be created under H.R. 810--only\n\n[[Page S7573]]\n\nthose left over in in vitro fertilization clinics, and only if the moms \nand dads give their written consent.\n  As I said, the second ethical requirement requires them to provide \ninformed written consent. Again, a lot of people don't realize this, \nbut the President's policy is a little fuzzy on the matter of informed \nand written consent. Some of the 21 federally approved lines--\nespecially those coming from other countries--don't meet that \nrequirement. So we need to pass H.R. 810 to tighten the ethical \nguidelines on stem cell research, so there is no question that the \nembryos were donated voluntarily.\n  Finally, H.R. 810 prohibits anyone from being paid to donate embryos. \nThere is no chance under this bill that women could be exploited to go \nthrough the donation process against their will. So no money can change \nhands. The three ethical guidelines, to repeat, are: One, we can only \nuse excess embryos in in vitro fertilization clinics; second, there \nmust be informed written consent for the donation of those embryos; and \nthird, no money can exchange hands to pay for any of these.\n  Let me address one more issue, and that is the matter of the so-\ncalled alternative ways of deriving stem cells. Some opponents of this \nwill speak today and tomorrow and argue that we don't need to pass H.R. \n810. Instead, they say, we should put our current stem cell research on \nhold in hopes that some new way of deriving stem cells will pan out \nsome time, hopefully, in the future.\n  That would be a tragic mistake. I support any ethical means to \nimprove the lives of human beings who are suffering. In fact, Senator \nSpecter and I included language in our appropriations bill last year \nurging NIH to support research on alternative ways of deriving stem \ncells. But not one of these so-called alternative methods has ever \nsucceeded in producing a stem cell line. Right now, they are just \ntheories. Maybe one day, 5 years or 7 years or 10 years or 15 years \nfrom now, one of these methods will pan out. But maybe not.\n  I think this chart tells the story. The NIH estimates that there are \nabout 400 stem cell lines worldwide, almost all of which were derived \nafter the President's arbitrary cutoff date of August 9, 2001. Every \none of these lines was derived the same way, using embryos that were \nleft over from infertility treatments that would otherwise have been \ndiscarded. So you see on the chart ``stem cell lines derived using \ncurrent method,'' and we have about 400 stem cell lines worldwide. Now, \nhow many lines were derived using unproven alternative methods? Zero. \nIt is 400 to zero.\n  Yet we will hear today and, I think, tomorrow from some who say we \nshould pass other bills. We should not use the proven method we have, \nbut we should go to alternative methodologies. We know right now that \nzero stem cell lines have been derived from using those alternative \nmethodologies.\n  Again, should we pursue these alternative methods? Of course. This is \nno prohibition against that. We should open every door we can in the \nethical pursuit to cures. But meanwhile, people we love are dying from \nParkinson's and ALS, and children are suffering from juvenile diabetes. \nShould we say wait another 5, 7, or 10 years and see if we can derive \nstem cells from these alternative methods? Maybe we can, maybe we \ncannot. If we cannot, what do we do then? Say the doors are all closed? \nMeanwhile, we have many stem cell lines derived from leftover embryos \nin in vitro fertilization clinics.\n\n  Another point about the alternatives bill. Even if Congress were to \npass it and the President signs it, it has absolutely no impact on the \nprogress of stem cell research. That is because the other bills we are \nvoting on here don't authorize anything NIH cannot do already. We had a \nhearing. Senator Santorum, the author of that bill, was at the hearing. \nWe had people from NIH. Senator Durbin was there and he asked the \nquestion:\n\n       Can you tell me whether S. 2754--\n\nwhich is another one of the companion bills we will be voting on \ntomorrow--\n\n     authorizes research on stem cells at the NIH that currently \n     is not permissible or legal?\n\n  Dr. James F. Battey at NIH said:\n\n       No, it does not.\n\n  That was on June 27 of this year. So the alternatives bill, S. 2754, \nmight not do any harm, but it doesn't do any good either. It just says, \nNIH, you can do what you can already do. Well, that is fine with me; I \nhave no problem with that. But don't be fooled into thinking that S. \n2754 somehow takes the place of H.R. 810. It doesn't.\n  That is one more reason we need to focus on H.R. 810.\n  In closing, my nephew Kelly is one of the millions of Americans whose \nhopes depend on stem cell research. He has been a quadriplegic for \nabout 27 years since suffering a spinal cord injury in a terrible \naccident while he was in the U.S. Navy and serving on an aircraft \ncarrier. Kelly's hope has been that sometime scientists will finally \nfind a way to mend his spinal cord so he can walk again. He has been \nfollowing very closely the whole issue of embryonic stem cell research. \nHis hope, like the hope of Christopher Reeve's, was--we all remember \nhim, our first ``Superman''; he fought so hard for embryonic stem cell \nresearch before he passed away. They both hoped embryonic stem cell \nresearch would lead to a breakthrough that would allow them to walk \nagain. Kelly asks all the time: When is the Senate going to vote on \nH.R. 810?\n  You know, we have seen the videos of mice whose spinal cords have \nbeen damaged so they could not walk and were treated with stem cells \nfrom other mice and they are now walking again. As Christopher Reeve \nonce said after reviewing the video of one of these white rats that \ncould not walk but was given stem cells and now was walking, ``Oh, to \nbe a rat.''\n  Well, after more than a year of prayers and pressure, my nephew Kelly \nand millions of other Americans suffering from disease and paralysis \nwill get their wish. I am optimistic that we have the 60 votes \nnecessary to pass H.R. 810 tomorrow and send it immediately to the \nPresident's desk. There are a lot of stories. I am sure we all have \nfamily stories such as my nephew's.\n  Here is a letter from the ALS Association--the Amyotrophic Lateral \nSclerosis Association, also called Lou Gehrig's Disease. It says, in \npart:\n\n       The advancement of stem cell research is vital for people \n     such as Roger Gould from Ames, IA. ALS has steadily eroded \n     Roger's ability to control muscle movement, limiting his \n     ability to speak, walk, move his arms, and lead the type of \n     life most all of us take for granted. Ultimately, the disease \n     will take his life. Stem cell research provides promise to \n     people such as Roger and his wife Cindy that one day an \n     effective treatment for ALS will be found. It also gives hope \n     to thousands of others that ALS no longer will mean death in \n     an average of 2 to 5 years after diagnosis; that one day we \n     may be able to prevent ALS from taking the lives of people \n     such as Rob Borsellino, a nationally recognized columnist \n     from Des Moines, IA, who lost his battle against ALS last \n     month, a year after his diagnosis.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that this letter be printed in the Record \nfollowing my statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, my time is up. Again, this is going to be \na good debate, a good airing of the issues. Tomorrow we will vote on \nthis bill and send it to the President. I am hopeful that the \nPresident, after reviewing it and looking at what happened in the \npast--the new things that have come to light because of the mouse \nfeeder cells and the contamination of those lines--will sign the bill \nand give real hope to millions of Americans.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                                           The Amyotrophic Lateral\n\n\n                                        Sclerosis Association,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 12, 2006.\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators: The ALS Association (ALSA) strongly supports \n     the Senate's consideration of legislation to advance stem \n     cell research. We are grateful for the bipartisan efforts of \n     Senators to bring this important issue up for a vote before \n     the August Congressional recess and are particularly \n     appreciative of the leadership on this issue demonstrated by \n     Majority Leader Bill Frist (R-TN) and Senator Tom Harkin (D-\n     IA).\n       We understand that the Senate will consider three different \n     stem cell initiatives during the week of July 17. We strongly \n     urge the Senate to pass all three proposals, including H.R. \n     810, the Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act. These \n     initiatives, and H.R. 810 in particular, provide our nation \n     with the best opportunity to fully explore the promise\n\n[[Page S7574]]\n\n     of stem cell research and the hope that it may lead to a \n     treatment and cure for ALS.\n       The ALS Association is the only national voluntary health \n     association dedicated solely to the fight against Amyotrophic \n     Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), more commonly known as Lou Gehrig's \n     disease. Our mission is to improve the quality of life for \n     those living with ALS and to discover a treatment and cure \n     for this deadly disease.\n       ALSA supports the ethical expansion of the Administration's \n     stem cell policy as provided for in H.R. 810, permitting the \n     use of embryos originally created for fertility treatment \n     upon the consent of those individuals for whom the embryos \n     were created. Importantly, the bill would arm researchers and \n     scientists with the tools and resources they need to \n     determine the potential embryonic stem cell research has to \n     prevent, treat and cure countless diseases. This is \n     especially important for people with ALS, for there is no \n     cure for the disease and although there is one drug available \n     to treat ALS, it only prolongs life by a few months.\n       The advancement of stem cell research is vital for people \n     like Roger Gould from Ames Iowa. ALS has steadily eroded \n     Roger's ability to control muscle movement, limiting his \n     ability to speak, walk, move his arms and lead the type of \n     life most all of us take for granted. Ultimately, the disease \n     will take his life. Stem cell research provides promise to \n     people like Roger and his wife Cindy that one day an \n     effective treatment for ALS will be found. It also gives hope \n     to thousands of others that ALS no longer will mean death in \n     an average of two to five years after diagnosis; that one day \n     we may be able to prevent ALS from taking the lives of people \n     like Rob Borsellino, a nationally recognized columnist from \n     Des Moines, IA who lost his battle against ALS last month, \n     just a year after his diagnosis.\n       Through our innovative TREAT ALS program, The ALS \n     Association is pursuing an aggressive strategy to advance the \n     development of new treatments for ALS, bringing innovations \n     from the lab to the bedside faster than ever before. \n     Exploring the potential of stem cells is an important \n     component of this effort. In fact, recent research funded by \n     ALSA and published in the Annals of Neurology just this \n     month, shows that stem cell therapy can partially restore \n     motor function--function which ALS destroys. Other research \n     in stem cells also show promise for ALS. While translating \n     the promise of stem cell research into treatments and a cure \n     for the disease continues to be a hope for the future, it is \n     important that we explore all potential avenues for treating \n     this horrific disease. An expansion of the current federal \n     policy on stem cell research can only benefit the search for \n     a treatment and cure for ALS.\n       Therefore, we urge the Senate to pass H.R. 810 and help \n     ensure that people with ALS can benefit as quickly as \n     possible from the very best that science and technology has \n     to offer, including the potential innovations that can result \n     from embryonic stem cell research.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                                 Steve Gibson,\n\n                              Vice President, Government Relations\n                                               and Public Affairs.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the majority \ncontrols the next 30 minutes.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I wish to take 5 minutes of my allotted 15 \nminutes to answer some of the questions raised by Senator Harkin and \nSenator Specter.\n  I think it is very important that the American public understands \nwhat this debate is. We have heard a lot of statements this morning \nthat there are no cures other than fetal stem cell research, and that \ncould not be further from the truth. I am a practicing physician. I \ndeliver babies. I have read almost every article published in the last \n12 months on stem cells, both embryonic and nonembryonic adult. The \nfact is there is not one cure in this country today from embryonic stem \ncells.\n  We talked about 21 lines, but what they don't say is there is no \nlimitation in this country at all on private research from any of the \n400 lines Senator Harkin mentioned. There also is a statement by the \ncaretaker and many scientists that the lines are not contaminated. As a \nmatter of fact, they are not contaminated. The question is, do we want \nto do what is best to get us further down the road to treat people? I \nam a two-time cancer survivor; I had cancer of the colon and melanoma. \nWith the treatments that are available--I desire the treatments that \ncan come out of stem cell research, there is no question. But every \ndisease Senator Harkin listed--every disease save ALS--has an adult \nstem cell or cord blood stem cell cure that has already been proven in \nhumans, without using embryonic stem cells. What is the science behind \nit? What is the science that tells us we are going to have trouble with \nembryonic but not with the other? It is called the mitochondria. If you \nstudy physiology at all, what you know is every cytoplasm of every cell \nhas mitochondria in it.\n  The only way to use an embryonic stem cell line and to use it \neffectively without falling into the trap of contamination or cross-\nimmunization--in other words, allergy to the treatment--is to somehow \nquiet mitochondria. They are the energy source for cells. They have \nDNA. So none of the problems that are seen with your own adult stem \ncells or cord blood from your own child will be existing in a treatment \nfrom your own stem cells.\n  The reason we should spend more money on our own stem cell lines \ntoday is because there will not be complications from them as is noted \nin every study that has thus far been done on embryonic stem cells.\n  The Senator mentioned the rats. The only study that shows neurologic \nimprovement is when the rats were sacrificed at 8 weeks. Every other \nstudy, when they let the rats live to 12 weeks, show teratoma or tumor \nformation, which is the problem with embryonic stem cells.\n  I hope the American people will listen. It is not about not getting \nwhere we want to go, but there is false hope, tremendous false hope in \nwhat we are about to do when, in fact, if we would redouble our efforts \non the other areas of stem cells.\n  One final point and then I will yield. There is a germ cell line, \nstem cell line, which goes against everything Senator Harkin says. It \nhas been proven in this country; it has been proven in Germany. It \ncomes from ovarian tissue and testicular tissue. It is, without a \ndoubt, the greatest thing on the horizon for us because it has none of \nthe problems associated--I am not talking the ethical problems, I am \ntalking the scientific problems associated with embryonic stem cells. \nThere are none of the problems with it.\n  I have seen beating heart tissue from germ cell lines. It can create \nevery area. There are three tissues, endoderm, ectoderm and mesoderm. \nThat is the important reason why embryonic is thought to be so \nimportant.\n  One final point on dedifferentiation, the ability to take a cell that \nis in your body today and make it go backward. That has been \naccomplished. We now see multiple lines of pluripotent cells from our \nown bodies.\n  The choice is not destroy embryos, and if we don't, we will not get \ngood research; the choice is go where the money is leading us, and the \nmoney is leading us into adult stem cells, germ cell lines, and other \nlines that have none of the problems of embryonic stem cells.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Oklahoma for \nhis short, clear statement. I have some charts that will back him up.\n  I am delighted we are having this debate. It is time. We last debated \nthis issue on the Senate floor in 1998. A lot has developed since then. \nAs my colleague from Oklahoma pointed out, much of the science has \npassed by the embryonic stem cell and the need for embryonic stem \ncells, as the science has gone to adult stem cells and cord blood, and \nthat is where the treatments are. I will show pictures of patients in \nthat area and what is taking place.\n  I am delighted to be debating my colleagues. We have been debating \nthis issue for some time. I think it is time we have a vote and look at \nthis issue.\n  When I was a young Congressman first running for Congress in Chanute, \nKS, a young man approached me. He knew me and knew I was running for \noffice. He said: Can you answer one question for me?\n  I said: I will try. I was anxious to be of help. I was anxious to \nprove I knew policy issues, I knew right from wrong, and I would be a \ngood Congressman for him.\n  He asked me: Why is it we will fine somebody up to half a million \ndollars for destroying a bald eagle's egg, and yet we will fund the \ndestruction of young humans? Why is it Federal law, both cases at that \npoint in time, as far as the funding of abortion--I don't remember when \nthat was changed, although now we are talking about the destruction of \nyoung human life again.\n  He said: Why is that?\n  I thought for a while. I thought: That is a good question. I don't \nknow why that is.\n\n[[Page S7575]]\n\n  I have a picture which may seem an odd place to start this debate, \nbut it will tie in, and I will show how. I have a picture of a bald \neagle's egg and a bald eagle. If I asked my 8-year-old children what \nhappens if I destroy this egg, will I get this eagle? they will say: \nNo, you don't get the eagle if you destroy the egg.\n  Why not? That egg is not an eagle.\n  I know, but the egg is the eagle because the eagle comes out of the \negg.\n  Well, he doesn't look like him.\n  I know it is an eagle in the egg, and if you destroy the egg, you \ndon't get the eagle. That is why we say in the Endangered Species Act, \nif you destroy this bald eagle's egg, you can have a maximum fine of up \nto half a million dollars.\n  I want to show some other eggs, if I can. These are human embryos, \nfertilized eggs. They are fertilized eggs such as this bald eagle's egg \nis. This one, Mother Teresa once was a human embryo. JFK was once a \nhuman embryo. Martin Luther King was once a human embryo. Ronald Reagan \nwas once a human embryo.\n  Again, I think if we ask ourselves a simple question: If I destroy \nthis, do I destroy this in the same way? Does it happen? If I destroy \nthis human embryo--everybody on the Earth was a human embryo at some \ntime--if I destroy that human embryo, do I somehow go ahead and get to \nbe here anyway?\n  The answer, of course, again, if you ask my 8-year-old children, is: \nNo, you don't get to be here because you destroyed the very start of \nyour life, you destroyed the beginning of it, you destroyed that \nbiological entity you were because the same genetic material that was \nthere was in Ronald Reagan, and it was a unique set of genetic \nmaterial, unique to him. The same for Martin Luther King, JFK, or \nMother Teresa, and the billions of people around the world. We all \nstarted as a human embryo, and if you destroy the embryo, you destroy \nthe person.\n  It is a unique set of genetic material right after the fertilization \ntakes place. It doesn't matter where the fertilization takes place. It \ncan take place in an IVF clinic or the old-fashioned way or it can take \nplace by cloning. You still have this. You can have this, or you can \ndestroy this and never get that. That is pretty direct, \nstraightforward, nobody argues it. And we are not talking theology, as \npeople try to drag this into the debate. We are talking basic biology. \nThis is basic biology 101. If you destroy the embryo, you don't get the \nfull-scale person. This is a genetic person, entity, special, unique, \nsacred, and so is this person.\n\n  My point one of this is, if we use taxpayers' dollars to fund the \nexpansion of embryonic stem cell research, you have to inherently \ndestroy young humans to do this, and do we want to do that? What was \npreviously said in Dickey-Wicker was: No, we will not use taxpayers' \ndollars to destroy young human life. Here we would change that and say: \nYes, we do; it is for a special purpose, a special reason; these are \nunique; these are something we are really going to get cures for. And \nthat is my second point, cures.\n  The other side has talked about cures for a long period of time, and \nI want cures, and we are getting cures to take place. If we had taken \nthe half a billion dollars, $500 million that we have invested in \nembryonic stem cell research in animals and humans and invested that \ninstead in adult stem cell research and cord blood research, we would \nprobably have a lot more people in clinical trials today. We would have \na lot more people, I believe, being treated and alive today if we had \ntaken the half a billion dollars that we put, in the last 5 years, into \nthese areas of embryonic stem cell research and put them in adult stem \ncells and cord blood, we would have more people alive today, walking \naround, experiencing treatments and I believe cures. Let me show some \nfaces of these people.\n  This is a beautiful lady, Jacki Rabon. She was involved in a traffic \naccident. She is a paraplegic. She had to go to Portugal to get a \ntreatment with her own adult stem cells. They are olfactory stem cells \nfrom the base of the nose. They take them out, grow them, and put them \nback in the spinal cord injury area. She had no feeling, no mobility, \nnothing below the waist. She is now getting feeling in her hips through \nthis treatment, adult stem cells, her own stem cells. She is getting \nfeeling in the hips and walking with the use of braces, but she had to \ngo to Portugal to do this. Why isn't this being done in America? Why \naren't we having people treated here? We are not adequately funding \nthis area. She wants to walk and I want her to walk and she could, but \nwe are taking money and putting them into these speculative areas when \nwe have cures that are working. We have to go to Portugal to get them.\n  Let's look at this next picture. This is an amazing story. This young \nman is named Ryan Schneider. I hosted him at a press conference 2 hours \nago. He is 3 years old, a young man with cerebral palsy. His mother \nsaved his cord blood.\n  At 2 years of age, she started noticing that he was not growing and \nthat his arms were retracting. She took him to the doctors and they \nsaid: Yes, CP; he has CP. The mother was devastated, but she would not \ngive up.\n  The morning after the diagnosis, she was lying in bed and she had \nthis a-ha moment. She said: I saved his cord blood and let's use the \ncord blood and treat him with the cord blood because I think that can \nwork and get him moving again.\n  She called all around the country and couldn't find anybody willing \nto do this procedure. She was pleading with these doctors: It is simply \nhis own cord blood, taking his own cord blood and putting it back in; \nthis isn't going to hurt him.\n  They said: We can't do it, not sure, we don't have FDA protocol.\n  Finally, she finds a researcher at Duke University, whom we had in to \ntestify, who said: Yes, we will do it, and the worst thing that can \nhappen is nothing because nothing will happen, it is his own cord \nblood; it is not going to hurt him.\n  She goes down to Duke University, takes his own cord blood, and they \ninject it in him. This is when he was 2. He was at a press conference \ntoday. There is no retraction taking place in the arms. He has full \nmobility. The thing he likes to do the most is bug his 8-year-old \nsister, which is what his mother said today: We like that, too, that he \nwants to do that. He has a word vocabulary that is normal for the age \nrange. She said: Why isn't this an FDA-approved situation? Why are we \nnot doing more research? Why aren't more people storing and saving cord \nblood so when this happens people can get cures?\n  Well, we haven't put enough funding into it. If we had put the half a \nbillion more dollars into this area instead of embryonic, we might have \na bunch of kids treated for CP who are not getting treated and be like \nRyan running around and bugging his sister instead of having CP.\n  Here is a real interesting story, too, Keone Penn. We had him in to \ntestify. He has sickle-cell anemia. He was dying. It is a real \ndifficulty. Sickle cell is a very difficult problem to face, very \npainful problem for a child to face. He went through the New York Cord \nBlood Center, got treatment there, got a match. They had enough of a \ngenetic match that it works for him. There are no indicators of sickle-\ncell anemia today. None. He isn't in Washington today, but we have had \nhim in to testify.\n  We need a lot more cord blood stored. We need a lot more diversity of \ncord blood stored. We could use that half a billion dollars to store \nmore cord blood and have more ethnic diversity so more people can get \ntreated, so more people such as him will live, not die; so more people \nwill not have to suffer what he went through. There could be real \ntreatments with these dollars to help them.\n  No. 1, why are we destroying young human life? We fine people for \ndestroying life in other forms that we want to preserve, such as the \nbald eagle. No. 2, why would we take this money away from current areas \nwhere we can really treat people and especially in the areas where we \nare not getting any treatments, we are having all the problems with \ntumor formation, as Dr. Coburn noted. Why are we doing that? So that \nfewer people are getting treatments and people are having to go \noverseas to get these treatments? Why? And why would we ask to do more \nof it now? That is what this bill is basically asking to do: That we \nwould change Federal law so you could destroy human life with Federal \ntaxpayer dollars. No. 2, that we would use this money, and more of it, \nto fund speculative areas\n\n[[Page S7576]]\n\nthat even their set of scientists are saying are a minimum of a decade \nor two away from treatments which we are not getting, and we have taken \naway from Keone Penn, and treatments that he could get. Why? What sense \ndoes that make?\n\n  In 1943, C.S. Lewis delivered a series of lectures--this is the \ngentleman who did the Narnia series that has been made into a movie \nthat a lot of young people have seen and read the Narnia series books, \nalong with a lot of other pieces--a brilliant writer and a brave man. \nHe did a lecture series called ``The Abolition Of Man'' in 1943, a very \nforward-looking series, and he noted at one point: ``If man chooses to \ntreat himself as raw material, raw material he will be.'' It echoes \nthemes of what we are hearing today. I don't give anybody over to a bad \nheart. I think everybody wants cures. I want cures. I see a way we can \nget treatments and hopefully cures. I want things done ethically. I \ndon't give anybody over to a bad heart. But what we are doing is \ntreating man as raw material--raw material to feed into a system that \nwe hope will produce some results.\n  Unfortunately, it is not the first time we have in human history that \nwe have treated people as raw material. We have frequently, in the \npast, subjected the weaker to the will of the stronger, and we have \nalways regretted it afterwards. We shouldn't do that today. It \nshouldn't have happened then, and we don't need to do it now. We are \ntalking about the embryo, the young human life.\n  I want to go through a couple of these points about what it is we are \ntalking about. President Clinton's bioethics board defined young human \nlife--and I want to give their definition for it. The National \nBioethics Advisory Commission says that an embryo is: ``The developing \norganism from the time of fertilization''--the time of fertilization--\n``until significant differentiation has occurred, when the organism \nthen becomes known as a fetus.'' So it is an embryo by that \nPresidential advisory bioethics analysis.\n  And here is a definition taken from a textbook, the Human Embryology \ntextbook states:\n\n       Although life is a continuous process, fertilization is a \n     critical landmark because, under ordinary circumstances, a \n     new, genetically distinct human organism is thereby formed. \n     The combination of 23 chromosomes present in each pronucleus \n     results in 46 chromosomes in the zygote.\n       Thus the diploid number is restored and the embryonic \n     genome is formed. The embryo now exists as a genetic unity.\n\n  That isn't Sam Brownback saying this, this is Human Embryology, Third \nEdition, saying that.\n  We have a distinct genetic entity once it is formed. It doesn't \nmatter the location. It can be the old-fashioned way, as I noted at the \noutset, via the human body; in vitro fertilization; it can be what some \nrefer to as somatic cell nuclear transfer, SCNT, or what most refer to \nas human cloning. It is a separate entity.\n  Pioneer stem cell researcher Jamie Thompson goes further. He says of \nhuman cloning: ``By any reasonable definition, you're creating an \nembryo. If you try to define it away, you're being disingenuous.'' \nJamie Thompson. So we are talking about a human embryo.\n  Now, some would say it is not big enough to be human life. Here I \nwant to make a point, on this chart, if I could. My colleagues made the \npoint that the human embryo is about this big; very small at its \nbeginning of life. Therefore, because it is small and is fragile and it \ncan't do anything on its own, you know, it is really not human life. \nAnd we should be able to destroy it, for a good purpose. We are doing \nthis for a good purpose. This isn't us being malicious; we are doing \nthis for a good purpose. Well, the interesting thing about that, as I \nsaid at the outset--of course, when you destroy this, you never get the \nfull human at any point in time. This is a separate genetic entity, \neven at this point in time. Also, the point was made to me one time \nthat if the Big Bang theory is correct, then at one point in time, this \nis the size of the universe. Then it is all condensed down, this much \nmatter is condensed down to that infinitesimal, small size before it \nblows. So I guess if you destroy it then, it doesn't become the \nuniverse, but that doesn't matter. It is too small to be seen as \nsignificant, and it can't do anything on its own. It sits in a frozen \nstate, and because it can't take care of itself, because it can't grow, \nbecause it can't breathe in this situation, then it is not human--\nbecause it can't care for itself, because it is too fragile. It doesn't \nbreathe. It doesn't do some of the things that we give over to the \npresence of life.\n  I want to give some examples, real quick, of young people--let's use \nthis one. This is Isaiah Sullivan Royal, born to Hannah and Jed Royal. \nHannah works in my office. Isaiah was born significantly premature. As \nyou can see, he is a fighter. He is a tough little guy. He has been \nthrough a lot--more medical treatments than most people would have gone \nthrough in their lifetime already. Without human intervention, without \nhelp, he doesn't survive and make it. Yet he is a young human, and he \nis beautiful. Talk to his parents about him. So the idea that just \nbecause of smallness, you can't take care of yourself doesn't make you \nhuman, is completely false. Do we want to say that because you are \nyoung and small and weak, you are worthless or helpless or you are not \nhuman, which would be even worse? That just doesn't stand. That doesn't \nstand to reason. Yes, human life is fragile, but it is of infinite \nworth and it is of infinite value.\n\n  I want to now look at the overall issue of where we are with adult \nstem cell work. Dr. Coburn hit on this area, and I want to put some \nmore points to it. We have, by peer review articles, 72 different \nareas, different human maladies being treated with adult stem cells or \nwith cord blood--72. There was recently an article in one of the \nmagazines saying: Well, we don't think the number is actually 72, it \nmay be 68, it may be this or that.\n  We can wait a day or two and it will be up to 72 because there are \nmore coming out in all of the areas. Some people are quibbling and \nsaying: Well, these are not in FDA treatment trials. That is true, a \nnumber of them are not because we don't have sufficient funding. A half \na billion dollars would really help us to move that along to get these \nin FDA treatment trials. These are in human clinical applications, \nwhere there are human beings treated for 72 different maladies by adult \nstem cells or cord blood--72, and for embryonic, we have zero.\n  We have known about embryonic stem cells in mice for 25 years. We \nhave not been able to get them to work in this situation. They form \ntumors and they are rapid growing. With adult stem cells we know what \nthey are about, we know what they are doing, and they are working, and \npeople are being treated: 72 adult stem cell treatments to zero \nembryonic treatments. Again, you can quibble that they are not in FDA \ntrials, not available to everybody. That is true. A lot of people are \nhaving to go overseas for treatments in some cases, and in some cases \nthey are actually treatments that were developed in the United States, \nbut because of FDA approval processes being long, they are having to \nget treatment overseas, even though the process was developed here.\n  I want to show you the specific areas, and this is--I am breaking the \nrules on charts because this one has--this one is too busy, but it is \nthe only way I can get it all on one chart: 72 current human clinical \napplications using adult stem cells.\n  As I said, we could wait a week or 2 weeks, it will be more. Here are \nsome of the amazing ones: Bladder diseases, they are developing, \nactually growing bladders with your own stem cells for people who have \nhad bladder cancer or something of that nature, they are able to \nactually form a shell structure and the cells grow around it. The ones \nI like the best are in the heart areas, the cardiovascular. I had David \nFoege speaking at a press conference we had, he could hardly walk, \nadvanced stroke, because of his heart problem, no infracturing rate. \nThe physicians--I am sure I am butchering the words--I am a lawyer. I \napologize for that. But he got this treatment, and he went first to a \nplace in the United States, and they said: Look, you are just too \nadvanced in your problematic stage. We are not going to treat you here \nbecause we want to treat early on and we only have so much money and we \ncould use more, but we only have so much.\n  So the guy goes to Thailand for the treatment--it may have been \ndeveloped in the United States. I am not certain that it was developed \nin the United States, but it is used here but only on\n\n[[Page S7577]]\n\npeople with great opportunity to make it through. He goes to Thailand, \ngets this treatment. His indicators of what happened to him in the \nstroke are diminishing. He is out walking. He spoke at the press \nconference that we had, and this man has got life again. Otherwise, he \nwould, in all probability, be dead today. And how many people are like \nhim, that because we have slowed the development of the adult field \ndown by putting so many of our resources in the nonproductive embryonic \narea, and we are getting interesting science, but with adult we are \ntalking about real people now. We are talking about real lives of \nindividuals. How many more of them can get treated, and how many people \ncan afford to fly to Bangkok to get this treatment? How many are able \nto do that? Yet they could go somewhere in the United States. I mean, \nmy goodness, I hope we start thinking about the people involved in this \nand seeing the success in so many various and different fields. I think \nit is important we would do that.\n\n  Mr. President, I want to point out we will have, as my colleagues \nknow, three votes that will be taking place. I do hope people will \nsupport the fetal farming ban. We shouldn't be growing young fetuses \nand using them for research, period. Some people are wanting to grow \nthem further, cells differentiate and use it then. What we are talking \nabout is an actual ban on that. I am hoping my colleagues will support \nthat because we should not be doing that. I hope everybody would see \nthat there is a huge moral dilemma with doing that. It is a bill that \nwill be put forward. There is an alternative bill coming up with these \npluripotent cells that I am hoping my colleagues can support.\n  The focal point is this, do we use taxpayer dollars, Federal taxpayer \ndollars, to destroy young human life for research purposes? I would \nhope it is seen that we could develop and put forward a very clear \nargument and rationale as to why you shouldn't do that. It is illegal. \nThe Dickey-Wicker appropriations language, to start off with, that is \nthe law we previously passed. It is immoral. We shouldn't use a weaker \nperson for the benefit of a stronger person. And it is unnecessary. \nThat is actually the beauty of it. We are presenting false choices to \npeople. The choice that works has no ethical problem, and we can get \nbroad-based support for it. Then, we can have more Jacki Rabons, Ryan \nSchneiders, and Keone Penns who are getting treatments now, and their \nlives are being saved, people staying in the United States for \ntreatment rather than going overseas for the treatment, and we have got \na lot of people being successfully treated and hopefully cured.\n  I may use that term ``cured'' too loosely because these are at the \nearly stages. These are treatments that are showing enormous promise, \nbut we can't--they are not, many of them are not in any sort of FDA-\napproved trial, so we can't use that term ``cure.'' But we have a lot \nof successes.\n  The other road that is being talked about is the use of human life as \nraw material, and if we do that, raw material we will be. We will \ncheapen life. And we cheapen life any time we use it for anything other \nthan the sacredness that life is. I hope, at the end of the day, that \nwould be the thing we grab onto. Clearly, embryonic stem cell research \nis unnecessary. We don't want to cheapen human life.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, would the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. COBURN. Is there any prohibition in the United States today for \nprivate money to fund any type of fetal research, embryonic stem cell \nresearch?\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Reclaiming my time, no, there is not. There is no \nlimitation today on State dollars, private dollars, foreign dollars, \nwhatever you want to call it.\n  Mr. COBURN. As a matter of fact, California passed, I think, \nProposition 71: $500 million over the next 10 years in fetal stem cell \nresearch?\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I think actually the number is $3 billion.\n  Mr. COBURN. Three billion dollars. So there is no limitation at the \npresent time.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. None whatsoever.\n  Mr. COBURN. Is the Senator aware of the private investment dollars \nthat are presently--the private investment dollars--not Government \ndollars, not State dollars--that are now going into embryonic stem cell \nresearch versus adult stem cell and germ line stem cell and cord blood, \nthe ratio is about 100 to 1?\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, reclaiming my time, it is, and it is a \nvery interesting feature that where the private money is going, where \npeople have to show production coming out of it, it is all going into \nthe adult cord blood because people know the science. And that is why I \nwant to conclude with what I started with.\n  In many respects, the science has passed this debate by. The science \nis saying: Do the adult, do the cord blood. The embryonic is not \nworking, and you have enormous ethical problems with doing that, and we \ndon't need to go that way. That is where the private dollars then are \ngoing, which I would hope my colleagues would look at as well.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the minority \ncontrols debate for the next 30 minutes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I don't know if there is a fixed order for \nthe minority. If not, I will yield myself 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n  Mr. LEVIN. We stand at the threshold of a new era of medical \ndiscovery. We can already glimpse the dramatic lifegiving advances in \nregenerative medicine that lie ahead, but we remain mired down at this \npoint with breakthroughs on the horizon but not within reach unless we \nchange the President's policy on stem cell research.\n  Embryonic stem cell research could hold the key to curing diseases \nthat no other research can cure. As best we know now, an embryonic stem \ncell is unique in nature. It and it alone can develop into any other \ntype of cell in the body. An embryonic stem cell and an embryonic stem \ncell alone can become a nerve cell, a muscle cell, or any of the more \nthan 200 types of cells in the body. The research into directing the \ncreation and use of these cells may be extraordinarily difficult, but \nit is easy to understand how creating healthy cells could replace \ndiseased cells and could save an untold number of lives.\n  One example of the possibilities of stem cell research is the hope \nthat it offers for those suffering from Parkinson's disease. \nParkinson's disease is a motor system disorder that results from a loss \nof brain cells that produce dopamine. Individuals with Parkinson's \ndisease often experience a trembling in the hands or arms or face and \nimpaired balance and coordination. As the disease develops, it can \nbecome difficult to walk, talk, and complete other basic tasks. With \nresearch, scientists may be able to coax embryonic stem cells into \nbecoming healthy neurons that produce the desperately needed dopamine. \nAnd if those neurons can be successfully transplanted into a patient \nwith Parkinson's disease, that person could be cured.\n  The list of other diseases ripe for stem cell research is long. Lou \nGehrig's diseased is a progressive neuromuscular disease characterized \nby a degeneration of the nerve cells of the brain and spinal cord. \nJuvenile diabetes is an autoimmune disease in which the immune system \nattacks the pancreas, destroying insulin-producing cells.\n  Alzheimer's disease is a form of dementia that afflicts the part of \nthe brain that controls memory, language, and thought. Spinal cord \ninjuries interrupt the sensory pathway between the brain and the rest \nof the body.\n  Now, imagine if embryonic stem cell research could produce \nreplacements for the nerve cells ravaged by Lou Gehrig's disease, for \nthe insulin-producing cells destroyed by diabetes, for the brain cells \nwashed away by Alzheimer's, for the neural pathways severed by spinal \ncord injuries. Stem cell research could offer the millions of Americans \nsuffering from these and other diseases not just hopes but cures. It \ncould give them and their families--who are often physically, \nfinancially, and emotionally exhausted--their lives back.\n  Many technical hurdles stand in the way of that day. These \ndiscoveries will not be easy. But it is wrong to throw additional and \nunnecessary obstacles\n\n[[Page S7578]]\n\nin front of our doctors, researchers, and scientists. That is \nprecisely, however, what the President's policy has done.\n  On August 21, 2001, President Bush issued an Executive order that the \nFederal Government would only fund embryonic stem cell research on stem \ncell lines created before that date. ``Stem cell line'' is the name \ngiven to constantly dividing cells that continue to be derived from a \nsingle embryo. Most independent experts estimated at the time of the \nPresident's Executive order that only 80 stem cell lines, a totally \ninadequate amount, would be available for Federal research. Even worse, \nmost of those 80 lines were determined to be polluted and unusable, \nleaving only about 20 stem cell lines actually available to scientists. \nThat number is far too small to tap the vast potential of this \nresearch.\n  The President did not question the legitimacy of the science being \nused in stem cell research but the ethics of using embryos, \nscientifically known as blastocysts, until implanted through in vitro \nfertilization. A blastocyst consists of around 150 cells, which is \nsmaller than the point of a pin. While the blastocyst is destroyed \nduring the process of extracting embryonic stem cells, the key fact is \nthat any that are used for stem cell research would have been discarded \nand destroyed anyway. That is a fact that opponents refuse to deal \nwith.\n  These blastocysts are created by in vitro fertilization clinics and, \nfor a variety of reasons, will not be used for implantation and will, \ntherefore, eventually be discarded.\n  Last month, the Detroit News editorialized against a Michigan law \nrestricting embryonic stem cell research and used words that equally \napply to the President's policy. The News wrote:\n\n       The justification for this law is to protect human embryos, \n     but the fact that fertility clinics can simply discard them \n     means that the research ban is pointless.\n\n  The logic of some embryonic stem cell research opponents is totally \nbefuddling. They are apparently willing to ignore the discarding of the \nembryos by fertility clinics, but they label as morally objectionable \nthe lifegiving use of embryos which would otherwise be discarded. I \nbelieve that embryonic stem cell research is truly a lifegiving, not a \nlife-destroying, process because of the extraordinary potential for \nhealing living, breathing human beings who have names and faces and \nloved ones.\n  While the President is fighting against research in America, other \ncountries are pressing ahead. America has always been at the forefront \nof scientific innovation, and we could do this research faster, more \nefficiently, and more ethically than most other countries. We also have \nan obligation to speed its potential benefits to the American people \nand to people around the world.\n  The President's policy, however, has stifled private-public \npartnerships and has hindered our potential impact in this area. Today, \nother countries are poised to reap the lifegiving rewards of stem cell \nresearch while we fall further behind.\n  Over a year ago, the House took a significant step toward overcoming \nPresidential opposition by passing the Stem Cell Research and \nEnhancement Act, H.R. 810, which would remove the President's arbitrary \nprohibition against using stem cells created after August 21, 2001. \nThat is another fact that opponents refuse to deal with. The \nPresident's date of August 21, 2001, is breathtakingly illogical. How \ncan the President argue that it is OK to use embryos created before \nthat date for research, even though in his view it was the taking of a \nlife but that after that date it is unethical to do so?\n\n  H.R. 810 would pave the way for hundreds or thousands of additional \nstem lines to be made available. It is bipartisan legislation, and it \npassed overwhelmingly in the House.\n  Shortly after the House made its strong statement in favor of \nexploring the medical potential of embryonic stem cell research, the \nSenate majority leader committed to bringing that bill up for floor \nconsideration. Senator Frist understands how great the life-enhancing \npossibilities are, and he has chosen to side with his fellow physicians \nand with the future in supporting this research.\n  This bill has the strong support of the American Medical Association, \nthe Coalition for the Advancement of Medical Research, the Association \nof American Universities, the Christopher Reeve Foundation, the \nJuvenile Diabetes Research Foundation, the Leukemia and Lymphoma \nSociety, the Parkinson's Action Network, and more than 200 additional \norganizations. More important, it has the overwhelming support of the \nAmerican people. If the President vetoes this bill, I hope we will \nresoundingly override his veto.\n  As part of the unanimous consent agreement to consider this \nlegislation, we are considering two additional bills as well. The bill \nput forward by Senators Santorum and Specter would emphasize the use of \nadult stem cells instead of embryonic stem cells. Adult stem cells may \nhave some potential, but they do not have the critically essential \nability of the embryonic stem cell to become any other type of cell.\n  Dr. Sean Morrison, the director of the University of Michigan's \nCenter for Stem Cell Biology, and one of the top stem cell researchers \nin the country, wrote recently in the Detroit Free Press about another \nalternative to embryonic stem cells being touted, adult stem cells from \numbilical cords. Dr. Morrison wrote:\n\n       Umbilical cord cells are used clinically only to replace \n     blood-forming cells. There is no compelling evidence that \n     these cells could ever be used to replace cells in other \n     tissues. These cells are not an alternative to embryonic stem \n     cells, which can replace any cell type in the body. . . .That \n     is why there is near universal agreement among respected \n     scientists and patient advocacy groups that current \n     restrictions [against embryonic stem cell research] should be \n     relaxed.\n\n  We may be on the cusp of one of the greatest miracles in the history \nof medicine. The door of possibility is ajar, inviting us to enter. But \nwe cannot make these great strides if our researchers continue to be \nhampered by President Bush's overly restrictive policy. We owe it to \neverybody suffering from--or who may in the future be afflicted by--\nthese dread diseases to move boldly toward a brighter future.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, today I speak in support of legislation \nthis Chamber has been waiting to consider for more than a year. I am \npleased that wait is finally over. I encourage my colleagues to join me \nin voting to give hope to millions of Americans living with diseases \nfor which embryonic stem cell research offers their only real hope of a \ncure. These patients are often desperate and have been waiting for \ntheir Congress to take action for nearly 5 years, since August 9, 2001, \nwhen the President defied common sense and stifled the promise and the \nhope offered by stem cell research.\n  This essential legislation has already passed the House of \nRepresentatives by an overwhelmingly large bipartisan majority. Today, \nI want to briefly share my thoughts on why the current policy on stem \ncell research is unsustainable and woefully inadequate, clarify some \nmisconceptions about the Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act, and share \nthe stories of some South Dakotans who will enormously benefit from the \npassage of this bill.\n  Current law allows federally funded research on only those stem cells \nderived as of August 9, 2001. At the time, there were more than 65 stem \ncell lines available worldwide. While this number represented marvelous \nprogress from the first derivation of an embryonic stem cell in 1998, \nwe know now that it was just the tip of the iceberg of possibility.\n  Today we know only 22 of those first 65 lines are viable for \nresearch, and virtually none will produce medical therapies permitted \nfor use in humans. This is because at the time the only way to maintain \nstem cell lines was to use mouse cells to help them grow. Since then, \nscientists working with private funds--and no thanks to the Federal \nGovernment--have developed stronger and more robust stem cell lines \nthat are not dependent on mouse cells and could lead to therapies for \nactual use in humans.\n  We must open these new lines to research supported by Federal \nfunding. The United States is home to the world's largest and most \ndistinguished organizations dedicated to maintaining and improving \nhealth through medical science. The National Institutes of Health and \nthe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention conduct research that is \ncritical to understanding\n\n[[Page S7579]]\n\nhuman disease and its treatment. These centers rely on Government \nfunding to continue their work, and if we do not fund their research on \nembryonic stem cell lines, the United States will fall behind the rest \nof the world in scientific and medical advancement. If the Stem Cell \nResearch Enhancement Act does not become law, we not only risk the \nfutures of Americans living with currently incurable diseases, we also \nrisk our national reputation as the home of the world's most innovative \nand distinguished scientists working to improve the health.\n  This is not just a matter of international medical research prestige; \nit directly goes to the millions of families around the world who will \nat last have hope that we can conquer the planet's most awful diseases \nand injuries.\n  The Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act creates a closely monitored \nand controlled stem cell research effort. The bill will allow vital, \nlife-giving research to progress using frozen fertilized embryos that \nwould otherwise be incinerated as medical waste. The choice is simple: \nlife-giving research or incineration of excess cells.\n  Stem cell research is conducted with egg cells fertilized in a \nlaboratory for the sole purpose of assisting childless couples who wish \nto have a baby. After choosing embryos for implantation in the mother, \nthe remainder are routinely destroyed as medical waste. I believe these \ncells, of which hundreds of thousands are now stored at fertility \nclinics, would be better used to advance medical research that holds \ngreat promise for curing or preventing some of the world's worst \ndiseases, as well as for repairing spinal cord and other injuries. I \nbelieve choosing research over incineration is a moral choice.\n  My South Dakota values, my religious faith, and my commitment to \nSouth Dakota families tell me we must choose life-giving research over \nincineration of these cells.\n  The Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act imposes tighter ethical rules \nthan exist under current law. Any donated embryos must be created \nsolely for fertility treatment and must be in excess of the clinical \nneed of those seeking fertility treatment. Furthermore, the bill \nrequires written consent from those who wish to donate the embryonic \ncells and prohibits financial incentives for donation.\n  Stem cells in umbilical cord blood have provided effective therapies \nfor diseases such as leukemia and sickle cell anemia. However, there \nare many other diseases, including type 1 diabetes, Alzheimer's, and \nParkinson's, which doctors cannot treat or cure with cord blood stem \ncells. Because of this fact, we must advance research in other areas, \nincluding embryonic stem cell research, to access all available options \nfor curing the debilitating diseases plaguing so many of our fellow \nAmericans.\n  Earlier, I mentioned that this bill gives hope to millions of \nAmericans living with diseases for which embryonic stem cell research \noffers the only hope for a cure. I have been honored to meet many of \nthese individuals in my home State of South Dakota.\n  This bill gives hope to 3-year-old Alexander Sohl from Brandon, SD. \nHis parents, Terry and Laurie, told me little Alexander's very first \nwords were not ``mommy'' or ``daddy'' but ``no shot''--his insulin \ntreatments began when he was just a baby. And it is stem cell research \nthat gives his family hope that the daily inflicted pain and the threat \nto the very life of this small child can at last end.\n\n  This bill gives hope to Bonnie Younkin. Bonnie lives in Huron, SD, \nand was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease in 2002 when she was in her \nearly 50s. Though living with her disease is a daily battle, Bonnie \nalso serves as an advocate for awareness of the disease and increased \nfunding for Parkinson's research as the State's action coordinator. It \ncan run in families; Bonnie is the fourth female in her family \ndiagnosed with Parkinson's, and she lives in fear that her three \ndaughters and one granddaughter may have a similar diagnosis in their \nfuture. Bonnie called my office last week, to touch base in advance of \nthis debate. Upon hearing that I remained committed to supporting this \nbill, she had just two words, ``Bless you.''\n  South Dakota families are desperate for this research to commence--\nand to proceed.\n  Choosing research over incineration is a moral choice. I have prayed \nabout this issue, and my deeply held religious faith tells me that \nrespect for human life, respect for God's children, requires this life-\nsaving research to proceed rather than the continued incineration of \nfrozen excess embryo cells that are sitting in fertility clinics \nclassified as medical waste.\n  Let there be no mistake: There are three bills being considered by \nthe Senate this week. But unless a Senator votes for H.R. 810, the Stem \nCell Research Enhancement Act, he or she will not have voted for this \nmeaningful life- giving research.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in affirming that respect--that \nrespect for life--by voting for the Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act. \nChoose research and life over incineration.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the minority is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I have a letter from a number of different \ngroups endorsing H.R. 810. It is patient advocacy groups, health \norganizations, research universities, scientific institutes, religious \ngroups, and others. There are 205 groups listed here. I will not go \nthrough all of them, obviously, but I think it is important that all of \nthese groups be laid upon the Record. I ask unanimous consent that the \nletter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                    July 14, 2006.\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator: We, the undersigned patient advocacy groups, \n     health organizations, research universities, scientific \n     societies, religious groups and other interested institutions \n     and associations, representing millions of patients, \n     scientists, health care providers and advocates, write you \n     with our strong and unified support for H.R. 810, the Stem \n     Cell Research Enhancement Act. We urge your vote in favor of \n     H.R. 810 when the Senate considers the measure next week.\n       Of the bills being considered simultaneously, only H.R. 810 \n     will move stem cell research forward in our country. This is \n     the bill which holds promise for expanding medical \n     breakthroughs. The other two bills--the Alternative \n     Pluripotent Stem Cell Therapies Enhancement Act (S. 2754) and \n     the Fetus Farming Prohibition Act (S. 3504)--are NOT \n     substitutes for a YES vote on H.R. 810.\n       H.R. 810 is the pro-patient and pro-research bill. A vote \n     in support of H.R. 810 will be considered a vote in support \n     of more than 100 million patients in the U.S. and substantial \n     progress for research.

Mr. President, I have a letter from the American Society \nfor Cell Biology. The letter was sent to Senator Hatch, dated July 17. \nIt says:\n\n       The Senate will shortly be considering legislation to \n     permit the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to fund \n     research with additional and new and existing human embryonic \n     stem cell (hESC) lines. As staunch supporters of biomedical \n     research and particularly research with hESCs, we trust that \n     you will exert your influence to ensure passage of H.R. 810. \n     Scientists engaged in ESC research are counting on you and \n     like-minded Senate colleagues to assure its passage.\n\n       The President must also be persuaded not veto this \n     legislation for if we continue on the path he set five years \n     ago, United States investigators will be out of the running \n     in coverting embryonic stem cells into important new \n     therapies. It is especially frustrating and demeaning that \n     American scientists are prohibited from using their NIH grant \n     funds for research with the hundreds of hESC lines generated \n     outside the United States or generated in this country with \n     private funding.\n\n  I note there are 27 leading scientists on this letter, 17 of them \nhaving received the Nobel Prize for medicine in one form or another.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                          The American Society for\n\n\n                                                 Cell Biology,\n\n                                      Bethesda, MD, July 17, 2006.\n     Hon. Orrin Hatch,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Hatch: The Senate will shortly be considering \n     legislation to permit the National Institutes of Health (NIH) \n     to fund research with additional and new and existing human \n     embryonic stem cell (hESC) lines. As staunch supporters of \n     biomedical research and particularly research with hESCs, we \n     trust that you will exert your influence to ensure passage of \n     H.R. 810. Scientists engaged in ESC research are counting on \n     you and like-minded Senate colleagues to assure its passage.\n       The President must also be persuaded not to veto this \n     legislation for if we continue on the path he set 5 years \n     ago, United States investigators will be out of the running \n     in converting embryonic stem cells into important new \n     therapies. It is especially frustrating and demeaning that \n     American scientists are prohibited from using their NIH grant \n     funds for research with the hundreds of hESC lines generated \n     outside the United States or generated in this country with \n     private funding.\n       Also, S. 2754, the ``Alternative Pluripotent Stem Cell \n     Therapies Enhancement Act,'' sponsored by Senators Specter \n     and Santorum, seems to us, superfluous. Ostensibly, it is \n     intended to authorize research ``to derive human pluripotent \n     stem cell lines using techniques that do not harm embryos.'' \n     However, at present, such research is currently permissible \n     and, therefore, does not require congressional legislation; \n     indeed, the National Institutes of Health may currently be \n     funding such efforts.\n       Moreover, all the alternative procedures advanced in the \n     report by the President's Council on Bioethics and other \n     alternative methods that have been suggested encounter \n     equally vexing ethical concerns. Hence, S. 2754 is unneeded \n     and if passed would deflect from the current urgent need for \n     generating new stem cell lines from excess IVF-derived \n     blastocysts.\n           Sincerely,\n       Peter Agre, M.D., Vice Chancellor for Science and \n     Technology, James B.

Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Yes.\n  Mr. COBURN. Is the Senator aware of the research that has been done \non juvenile diabetes thus far in terms of embryonic stem cell research \nand adult stem cell research?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I am not intimately knowledgeable of all of the nuances \nin research that is being done. We had hearings, and we have the \ninformation in our hearing record on a lot of that. Standing here now, \nI don't know all of that.\n  Mr. COBURN. Is the Senator aware that the only successful treatments \nfor juvenile diabetes to come from stem cells have come from adult stem \ncells, and in fact that the embryonic stem cells have one-fiftieth the \namount of insulin, were not effective, and ended after about 80 days \nafter transplantation? Is the Senator aware of that?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Will the Senator repeat that? I was reading something.\n  Mr. COBURN. Is the Senator aware that of the human studies which have \nthus far been done on juvenile diabetes in fact the successful one was \nadult stem cells and the unsuccessful one was embryonic stem cell? Is \nthe Senator aware of that fact?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Let me respond this way: First, I note that the Juvenile \nDiabetes Research Foundation, which represents families all over \nAmerica who are affected with juvenile diabetes, is in support of H.R. \n810. I want that on the record. In fact, they have been one of the \nstrongest supporters.\n  Second, the transplantation of insulin-producing pancreatic cells is \nalready known to reverse the most damaging symptoms of type 1 diabetes. \nThe problem with that is the limited number of organ donors out there \nwho donate pancreases. That seems to be the problem.\n  Could I ask the Senator, are there enough pancreas donors out there \nto take care of everyone with juvenile diabetes?\n  Mr. COBURN. It is not required. Actually, today the science shows \nthat ductal cells from the patient's own pancreas can be induced to \nbecome stem cells that then produce insulin-producing cells. There is \nno transplantation needed. In fact, these ductal cells have been proven \nand demonstrated to produce the same eyelet cells that the patient did \ninitially when they were grown as an embryo.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I have heard this argument before. I am not a scientist. \nI don't know all of the nuances, I would be the first to admit. I do \nknow, however, that every time that has come up, the Juvenile Diabetes \nResearch Association disagrees that this is a viable pathway toward \ncuring all of those with juvenile diabetes.\n  Mr. COBURN. They cannot disagree. It has only been done for 3 months, \nand it is successful. There have been no successful embryonic cells \ntaken from the duct of the pancreas of children with diabetes, \nconverted into cells, and have in fact cured their diabetes.\n  Mr. HARKIN. How many people have been cured of juvenile diabetes with \nthis?\n  Mr. COBURN. For 3 months is all we know. I don't know the numbers. I \nthink it is eight or nine. This protocol is being done in Europe at the \npresent time.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Is it not being done in the United States?\n  Mr. COBURN. No, it is not being done in the United States.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Have any of these findings been published?\n  Mr. COBURN. They have been published in peer-reviewed articles. I \nwould be happy to submit them for the Record.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I would appreciate that.\n  Mr. COBURN. I thank the Senator for allowing me to ask those \nquestions.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank the Senator. There is a good colloquy.\n  I would further ask the Senator from Oklahoma--this has been done for \n3 months--do we have any data to show that this does cure juvenile \ndiabetes? Does it abate it somewhat? I don't know what the outcomes \nhave been for these eight or nine people.\n  Mr. COBURN. Here is the key point that needs to be made in this \ndebate: If you use your own cells, you will not have tumors, you will \nnot have teratomas, and you will not have rejection. If you use \nembryonic stem cells, you will have tumors, you will have teratomas, \nand you will have rejection.\n\n  That is what we know. That is why I, as a scientist, have not raised \nthe life issue here once, but I am adamantly pro-life. I believe the \nscience is so far ahead of this debate. When everyone knows what is \nreally going on in terms of research, they are going to want the \ndollars put into the stem cells, both in terms of dedifferentiation--we \nknow we can differentiate cells backward to make them pluripotent--and \nalso to isolate cells from our own human body to use back on us. That \nis an important part of the debate.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank the Senator.\n  I again say that all the Nobel scientists, all of the leading \nscientists in America simply do not agree with the Senator from \nOklahoma. These are the people involved in cell biology and that kind \nof research.\n  The Senator says embryonic stem cells will produce tumors. We do not \nknow that is true. We do not have any real long-term data to know \nanything about how embryonic stem cells will work later on.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Under the previous order, the majority is recognized for the next 30 \nminutes.\n  Mr. COBURN. I inquire of the Chair, under the previous order, if the \nmajority is not here, who assumes control of the time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time is reserved for the majority to be \nrecognized.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, it is my understanding that Senator Frist \nhas this time. He has advised me I can use the time until he arrives.\n\n[[Page S7582]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. I will spend a few minutes. This is a very emotional \ndebate for every family in this country. Every family in this country \nhas someone who, in fact, has a disease that will be impacted in the \nfuture by research that is ongoing in terms of stem cell research.\n  I make a couple of points. We have heard today a couple of very \nstrong statements that are highly inaccurate.\n  One is that the only way you will cure this is with embryonic stem \ncells. No one knows that. As a matter of fact, most of the cures in \nscience have come not by what we thought was going to happen but by \nwhat happened that surprised us. That is not true.\n  No. 2, there is no ban at the present time on research in this \ncountry on embryonic stem cells. What there is a ban on is using \nadditional Federal funds to create additional stem cells, but \nadditional stem cells can be created outside of the Government.\n  The Senator from South Dakota created a false choice. The false \nchoice is not incineration. There are 400,000 embryos that are frozen \nin this country today; 93 percent of those the parents want to save for \nthemselves. So that leaves us a smaller portion. If you look at the \nnumbers, when you thaw embryos, you have a 50-percent wastage, you lose \n50 percent of them. The false choice Senator Johnson put forward was \nthis: they either get burned up or they get used for embryonic stem \ncell research. This last week, the 108th baby was born through this \nOperation Snowflake--which is adopted embryos--so that is not the only \nchoice.\n  The other thing is, if everyone will recognize, in the fertility \ncommunity in this country, that in Europe, they do not have a problem \nwith excess embryos. We overdo it in this country in terms of creating \nembryos for fertility clinics. We create about four times as many \nobstetrician and fertility specialists as the rest of the world. The \nchoice is not incinerate or use for embryonic stem cell research.\n  The majority leader has arrived. I yield my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I thank both of my colleagues for the \nsuperb comments thus far over the last 30 minutes but, indeed, since we \nstarted at 12:30 today.\n  As I opened this morning, I made it clear that this debate would be \nthe first of the 21st-century dilemmas that involve ethical \nconsiderations and considerations around science, probably the first of \nmany. I say the first; obviously, we have dealt with some other ethical \nissues in medicine over the last 5 years, but much of the discussion \nwill focus around science and ethics and that nexus, that crossing of \nthose two, and the interplay.\n  It is important that we debate this and that all concerns are put on \nthe table, ultimately. These three bills give that opportunity.\n  Let me add that this probably will be the first of many debates like \nthis in the Senate. I know there are a lot of my colleagues who asked: \nWhy are we bringing this up now? Why are we talking about these tough \nissues which do force us to address issues about the distinctions of \nlife, the early days of life and also the hope and the promise of \nscience as it goes forward and that interplay? This Senate will have to \nget used to it.\n  This Senate will have to focus on those issues as we move forward \nbecause science, where it used to be growing at a small clip, is now \ngrowing at leaps and bounds, not exponentially but close to \nexponentially, and will continue to do so.\n  Less than a century ago, we did not have antibiotics, we did not have \nvaccines. We had measles, mumps, smallpox, polio--all diseases that \nravaged our populations, in this country and around the world. Because \nof science, because of public health initiatives, they have essentially \nbeen eradicated. We will see forward momentum. That momentum will be \naccelerated in biomedical research.\n  I mentioned earlier today in opening the debate that when people look \nback at the 21st century, I would say maybe the next decade is the \ndecade of the cells. Much of our discussion is about developmental \nbiology. That has built upon the foundation of the shoulders of new \nknowledge regarding molecular and cellular development, coupled with \nthe new understanding that is a product of a sequencing of the human \ngenome from a decade of the last century.\n\n  What is important is that the rules, regulations, guidelines, and the \nframework must be defined and in large part must be defined by this \nSenate. That is our responsibility as Senators, as representatives of \nthe American people, their attitude, their thought, their philosophies. \nThey are our constituents.\n  A second point I made when I first started talking about stem cell \nresearch 5 years ago is we will have to continually assess and then \nreassess in light of advancing science certain rules, guidelines, and \nregulations we put in place. In part, that is why we are here today.\n  We have three bills before the Senate. My colleagues have talked \nabout those three bills: the Fetus Farming Prohibition Act, the \nAlternative Pluripotent Stem Cell Therapies Enhancement Act, and the \nStem Cell Research Enhancement Act. Each addresses a different facet of \nthe issues raised by advancing research, advancing developmental \nbiology, advancing stem cell research. Each one of them demands \nthoughtful consideration and deliberation which will play out over the \ncourse of today and tomorrow.\n  I spent my entire professional career as a transplant surgeon, a \nprofessional who specializes in moving living tissue from one person to \nanother person--say an organ or a heart. Take out a heart, put in a \nheart. Take out a lung, put in a lung. Thus, my interest before coming \nto this Senate focused on many of the same issues that come before the \nSenate today: advancing science, how do we define ``brain death,'' \nsomething we did in the 1960s, to make transplantation of the human \nheart possible.\n  Thus, it was a little over 5 years ago--on July 18, 2001--that I laid \nout a comprehensive proposal, a framework at that time, which I \nbelieved would both promote stem cell research but also provide an \nethical framework through which such research could be conducted. That \nwas 2001, about 2\\1/2\\ years after embryonic stem cells had just been \ndiscovered by James Thomson at the University of Wisconsin, or the \nhuman embryonic stem cells.\n  At that time, 5 years ago, I laid out 10 specific interdependent \nprinciples. The principles dealt with all types of stem cell research--\nthe adult stem cells, the germ stem cells, embryonic stem cells. They \nhave helped to guide my assessment of stem cell research over the last \n5 years, and they have provided a framework I have used and \nconsistently gone back and adopted as I looked at various pieces of \nlegislation on stem cells before this Senate. I will read those 10 \nprinciples because of their inclusiveness and their interdependence:\n  No. 1, ban embryo creation for research.\n  No. 2, continue funding the ban on the derivation.\n  No. 3, ban human cloning.\n  No. 4, increase adult stem cell research.\n  No. 5, provide funding for embryonic stem cell research only from \nblastocysts that would otherwise be discarded.\n  No. 6, require a rigorous informed-consent process.\n  No. 7, limit the number of stem cell lines.\n  No. 8, establish a strong public research oversight system.\n  No. 9, require ongoing independent scientific and ethical review.\n  No. 10, strengthen and harmonize fetal tissue research restrictions.\n  The principles are meant to stand the test of time even when applied \nto a field as rapidly changing as stem cell research.\n  Yes, I do believe both embryonic and adult stem cell research should \nbe Federally funded but should only be done so within a carefully \nregulated, fully transparent, fully accountable framework, ensuring the \nhighest level of respect for that moral significance of the human \nembryo. But we should fund research when it comes to embryonic stem \ncell research only if those embryos, only if those stem cell lines were \nderived from blastocysts that, with 100 percent certainty, are not \ngoing to be frozen forever, are not going to be adopted but with 100 \npercent certainty and with appropriate consent would be discarded, \nwould be thrown away.\n\n[[Page S7583]]\n\n  Today, we do debate science, developmental biology, and we debate \nethics. We are called upon to confront the distinctions around life's \nearly goings when we do so. As my colleagues know, I am pro-life. I do \nbelieve human life begins at conception. It is at this moment, at \nconception, that the organism is complete--immature, yes, but complete. \nIt is genetically distinct, it is biologically human, living. \nDevelopment is a gradual process, it is a continual process. All of us \nin this Senate were at one time an embryo. It represents human life at \nits earliest stage of development. It is a continuum, coming all the \nway through. That is the science. That is not religion. That is not \nfaith. That is the science. Thus, I believe strongly that an embryo \ndoes have moral significance. It needs to be treated with the utmost \ndignity and respect.\n  We have three bills before the Senate. The Fetus Farming Prohibition \nAct of 2006, the implantation and gestation of the human embryo into \neither a human or an animal for the purpose of aborting for research--\nthat prohibition is what the discussion is about. Clearly, that would \nfall far short of ``utmost dignity and respect.''\n  The bill before the Senate ensures this practice is never employed in \nhuman research in the United States. That purposeful development of a \nhuman embryo, the manufacturing of human life for experimentation and \nits ultimate destruction is morally reprehensible. It offends the \nconscience, degrades the value of human life, and, of course, is not \nmedically necessary. Yet it is a practice that some in the field of \ndevelopmental biology just might be inclined to pursue if those \nguidelines, if those regulations, are not out there. Why? To look at \nthe later stages beyond the embryo in terms of development and how \ncells function, or it might be, as we have heard argued before, that \nthe cells have a different nature after the embryo stage but before \ndelivery of the fetus itself and have more stability or more \ndifferentiation. This particular legislation preempts, it stops that \npossibility.\n  Not only would this be a flagrant lack of respect for nascent human \nlife, but it would also create powerful incentives for women to undergo \nan intense regimen of superovulation drugs and surgery with potentially \ndevastating side effects. It could exploit women, the most likely \ntargets of egg harvesting or fetal farming. Under no circumstances \ncould human fetus farming be labeled ``medical advancement.'' It is the \nexact opposite, an unconscionable regression of the mores that define \nour culture, a culture that upholds respect for life and health.\n  As a transplant surgeon, I have had that opportunity to see firsthand \nhow new medical discoveries and technologies can save lives and make \nlife more fulfilling for others. In fact, my entire professional career \nwas spent on these newer therapies, these newer technologies, in order \nto give others a better life. But at the same time, whether it is in \nthe laboratory, where I spent a lot of time, or at the bedside, I have \nbeen able to also witness how fear can also delay scientific advances \nthat are out there before us.\n  So before us today is that challenge to bridge this divide. And we \nshould reject an outright fear of all technological advance. We have to \nwork together to allow science to advance and to promote those medical \nadvances, whether it is in developmental biology or the human genome \nproject, in order to give a healthier life or more life to others. But \nwe have to do so. That is why we bring these bills to the floor, within \nan ethical and moral framework, in this pursuit.\n  Even while we reject a fear of scientific and technological \nadvancement, we still have to--we must; it is our responsibility--live \nwithin limits. Limits do not hamper human advances but, rather, allow \nus to preserve them and to promote them. That is why we can reject this \npractice of fetus farming while still embracing the hope that is \noffered by stem cell research. Senators Brownback and Santorum worked \nhard to bring this important legislation to the floor, and I hope my \ncolleagues will join me in supporting it.\n  The second bill, the Alternative Pluripotent Stem Cell Therapies \nEnhancement Act, put forth by Senators Santorum and Specter, is a very \nimportant bill, the purpose of which is to step back from and to remove \nthe ethical considerations that surround the unique potential that \nthese pluripotent stem cells have.\n  Five years ago, when I came to the floor in 2001, I said the \nfollowing:\n\n       We should not let the potential of this research drive the \n     moral considerations themselves. . . . We do not know what \n     the next great discovery is going to be 6 months from now. . \n     . . So the oversight process has to be responsive, has to be \n     ongoing. It has to recognize that science moves very quickly.\n\n  That is why we are here. We recognize that science cannot be \npracticed in a vacuum. We need to promote and accelerate these medical \nadvances. But we also need to ensure that research practices are \nchanneled along lines that respect human life and dignity.\n  What seemed impossible even 5 years ago now seems possible. Exciting \ntechniques are beginning to emerge that just may make it unnecessary to \nhave to destroy that embryo, to disaggregate or dismember that embryo, \nin order to obtain cells that have the pluripotent properties that are \neither exactly like or very similar to the embryonic stem cells. And we \nhave talked about it a little bit earlier today, and in the past, as to \nthe unique property these embryonic stem cells have, which is this \npluripotentiality, which has two concepts to it: No. 1 is that they can \nbecome any tissue--theoretically, they can become any tissue--and that \nis in the differentiation; and, secondly, this overall process of self-\nrenewal, that they can renew and replicate themselves again and again \nand again.\n  An adult stem cell might be reprogrammable. You might be able to \ndirectly reprogram that cell to an earlier stage to make it more \npliable, to take it back to an earlier or closer to an embryonic phase. \nAdult stem cells can be what we call multipotential, and that means \nthey can differentiate, and you can back them down to differentiate \ninto certain tissues. The embryonic stem cell is pluripotential, and \nthe range of tissues it can differentiate to are much greater.\n  But this reprogramming, coming back earlier to the adult stem cell, \nearlier and earlier along its chronological development, gives the \nopportunity to send that adult stem cell into various regions; thus, \nthis direct reprogramming concept opens up great potential. To me, and \nI would hope to every Member of this body, this type of research--\nresearch that stops short of having to destroy an embryo--to obtain \npluripotent cells through alternative ways should be supported, and I \nhope can be supported, by everybody in this body.\n  In May of last year, 2005, the President's Council on Bioethics \nissued a report bringing these alternative sources attention. At that \ntime, I asked and worked with several of my colleagues to put together \na piece of legislation for which we could say Federal funding will go \nin that direction to derive these alternative means of developing these \npluripotential cells. With more Federal support, and with more \nemphasis, these newer methods may pay off hugely in terms of scientific \nadvantage and clinical advantage.\n  They may be the way to bridge these moral and ethical differences \namong people who hold wildly different and broadly different views, \nwhich we will actually hear on the floor over the course of today and \ntomorrow on stem cell research. Why? Because they avoid any destruction \nof the human embryo. The alternative methods of potentially deriving \npluripotent cells, that were spelled out in the Council on Bioethics \nreport of May of last year, include: extraction from embryos that are \nno longer living; a second proposal was blastomere extraction, which \ninvolves a nonlethal and nonharmful extraction of the blastomeres from \nembryos--and, indeed, several researchers over the course of the last \nyear, since that proposal was initially made, have reported success in \nthat regard--thirdly, extraction from artificially created organisms \nthat are not embryos, but embryolike--this was initially proposed by \nBill Hurlbut at Stanford and subsequently demonstrated by Dr. Rudolf \nJaenisch and others at MIT--fourthly, the direct reprogramming of adult \nor somatic cells to a pluripotent state through fusion with embryonic \ncell lines.\n\n  We are already driving and promoting ethical alternatives such as\n\n[[Page S7584]]\n\nadult stem cell research and therapies and cord cell research, both of \nwhich have been important to date in the treatment, as well as other \ntypes of therapy.\n  Today, adult stem cell research is the only type of stem cell \nresearch that has resulted in proven treatments for human patients. At \nthe Multiorgan Transplant Center that I established and directed at \nVanderbilt, we did bone marrow transplants, which are commonly done for \ntreatment of many types of cancers now; at that point, for many types \nof blood disease. We have had bone marrow transplants done in this \ncountry for, oh, about 40 years. The first bone marrow transplant was \ndone in 1968.\n  Stem cells taken from cord blood have shown great promise in treating \nthe myeloproliferative disorders, the leukemias, congenital immune \nsystem disorders.\n  Recently, cord blood cells have shown some ability to become natural \ncells, which could lead to treatments for more heart disease and \nParkinson's disease. The first cord blood transplant was done about 20 \nyears ago in 1988.\n  So every day we unlock more of the mysteries of human life, more ways \nto promote and enhance our health. This compels the profound questions \nwe address, moral questions with which we understandably struggle. \nTransplantation itself posed a question similar to those we face with \nstem cell research, a little bit different in that organs were \ntransplanted principally, when I got started, at the end stage of life. \nPeople without a heart would be dying 4 to 6 months later. We had to \ndefine, as I mentioned earlier, what is brain death. We had ethical \nconsiderations about how to allocate a very few number of organs to the \nmany people who waited, which literally meant some people would die \nwaiting for that scarce organ--all ethical considerations.\n  If we can devise a moral and ethical framework, then it is my belief \nwe will have the chance to save many lives and make many countless \nother lives more fulfilling. That is why it is imperative we get our \nstem cell policy right scientifically, morally, and ethically.\n  A lot of diseases have been mentioned on the floor, and I guess over \nthe next 2 days I will have the opportunity to come back and talk about \nsome of those particular diseases. Adult stem cells, we know, are so \npowerful. They have effectively treated so many diseases today. I \nmentioned bone marrow transplantation. But the list will be coming to \nthe floor, and they have come to the floor, about the number of \ntherapies with bone marrow transplantation and other adult stem cells. \nEmbryonic stem cells, however, do have this unique capacity of self-\nreplication, self-renewal over time, and greater potential to \ndifferentiate into other types of tissues. Unlike other stem cells, \nthese embryonic stem cells are pluripotent, where adult stem cells tend \nto be multipotent. That means the embryonic stem cells have the \ncapacity to become a greater range of types of tissues. They are \ncapable of renewing themselves and replicating themselves over and over \nagain indefinitely.\n  A number of people have brought up what the current administration \npolicy is. As we all know, on August 9, 2001, President Bush laid out \nhis principles and put in place a policy, which I supported, that for \nthe first time allowed Federal funding for embryonic stem cell \nresearch. The President's policy was consistent with my initial \nprinciples--my seventh principle: to limit the number of stem cell \nlines. In order to accomplish that limiting the number of lines, the \nPresident used a date: August 9, 2001.\n  The President's policy also says: Let's support stem cell lines that \nhave been derived from blastocysts that were going to be thrown away or \ndiscarded. His policy is the same in that regard. The cell lines we \nfederally support today all came from blastocysts that were left over \nby in vitro fertilization that were going to be discarded. The \nPresident basically said it was OK to do that before August 9, but \nafter August 9 that will not be allowed anymore, and we will only fund \nthose cell lines.\n  I thought it was very important that Congress continue oversight. \nRemember, 5 years ago or 6 years ago, I said we are going to be coming \nback to this again and again and again. I think that oversight \nabsolutely is critical.\n  This third bill, the Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act, which is the \nHouse-passed bill, the Specter-Hatch, the Castle-DeGette bill, is the \nbill most people will be spending most of their time on over the next \nday and a half.\n  Over the last 5 years--while it was widely believed when the \nPresident put forth his policy that there would be 78 embryonic stem \ncell lines available for Federal funding--we have learned, through \nscience, that has not been the case. In fact, of the initial \nanticipated 78 lines, there are, right now, about 22 lines that are \neligible. There is some concern that these lines are becoming less and \nless stable and less replicative than initially thought.\n  While we know that this embryonic stem cell research is at a very \nearly stage--remember, these embryonic stem cells were discovered, \nfirst, just in 1998; unlike adult stem cells, where we have 40 years of \nresearch history--we do know that the embryonic stem cell research is \nmoving fast and moving quickly.\n  The question is: Are there a sufficient number of cell lines to keep \nthat research going? I believe right now that the current policy unduly \nrestricts the number of cell lines. As I have said, I am going to be \nsupporting and voting for H.R. 810, the Stem Cell Research Enhancement \nAct. I do not think it is an ideal piece of legislation. It has a few \nessential shortcomings as written. It restricts funding to blastocysts \nleft over after IVF that would otherwise be discarded. And that is \nconsistent with my fifth principle. But the shortcomings do have to be \naddressed somewhere.\n  First, it lacks a strong ethical and scientific oversight mechanism. \nSecond, the bill does not prohibit financial or other incentives \nbetween scientists and fertility clinics. Third, the bill does not \nspecify whether the patients or clinic staff or anyone else has the \nfinal say about whether an embryo will be implanted or will be \ndiscarded.\n  And were circumstances different and had the House not acted so \nquickly and sent the bill over--I think we should have had the \nopportunity to have a thorough examination and rewrite of that bill. \nHowever, even with those reservations, I do support the Stem Cell \nResearch Enhancement Act. As I said, it is completely consistent with \nmy principles from 5 years ago.\n  Many of my colleagues, such as I, have spent countless hours \ngrappling with this issue--the future of stem cell research. How do we \nbalance pro-life positions with the potential for new life and health \noffered by stem cell research? There is, perhaps, an inclination to \navoid such difficult issues, to ignore them and let others debate. But \nI believe and feel strongly that we must participate in defining \nresearch surrounding the culture of life.\n  If we don't do that, it will define us. Finally, I thank all of my \ncolleagues. I know we will have a good debate over the next day. We \nwill have those votes at 2:45 tomorrow. I hope those votes will show \nthere are areas of consensus among us and that where differences exist \nwe can respectfully articulate and vote our conscience.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the minority is in \ncontrol of time for the next 30 minutes.\n  The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I know that one of the cosponsors of the \nbill, one of the great leaders in the Senate on stem cell research, has \narrived on the floor to speak. I know the Chair will be recognizing her \nshortly.\n  I wanted, again, to just take a moment to sort of repeat for emphasis \nsake what has been said before. I think the distinguished majority \nleader referred to that also. It is just that here we have an instance \nwhere so many leading scientists around, U.S. Nobel Prize winners, and \nall the disease groups--I submitted a compendium of about 205, and I \nthink that may soar to 500 or 600 by the end of the day--are supporting \nH.R. 810.\n  Lest one thinks that, A, either they have all been hoodwinked into \nthinking this bill is something it is not or, B, that these are \nmalevolent people who want to just destroy embryos without any thought \nabout the morality or the ethics of it, they are simply mistaken. First \nof all, none of these people have been hoodwinked, and most of these \nscientists are as ethical\n\n[[Page S7585]]\n\nand moral a people as you could find anywhere. They are saying let's \nuse these blastocysts, embryos, or however you want to define them to \nenhance life, cure disease and illness, rather than having them be \ndiscarded, and to do it in a very ethical manner. That is what this \nbill provides.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise to support the Stem Cell \nResearch Enhancement Act. Passage of this legislation will finally \nallow scientists to fully pursue the promise of stem cell research. It \nwill offer hope to millions of our people. Mr. President, we have \nwaited a long time for this day. Earlier, Senator Harkin spoke to the \nfact that it was in 1998 when he and Senator Specter introduced the \nfirst bill dealing with stem cell research. I recall that year I \nintroduced one of the first bills dealing with ethical standards \nsurrounding stem cell research. So it has been 8 years.\n  Now, finally, the House of Representatives overwhelmingly approved \nbipartisan legislation. In the intervening time, we have all heard from \npatients, survivors, and scientists who are desperate to pursue this \nresearch that one day could lead to treatments and cures for diabetes, \ncancer and, yes, even spinal cord injury. Forty Nobel laureates have \nweighed in with their support, as did former First Lady Nancy Reagan.\n  While we were waiting, we lost Christopher and Dana Reeve, tireless \nadvocates of stem cell research, and an inspiration for all of us. \nMillions more American families experienced firsthand the devastation \nwrought by catastrophic illnesses.\n  My colleagues and I, Senators Specter, Harkin, Kennedy, Hatch, and \nSmith, worked tirelessly to bring this to a vote. We pushed privately, \nwe wrote letters, we gave speeches, and we held press conferences to \nhighlight the plight of patients who are living with illnesses day in \nand day out.\n  Finally, after all of this pleading and delay, the Senate is acting.\n  I thank my colleagues for their longstanding leadership on this \nissue, and I am also very grateful to the majority leader, Senator \nFrist, for his support for stem cell research and his work with his \ncaucus to reach this agreement that has made this debate possible.\n  For all of the controversy that it is generating, the Castle-DeGette \nStem Cell Research Enhancement Act is remarkably simple. It reverses \nthe failed policy announced by President Bush in 2001 when he \nrestricted Federal funding to stem cell lines already in existence.\n\n  At the time, the President himself recognized the great promise of \nstem cell research. He sought to find middle ground, announcing a \npolicy that provided Federal funding for more than 60 preexisting \ngenetically diverse stem cell lines. This was morally acceptable, he \nsaid, because the life-or-death decision for these stem cell lines had \nalready been made.\n  Unfortunately, the policy did not work out as promised. These \navailable lines are all contaminated with mouse feeder cells and, \ntherefore, are useless for human research purposes. They don't have the \ndiverse genetic makeup that may be necessary to find cures to benefit \nall Americans. Researchers cannot use them to examine rare and deadly \ngenetic diseases.\n  Castle-DeGette states that embryos to be discarded from in vitro \nfertilization clinics may be used in federally funded stem cell \nresearch no matter when they were created.\n  While opponents have suggested that this bill will lead us down a \nslippery slope, the parameters created by the bill are actually \nnumerous and they are very strict:\n  The embryos must be left over following fertility treatment.\n  It must be clear that the embryos will be discarded.\n  The people donating the embryos must provide written consent.\n  These donors may not be compensated for their donation.\n  These restrictions mean that over 400,000 embryos could become \navailable, all while ensuring that researchers meet the highest of \nethical standards.\n  Let us be clear. We are talking about embryos that will be destroyed \nwhether or not this bill becomes law. It is an indisputable fact that \nthese embryos have no future.\n  We should not confuse the research permitted under this bill with the \nactivities described under the two other bills currently before us. I \nam going to support these bills. Yet it is important to realize that \ntheir passage will do nothing to change the status quo.\n  The Fetus Farming Prohibition Act bans activities that occur in \nhorror movies, not in our research labs. We should not allow these \nfarfetched and frightening techniques, which no respected scientist \nanywhere endorses, to distract from the plight of millions of Americans \nseeking cures from devastating diseases.\n  This debate is also not about the myriad research approaches \nenvisioned in the Alternative Pluripotent Stem Cell Therapies \nEnhancement Act, as introduced by my colleagues, Senators Specter and \nSantorum. This research can already be funded with Federal dollars. \nRespected scientists are examining a variety of ways to create these \nmultipurpose cells and, of course, this work should continue.\n  We simply don't know which research approaches will prove fruitful \nand which will fail. Alternative techniques may lead eventually to \ncures for serious afflictions, or they may not. Scientists, not \nSenators, should determine what research to pursue.\n  Supporting only the Specter-Santorum alternative is not an \nendorsement of stem cell research. It is an affirmation of a policy \nthat is leaving American researchers far behind in one of the most \nimportant fields of scientific discovery, and I want to spend a moment \non that.\n  Because of President Bush's restrictions, some of our best and \nbrightest scientists are leaving the United States to work overseas in \ncountries that have embraced the promise of comprehensive stem cell \nresearch. This brain drain has hit my State particularly hard. Let me \ngive you a few examples.\n  Roger Peterson, a renowned scientist, left the University of \nCalifornia Medical Center in San Francisco in 2001, citing the \nunfriendly research climate in the United States. He is now conducting \nhuman stem cell research at Cambridge University in the United Kingdom. \nHe and his UK team are exploring the biology behind pluripotent, or \nmultipurpose stem cells, and are looking for ways to use them for \ntreatment. He would not have had Federal funding to do this work in the \nUnited States, so he left.\n  Dr. Judith Swain, from the University of California San Diego, will \nleave for Singapore in September, where she will work at Singapore's \nstate-funded research institute called Biopolis. Her husband, Dr. \nEdward Holmes, also of the University of California at San Diego, is a \nranking official in California's stem cell agency. He is also leaving \nfor Singapore.\n  NIH researchers, Neal Copeland and Nancy Jenkins, turned down offers \nto join Stanford University's stem cell department. They, too, are \nmoving to Singapore. Copeland has said that he selected Singapore \nbecause of its ``unfettered support of human embryonic stem cell \nresearch.''\n  These are but a few examples of the costs of this President's policy.\n  Researchers are attracted by the federal funding provided in at least \n10 other nations--Germany, Finland, France, Sweden, United Kingdom, \nSouth Korea, Singapore, Israel, China, and Australia. These investments \ntotal hundreds of millions of dollars that are already producing \ntangible progress.\n  Sweden funds, with federal funds, 400 researchers today. South Korea \nand China are each funding an additional 300. Australia has pledged $90 \nmillion through 2011. This investment has already paid off, as \nAustralian researchers have discovered a way to manipulate stem cells \ninto lung cells. This technology could one day be used to treat cystic \nfibrosis.\n  Scientists from around the world have come to Singapore's Institute \nof Bioengineering and Nanotechnology. There, they are using stem cells \nto produce artificial kidneys. This could one day free people from the \nburden of kidney dialysis.\n  Researchers in other countries now author an increasing proportion of \nstem cell papers than those in the United States.\n  Foreign researchers have derived almost three-quarters of the world's \nnew\n\n[[Page S7586]]\n\nstem cell lines, moving quickly ahead of our country, the United \nStates.\n  Other nations have the money, the researchers, the facilities, and \nthe new stem cell lines they need to move forward. They are learning \nmore about stem cells every day and laying the foundation for \ngroundbreaking cures.\n  American scientists, on the other hand, cannot obtain Federal funding \nto do this work. These Federal funding restrictions have a real world \nimpact on ongoing research.\n  American scientists are making great strides with work on mouse stem \ncells. They are showing what could be possible if there is Federal \nfunding to extend this work into humans.\n  Researchers at Stanford University have recently turned cells derived \nfrom mouse embryos into one of the building blocks of blood vessels. \nThis advance means they may eventually be able to grow entirely new \nblood vessels, offering great promise to patients suffering from heart \ndisease. But without Federal funds, it is unlikely they can get the \nstem cell lines to be able to do the human research.\n  A research team at Johns Hopkins used cells from mouse embryos to \nregenerate nerves in paralyzed rats. After treatment, many of the rats \nregained enough strength to walk and bear weight on their previously \nparalyzed hind legs.\n  Mr. President, do you know what this means? This means it might--just \nmight--be possible to do something science said could never be done, \nand that is to regenerate a severed spinal column, to regenerate the \nnerves which scientists always thought never again could be \nregenerated.\n  We would never have thought discoveries such as this were possible \neven a few years ago. So think of what it means for every paraplegic or \nquadriplegic to know that there is hope out there, that the first rat \ntests have shown it works?\n  The next step is the human stem cell lines, to be able to carry out \nthat research on humans, and that is exactly what we are talking about \ntoday.\n  Scientists now must work to translate these promising advances into \ncures for humans. Such a feat will almost certainly require access to \nviable lines of human stem cells, and unless we pass Castle-DeGette and \nunless the President signs Castle-DeGette, these lines will not be \navailable in the United States to regenerate a severed spinal column, \nto regenerate blood vessels, or to do anything else.\n  Mike Armstrong, an old friend and chairman of the Johns Hopkins board \nof trustees, made this very point in a letter he wrote stating news of \nthis advance. Here is what he said:\n\n       Treatments not only for paralysis, but for ALS, for \n     multiple sclerosis, and similar diseases of the brain now \n     seem possible. The exact timeframe is impossible to predict, \n     but it will almost certainly depend on the availability of \n     Federal funding.\n\n  It will depend on the availability of Federal funding, and that is \nwhat is at stake in this debate. He goes on to say:\n\n       The level of funding that will ultimately be required to \n     advance this field of science to human trials, however, \n     suggests that Federal funding will be necessary. Yet, under \n     current Federal policy, the only stem cell lines eligible for \n     Federal funding were created using mouse feeder cells and \n     could never be used in clinical trials with humans.\n\n  Could never be used in clinical trials for humans.\n  I am particularly proud of the commitment demonstrated by California \nscientists and activists in the face of these restrictions. In 2004, \nCalifornia voters approved a proposition, proposition 71. That \nproposition created and funded the California Institute of Regenerative \nMedicine. It funded it with $3 billion of taxpayers' dollars over 10 \nyears, and it supported promising research conducted in my State. This \nwork will be done with careful ethical oversight. It also bans human \nreproductive cloning, something we all agree is immoral and unethical.\n  This investment, hopefully, once it gets past the court tests, will \nmake California a leader in this industry and in finding cures that \nwill change the lives of suffering patients.\n  Other States are making similar investments. Connecticut, Illinois, \nNew Jersey, Maryland, and others are considering after 5 years of delay \nbecause of the restriction on Federal funding--they are taking steps to \nmove this important work forward on a State basis. But--and here is the \nbut--a patchwork, State-by-State approach is no way to run science \npolicy. States have many other responsibilities, such as funding \neducation, building infrastructure, and so on, and we shouldn't expect \nthem to solely carry the burden of funding one of the most promising \nfields of science.\n  There is a reason we invest so much in the National Institutes of \nHealth and the biomedical research they conduct. The NIH can then set \nnational standards and ensure that research is not being duplicated and \nto see that it is carried out under ethical standards. This is \nsomething everyone should want. You should want that Federal oversight \nof NIH over all research funding that is funded with Federal dollars.\n  It is also important to remember that this debate is about real \npeople whose lives are impacted by illness every single day, day in, \nday out. I have heard from so many Californians who have been \npersonally impacted by diseases that could one day be cured with stem \ncell research. I want to tell a few of those stories.\n  Leslie Bishop Franco from Oakland, CA, wrote to me to say she \nsupports stem cell research because her mother was diagnosed with \nAlzheimer's at the age of 57. Her mother quickly became unable to work \nand then unable to care for herself. Leslie and her sisters and \nbrothers cared not only for their own young children but also for their \nmother. This is something many families know all too well.\n\n  Leslie writes that even if stem cell research does not ``lead to a \ncure for Alzheimer's as it has the potential in other diseases like \nParkinson's and diabetes, it will provide crucial insights into the \ndisease and the usefulness of new drugs.''\n  Mark Siegel from Los Angeles has suffered from Parkinson's for 8 \nyears. For over half the time he has been ill, the President's policies \nhave slowed stem cell research. Mark was diagnosed when he was 36 years \nold. One of my sons-in-law was just diagnosed, and he is 44 years old.\n  What happens is Parkinson's slowly erodes one's motor control. Mark \nSiegel's condition had forced him to change jobs, and he is afraid we \nare losing the race against time to find a cure and save his life.\n  Jennifer Heumann from Huntington Beach, CA, has been living with \njuvenile diabetes since she was 2 years old, and she is now 16. She \nsays diabetes hasn't stopped her from playing varsity tennis or going \nto high school dances, but she knows her disease can cause serious \ncomplications. Without a cure, she has a 65-percent chance of dying \nfrom heart disease or stroke and a 60-percent chance of developing \nnervous system damage.\n  Jennifer writes:\n\n       These are the cold, hard facts, but I am not content to \n     admit they are my destiny. I believe that a cure is in sight, \n     and that embryonic stem cell research may be the key to \n     finding this cure. If this is the case, how can we justify \n     passing up this opportunity?\n\n  We all should ask that question. This impressive young woman is hard \nto argue with. She makes a very eloquent point, and until we know what \nkinds of research could lead to cures for these catastrophic diseases, \nwe should support scientists and we should push ahead every possible \nlead.\n  These patients and family members represent only a few of the tens of \nthousands of Californians I have heard from who support stem cell \nresearch. As a matter of fact, by the latest poll, 72 percent of \nAmericans support stem cell research.\n  We don't want to spread false hope. There is still much we don't \nunderstand about stem cells. Some of the cures may never come to \nfruition, but unless we allow our scientists to continue their work, we \nwill never, ever know. How can any of us tell a patient suffering from \njuvenile diabetes, a cancer victim, or a young man with heart disease, \nthat the Senate decided not to allow researchers to pursue all the \nscientific leads that may one day offer them a cure? How can we say \nthat? How can we say we know better? How can we say because of a small \nproportion of people's beliefs we are going to stop all Federal \nresearch in the United States of America?\n  Last week, Karl Rove declared that the President is emphatic about \nvetoing this legislation. I hope not. The President himself \nacknowledged the great promise of stem cells back in 2001, and with the \nhealth of millions of Americans at stake, it is my hope that if and \nwhen this bill tomorrow afternoon passes the Senate and if and when\n\n[[Page S7587]]\n\nit goes to the President of the United States, he will reconsider his \nveto threat. Too many lives depend upon the advances which may well be \npossible.\n  Either you are for stem cell research or you are not. It is that \nsimple. True support for stem cells means lifting the restrictions from \nhampering some of the most promising research, and only Castle-DeGette, \nonly H.R. 810 will do that. No matter what the President decides on \nother legislation we are considering today, rejecting H.R. 810 is a \nrejection of science. It is a rejection of the hopes of millions of \npatients. This vote and the President's reaction to it should not be \nabout assuaging a small but vocal minority with views far from the \nmainstream of 72 percent of the American people. Patients and their \nfamilies deserve more than the President's first veto. How would you \nlike it if you were President of the United States and the first veto \nof your political career were a veto of the one thing that offers hope \nfor millions of Americans suffering from catastrophic disease? The one \nthing out there.\n  I want to assure these patients that my colleagues and I will not \nstop fighting for this. We will continue to push in every way possible. \nPatients suffering from these catastrophic illnesses have already \nwaited too long. American scientists have already fallen behind their \ninternational counterparts, and the time has come to finally pass \nCastle-DeGette on a sweeping bipartisan basis, just as the House of \nRepresentatives did 13 months ago.\n  Thank you very much. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the next 30 minutes \nwill be controlled by the majority.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, Senator Brownback has graciously allowed \nme to take 10 minutes of his time. I would like to do that at this \ntime.\n  First of all, I would like to set the record straight: the United \nStates remains the world's leader of published stem cell articles and \nhuman embryonic stem cell articles. Specifically, it was April 6 of \nthis year when that statement was made. From 1998 through the end of \n2005, the United States published 46 percent of all papers published \nworldwide--by far the single largest proportion. The remaining 54 \npercent was divided among 17 other countries.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthe latest peer review articles that have been brought up to date for \nthis year. This is about 15 pages long, and it has multiple entries. \nFor every disease that has been mentioned on the Senate floor by those \nsupporting the embryonic stem cell research, there are treatments \nongoing today using adult stem cells.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, the other thing I think we ought to make \nsure of--and I just want to go back. The Senator from California claims \n72 percent of Americans favor stem cell research. That is true. That is \ntrue, if you ask it that way. But if you ask it: Should your tax \ndollars be used to destroy embryos to then create a research mechanism, \nit falls to 38 percent. So there is a difference between the ethical \ndilemma. I understand people can honorably disagree on the ethical \ndilemma, but we ought to be truthful about what the polling actually \nsays. If you specifically say what we are doing, you get a much \ndifferent answer.\n  I want to talk for a minute about something the majority leader \ndiscussed. He is a transplant surgeon. There are two problems \ntransplant surgeons face. One is enough organs, which is a difficult \nproblem in our country today, but the second problem is rejection. \nNobody is talking about the long-term consequences of where we go.\n  Let's assume everything that everyone says about embryonic stem cell \nresearch is right. I am highly skeptical of that, but let's assume that \nit is. You still have this little problem called histocompatibility; in \nother words, rejection. Whatever you do with it, you are going to have \na problem with rejection. And the thing that is so exciting about germ \ncell--and I want to explain that for a minute. Germ cells--pluripotent \nstem cells--just as powerful as embryonic, they can do everything that \nembryonic can. They don't have that problem. No. 1, they are \npluripotent; No. 2, they continue to reproduce pluripotent cells just \nlike embryonic. That is new research. That is 6 months old. It was \ndiscovered here first. It was duplicated in Germany last month. So that \nis a brand new study.\n  The point is, you don't have rejection because you are taking your \nown cells to create a pluripotent cell, and that is the wonderful thing \nabout adult stem cells, about cord blood stem cells, about germ cells, \nis that they create a pluripotent cell. There is no rejection. So when \nyou hear all the talk about embryonic stem cell research, the thing to \nremember is when you get the treatment, you are going to have the side \neffects like everybody else who has the transplant--if it works--and \nthat is immune-suppressive drugs. You are going to have to have them. \nThe only way not to have that is to do fetal farming or human cloning, \nwhere you clone yourself and then take part of what you have cloned \nback, which we already know is illegal and is banned. So it is \nimportant for the debate to focus on that.\n  Everybody in this country wants cures. Everybody wants to do the \nthing that will get us there the fastest with the least complications, \nand we want to invest our dollars in what will be most successful.\n  One of the things my dad taught me is to look around the world, and \nif you want to see what is happening, follow the money. If you look \naround the world today, the world as a whole, and you look at where the \nmoney is being spent, it is not being spent on embryonic stem cells. It \nis being spent on stem cells from us, just like we had the debate a \nmoment ago. We now know ductal cells from somebody's pancreas can \ncreate new insulin-producing cells. We know now the mucosa, the lining \nof your mouth, can create cells to make you a new cornea. You don't \nhave to have a cornea transplant in the future because your own cells \nare going to be able to create a new cornea. We also know that we have \nstem cells in our body that can take away cystoid macular edema, this \naging process where we as seniors start to lose our vision--the \ncloudiness--the macular area of the retina starts to fall away. All of \nthese wonderful things that we are doing versus nothing that has been \naccomplished.\n  I also would refer to the reference of the Senator from California to \nthe renal success. It wasn't done with an embryonic stem cell, it was \ndone with an adult stem cell. That research was all adult stem cells. \nSo we end up tending to confuse what has really happened.\n  The fact is, all the success in treatment, all the success in terms \nof who is willing to invest private capital, where they are putting it, \nthey are not putting it in embryonic. There is a reason for it. It is \nbecause in the long term it won't be the best treatment. It is fun \nscience. As a doctor, I will tell you there could be no more fun or \nrewarding or interesting science than embryonic stem cell because you \ncan turn things on and turn things off. There is no question about it. \nBut what we are finding out is you can actually do that with our own \ncells, our own stem cells.\n  This idea of de-differentiation--and I want to explain that for a \nminute because we are going to hear a lot about it in the next 10 \nyears--we take one of your stem cells, one of your multipotent--not \ntotipotent, not pluri potent, but multi--and reverse its mechanism \nwhere we make it pluripotent. We are doing that in several stem cells \nnow with an enzyme called reversa, where they are reversing the cell \nstructure and making it revert back to what it was; in other words, \ngrow in reverse to become pluripotent.\n  So I hope everybody will remember, this isn't a choice about cures or \nno cures. We are getting cures like crazy right now with adult stem \ncells and cord blood. We are going to be doing tons more when this germ \ncell comes forward. There is no question the scientific community is \nextremely excited about germ cell pluripotent stem cells because it has \nall the potential that an embryonic stem cell has and none of the \nproblems.\n  With that, I yield back my remaining time, and I thank the Senator \nfrom Kansas.\n\n[[Page S7588]]\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\nPEER-REVIEWED REFERENCES SHOWING APPLICATIONS OF ADULT STEM CELLS THAT \nPRODUCE THERAPEUTIC BENEFIT OR HUMAN PATIENTS (NOT A COMPLETE LISTING, \n                           SAMPLE REFERENCES)\n\n              Adult Stem Cells--Hematopoietic Replacement\n\n\n                                cancers\n\n     Brain tumors--medulloblastoma and glioma\n       Dunkel, IJ; ``High-dose chemotherapy with autologous stem \n     cell rescue for malignant brain tumors''; Cancer Invest. 18, \n     492-493; 2000\n       Abrey, LE et al.; ``High dose chemotherapy with autologous \n     stem cell rescue in adults with malignant primary brain \n     tumors''; J.

Mr. President, I want to thank my colleague from \nOklahoma. He is learned. He has spent the time to study these issues as \na doctor. He has worked on these issues and he cares a great deal about \nthem, and I appreciate his time and his focus on this issue.\n  I want to discuss a few additional things in response to the comments \nthat have been made thus far. I want to get back to what we are talking \nabout. We are talking about destroying young human life for research \npurposes. I will show a picture of that so people will get the idea--\nand I know people do--but it is important to remember we all started \nout looking like this. Even the Presiding Officer, as handsome as he \nis, looked like this at one point in time. Just a clump of cells--that \nwas him.\n  This is a particular young person by the name of Hannah with whom I \njust met a few hours ago. This is when she was adopted as a frozen \nembryo, and this shows her development taking place. If you destroy her \nhere, we don't get her here. That is the key. She was called a \nsnowflake: an adopted frozen embryo.\n  I hope some people who are maybe watching or hear about this, if they \nhave frozen human embryos, they consider putting them up for adoption \nbecause a number of people want to adopt them.\n  A couple of people adopted Hannah. They had fertility problems \nthemselves, could not conceive. They used IVF, and so adopted her as a \nsnowflake, as a frozen embryo. She was implanted, and now we have \nHannah. Hannah is quite--I guess you would say out of the mouths of \nbabes, children, comes great wisdom.\n  This is a chart she did last year when she was in Washington. When \nthe House was considering legislation--this same legislation--she did \nthis chart, this letter that kids write, my kids write--I love them. \nShe said--this is\n\n[[Page S7592]]\n\nHannah--snowflake: We're kids, I love you. Then she draws three \npictures here below. This is her smiling because she got adopted, and \nshe is here. Here is another frozen embryo--these are embryos--that is \nsad because he is still sitting in a frozen state, and then here is one \nthat, as she explains, is saying: What, are you going to kill me? This \nwas her explanation to her mother who just gave this chart to me.\n  I hope people really would think about that. This is not just a clump \nof tissue. This is not just a group of a few cells. This is not a hair \nfollicle. This is not a fingernail. This is Hannah. And, if nurtured, \nshe grows to be just this beautiful child. We have a lot of them, \nfrozen embryos, and I hope people will consider putting them up for \nadoption because there are a lot of people who want to adopt them.\n  My colleagues talked about cures. I want cures. I have talked a lot \nabout cures here on the floor. I have talked about it for a lot of \nyears. There are 72 clinical human trials using adult cord research. If \nwe want the people Senator Feinstein and others talked about to get \ncures now, the certain way to do this is to not fund embryonic stem \ncell research. The people she is talking about are not going to be \ncured any time soon.\n  I want to read some quotes from scientists talking about cures from \nembryonic stem cell research. I want to lay my hands on this real quick \nso that people can hear what the scientists are saying about this \nparticular area. Let me get to that in a second, as soon as we can pull \nthat out from the notebook.\n  I want to hit a second point on this and then print this for the \nRecord. Mr. President, I will ask unanimous consent that this be \nprinted in the Record at the end of my statement.\n  Mr. President, this is a series of one-page--a cover article on stem \ncells, embryonic stem cells forming tumors. We have talked about this \nbeing a problem. This has been a problem on fetal tissue research, \nabout 15 years ago. This stack is of the front pages of peer-reviewed \narticles citing embryonic stem cells creating tumors when implanted in \nother animals. Let me just read a few of these summations. This is just \nthe front cover, and people can look up the whole article if they want.\n  More than 70 percent of the mice that received embryonic stem cells \nderived neuro processors--or precursor cells developed teratomas, 70 \npercent teratomas, tumors. That was a 2006 article.\n  Rats grafted with embryonic stem cells de-differentiated in vitro for \n16 days developed severe teratomas--tumors. This is an article for \npublication, March of 2006. I am just reading the front page of these.\n  Here is another article, a 2005 article. We conclude that pluripotent \ncell types used in this study are unsuitable for achieving safe \nengraftment in a Guinea pig brain. Why? Creation of teratomas--tumors.\n  Unlimited self-renewal and high differentiated potential poses the \nrisk of tumor induction after engraftment. This is just the front page \nof another article, December of 2004.\n  Here is another article. Conclusions: the cells will, however, form a \ntumor if they leak into an improper space such as the thoracic cavity. \nThis is an article from 2003.\n  Then I have three more articles. These are just summations of peer-\nreviewed articles. They form tumors. That is the problem with embryonic \nstem cells.\n  So the Senators from California, Michigan, Iowa, and Pennsylvania and \nother places saying we want cures--I want cures. The research is saying \nembryonic stem cells form tumors. You put them into individuals, they \nform tumors. And while we hope at some point in time something positive \nhappens, the problem is, they form tumors. This isn't working. So if we \nwant treatments and cures, the answer isn't embryonic stem cells, it is \nadult stem cells, cord blood, where we don't have a tumor formation \nproblem and where we are getting all of these initial successes that \nare taking place\n  We are also going to consider legislation--and I will come back to \nanother point here--we are going to consider legislation on fetus \nfarming. There are three bills that are up and one of the bills is to \nban fetal farming--fetus farming. I want to speak on that bill. I am a \ncosponsor of the bill. It would prohibit a gruesome procedure known as \nfetus farming. I am hopeful this passes with broad bipartisan support.\n  What this prevents is growing young humans to a certain stage, then \nharvesting their parts like an organ donor--parts. You grow a cloned \nhuman to a certain stage, let the cells differentiate and then harvest \nthe parts. The Fetus Farming Prohibition Act is intended to prevent the \nexploitation of women for the purpose of harvesting spare organs, \nbodies parts, and tissue. In an ideal world we wouldn't need this type \nof legislation, yet we have already seen four scientific papers \npublished on proof of concept of where they clone an animal to harvest \nthe tissue to put into another animal to see if there was a rejection \nissue. Such proof of concept or proof of principle is simply the first \ncase you take before actually moving to doing it in humans. That is why \nwe seek to ban this particular procedure.\n  Some of my colleagues are saying of course nobody would think about \ndoing this. I remember at the outset of this debate 8 years ago, \neverybody said of course we are not going to clone human beings. That \nis not necessary; that is abhorrent, and we wouldn't do that. The same \npeople who were saying that are now saying it is essential we clone \nhuman beings, so the distance from ``of course we would never'' to ``of \ncourse we must'' seems to only take a matter of years and that is why \nwe are seeking to ban this particular area of using human beings. Human \nbeings, as I said at the outset, are ends in themselves. They should \nnot be used for somebody else's purposes. It is beneath human dignity \nto turn humans into commodities--that is organ factories--and that \nwould be the case with fetus farming. That is what this act does; it \nprohibits it. I am hopeful my colleagues can strongly support this ban \non fetal farming that is going to come before this body and I hope will \npass the House and be sent to the President for signature.\n  I want to talk about an area that perhaps we all pretty easily fall \ninto. That is, we get contacted by individuals who have a particular \nmalady or disease or genetic problem and we tell them we want to give \nthem a cure.\n  We do want to give them a cure. Everyone in this body wants to give \nthem a cure. But then false hope can be held out or people can start \ndown a road that doesn't produce. That is where we have been going. \nThat is where we are going with the embryonic stem cells. This is a \nroute into which we put half a billion Federal taxpayer dollars and it \nhasn't produced. It is time to move somewhere else. We have tried this \nroute before.\n  I want to quote one of my colleagues on fetal tissue research. Some \nof my colleagues remember 10 or 15 years ago we were debating fetal \ntissue research. The promises sound strangely familiar, what people \nsaid.\n\n       There is substantial evidence that fetal tissue research \n     will offer a new hope of prolonged life, greater quality of \n     life, and perhaps one day even a cure for many of these \n     diseases at a tremendous economic and social cost-saving to \n     the country.\n\n  Then people frequently would list different areas that would be \ncovered, such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease and the like.\n  We funded fetal tissue research. The reason I mentioned this is it is \nquite a bit like fetal farming. In fetal tissue research the fetus is \naborted and then body parts harvested for use in somebody else, and \nthat was going to cure everybody. We were going to get rid of \nAlzheimer's and Parkinson's and Lou Gehrig's and cancer and all these \nareas with great promise. Yet we saw what happened on the fetal tissue \nresearch.\n\n       Parkinson's research is set back by failure of fetal cell \n     grants--disastrous side effect--absolutely devastating--it \n     was tragic, catastrophic, it's a real nightmare. And we can't \n     selectively turn it off.\n\n  That was what the researchers said when they took fetal tissue and \nput it in somebody to deal with Parkinson's disease. What we are trying \nto prohibit with the Fetal Farming Act is this from backing up even \nfurther, or doing it in a clone state, and inserting cancerous tumors \ninto individuals. You can't selectively turn it off. That is why we \nwant to ban this. That is why it is the wrong thing to do. It was the \nwrong thing to do then, using fetal tissue in that particular case.\n  It is also the wrong thing to promise people these cures when we look \nat the\n\n[[Page S7593]]\n\nscience of this and you know pretty likely this is not going to work--\nfrom all the scientific evidence. Let me read from some of the eminent \nscientists. By the way, the material I had printed for the Record on \ntumor formation, I believe every one of these scientists, at least most \nof the scientists published in these articles, are pro embryonic stem \ncell research. They support embryonic stem cell research. They want it \nto work. The problem is, tumor formation, just as we saw with fetal \ntissue research. The cell grows fast, undifferentiated, but it can get \nin the brain and in some cases formed fingernails or hair follicles \ninstead of brain tissue.\n  What are some of the scientists who are strong embryonic stem cell \nsupporters saying about the likelihood of human treatments using \nembryonic stem cells? Here I am quoting from people who support this \nresearch. Lord Winston, a British stem cell expert, has warned his \ncolleagues over the political hype in support of human embryonic stem \ncells:\n\n       One of the problems is that in order to persuade the public \n     that we must do this work, we often go rather too far in \n     promising what we might achieve. This is a real issue for the \n     scientists. am not entirely convinced that embryonic stem \n     cells will, in my lifetime, and possibly anybody's \n     lifetime for that matter, be holding quite the promise \n     that we desperately hope they will.\n\n  This was in a lecture he gave in 2005. If we want to cure people, as \ndifferent colleagues are talking about and giving different human \nexamples, people examples--this is a clear route here, adult and cord \nblood. Put the money there if we want to cure people. If we want to do \nthe scientific research, that is another thing, but if we want to cure \npeople, we have an answer and it has no ethical problem to it. But we \nshould not overhype the embryonic stem cells when the lead scientist \nsay he thinks it is unlikely any time soon, if ever, to work, as I just \nquoted to you there.\n  Let me give another quote from the journal ``Science.'' It carried a \npiece last summer in which supporters of embryonic--destructive human \nembryonic stem cell research admitted:\n\n       It is necessary that prospective donors of human eggs \n     recognize the large gap between research and therapy. This is \n     particularly important in frontier areas of research where \n     therapeutic impact in humans is unproven.\n       Also, it is nearly certain that the clinical benefits of \n     the research are years or maybe decades away. This is a \n     message that desperate families and patients will not want to \n     hear.\n\n  If we are talking cures, we have an answer here. But it is not \nembryonic stem cell research. Otherwise we should not be talking about \ncures. We should be talking maybe about research on embryos, research \non embryonic stem cells. We are interested in how they work, but we \nshould not be talking cures because the cures are coming in the adult \nand cord blood route.\n  I will have the ``Science'' article printed. I ask unanimous consent \nall these be printed in the Record at the end of my presentation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. This is an op-ed piece in the Washington Post. David \nShaywitz put it in, in 2005.\n\n       While stem cell advocates have helped voters connect stem \n     cell research with compelling images of patients who might \n     one day benefit from treatments, such therapies are unlikely \n     to emerge soon enough to benefit most current proponents. . . \n     .\n        . . . scientists must do a better job of articulating the \n     limitations of our existing knowledge, taking care to \n     emphasize not only the ultimate therapeutic potential of \n     these cells, but also how far we are from achieving such \n     therapies.\n\n  That is from scientists who support embryonic stem cell research. \nLet's be clear what we are talking about in this particular field.\n  Now I want to talk about the pluripotent nature of adult stem cells. \nHere, Dr. Coburn, Dr. Frist, and others would be better qualified, \nobviously, than I could ever dream of being about this topic, but this \nhas been raised for some period of time. The theory has gone, embryonic \nstem cells are pluripotent, they can form any type of cells. Adult stem \ncells cannot. Their plasticity is insufficient for them to be able to \nform other types of cells.\n  I simply point to this chart, listing 16 peer-reviewed studies \nshowing alternative sources of pluripotent stem cells other than \nembryonic stem cells, and almost all of these are out of adult stem \ncells--pluripotency.\n  I urge my colleagues, the science has moved quite rapidly on this. I \nhope we can get up to speed with where the science is on this. There is \npluripotency in other stem cells. There is pluripotency in cells other \nthan the embryonic stem cells. We have the alternative bill, the \nSantorum-Specter bill, looking at other alternative sources of \nembryonic-type like stem cells that you do not have to destroy an \nembryo to get to. Look at those fields and those areas, these adult \nstem cells and this research, rather than saying the only source is \nembryonic, because it is not. That is not the only source because the \nscience continues to move on through this and find other areas of \npluripotency in adult stem cells as they are created.\n  Because I have a little bit of time--I ask the Chair, how much time \nis remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 4\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Fantastic. I have a picture I want to show, then, \nbecause this is a real hope. It is also a bit of a tragedy. Here is a \ngentleman I hosted at a hearing about Parkinson's disease. He suffers \nfrom Parkinson's disease. He had an adult stem cell treatment. We got \nhim in to testify. It is adult stem cells put back in his own part of \nthe brain, it is his own cells, so there is not a rejection problem. He \nwas Parkinson's free for 5 years. We had trouble getting him in to \ntestify. He was out doing African safaris and things. We couldn't get \nhim to come in.\n  I say that because that is the beauty of it. The tragedy of it is \nsome of the Parkinson's traits are coming back. He would love to have \nanother treatment for Parkinson's with his own adult stem cells. Yet we \nhave so few clinical trials going on, we are so short in the funding of \nthis, that he is not able to get additional treatments or other \nParkinson's patients aren't able to get this.\n  I ask my colleagues, if we want to treat, let's take the half a \nbillion dollars and let's put it into research for a guy such as this, \nwhere we have a real promising start. He was Parkinson's free of things \nhere for 5 years, and then it started coming back.\n  My final comment I have in the time I have left is: What a beautiful \ntime. What an opportunity we have for people to live longer and better \nlives. This is a glorious time for us to make a step forward.\n  Senator Feinstein from California and I cochair the cancer caucus. We \nare setting an objective of ending deaths by cancer in 10 years. It is \ngoing to have to be aggressive to be able to do this. We are going to \nhave to do some work on these adult and cord blood stem cell areas. \nWhat a beautiful time. Let's invest wisely. Let's not check our morals \nat the door--our values. Let's treat every single human as a sacred, \nbeautiful child of the living God and we are going to be here 10 years \nfrom now with amazing stories of things that have happened, and a happy \nheart, and a clear conscience at the same time--that we did it, we did \nit the right way, that more people are alive today, not dead, we didn't \nsacrifice other human beings in the process, and people are cured. \nPeople with spinal cord injuries are walking. People with Parkinson's \nno longer have it.\n  We have people in whom this is taking place today. We didn't give \nthem cancer in the process of trying to cure them--where we are having \nthe troubles with the embryonic stem cells.\n  This can happen if we will go the right way, ban the fetal farming, \nnot expand and use taxpayer dollars to fund destructive human embryonic \nresearch where you destroy a human, and look at these alternatives. It \ncan and it will happen. And that--that is going to be a beautiful day.\n  I believe my time has expired and I yield the floor\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n           Stem-Cell Reality: ``ESC Treatments Decades Away''\n\n       ``Similarly, it is important not to use the term `therapy' \n     when what is meant is `research' and not to refer to human \n     embryonic stem cell research as `therapeutic cloning.'

Some say it is time to go back to the \n     laboratory and to animals before doing any more operations on \n     humans.\n       The findings may also fuel the debate over whether it is \n     appropriate to use tissue from aborted fetuses to treat \n     diseases. Despite their disappointment, some researchers said \n     they hoped that the results would not bring fetal cell \n     research to an abrupt halt. The research has been \n     controversial because the fetal cells were obtained from \n     abortion clinics.\n       ``This is still our one great hope for a cure,'' said Dr. \n     J. William Langston, who is scientific director and chief \n     executive officer at The Parkinson's Institute in Sunnyvale, \n     Calif.\n       Parkinson's disease occurs when cells of the substantia \n     nigra region in the base of the brain die, for unknown \n     reasons. The hope was that fetal substantia nigra cells might \n     take over for them. But, the study showed, in older patients \n     the operation had no benefit and in some younger patients, \n     the transplants brought on nightmarish side effects.\n       Although the paper depicts the patients with the side \n     effects in impassive clinical terms, doctors who have seen \n     them paint a very different picture.\n       Dr. Paul E. Greene, a neurologist at the Columbia \n     University College of Physicians and Surgeons and a \n     researcher in the study, said the uncontrollable movements \n     some patients suffered were ``absolutely devastating.''\n       ``They chew constantly, their fingers go up and down, their \n     wrists flex and distend,'' Dr. Greene said. And the patients \n     writhe and twist, jerk their heads, fling their arms about.\n       ``It was tragic, catastrophic,'' he said. ``It's a real \n     nightmare. And we can't selectively turn it off.''\n       One man was so badly affected that he could no longer eat \n     and had to use a feeding tube, Dr. Greene said. In another, \n     the condition came and went unpredictably throughout the day, \n     and when it occurred, the man's speech was unintelligible.\n       For now, Dr. Greene said, his position is clear: ``No more \n     fetal transplants. We are absolutely and adamantly convinced \n     that this should be considered for research only. And whether \n     it should be research in people is an open question.''\n       Dr. Gerald D. Fischbach, who was director of the National \n     Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, which \n     sponsored the study, said that while the operation had been \n     promoted by some neurosurgeons as miraculous, this was the \n     first time it was rigorously evaluated. It used sham surgery \n     as a comparison, a controversial and rarely used strategy but \n     one that researchers felt was necessary to understand the \n     true effects of the operation.\n       Dr. Fischbach, who is now dean of the faculty of medicine \n     at the Columbia University College of Physicians and \n     Surgeons, was the director of the institute only at the end \n     of the study.\n       ``Ad hoc reports of spectacular results can always occur,'' \n     Dr. Fischbach said. ``But if you do these studies \n     systematically, this is the result you get.''\n       The surgery, he added, ``is not the final solution that \n     people would have hoped going into it.''\n       In the study, researchers, led by Dr. Curt R. Reed of the \n     University of Colorado Health Sciences Center in Denver and \n     Dr. Stanley Fahn of the Columbia University College of \n     Physicians and Surgeons, recruited 40 patients, ages 34 to \n     75, who had had Parkinson's disease for an average of 14 \n     years. The patients were randomly assigned to have substantia \n     nigra cells from four fetuses implanted in their brains or to \n     have sham surgery, for comparison.\n       The surgery took place in Colorado and the patients were \n     evaluated in New York. The fetal cell surgery involved \n     drilling four small holes in the patient's forehead and then \n     inserting long needles through the holes into the brain and \n     injecting fetal cells. The sham surgery involved drilling the \n     holes but not injecting needles into the brain. After a year, \n     the patients were told whether they had the fetal cell \n     surgery and, if not, they were offered it if they wanted it.\n       The study's primary measure of success was whether the \n     patients themselves noticed that they were better, as \n     determined by a survey that they mailed in a year later but \n     before they knew whether they had had fetal cell implants or \n     a sham operation. The study found no difference between the \n     two groups--neither those who had had the fetal cell \n     operation nor those who had had the sham surgery notice an \n     improvement in their symptoms.\n       Other tests, like neurologists' assessments of the patients \n     while they were taking their medication and the patients' \n     assessments of their condition in diaries they kept also \n     showed no effect of the surgery. And there was no difference \n     between the two groups in the doses of drugs needed to \n     control the disease.\n       The one glimmer of hope came from assessments by \n     neurologists before the patients had had their first dose of \n     medication in the morning. By that measure, the 10 patients \n     under age 60 who had had the fetal cell implants seemed \n     better than those who had had sham surgery, with less \n     rigidity, although their tremor was just as bad.\n       Dr. Freed hailed that result, saying, ``It was clear-cut \n     improvement.''\n       And, he added, the fetal cells survived in most patients' \n     brains.\n       ``I would be disappointed if people used a strict clinical \n     trial approach,'' Dr. Freed said. ``This study is about \n     multiple phenomena.''\n       Others were less enthusiastic, pointing out that finding \n     subgroups after the fact who may have benefited suggests a \n     hypothesis for future studies, not evidence of an effect.\n       ``We try to teach everybody that you have to identify \n     beforehand what's the primary outcome,'' said Dr. William \n     Weiner, the director of the Maryland Parkinson's Disease and \n     Movement Disorder Center and a professor of neurology at the \n     University of Maryland School of Medicine in Baltimore, \n     referring to the measure of success determined before the \n     study began. ``In this case, they picked a subjective \n     assessment by the patients themselves, which I think is a \n     very good one.''\n       And so, Dr. Weiner said, when the patients noticed no \n     improvement, ``the study was negative.''\n       In addition, Dr. Langston said, even if a Subsequent study \n     confirmed that the surgery had an effect on the condition in \n     younger patients before they took their medicine in the \n     morning, and even if there was a way of preventing the \n     terrible side effect, the operation would still hardly be a \n     breakthrough. Parkinson's disease is almost always a disease \n     of the elderly, he noted, adding that well under 10 percent \n     of patients who would be candidates for the surgery are \n     younger than 60.\n       The wiggling and writhing movements first emerged a year \n     after the operation, showing up in five of the younger \n     patients who had at first appeared to benefit from fetal cell \n     surgery--three who had the operation in the initial phase of \n     the study and two who had it a\n\n[[Page S7595]]\n\n     year later, when they learned that they had originalIy had a \n     sham surgery. While doctors sometimes see such effects in \n     Parkinson's patients, it is caused by giving too much of \n     drugs that act like dopamine in the brain. And it can be \n     controlled by reducing the drugs.\n       In this case, however, drugs were not the culprit. Even \n     when doctors took away the drugs, the symptoms persisted.\n       The fetal implant study had been controversial from the \n     start, both because it included sham surgery and because it \n     used fetal tissue from abortions. But many Parkinson's \n     disease experts said it had to be done because doctors were \n     already offering the surgery to patients, and charging them \n     for it, at costs of $40,000 or more, with no evidence that \n     they were helping them. Yet patients, facing a disease in \n     which brain cells slowly and inexorably die and in which even \n     the drugs that once controlled their symptoms of tremor and \n     rigidity would inevitably fail, took their chances with the \n     operation, thinking they had little to lose.\n       Dr. Freed said he was the first in the United States to \n     offer the treatment, starting in 1988 with a 52-year-old man, \n     who is still alive although, of course, he also still has \n     Parkinson's disease.\n       Dr. Freed continued to offer it to paying patients while he \n     was treating those who were part of the federal study and \n     whose procedures were paid for by the study. He said he \n     considered these other operations research because he \n     experimented with different amounts and placements of fetal \n     cells. He has given fetal cell implants to 27 patients, he \n     said, with the most recent operation last October.\n       Dr. Freed said his group was now implanting less fetal \n     tissue and putting the tissue in a different area of the \n     brain, hoping to avoid the devastating side effects. But, he \n     said it would be a mistake to stop doing the surgery \n     altogether.\n       ``To say that you can't do or shouldn't do human research \n     because the research has uncertain outcome, I think would be \n     a bad decision,'' Dr. Freed said.\n       Meanwhile, a second federally financed study of the \n     operation is winding to a close, and some researchers say it \n     is time to go back to animal studies and learn more about the \n     complex roles of the brain cells involved in Parkinson's \n     disease.\n       Dr. Weiner said that if a patient came to him today seeking \n     advice, he would say: ``The bottom line for patients is that \n     human fetal cell transplants are not currently the best way \n     to go. If you are willing to pay for them, you can still have \n     them done. But my advice is you ought not to do this.''\n                                  ____\n\n         [From Stem Cells Express, \n           Feb. 2, 2006]\n\n Embryonic Stem Cell-Derived Neuronally Committed Precursor Cells with \n  Reduced Teratoma Formation After Transplantation into the Lesioned \n                           Adult Mouse Brain\n\n                           (By Marcel Dihne)\n\n\n                                ABSTRACT\n\n       The therapeutic potential of embryonic stem (ES) cells in \n     neurodegenerative disorders has been widely recognized, and \n     methods are being developed to optimize culture conditions \n     for enriching the cells of interest and to improve graft \n     stability and safety after transplantation.

Three fetuses were delivered 1 month after \n     transplantation, and the other, 3 months after \n     transplantation Fetal tissues were examined for transplanted \n     cell progeny by quantitative polymerase chain reaction and in \n     situ polymerase chain reaction of the GFP sequence.\n       Results. A fluorescent tumor, obviously derived from \n     transplanted ES cells, was found in the thoracic cavity at 3 \n     months after transplantation in one fetus. However, \n     transplanted cell progeny were also detected ( 1%) without \n     teratomas in multiple fetal tissues. The cells were solitary \n     and indistinguishable from surrounding host cells\n       Conclusions. Transplanted cynomolgus ES cells can be \n     engrafted in allogeneic fetuses. The cells will, however, \n     form a tumor if they ``leak'' into an improper space such as \n     the thoracic cavity.\n\n[[Page S7596]]\n\n     \n                                  ____\n          [From the American Journal of Pathology, June 2005]\n\n  Stem Cells, Tissue Engineering and Hematopoietic Elements: Teratoma \n   Formation Leads to Failure of Treatment for Type I Diabetes Using \n          Embryonic Stem Cell-Derived Insulin-Producing Cells\n\n                         (By Takahisa Fujikawa)\n\n       Embryonic stem (ES) cells have been proposed to be a \n     powerful tool in the study of pancreatic disease, as well as \n     a potential source for cell replacement therapy in the \n     treatment of diabetes. However, data dem onstrating the \n     feasibility of using pancreatic islet-like cells \n     differentiated from ES cells remain controversial. In this \n     study we characterized ES cell-derived insulin-expressing \n     cells and assessed their suitability for the treatment of \n     type I diabetes. ES cell-derived insulin-stained cell \n     clusters expressed insulin mRNA and transcription factors \n     associated with pancreatic development. The majority of \n     insulin-positive cells the clusters also showed \n     immunoreactivity for C-peptide. Insulin was stored in the \n     cytoplasm and released into the culture medium in a glucose-\n     dependent manner. When the cultured cells were transplanted \n     into diabetic mice, they reversed the hyperglycemic state for \n      3 weeks, but the rescue failed due to immature teratoma \n     formation. Our studies demonstrate that reversal of \n     hyperglycemia by transplantation of ES cell-derived insulin-\n     producing cells is possible. However, the risk of teratoma \n     formation would need to be eliminated before ES cell-based \n     therapies for the treatment of Diabetes are considered.\n                                  ____\n\n\n        [From Somatosensory and Motor Research, Mar./June 2005]\n\n  Transportation of Apoptosis-Resistant Embryonic Stem Cells Into the \n                        Injured Rat Spinal Cord\n\n                         (By Michael J.

One \n     group received transplants of cells genetically modified to \n     over-express bel-2, which codes for an anti-apoptotic \n     protein. A second group received transplants of the wild-type \n     ES cells from which the bcl-2 line was developed. In the \n     untransplanted control group, only medium was injected. \n     Locomotor abilities were assessed using the Basso, Beattie \n     and Bresnahan (BBB) rating scale for 6 weeks. There was no \n     incremental locomotor improvement in either transplant group \n     when compared to control over the survival period. Morbidity \n     and mortality were significantly more prevalent in the \n     transplant groups than in controls. At the conclusion of the \n     6-week survival period, the spinal cords were examined. Two \n     of six cords from the bc-2 group and one of 12 cords from the \n     wild-type group showed gross evidence of abnormal growths at \n     the site of transplantation. No similar growth was seen in \n     the control. Pathological examination of the abnormal cords \n     showed very large numbers of undifferentiated cells \n     proliferating the injection site and extending up to 1.5 cm \n     rostrally and caudally. These results suggest that \n     transplanting KD3 ES cells, or apoptosisresistant cells \n     derived from KD3 line, into the injured spinal cord does not \n     improve locomotor recovery and can lead to tumor-like growth \n     of cells, accompanied by increased debilitation, morbidity \n     and morality.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                   [From Diabetologia, Feb. 14, 2004]\n\n Insulin Expressing Cells From Differentiated Embryonic Stem Cells Are \n                             Not Beta Cells\n\n                            (By S.

Embryonic stem (ES) cells have beer \n     proposed as a potential source of tissue for transplantation \n     for the treatment of Type 1 diabetes. However studies showing \n     differentiation of beta cells from ES cells are \n     controversial. The aim of this study was to characterise the \n     insulin-expressing cells differentiated in vitro from ES \n     cells and to assess their suitability for the treatment of \n     diabetes.\n       Methods. ES cell-derived insulin-expressing cells were \n     characterised by means of immunocytochemistry, RT-PCR and \n     functional analyses. Activation of the Insulin I promoter \n     during ES-cell differentiation was assessed in ES cell lines \n     transfected with a reporter gene. ES cell-derived cultures \n     were transplanted into STZ-treated SCID-beige mice and blood \n     glucos concentrations of diabetic mice were monitored for 3 \n     weeks.\n       Results. Insulin-stained cells differentiated from E cells \n     were devoid of typical beta-cell granules, rarely showed \n     immunoreactivity for C-peptide and were mostly apoptotic. The \n     main producers of proinsulin/insulin in these cultures were \n     neurons and neuronal precursors and a reporter gene under the \n     control of the insulin I promoter was activated in cells with \n     a neuronal phenotype. Insulin was released into the \n     incubation medium but the secretion was not glucose-\n     dependent. When the cultures were transplanted in diabetic \n     mice they formed teratomas and did not reverse the \n     hyperglyceamic state.\n       Conclusions/Interpretation. Our studies show that insulin-\n     positive cells in vitro-differentiated from ES cells are not \n     beta cells and suggest that alternative protocols, based on \n     enrichment of ES cell-derived cultures with cells of the \n     endodermal lineage, should be developed to generate true beta \n     cells for the treatment of diabetes.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the minority is in \ncontrol of the next 30 minutes.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I was going to ask the Senator from \nKansas--I will even do it on my time. I guess our next speaker is not \nhere right now. If the Senator from Kansas would perhaps engage me in a \ncolloquy, I would ask about the gentleman whose picture he has up \nthere. How is he doing now? I understand that, frankly, while his \nParkinson's was relieved for a while, it has reverted and he is back in \nhis previous state. Does the Senator know about that?\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Yes. If you caught my comments on the floor, I stated \nthat is part of the tragedy here. He had 5 years Parkinson's free, \nwants an additional treatment using the same adult stem cell procedure \nhe had before that worked, and can't get it. We don't have sufficient \nfunding to move that on forward.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I say to my friend, I don't understand that. I have a \nchart here that shows stem cell funding, embryonic stem cell funding, \nis $38.3 million last year and adult stem cell funding is $200 million. \nYou are telling me out of $200 million they can't help one individual?\n  Plus, I ask my friend from Kansas, if this is so promising, why is \nthe entire Parkinson's network that represents all the people with \nParkinson's disease 100 percent behind H.R. 810? Why are they so \nsupportive of H.R. 810 and not this approach?\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. If I could answer on both of those, I would have \nprinted in the Record the funding over the past 4 years for both \nembryonic and adult and cord blood stem cells. We put about half a \nbillion in embryonic, both animal and human, over the past 5 years.

Second, I would point out on Parkinson's, I don't know \nwhy the Parkinson's advocacy community would support that. I find it \nhard to believe they would oppose us doing more work in this field. I \nwould simply ask you, or others, if we have a place that is working and \nwe have another place that is producing tumors, why wouldn't you put \nmore in a place that is working?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I say to my friend from Kansas--and I see Senator Nelson \nis here to speak. He had previously been\n\n[[Page S7597]]\n\nscheduled to do so--first, I didn't see all the figures the Senator \nsent to the desk. I would like to see those. I heard him talk about a \nhalf billion dollars. Frankly, what the Senator from Kansas is talking \nabout is animal embryonic. We are talking about human--human \nexperiments here, not animal.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. If I could respond?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I am more interested in the human than I am about human \nand animal.\n  Second, on cancer and tumors, it is my understanding--I am not a \nscientist, but in talking with the scientists--the fact that an \nundifferentiated stem cell causes cancer is exactly what they are \nlooking for. It is the gold standard. I thought it was the gold \nstandard for determining whether you have an embryonic stem cell.\n  Let me see if I can repeat it as told to me. If you derive a stem \ncell line from an embryo, you don't really know if you have stem cells. \nSo the scientists take the undifferentiated cells and put them in a \nmouse to see if it causes cancer. That is the gold standard--to see \nwhether there is a stem cell line.\n  No one is talking about putting undifferentiated cells into your body \nor mine or anyone else's. We are talking about undifferentiated cells \nand then finding how they make nerve cells, how they make heart cells, \nhow they make tissue cells, how they make brain cells. Only after they \nare differentiated would they then be put into a person, not \nundifferentiated.\n  I hear all about the terms. I heard that earlier this morning. I \nthought I would check up on it. That is what I found out.\n  I would be glad to engage in a colloquy.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, let me clarify for the record. I think it \nis very important. There is a difference between cancer and teratoma. \nThey use the formation of teratomas to make a differentiation of \nwhether this is a part of the cell. That is not a cancer. Teratomas are \nnot necessarily cancer. They are tumors but not necessarily cancer.\n  Mr. HARKIN. They are tumors. That is what I heard the Senator say.\n  Mr. COBURN. If you do not have a tumor, I would just as soon have a \nteratoma as cancer.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I don't know. I am a little confused. Is the Senator \nsaying, if a stem cell has been introduced and is undifferentiated, it \ncauses cancer or teratoma?\n  Mr. COBURN. No. The Senator alluded to the fact that there is a gold \nstandard of whether an embryonic stem cell is pluripotent or whether it \nproduces a teratoma. That means it has components of the three layers \nof an embryo--exoderm, endoderm, and mesoderm--which create all the \nother tissues.\n  Mr. HARKIN. But the fact is the inference from some of the \nstatements, I think, is that thus far stem cells, when introduced, \ncause cancer. That is not so. That has not been proven. That has not \nbeen proven at all.\n  Mr. COBURN. It has. Most of the time teratoma.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I submitted for the Record seven peer-\nreviewed articles on the creation of tumors.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Tumors but not cancer.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. We have been down this road before. We tried this on \nthe fetal tissue research. Remember that debate of 10 to 15 years ago. \nThey had fast-growing cells, Parkinson's, and heart disease. When we \ninserted them into actual human patients, here is what it did. It \ncreated disastrous results because they formed all sorts of tissues \nalong with cancer. We have been here before, as the Senator knows, on \ntrying to get these sort of different cells from other bodies into one.\n  Mr. HARKIN. We have gone down a lot of blind alleys in medical \nresearch in the past. I have often said that one of the reasons for \nbasic research is that you have 11 doors that are closed. The answer to \nthe problem and the answer to your endeavor may be behind one of those \ndoors. When you have enough funding to open one door, you know what the \nodds are against you finding it. Or if you have funding for half, then \nyou know what the odds are against you opening the right door. A lot of \ndoors don't lead to anything. A lot of basic research goes down the \npath, and they find out that is not the answer. So they have to shift \nto something else. That happens all the time. That is what basic \nresearch is all about.\n  I do not know the specific thing. I am not surprised that many things \nin the past that scientists have gone down the road on have not led to \nsomething curative or therapeutic or something like that which helps \nus.\n  That doesn't mean that we have tried something before with \ndevastating effects which doesn't say that we can't then do embryonic \nstem cell research.\n  I get back to the point that when you have almost every disease group \nin this country supporting the bill that is before us, H.R. 810, you \nhave Nobel laureates, scientists, doctors, and you have 19 Directors of \nNIH saying that thi has great potential, then I say, again, to my \nfriends that you have to make either one of two assumptions. Either all \nof these people have been hoodwinked and they do not know what they are \ntalking about or they have no care or concern about ethics or morals or \nanything else. I think both assumptions are wrong. I think these people \nknow. They are informed. They may not know every little thing medical \ndoctors might know, but they know the potential.\n\n  Second, I think they are vastly ethical and moral people.\n  I hope we will have some further colloquies on this later.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I would love to respond with a quick response. I think \na third option is people are kind of interested in what these cells \nwill do. I quoted from Lord Winston, a British stem cell researcher, \nsaying it is an interesting area, but it is not going to produce any \nlikely cures in my lifetime. But they are curious. They are looking at \nit and saying it is an interesting area of research. If we are going to \ncure people, let us cure people and let us talk about that kind of \nresearch.\n  The Senator has been very kind to let me speak.\n  Mr. HARKIN. The Senator has been very kind. I think we can engage at \nsome other point.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, we just heard a great deal of \ndiscussion and disagreement. My bottom line on this whole issue of stem \ncell research is that a vast majority of the medical and scientific \ncommunity feels that this is a process which would lead to medical \nbreakthroughs in the fight against disease. To this Senator, that is \nworth exploring.\n  There is hardly a Senator here whose life has not been touched by \ndisease, in one way or another, through their family. In this \nparticular Senator's life, my family has been touched by disease, and \nwe don't know the cause of it. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or ALS, \notherwise known as Lou Gehrig's disease. It took down the great \nbaseball player, Lou Gehrig. For years, the researchers have looked and \nlooked and researched and researched and have not found a cure. The ALS \ncommunity, along with many other communities, is concerned about the \ntreatment and cure of diseases on which stem cell research might offer \na clue.\n  Researchers believe that stem cells may have the potential to treat \nover 100 million Americans who suffer from a variety of conditions, \nmany of which you heard already discussed on the floor of the Senate \ntoday.\n  There is a T-shirt that I jogged in this morning. It was given to me \nby the Miami Project. One of the most graphic symbols on this T-shirt \nis the international symbol of a wheelchair-bound person, and that \ninternational symbol suddenly starts to become upright and walks. The \nMiami Project was put together after the tragedy of a spinal cord \ninjury to the son of Nick Buoniconti, the all-pro linebacker of the \ngreat Miami Dolphins team, the undefeated team of 1972. When his son \nwas at a Citadel football game, he suffered that injury. Now the son \nand the father are both behind Miami Project, trying to find a cure for \nspinal cord injuries. And all the medical researchers feel that stem \ncell research is very promising for Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, \ncardiovascular disease, cancer, and I already mentioned ALS and \ndiabetes.\n  If that occurred, think what that would mean as we grapple with the \nFederal budget that is going out of control because of the accelerating \ncost of Medicare. If we were able to\n\n[[Page S7598]]\n\ntreat and cure some of these diseases, think about how much cost \nsavings that would create. And clearly, in this Senator's mind, a \nsecondary consideration is the fact of eliminating, almost \nmiraculously, the plague of these diseases by the stem cells that have \nthe ability to reproduce themselves and potentially develop into \ndifferent kinds of cells in the human body.\n  Of course, you have already heard in the debate today about the \nextensive research and being able to treat certain diseases. When \nconfronted with this a few weeks before September 11, 2001, the \nPresident announced that the administration would only allow Federal \nfunding for this research to be used on existing colonies of embryonic \nstem cells. Of course, you have heard the chorus in the scientific \ncommunity, since then, expressing concern about the quality, the \nlongevity, and the availability of these lines--and they believe that \nthe research advancement requires new embryonic stem cell lines. The \nkey is to increase the availability of the quality embryonic stem cell \nlines.\n\n  The current rules have limited the supply and have resulted in fewer \ninvestigators focusing their efforts on stem cell research. Therefore, \nprogress has been limited because of Federal funding in this research \nbeing limited. We have the ability to fix that. We can do that in this \nbill before the Senate.\n  This Senator intends to support this bill. This bill lifts the \nPresident's current restriction that allows researchers to receive the \nFederal funding for the study of embryonic stem cells. These stem cells \ncan only be derived from embryos originally created for fertility \ntreatments and that are willingly donated by patients and, I might say, \nthat are slated to be discarded.\n  We will get a substantial majority of votes in the Senate. Although \nwe hear the threats of a veto, it would be my hope the President will \nreexamine this issue. We are only talking about one kind of stem cell \nresearch. This is the stem cells that come through a rather complicated \nprogress, from a fertilized egg that was going to be discarded.\n  There is another promising way of doing this called somatic cell \nnuclear transfer where it is not even a fertilized egg. You take an \negg, scoop out the nucleus, take a stem cell from the donor--it can be \nfrom a skin cell--put that nucleus in, and activate the process of \ngrowing cells. That process of stem cell research has enormous promise.\n  This Senator has heard from thousands of Floridians who suffer on a \ndaily basis from some of these terrible diseases. The Senate has the \nability to bring hope to these people. It is time to act. The Senate \nshould pass this bill and pass it with a fairly sizable majority, \ngiving scientists the tools they need to search for cures.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, a few weeks ago I was visited by two of my \nconstituents--Mary Schneider and her son Ryan.\n  When Ryan was just 2 years old, his parents and doctors noted severe \ndelays in his motor and speech development, and he was diagnosed with \ncerebral palsy. His parents were devastated, as the prognosis for any \nchildren with cerebral palsy is quite grim, and given the severity of \nRyan's condition, his doctors didn't have much hope for his \nimprovement.\n  Yet, his parents had hope. Because when Ryan was born, his parents \nhad saved his cord blood, a viable but limited source of stem cells. \nThey found a doctor at Duke University who was willing to perform an \nexperimental infusion with these cells to see if they might improve his \ncondition.\n  They did. In fact, they seem to have cured him.\n  Within months of the infusion, Ryan was able to speak, use his arms, \nand eat normally, just like any other child--a miracle his family had \nonce only dreamed of.\n  Ryan's story exemplifies the power and the promise of stem cells to \ntreat and cure the millions of Americans who are suffering from \ncatastrophic, debilitating and life-threatening diseases and health \nconditions.\n  Each year, 100,000 Americans will develop Alzheimer's disease. Over 1 \nmillion adults will be diagnosed with diabetes this year, which can \nlead to complications such as blindness, damaged nerves and loss of \nkidney function. And there are far too many individuals with spinal \ncord injuries who are struggling to maintain mobility and independence.\n  For most of our history, medicine has offered little hope of recovery \nto individuals affected by these and other devastating illnesses and \ninjuries. Until now.\n  Recent developments in stem cell research may hold the key to \nimproved treatments, if not cures, for those affected by Alzheimer's \ndisease, diabetes, spinal cord injury and countless other conditions.\n  Many men, women and children who are cancer survivors are already \nfamiliar with the life-saving applications of adult stem cell research. \nPatients with leukemia or lymphoma often undergo bone marrow \ntransplants.\n  One of my old law partners back in Chicago underwent a bone marrow \ntransplant at the age of 30. It is a type of stem cell transplant which \ncan significantly prolong life or permanently get rid of cancer. This \nis what happened, fortunately, to my partner. He is now cancer free. \nThis therapy has been used successfully for decades and is saving lives \nevery day.\n  Now, here is the problem. This particular breakthrough of adult stem \ncells has its limitations. Adult stem cells, as has already been \nmentioned by the distinguished Senator from Iowa, such as those which \nare used in bone marrow transplants can only be collected in small \nquantities. They may not be a match for the patient. They have limited \nability to transform into specialized cells.\n  Cord blood, like the kind Ryan used, has limitations as well. If, for \nexample, Ryan's condition should deteriorate or he should have another \nillness, there is simply not enough cord blood cells left for a second \nuse. His mother has told us that the few remaining cells would have to \nbe cloned to get enough cells for future use or they would have to \nobtain stem cells from another source.\n  These and other difficulties are the reason scientists have started \nto explore other types and other sources of stem cells, including \nembryonic stem cell research. Embryonic stem cells can be obtained from \na number of sources, including in vitro fertilization. At this very \nmoment, there are over 400,000 embryos being stored in over 400 \nfacilities throughout the United States. The majority of these are \nreserved for infertile couples. However, many of these embryos will go \nunused, destined for permanent storage in a freezer or disposal. It \nmakes sense for us to expand and accelerate research using these \nembryos, just as we should continue to explore the viability of adult \nstem cell use and cord blood use.\n  All over the country, exciting progress is being made in the area of \nembryonic stem cell research. At the University of Illinois, they are \ndiscovering that stem cells have the potential to treat blood \ndisorders, lung diseases, and heart damage. At Johns Hopkins, \nresearchers use mouse embryonic stem cells to restore damaged nerves \nand restore mobility in paralyzed rats. One cannot help but think it is \na matter of when, not if, the research will be able to help those who \nhave lost the ability to walk.\n  For these reasons, I am proud to be a longtime supporter of greater \nstem cell research. While I was a member of the Illinois Senate, I was \nthe chief cosponsor of the Ronald Reagan Biomedical Research Act, which \nwould specifically permit embryonic stem cell research in Illinois and \nestablish a review of this research by the Illinois Department of \nPublic Health.\n  I am proud to be a cosponsor of the stem cell bill before the Senate \ntoday. This bill embodies the innovative thinking we as a society \ndemand and medical achievement requires. By expanding scientific access \nto embryonic stem cells which would be otherwise discarded, this bill \nwill help our Nation's scientists and researchers develop treatments \nand cures to help people who suffer from illnesses and injuries for \nwhich there currently are none.\n  The bill is not without limits. It requires that scientific research \nalso be subject to rigorous oversight. I recognize there are serious \nmoral and ethical issues surrounding this debate. I am respectful of \nthose on the other side. I also realize that we are not talking about \nharvesting cells that would\n\n[[Page S7599]]\n\nhave been used to create life. We are not talking about cloning humans. \nWe are talking about using stem cells that would otherwise have been \ndiscarded and lost forever. We are talking about using those stem cells \nto possibly save the lives of millions of Americans.\n  Democrats want this bill passed. Conservative pro-life Republicans \nwant this bill passed. By large margins, the American people want this \nbill passed. It is only the White House right now that is standing in \nthe way of progress, standing in the way of so many potential cures.\n  I ask, after this bill passes--because I am confident it will pass in \nthe Senate--that the President think about this before he picks up his \npen to deliver his first veto in 6 years. I ask that he think about \nRyan Schneider and his parents and all the other families sitting and \nwaiting and praying for a cure, hoping that somewhere a researcher or \nscientist will find an answer.\n  There was a time in the middle of the last century when America \nwatched helplessly as a mysterious disease left thousands, especially \nchildren, disabled for life. The medical community worked tirelessly to \nfight to try to find a cure, but they needed help. They needed funding \nto make their research possible.\n  With a world war raging and the country still emerging from the \nDepression, the Federal Government could hav ignored their plight or \ntold them to find their own cure, let it be funded privately, but that \nis not what happened. Instead, FDR helped to galvanize a community of \ncompassion and organized the March of Dimes to find the cure for polio. \nWhile Roosevelt knew that his own polio would never be cured by the \ndiscovery of a vaccine, he also knew that at its best, the Government \ncan be used as a force to accomplish together what we cannot achieve on \nour own. So the people began to care. The dimes piled up, and the \nfunding started to flow. And 50 years ago, Jonas Salk discovered the \npolio vaccine.\n\n  Americans are looking for that kind of leadership today. All over the \ncountry, patients and families are waiting today for Congress and the \nPresident to open the door to the cures of tomorrow. At the dawn of \nthis new century, we should approach this research with the same \npassion, the same commitment that has led to so many cures and saved so \nmany lives throughout our history. I urge my colleagues to support this \nbill.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. HARKIN. How much time remains on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority has 3 minutes.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I yield that time to the Senator from \nKentucky. We had a colloquy earlier that maybe we can find some time \nbefore 5 for Senator Dorgan to speak. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the majority is in \ncontrol of the next 30 minutes.\n  The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I come to the Senate today to speak on \nthe three bills related to stem cell research. One of these bills is \nwrong, but I believe that the other two are worthy pieces of \nlegislation.\n  Stem cell research is a controversial issue in the medical, \nscientific, and religious communities, as well as in Congress. I am not \nopposed to stem cell research; however, I am 100 percent opposed to \nembryonic stem cell research. This is why I oppose H.R. 810, the Stem \nCell Research Enhancement Act of 2005. This bill would remove all \ncurrent protections against the destructive use of embryos for \nharvesting stem cells. I firmly believe it is wrong to take these \nsources of life and destroy them, even if it is for a benign purpose \nsuch as medical research.\n  Current Federal policy on stem cell research developed out of a \ncompromise between proponents of research and those who endeavor to \nprotect life at its earliest stages, brokered by President Bush. This \nis the first administration to allow Federal funding of embryonic stem \ncell research. Today's policy allows Federal funds to be used for \nembryonic stem cell lines that were in existence prior to August 9, \n2001.\n  As an opponent of the destruction of human embryos, I believed the \nBush administration's decision to allow the embryonic stem cell \nresearch was misguided. H.R. 810 goes even further than the current \npolicy. It cancels the protections of the 2001 cutoff for research by \nallowing research of all embryonic stem cells created from in vitro \nfertilization treatments. This legislation would move us in the wrong \ndirection on this issue.\n  Some have said that these excess embryos which would be used for \nresearch would be destroyed anyway. However, I do not think this makes \nethical sense. Just because these budding lives will not survive does \nnot mean that we should ghoulishly conduct experiments on them.\n\n  I believe there is a disconnect between what many Americans believe \nabout this issue and what the facts are. For one, we are debating the \nuse of Federal funds for embryonic stem cell research. We are not \ndebating the legality of embryonic stem cell research. Any company or \norganization that wants to conduct or fund embryonic stem cell research \nmay do so. I just do not think taxpayers should be forced to pay for \nit.\n  Also, there are different kinds of stem cells. Adult stem cells, such \nas those derived from cord blood tissue, do not require the destruction \nof a human embryo. Why walk down such a dangerous ethical path when \nthere is no need to do so? These adult stem cells have proven very \neffective in combating several serious conditions, such as diabetes and \nspinal cord injuries, among others.\n  This leads me to another point. We have seen the benefits that come \nfrom adult stem cell research. However, we have yet to see any tangible \nbenefits from any embryonic stem cell research. Many scientists agree \nthat these kinds of stem cells might--I say ``might''--be able to help \nfight disease someday, but it has not happened yet. We are talking \nabout ending human life when no lives have been saved yet. Who knows \nhow many human embryos we will have to destroy before any tangible \nprogress is made.\n  That being said, I am pleased to see that the Senate is considering \nS. 2754, the Alternative Pluripotent Stem Cell Therapies Enhancement \nAct. This bill could very well remove the most contentious issues of \nthis debate. Embryonic stem cells are pluripotent, meaning that they \ncould potentially have a wide variety of uses. It is this quality that \ndrives the supporters of embryonic stem cell research to their \nposition. However, great strides have been made in deriving pluripotent \nstem cells from sources that do not destroy embryos.\n  S. 2754 would authorize Federal funding to conduct research on the \ncreation of nonembryonic pluripotent stem cells. If successful, we \nwould be able to end this debate by funding a morally acceptable \nreplacement for research involving human embryo destruction. I urge the \nSenate to adopt this measure.\n  The final bill the Senate is debating on the subject is S. 3504, the \nFetus Farming Prohibition Act. I fully support passage of this \nlegislation. This bill would ban research from fetal farms where human \nembryos are implanted in nonhuman uteruses. It would also ban embryos \nfrom human pregnancies created specifically for research.\n  Most people would find these requirements to be self-evident. \nHowever, some groups have said this is unnecessary because research \nalready follows ethical guidelines that forbid this. That may be the \ncase, but I believe we should take these ethical guidelines and give \nthem the force of law to prevent the possibility of such gruesome \nmethods ever being used by researchers. I urge my colleagues to pass \nthis bill.\n  I do not like to see people with medical conditions suffer. However, \nI believe many advocates of embryonic stem cell research are playing on \nthe hopes and griefs of many people whose lives are touched by illness. \nWe are at an ethical crossroads with this issue. We must stay true to \nour values of respecting life. It seems foolish to stubbornly barrel \nahead with Federal funding for embryonic stem cell research when, with \na small bit of patience, we can put aside the moral and ethical \nconcerns and proceed down a path we can all agree upon.\n  In closing, I firmly believe we cannot create life and then destroy \nit in order\n\n[[Page S7600]]\n\nto save another life. I urge my colleagues to vote against the Stem \nCell Research Enhancement Act and to support S. 2754 and S. 3504.\n  Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I want to spend a few minutes to kind of \noutline some of the statements that have been made. To just show how \noff base from reality some of them are, we heard there was a ban on \nembryonic stem cell research. There is no ban on embryonic stem cell \nresearch. As a matter of fact, the American people paid $40 million \nthis last year on embryonic stem cell research--human, $40 million. So \nthere is no ban. And considering that, there is a significant industry \nin the private sector that is researching it.\n  We heard there are only 21 cell lines around, available. There are \n400 cell lines available to scientists. There are 21 that Federal \ndollars can be spent on. So let's be real clear about what the real \nfacts are.\n  We also heard from the Senator from Florida that all medical \nresearchers believe that embryonic stem cell research is the best hope. \nThat could not be further from the truth. All of them do not. As a \nmatter of fact, there is a large number who do not believe that way at \nall, based on not ethical concerns, on scientific concerns. They think \nit is not an acceptable way.\n  We heard the Senator from Illinois saying that adult stem cells can \nonly be collected in small quantities. That is not true at all. Many \nadult stem cell lines are reproductive of themselves. They are \nprogenitor cells. They reproduce themselves. They come from amnionic \nmembrane. They come from bone marrow. They come from endometrial \nlining. They come from placental tissue. They come from cord blood. \nThey come from the spleen and the liver. They come from all sorts of \nareas in our body.\n  We heard the Senator from California say we should let the scientists \ndecide, not the Senators. Let's talk about Tuskegee. We let the \nscientists decide that one. I can think of two or three more instances \nin the 20th century when we let the scientists decide, and we went down \na path that all of us were grieved over.\n  When Senator Specter opened the debate today, there was, again, the \nassumption, in his first statement, that there is no embryonic fetal \nstem cell research. Not true. He also said none of the others have the \npotential of embryonic stem cell research. Well, I think there is a \nlarge body of science and a larger body of scientists who would \ndisagree with that, especially as they study the new breakthroughs on \ngerm cell pluripotent stem cells.\n  I am going to ask to have printed in the Record a Rand study on the \navailable numbers of human embryos, where in fact there are 400,000. \nBut they outline, in great detail, that the fact is, a very small \npercentage of those are available for fetal research. They also outline \nin great detail so the American public can know that for every two \nembryos you are going to thaw, one of those two will die during the \nthawing process.\n  So for this limited number, the most number of new cell lines, if you \ntook all that are available today, would be less than what is available \nin the world today. It is 273 cell lines. So we have this great big \ndemand, that we are going to get all this, but what we are going to get \nis less than what is out in the world today.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Rand study I referred \nto be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              [From the Rand Law & Health Research Brief]\n\n       How Many Frozen Human Embryos are Available for Research?\n\n       Frozen human embryos have recently become the focus of \n     considerable media attention. Frozen embryos are a potential \n     source of embryonic stem cells, which can replicate \n     themselves and develop into specialized cells (e.g., blood \n     cells or nerve cells). Researchers believe that such cells \n     might be capable of growing replacement tissues that could be \n     used to treat people suffering from a number of diseases, \n     including cancer, Alzheimer's disease, and diabetes. Among \n     the most contentious issues in the stem cell debate are \n     whether frozen embryos should be used to produce stem cells \n     for research purposes and whether it is appropriate to use \n     federal funds for research involving human embryos.\n       Many of the proposed resolutions to the embryonic stem cell \n     debate are based on assumptions about the total number of \n     frozen human embryos in the United States and the percentage \n     of that total that is available for research. Accurate data \n     on these issues, however, have not been available. Guesses on \n     the total number of embryos have ranged wildly from tens of \n     thousands to several hundred thousand.\n       RAND researchers Gail L. Zellman and C. Christine Fair, \n     together with the Society of Assisted Reproductive Technology \n     (SART) Working Group led by David Hoffman, MD, have completed \n     a project designed to inform the policy debate by providing \n     accurate data on the number of frozen embryos in the United \n     States and how many of those embryos are available for \n     research purposes. Their findings include the following:\n       Nearly 400,000 embryos (fertilized eggs that have developed \n     for six or fewer days) have been frozen and stored since the \n     late 1970s.\n       Patients have designated only 2.8 percent (about 11,000 \n     embryos) for research. The vast majority of frozen embryos \n     are designated for future attempts at pregnancy.\n       From those embryos designated for research, perhaps as many \n     as 275 stem cell lines (cell cultures suitable for further \n     development) could be created. The actual number is likely to \n     be much lower.\n\n\n      vast majority of frozen embryos are held for family building\n\n       The practice of freezing embryos dates back to the first \n     infertility treatments in the mid-1980s. The process of in \n     vitro fertilization often produces more embryos than can be \n     used at one time. In the United States, the decision about \n     what to do with the extra embryos rests with the patients who \n     produced them.\n       The RAND-SART team designed and implemented a survey to \n     determine the number and current disposition of embryos \n     frozen and stored since the mid-1980s at fertility clinics in \n     the United States and the number of those embryos designated \n     for research. The survey was sent to all 430 assisted \n     reproductive technology facilities in the United States, 340 \n     of which responded. Estimates for nonresponding clinics were \n     developed using a statistical formula based on a clinic's \n     size and other characteristics. The results show that as of \n     April 11, 2002, a total of 396,526 embryos have been placed \n     in storage in the United States. This number is higher than \n     expected; previous estimates have ranged from 30,000 to \n     200,000.\n       Although the total number of frozen embryos is large, the \n     RAND-SART survey found that only a small percentage of these \n     embryos have been designated for research use. As the figure \n     illustrates, the vast majority of stored embryos (88.2 \n     percent) are being held for family building, with just 2.8 \n     percent of the total (11,000) designated for research. Of the \n     remaining embryos, 2.3 percent are awaiting donation to \n     another patient, 2.2 percent are designated to be discarded, \n     and 4.5 percent are held in storage for other reasons, \n     including lost contact with a patient, patient death, \n     abandonment, and divorce.\n\n\n embryos available for research do not have high development potential\n\n       Although the 11,000 embryos designated for research might \n     seem like a large number, the actual number of embryos that \n     might be converted into stem cell lines is likely to be \n     substantially lower. Because assisted reproductive technology \n     clinics generally transfer the best-quality embryos to the \n     patient during treatment cycles, the remaining embryos \n     available to be frozen are not always of the highest quality. \n     (High-quality embryos are those that grow at normal rates.) \n     In addition, some of the frozen embryos have been in storage \n     for many years, and at the time that some of those embryos \n     were created, laboratory cultures were not as conducive to \n     preserving embryos as they are today. Some embryos would also \n     be lost in the freeze-and-thaw process itself.\n       To illustrate how such laboratory conditions might limit \n     the number of embryos available for research, the RAND-SART \n     team performed a series of calculations. Drawing upon the few \n     published studies in this area, they estimated that only \n     about 65 percent of the approximately 11,000 embryos would \n     survive the freeze-and-thaw process, resulting in 7,334 \n     embryos. Of those, about 25 percent (1,834 embryos) would \n     likely be able to survive the initial stages of development \n     to the blastocyst stage (a blastocyst is an embryo that has \n     developed for at least five days). Even fewer could be \n     successfully converted into embryonic stem cell lines. For \n     example, researchers at the University of Wisconsin needed 18 \n     blastocysts to create five embryonic stem cell lines, while \n     researchers at The Jones Institute used 40 blastocysts to \n     create three lines.\n       Using a conservative estimate between the two conversion \n     rates from blastocyst to stem cells noted above (27 percent \n     and 7.5 percent), the research team calculated that about 275 \n     embryonic stem cell lines could be created from the total \n     number of embryos available for research. Even this number is \n     probably an overestimate because it assumes that all the \n     embryos designated for research in the United States would be \n     used to create stem cell lines, which is highly unlikely.\n       The RAND-SART survey found that almost twice as many frozen \n     embryos exist in the United States as the highest previous \n     estimate. Only a small percentage of these embryos are \n     available for research because the\n\n[[Page S7601]]\n\n     vast majority are reserved for family building. Among those \n     that are in principle available for research, some have been \n     in storage for more than a decade and were frozen using \n     techniques that are less effective than those that are \n     currently available.\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Now, why do we want multiple cell lines? It goes back to \nthe issue I have been talking about all day. It is called tissue \nrejection. That is the wonder of adult stem cells and germ cell \npluripotent stem cells versus embryonic. With embryonic, there is \nrejection because there is an allergy to the foreign tissue. It is \ncalled the HLA, histocompatibility complex. The only way around that, \nwith fetal embryonic stem cells, is to clone yourself--the only way you \nwill get around it. And it will only work well in women. Only if you \nclone yourself with your own egg do you avoid all the allergy \nimplications of foreign tissue.\n  So I think it is very important that we--it is OK to have this \ndebate, but some of the claims we hear--we actually heard, and I know \nhe did not mean this, Senator Specter talking about embryos injected \ninto the pulp of the tooth to create a new set of teeth. He did not \nmean embryos. He meant pluripotent stem cells. But you do not want \npluripotent. What you want is the epidermal stem cells that produce \nteeth in the first place. That is what is great about adult stem cells. \nWe are going to be able to do that with adult stem cells.\n  He also stated that embryonic stem cell research is outstripping all \nof the research. That is not true. It is not true at all. The vast \nmajority of success in stem cells today lies not with embryonic stem \ncells, it lies with everything but embryonic stem cells.\n  Now, I do not deny as a scientist that would be a wonderful area in \nwhich to work. There is lots unknown, and if you are a scientist today, \nand they say you can go to this area where there are all these areas \nwhere you can work and go and move and everything, it is a fun area of \nresearch. But it is loaded with hazards, just like the Senator from \nKansas talked about, in terms of fetal tissue. The fact is, as we may \nsomeday learn how to turn on and turn off some of these cell lines, we \ndo not know that yet. It is fine to perfect that in animals. It is not \nfine to perfect that in human clinical trials until we have that \nabsolutely controlled. I do not have any trouble with what we are doing \nnow, doing that in the private sector.\n  But the question is, do we ask American taxpayers to use their money \nto destroy embryos--embryos for which there are 2 million people in the \ncountry who would love to adopt--do we ask them to destroy that with \ntheir tax money so we can do that research, even though it is occurring \nin the private sector at a far greater rate than it is in the public \nfinance sector?\n  So I think this really boils down to two questions: false choices and \nfalse promises. Let me outline them. The false promise is that only \nembryonic stem cells are going to solve the problem. It is not true.\n  The second promise is we are going to get treatments, but we are not \ngoing to have to clone. You are going to have to clone if you are going \nto get treatments from embryonic stem cells.\n  No. 3 is that adult stem cells and the pluripotent lines, as well as \ngerm cell lines, will not be able to do what embryonic stem cells do. \nThat is not proven anywhere in the scientific literature. That is a \nfalse promise.\n  And No. 4 is the false promise issue that you cannot take adult stem \ncells and dedifferentiate, move backwards, to make them pluripotent, \nwhich we are seeing great science with an enzyme today called reversa. \nSo those are the false promises that are out there.\n  Now, there are four false choices, I believe. One is that there is no \ncure without embryonic stem cells. That, for sure, the evidence does \nnot show. Another is that there will not be any research unless the \nGovernment pays for it. That is not true at all. The research is \nongoing across the world in lots of areas without government research, \nand much more so in our country outside of government research.\n  The third choice is that there is no life in an embryo. The fact is \nthere is. Now, we had one Senator talk about the fact that they are \ngoing to be incinerated. If you talk about the 108 snowflake babies, \nthe other 2 or 3 organizations that are adopting those, those children \nbelie that fact that there is wonderful potential with the amount of \ndemand.\n  I am not saying that people who disagree with me on the ethical \nissues are bad or immoral people. I am saying I am not fighting this on \nethical issues. I am fighting this on common sense, to see what things \nare happening and where we are seeing success and keeping up with the \nscience. This debate in the Senate today is almost all about a year and \na half old, as far as the science is concerned. I am talking about the \nnew science. That is why I worked so hard to stay up on it.\n  Finally, the promise is what every scientist knows, what every \nembryologist knows and every cell biologist knows, which is the mighty \nmitochondria. You cannot clone without having potential rejections \nunless you clone yourself with your own egg. There is different DNA in \nthe mitochondria and the cell cytoplasm. I appreciate the spirit of the \ndebate, and I hope the American people understand that it is not a \nfalse choice of no research versus some. The question is, Do we destroy \nunborn children? Two, do we give Federal dollars to do that? Thank you.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia is recognized. \nThe Senator is to be aware that the majority controls the time until 5 \np.m.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I am aware of that. I ask unanimous consent \nthat, notwithstanding and without any prejudice to any Senator, to \nspeak for 5 minutes on another matter.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BYRD. Not showing an interruption at this point.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, my \nunderstanding was that I would be recognized for 10 minutes following \nthe presentation by Senator Coburn. I don't object to anything someone \nelse wishes to do, provided that following that presentation, I am \nrecognized for 10 minutes. Would that be part of the unanimous consent \nrequest?\n  Mr. BYRD. I make that part of my request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. HARKIN. If I might, as a manager, we are on strict time limits. \nAt 5 o'clock, Senator Kennedy gets 25 minutes and then 5 minutes goes \nto Senator Reed. At 5:30, it goes back to the other side. If we take \ntime here and there, it spills over, and someone is going to lose time.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I will be glad to yield 5 minutes of my time to the \nSenator from West Virginia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  The Senator from West Virginia is recognized.\n  (The remarks of Mr. BYRD are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business''.)\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nNorth Dakota is recognized for 10 minutes.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, all of us have great pride in being able \nto serve in this great body and the purpose of it is, of course, to be \nengaged in public policy debate, how to advance this country's \ninterests. We come to this debate today on something that is very \nimportant, very controversial. This country's search in many areas--\nsocial justice, science, and so many areas of our lives--is a search \nthat never ends. We have split the atom. We have spliced genes. We did \nthe human genome project, developed the owner's manual for the human \nbody. We invented plastics and radar and silicon chips, cured polio, \ncured smallpox, built airplanes and learned to fly them, and built \nrockets and walked on the moon; we invented the telephone, the \ncomputer, and the television.\n  It is pretty unbelievable, but this country is hardly out of breath. \nWe continue to inquire, continue to search, and continue to ask \nquestions. Those questions, especially in science, are, in some cases, \ndifficult questions. We will have three pieces of legislation we will \nvote on tomorrow dealing with stem cell research. One piece of \nlegislation prevents something that is not being done. I will not have \nany problem supporting that; preventing something\n\n[[Page S7602]]\n\nthat is not being done is not posing any difficulty for me. The second \npiece of legislation authorizes that which is already authorized. I \nhave no difficulty with that vote either. I will be happy to support \nthat.\n  The third piece of legislation is called embryonic stem cell \nresearch. That is the basis of the controversy being discussed today. \nThose in this Chamber and those throughout this country who have lost \nloved ones to dreaded diseases understand the urgency to unlock the \nmysteries of these diseases. I lost a beautiful young daughter some \nyears ago to heart disease. I wondered then, and I wonder now, and I \nwill wonder for some long while, if there is anything that we could do \nto unlock the mystery of that devastating killer. But it is not just \nheart disease. It is diabetes, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, cancer--the \nlist goes on and on.\n\n  Every day, people die. Every day, there are scientists who inquire: \nWhat can be done? What can we do to unlock the mysteries to find cures \nfor these terrible diseases?\n  Stem cell research. Mr. President, there are 1 million people walking \non this Earth who were conceived outside of the womb in a test tube. \nThere are 1 million living people who were conceived through in vitro \nfertilization. We had somebody testify before the Senate Commerce \nCommittee a few years ago, and he said none of those people should have \nbeen born, it was wrong and in vitro fertilization should not exist. It \nis wrong, he said. I disagree with him. It is the blessing to provide \nthe opportunity to have a family to so many couples who were childless \nthrough in vitro fertilization, using the egg and sperm and uniting \nthem outside of the womb, implanting them, and providing a child for \nthose families.\n  At in vitro fertilization clinics, many more eggs are fertilized than \nare used. Some are stored and frozen. Those frozen embryos at in vitro \nfertilization clinics, when they are not going to be used in the \nfuture, are discarded, simply thrown into a wastebasket. They become \nwaste and they are discarded. Some of my colleagues would say each and \nevery one of those represents murder. I don't believe that, but some of \nmy colleagues would insist on that position. That is murdering an \nembryo. We have 400,000 of those embryos stored, cryogenically frozen, \nat in vitro fertilization clinics. Around 8,000 to 11,000 of them a \nyear will be simply discarded.\n  The question is: Should we relax the ban on Federal funding of stem \ncell research and allow the use of frozen embryos that otherwise are \ngoing into a wastebasket, that otherwise are going to be discarded? \nShould we allow the use of them with ethical boundaries and be \nconcerned about the ethics of its use for scientific research, to try \nto find the cures to these terrible diseases? Should we allow that? The \nanswer clearly is yes.\n  Are we comparing someone who is suffering from Parkinson's, someone \nwho has Alzheimer's, someone with heart disease or cancer or diabetes \nto an embryo that is going to be discarded into a wastebasket--8,000 to \n11,000 of them a year? Do we find an equivalency there\n  Do you believe that all of those unused fertilized eggs that are \nfrozen at an IV clinic, an in vitro fertilization clinic, that are \ndiscarded, that each and every one represents a murder? Some believe \nthat. I don't.\n  What is pro-life, I believe, what is life-giving is to be able to \ncontinue in this area of science with ethical guidelines but continue \nthis search to unlock the mysteries of these diseases.\n  My colleague a moment ago said quite correctly that we don't prevent \nstem cell research. He is quite right about that. This issue is the \nrestriction of Federal funding, and, of course, a substantial amount of \nthe funding for scientific research, research in health care in this \ncountry, comes from the Federal Government.\n  If we take a look at what has happened with respect to the United \nStates and the rest of the world, we will see, because President Bush \nhas imposed restrictions on stem cell research, we have lost a \nsubstantial amount of ground to the rest of the world. We are falling \nfar behind.\n  This is not about Republicans or Democrats. It is not about \nconservatives or liberals. Let me quote Nancy Reagan: Science has \npresented us with a hope called stem cell research, which may provide \nour scientists with answers that have so long been beyond our grasp. I \njust don't see how we can turn our backs on this--there are just so \nmany diseases that can be cured, or at least helped. We have lost so \nmuch time already, and I just really can't bear to lose any more.\n  Nancy Reagan watched the ravages of Alzheimer's disease destroy her \nhusband, our former President, the late Ronald Reagan. I believe she \nunderstands the urgency with which we pursue this purpose. I can read \nthe pain in this message, and that pain exists--my guess--with so many \nin this Chamber and across the country who have watched loved ones die \nbecause of dread diseases that have wasted away their lives. The \nquestion is: Are we willing to do something about that? Can we do \nsomething about that? Will we retard or will we advance science? Will \nwe hold back or will we encourage the scientists to search for these \ncures?\n  I hope the Senate will do just as the House has done and indicate \nthat we believe that with proper ethical guidelines, stem cell research \nshould continue with Federal funding. I believe, as I said, this is \nabout saving lives, this is not about taking lives.\n  I understand that this is a sensitive subject. In fact, in my last \ncampaign for office 2 years ago, my opponent ran television commercials \nsaying that my position was to be supportive of planting embryos into \nmommies' wombs and growing them for a while and then harvesting them \nfor body parts. That is the Byzantine nonsense which, unfortunately, \nattends part of this debate. No one here--certainly not me--would ever \ncountenance anything resembling that, and yet much of the political \ndiscussion about this issue becomes so bizarre and so Byzantine that it \nis detached from reality.\n  The bill that is before the Senate that I just described--I am not \ntalking about the first two bills, the one that prevents something that \nis not being done. I don't have a problem with that. Or the one that \nauthorizes something that is already authorized, and I have no problem \nwith that.\n  I am talking about the legislation dealing with stem cell research. \nThe bipartisan coalition that brought it to the Senate includes \nRepublicans, Democrats, conservatives, and liberals. My hope is the \nSenate will act on this legislation with a veto-proof majority and \ndecide whatever the President does that we have made this decision and \nthe decision should stick.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Alexander). The Senator's time has \nexpired. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I believe I am to be recognized for 20 \nminutes. I would like the Chair to let me know when I have 3\\1/2\\ \nminutes remaining.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair will do that.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I join my friend and colleague from North \nDakota in giving special recognition to Mrs. Reagan on this issue. As \nsomeone who has been interested in this issue for some time, as many of \nmy colleagues have, I think all of us pay tribute to her, to a very \ngracious, lovely, wonderful, warm First Lady and someone I admire so \nmuch because after she has been to the top of the mountain, so to \nspeak, and entitled to a very secure and well-deserved retirement, she \nis still restless about this issue and tireless about talking with \npeople and speaking about this issue with great knowledge, great \nawareness, great understanding, and great compassion. I mention that at \nthis time. I think we all know this debate has moved farther down the \nroad toward a hopeful conclusion because of her work.\n  Today, the Senate begins the debate on legislation unlike any other \nwe have considered this year. Today's debate is not about economic gain \nor loss or helping one State or one region of the country. Today's \ndebate is about something far more basic, something that touches the \nspirit of every American. Today's debate is about hope.\n  Hope is one of those qualities of spirit that makes us human. Hope \nallows us to dream of a better life for our children, our community, \nour world, and especially for loved ones now suffering or in pain. Hope \nis what stem cell research holds for the parents of children\n\n[[Page S7603]]\n\nwith diabetes who dream of a day when their constant fears for their \nchildren's well-being are things of the past. Hope is what stem cell \nresearch brings to those with Parkinson's disease who long for a time \nwhen the tremors of that disease are banished forever. Hope is what \nstem cell research brings to millions of Americans who seek better \ntreatments and better drugs for cancer or diabetes, spinal injury, and \nmany other serious conditions. And hope cannot be extinguished or \ndestroyed, but it can be delayed.\n\n  In the Bible, the Book of Proverbs tells us:\n\n       Hope deferred makes the heart sick.\n\n  And today hearts are sick almost to the breaking point because, for \nthe last 5 years, the Bush administration has shut down the stem cell \nresearch program begun at the National Institutes of Health and imposed \nthe arbitrary restrictions on this lifesaving research.\n  Hope soared anew a year ago when the House of Representatives set \naside partisan differences and courageously approved legislation to end \nthose restrictions and to give our scientists the tools they need to \nmake the progress in the fight against disease. The vote in the House \naffirmed that embryonic stem cells can promote a true culture of life \nby enabling fuller, longer lives for millions of our citizens. The \nHouse voted for hope, for progress, and for life.\n  The supporters of this legislation in the Senate come from \nbackgrounds as diverse as its proponents in the House. All of the \nsupporters of H.R. 810, with our different backgrounds and different \nfaiths, representing different parts of this country, have concluded \nthat support of this legislation is the moral choice to make.\n  The legislation before us takes only two actions, but they hold the \nkey to medical progress.\n  First, our legislation overturns the restrictions on the embryonic \nstem cell research imposed by Presidential order 5 years ago. That \nunilateral action by the administration bypassed Congress and froze \nprogress in its tracks by barring the NIH from funding research on stem \ncells derived after 9 p.m. eastern daylight time, August 9, 2001--an \narbitrary date and time chosen solely to coincide with a Presidential \nspeech.\n  At the time the President's order was issued, it was claimed that \nover 60 independent stem cell colonies, or lines, would be available to \nNIH researchers. Initially, the NIH listed 78 such lines in its \nregistry, but time and the unalterable facts of science have shown that \ntwo-thirds of these lines are useless or that claims about them proved \nto be an illusion.\n  Today, only 21 stem cell lines are available to NIH researchers, and \nall of these were obtained using out-of-date methods and outmoded \ntechniques. Each of these 21 lines is contaminated with animal tissue \nbecause each was cultured on a so-called feeder layer of mouse cells. \nTechniques developed since 2001 have allowed scientists to grow stem \ncells without mouse cells, but these are all off limits to NIH-funded \nscientists because of the administration's restrictive policy.\n  Even if the 21 lines were not contaminated with mouse cells, they \nwould still be unusable for treatments. The reason is that the use of \nevery one of these cells is constrained by a legal contract called a \nmaterial transfer agreement, and each of these documents contains a \nclause forbidding the use of the cells in patients.\n  Let me be clear. If the cells in the NIH registry weren't already \nuseless for treatment because they are contaminated, they would be \nuseless because the contract under which they are provided forbids \ntheir use in patients.\n  Five years ago, we warned that imposing an arbitrary date restriction \non new stem cell lines would freeze progress by denying NIH researchers \naccess to new lines that might hold the key to medical breakthroughs, \nand these fears have proven well-founded.\n  Since the restrictions were imposed, scientists working overseas or \nwith limited private funds have developed new lines with exceptional \npromise for research. For example, Dr. Douglas Melton at Harvard has \nderived 17 new stem cell lines with improved techniques. Scientists at \nthe University of California have shown that stem cells can be derived \nwithout contamination from animal cells. And doctors in Israel have \ndeveloped stem cell lines that have genetic traits with the potential \nof treating hereditary diseases, such as muscular dystrophy. These \nastonishing breakthroughs could lead to new cures and new understanding \nof these disorders, but the administration's restrictions bar NIH from \nsupporting research to explore their promise. To unlock the healing \npower of stem cell research, the first action our legislation takes is \nto end the ban that keeps NIH from supporting research on new stem cell \nlines.\n  But science without ethics is like a ship without a compass. Strong \nethical guidelines are needed to ensure that scientific progress \nfollows the moral course that we as a society set. For this reason, the \nsecond major action our legislation takes is to establish ethical \nsafeguards for stem cell research. And once again allowing NIH to lead \nstem cell research, we bring more research under the strong ethical \nstandards that are part of every NIH grant for any kind of medical \nresearch. The bedrock principles of these standards are informed \nconsent of the patient and approval of an ethics committee.\n  In addition, when it comes to stem cell research, our legislation \nrequires NIH to go beyond these general requirements and requires NIH \nto issue specific standards for stem cell research. Before the NIH stem \ncell research program was terminated in the early days of the Bush \nadministration, it had developed an extensive and robust ethical \nframework for the research. These requirements include an extra level \nof review to assure that all research was conducted according to \nspecial protections applicable to stem cell research. They limit \nresearch only to cells derived from embryos from fertility clinics that \nwere never to be used to initiate a pregnancy and were likely to be \ndiscarded. They prohibit payment for donation of cells. They forbid \nimproper inducements to donate embryos to further ensure that all cells \nused for research must come from embryos that would not be used to \ninitiate a pregnancy.\n\n  I want to take a moment to discuss this last point in detail. Even \nwith the intense debate on stem cells over the last 5 years, there \nremains some confusion about the source of stem cells. The cells are \nnot derived from fetuses, they are not from embryos that might \notherwise have been used to start a pregnancy.\n  Our legislation explicitly requires the stem cells to be derived:\n\n       From human embryos that have been donated from in vitro \n     fertilization clinics, were created for the purpose of \n     fertility treatment, and were in excess of the clinical need \n     of the individuals seeking such treatment.\n\n  Those are the words, Mr. President.\n  In fertility clinics around the country, there are thousands of \nembryos that are simply thrown away. Hundreds of thousands more are \nfrozen and never used. They are not the result of a pregnancy; they are \nnot the product of an abortion or a miscarriage. The only way they can \nproduce life is to be implanted in a woman, and these embryos we \npropose to save for research have not been and will not be. We believe \nit is better to save embryos that would otherwise be destroyed so they \ncan give the gift of life to patients who are suffering. Life is too \nprecious to allow an opportunity to cure illness to be simply thrown \naway.\n  Some say this debate is only about science, and that it is not a \nmoral choice. I disagree. A vote on this bill involves a deeply moral \nchoice. It is a choice between making progress toward better treatment \nfor patients or spurning a chance for new cures. There are deeply moral \npeople on both sides of this debate, but I am convinced that medical \nprogress is the right one.\n  We have faced similar choices many times in the past. In the 1970s, \nCongress was considering whether to ban research on recombinant DNA--\nthe very foundation of biotechnology. Then, as now, some raised ethical \nconcerns or dismissed the promise of this research as a pipedream, and \nurged Congress to forbid it. In the 1980s, Congress made the right \nchoice by rejecting attempts to outlaw IVF, a technique that has \nfulfilled the hopes and dreams of thousands of parents who never would \nhave been able to have a child otherwise.\n  Other forms of medical progress brought similar controversy: \ntransplantation, blood transfusion, even\n\n[[Page S7604]]\n\nvaccines. All of these breakthroughs were once new and controversial, \nwith strong voices raised against them. All were discussed and debated \nand eventually adopted in ways that are consistent with American \nvalues. Each time we looked to the future and saw the potential of \ncontroversial research, we chose progress, and the benefits have been \nimmense.\n  We should make the same choice on stem cell research. We should not \nallow the misplaced fears of today to deny patients the cures of \ntomorrow.\n  Some argue that we should support research on adult stem cells, or \nstem cells from umbilical cords, or stem cells derived from using new \ngenetic techniques. I agree. We should leave no stone unturned in the \nsearch for new cures. Perhaps some cures will come from one technique \nand other breakthroughs from another. Let's encourage our scientists to \nexplore every avenue that is ethical and could lead to progress. But \nthere is no sense in closing the door on one of the most promising \nareas of medical research discovered in decades, while we wait for \nother, less hopeful methods to show success or failure. That is not my \nassessment; it is the judgment of every major scientific leader in \nAmerica.\n  According to a letter by 80 Nobel laureates:\n\n       For disorders that prove not to be treatable with adult \n     stem cells, impeding human pluripotent stem cell research \n     risks unnecessary delay for millions of patients who may die \n     or endure needless suffering while the effectiveness of adult \n     stem cells is evaluated.\n\n  The Institute of Medicine was just as clear on the need for embryonic \nstem cell research:\n\n       Embryonic stem cells studied in animals clearly are capable \n     of developing into multiple tissues and capable of long-term \n     self-renewal in culture, features that have not yet been \n     demonstrated with many adult stem cells.\n\n  In a letter to the Senate Appropriations Committee, Dr. Elias \nZerhouni, the Director of the NIH, said:\n\n       It is clear that more cell lines would be helpful in \n     ensuring expeditious progress in this important field of \n     science.\n\n  His conclusions were echoed by other NIH Institute Directors such as \nDr. Elizabeth Nabel, head of the NIH Institute on Heart, Lung and Blood \nDisorders, who said:\n\n       The limitations of existing cell lines are hindering \n     scientific progress among a community that is very eager to \n     move forward in this promising area.\n\n  The judgment of the Nation's scientific leaders could not be clearer \nor more emphatic: Yes, we should study adult stem cells, but we should \nlet science decide which approach works best for patients.\n  But in the end, this debate is not about abstract principles or \ncomplex terms of science. It is about people who look with hope to stem \ncell research to help them with the challenges they face.\n  Two years ago, I held a forum in Boston on the promise of stem cell \nresearch. One of the participants was Moira McCarthy Stanford from \nPlymouth, MA, whose 14-year-old daughter Lauren has juvenile diabetes. \nI wish to end my remarks today with a letter that Lauren wrote to me. \nIt explains far more eloquently than any Senator could the urgent need \nto pass this legislation. These are Lauren's words:\n\n       For as long as I can remember, I have had to take a lot of \n     leaps of faith. I have had to believe my parents when they \n     told me taking four or five shots a day and pricking my \n     finger eight or more times a day was just a new kind of \n     normal. I had to--\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 3\\1/2\\ minutes remaining.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the Presiding Officer.\n\n       I had to just smile and say I'm fine when a high blood \n     sugar or a low blood sugar forced me to the sidelines in a \n     big soccer game, or into the base lodge on a perfect ski day, \n     or out at the pool during a swim meet.\n       But when I watched, with my parents, President Bush's \n     decision on stem cell research in the summer of 2001, I just \n     could not accept it. You see, the one thing that has helped \n     me accept all I have had to accept these years is \n     the presence of hope. Hope keeps me going.\n       That night, President Bush talked about protecting the \n     innocent. I wondered then: What about me? I am truly innocent \n     in this situation. I did nothing to bring my diabetes on. \n     There is nothing I can do to make it any better. All I can do \n     is hope for a research breakthrough and keep living the \n     difficult, demanding life of a child with diabetes until the \n     breakthrough comes. How, I ask my parents, is it more \n     important to throw discarded embryos into the trash than it \n     is to let them be used to hopefully save my life.\n       I am so happy to hear that the Senate is thinking of \n     passing H.R. 810. I can dream again--dream of that great day \n     when I write a thank you letter to the Senate, to the House, \n     and everyone who helped me become just another girl; a girl \n     who dreamed and hoped and one day, got just what she wanted: \n     her health and her future. That's all I'm really asking for.\n\n  Those are Lauren's words, and they command us to act. Tomorrow, we \nmust cast a vote of conscience and of courage. We must reaffirm that \nour common value of bringing hope to those who need it outweighs any \nsingle ideology. We must approve the Stem Cell Research Enhancement \nAct, and we must call upon the President of the United States not to \nveto hope.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I believe I have 5 minutes under the order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority controls the time until 5:30.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I yield myself 5 minutes.\n  I wish to take a few moments talking about H.R. 810, the Stem Cell \nResearch Enhancement Act. Last year, the House overwhelmingly passed \nthis bill, and I am pleased that the Senate will now finally consider \nthis legislation. My colleague in the other body, Congressman Jim \nLangevin, has been a staunch advocate for stem cell research and has \nplayed a central role in advancing this legislation through the House \nof Representatives, and I commend him for that.\n  I hope to be able to stand on the Senate floor a few years from now \nto highlight the advancements that have been made in the treatment of \nspinal cord victims, children with diabetes, and Parkinson's treatment \nbecause of embryonic stem cell research. However, I fear that even if \nthe Senate approves legislation, patients will only see further delays \nin promising stem cell research.\n  The President endorsed the use of Federal funds research on existing \ncell lines in his August 2001 Executive Order. At the time of the \nannouncement, he said:\n\n       Scientists believe further research using stem cells offers \n     great promise that could help improve the lives of those who \n     suffer from many terrible diseases--from juvenile diabetes to \n     Alzheimer's, from Parkinson's to spinal cord injuries. And \n     while scientists admit they are not yet certain, they believe \n     stem cells derived from embryos have unique potential.\n\n  This is from the President's Executive Order.\n  We know now that the stem cell lines identified in the Executive \nOrder were not the panacea for breakthrough medical research. There are \nonly 22 stem cell lines available for federally funded research, and \nsince they were derived in the absence of scientific and ethical \nguidelines, they have proven unsuitable for most research. At the same \ntime, there are approximately 400,000 frozen embryos in IVF clinics \nthat will likely be destroyed. While I recognize the many benefits of \nusing embryonic stem cells in biomedical research, I also realize that \nmany serious ethical and moral issues have to be considered. I believe \nFederal guidelines designed to create and uphold strict oversight of \nthese practices can achieve the appropriate balance needed in order to \nensure that this research is being carried out in an acceptable manner.\n  H.R. 810 sets forth responsible rules and limitations for obtaining \nexcess embryos as well as adequate standards for conducting research \ninvolving embryonic stem cells. It would establish the necessary \nframework for oversight so that principled research can finally be \nallowed to proceed.\n  Some of my colleagues believe embryonic stem cell research is not \nnecessary, given some of the tremendous advances adult stem cells have \nyielded. Indeed, I wholeheartedly support continued progress in the \narea of adult stem cell research and was proud to be one of the lead \nsponsors of the Stem Cell Therapeutic and Research Act, which Congress \nenacted late last year. This bill was essential in maintaining patient \naccess to lifesaving treatments through the National Marrow Donor \nprogram and also opening the door to the developments of a companion \nregistry system for cord blood.\n  We know the use of umbilical cord blood in treating diseases such as \nleukemia, sickle cell anemia, and rare but deadly genetic disorders \nsuch as Krabbe disease is showing tremendous promise. The Stem Cell \nTherapeutic\n\n[[Page S7605]]\n\nand Research Act solidified the Nation's commitment to increasing the \nnumber of cord blood transplants by providing additional Federal funds \nto help public cord blood banks increase their inventory, as well as \nsupport outreach, patient advocacy, and coordinating information and \neducation activities.\n  The President also recognized the importance of this avenue of \nresearch. During the 2001 Executive Order, he said:\n\n       You should also know that stem cells can be derived from \n     sources other than embryos. And many scientists feel research \n     on these types of stem cells are also promising. Many \n     patients suffering from a range of diseases are already being \n     helped with treatment developed from adult stem cells.\n\n  He went on to add:\n\n       However, most scientists, at least today, believe that \n     research on embryonic stem cells offer the most promise \n     because these cells have the potential to develop from all of \n     the tissues of the body.\n\n  Those are the President's words. I urge all of us to heed those words \ntoday.\n  I urge the Senate to support H.R. 810 and also the President to sign \nit into law. I also intend to support S. 3504 and S. 2754, but neither \nof these measures is a substitute for H.R. 810.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I rise to take advantage of the time \nassigned or allotted for all of us to discuss what is obviously a \npassionate, controversial, and important issue. But I rise to talk \nabout it from, probably, a different perspective than some of the other \nspeeches--at least those I have heard. I want to talk prospectively, \nabout what happens after this debate is over.\n  If all the predictions come true, at the end of the day we will not \ndebate stem cells for the rest of this year because the agreement to \nbring it to the floor was that we come to the floor, we debate these \nthree bills, and the debate would be over for the year.\n  The debate will not be over. In fact, if anything, this is probably \nthe beginning of a long debate as we deal with the ethics and the \nmorality and the hope and the promise of science as it relates to stem \ncells--in particular, embryonic stem cells.\n  When the President issued his order in August of 2001, I supported it \nbecause it invested in embryonic stem cell research and it clearly drew \nthe line in terms of how far we would go. I have been supportive of the \nPresident's policies on embryonic stem cell research since.\n  When H.R. 810 passed, I began to do what I think all of us should do. \nI began to get educated as best I could on this controversial and \nimportant issue. Dr. Michael Johns at Emory University helped me. Dr. \nSteven Stice, at the University of Georgia, helped me. I sat through \nmore than a few demonstrations--not sales presentations but \ndemonstrations of programs and efforts in embryonic stem cell research \nunderway, under NIH guidelines, and were moving forward.\n  I learned a lot. I learned this promise of embryonic stem cells was \nuncovered or identified in 1998. Research has been done for 8 years. \nThey hold great promise. Adult stem cells have been around longer and \nhave demonstrated promise beyond what embryonic has today, but that is \nbecause of the time and the amount of money that has been invested.\n  But I learned one thing. I am not smart enough to know what the end \nresult of all this research will be, but I am smart enough to know that \nour country must continue to be a player in the research. Everywhere \nNIH is involved, you have standards, you have ethics, you have \nprocedures, and you have protocols. It is very important that all those \nexist in such a delicate and important type of research. We must be \nrespectful of human life.\n  The proposal in H.R. 810 that is of concern is that it involves the \ndestruction of an embryo that, if implanted, could become a human \nbeing. That is a legitimate concern for us as a country to have.\n  When Senator Frist began fielding inquiries with regard to this \nissue, months ago, after H.R. 810 passed the House, I engaged myself as \nI was in this learning process in hopes of finding a prospect where we \ncould match the standards of ethics we all want and also invest in the \nhope for the future. I believed that there was a way--in fact, there is \na way--that we could invest in embryonic stem cell research without \ninvolving the destruction of an embryo that could be transferable to \nthe womb and become a fetus.\n  For a second, I wish to discuss that on the floor simply, if nothing \nelse, to point out that there are many opportunities of hope out there \nthat meet both the ethical and the moral as well as the scientific \ndesire that I think a consensus of this body has.\n  Dr. Steven Stice is a noted researcher at the University of Georgia. \nI had the privilege of meeting him last year. I have three times been \nto his clinic at the university. Dr. Steven Stice is a man who \nunderstands the concern over the ethics of the destruction of a viable \nembryo. So in the development of embryonic lines BG01, 2, and 3, which \nwere developed prior to August of 2001 and are in operation at the \nUniversity of Georgia today, those stem cell lines were derived from \nthe byproducts of in vitro fertilization that could not be implanted \nand could not be frozen.\n  My point to you, the Presiding Officer, and the ladies and gentlemen \nof the Senate, is this: There are three lines that exist today that \nwere derived from the byproducts of in vitro fertilization that could \nnot be implanted in the womb and become a fetus or be frozen for \nsubsequent implantation. Under the Guarder et al. principles in the \ngrading of material in in vitro fertilization, there is a clear line of \nthat which is viable, that which can be frozen, and that which cannot. \nIt doesn't involve the discarding of anything that can be viable, but \nit does lend hope that from sources other than the viable embryos, stem \ncells can be derived.\n  I respect human life and I want us, as a nation, to always be \nrespectful and never disrespectful of it and its potential. I also \nrespect the wonder of science in innovation and the great discoveries \nthat it has brought. I stand here today believing that you can do both \nand that as we move forward, beyond this debate, beyond a veto if it \ntakes place--whatever the fire and substance is--we should start \ntomorrow looking at these other alternatives. Just in the 18 months \nsince this issue began to bubble up in the Senate, there have been \nbreakthroughs, such as single cell extraction from embryos without the \ndestruction of the embryo--something that holds great promise for those \ncells to actually replicate themselves into stem cells.\n\n  We can do it. It is important that we stay on course to do it. But it \nis important that we not break the ethical principles to which we are \ncommitted and always be respectful of life.\n  In the course of the negotiations with the leader--and I want to \ninject something here with regard to Majority Leader Frist. I don't \nknow anybody who has ever been dealt a tougher hand in terms of coming \nto a resolution of these issues. I thank him for the amount of input he \nlet me have. Unfortunately, I was unsuccessful in being a part of the \nfinal debate, in terms of what I just described, in terms of the stem \ncell lines they are operating on at the University of Georgia, but I \nthink under the circumstances he did the best he could.\n  Sincerely I stand here as a Member of the Senate with 4 years \nremaining in my term, knowing that we will revisit this issue time and \nagain. As science changes and moves forward, there will be ways we can \nembrace, ethically and rightfully, research that holds hope and promise \nfor those who suffer and those who are afflicted.\n  My last comment is this. I was a real estate broker in my private \nlife, before I came to Congress. I am not a doctor and I am not a \nscientist. I have heard some declaratory statements on the floor about \nwhat research will and will not prove in the future. I didn't just fall \noff a turnip truck. You do research to determine what you are going to \nfind out, not just to predict what it will or will not do.\n  As we go through this difficult, tenuous debate over a subject of \nimmense\n\n[[Page S7606]]\n\nimportance to the American people, let's look for ways that we can be \nrespectful of human life and open the doors for the furtherance of \ndevelopment in science in embryonic stem cells. I submit there are ways \nto do both, and I will be here to work with the leader, with my \ncolleagues, and with our President to unlock those doors so that \npromise and hope exists and we never breach the ethical divide that \ncaused the debate today.\n  I yield the remainder of my time and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I see the next speaker is here, and I \nyield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine is recognized.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to speak to an issue of \ntremendous significance to countless Americans and to generations to \ncome--the matter of stem cell research. I thank the majority leader for \nhis tireless efforts to ensure consideration of stem cell legislation. \nThe bottom line is, there is research we could be conducting today that \ncould help us treat--and in some cases cure--some of our most serious \ndiseases. That is why two-thirds of Americans favor embryonic stem cell \nresearch and why I have cosponsored H.R. 810, the Stem Cell Research \nEnhancement Act.\n  The promise of stem cell legislation lies in the simple fact that \nembryonic stem cells have the unique potential to develop into any of \nthe cells which could be needed to treat the multitude of diseases from \nwhich Americans suffer. The vast potential of stem cell therapy is key \nto many future therapy because in so many diseases, cells are lost and \ntheir function is often irreplaceable. Stem cells offer an opportunity \nto actually replace cells which are lost.\n  Consider today that 20 million Americans live with diabetes. Despite \ntreatment with drugs and insulin, many experience vision loss, injury \nto extremities, heart disease and other complications. For years, \nscientists have sought to find a cure. And today stem cells offer that \npotential to end dependence on insulin, freeing millions from diabetes.\n  In many diseases, there simply is not even a therapy to replace the \nfunction of lost cells. Brain disorders such as Parkinson's disease, \nALS or ``Lou Gehrig's disease,'' and Alzheimer's disease have only \nlimited treatment options available. We simply cannot replace the \nfunction which is lost. But with new therapies derived from stem cells, \nwe could see major breakthroughs in avoiding the terrible toll that \nmillions now experience.\n  Today the Senate is considering three bills. The first of these, the \nFetus Farming Prohibition Act, certainly addresses an issue about which \nI expect there is no disagreement in the Senate. No embryo should ever \nbe conceived for the purpose of producing stem cells. That is not at \nissue. Nor does any reputable scientist desire to work with human \ntissue produced in an animal. These prohibitions are not controversial \nand I believe my colleagues will join me in supporting them.\n  In fact, 1 year ago this week, I joined with Senators Feinstein, \nSpecter, Hatch, and others to introduce the Human Cloning Ban Act to \nmake indisputably clear another prohibition--that no human would be \ncloned. Nor is stem cell research about conducting research on embryos.\n  I do share with the majority leader the concern that we address the \nhighest levels of ethical standards, and I have great confidence that \nwith the Federal Government playing a role in this research, we can \nbring such standards to bear.\n  This is essential--that the Federal Government be constructively \nengaged.\n  The second piece of legislation concerns stem cell research already \nsupported by the Federal Government. My colleague, Senator Santorum, \nhas introduced legislation--the Alternative Pluripotent Stem Cell \nTherapies Enhancement Act, S. 2754--to promote the use of ``alternative \nstem cells.'' These are typically ``adult stem cells.'' These cells are \nalready partly specialized, and have the potential to develop into \nseveral kinds of cells. Yet they are not the same as embryonic stem \ncells, which can develop into potentially any kind of tissue. So their \nuse is limited. Cord blood stem cells are an example of this type of \ncell, and they have certainly proven useful in treating some diseases.\n  I must note that no obstacles currently exist to the kind of research \nthe Santorum bill addresses. Clearly, adult stem cells have potential, \nand certainly research on them should continue to be pursued. Yet by \npassing this bill we do not open any new avenues to our scientists. In \nfact, we can make them take a detour. This is why.\n  We know that in order to use embryonic stem cells to make cells which \ncan be used to treat a disease--like diabetes--scientists must learn \nhow to make the cell become the right type.\n  But an adult stem cell is actually already somewhat specialized, so \none could not use them to produce many of the types of cells we need to \nproduce new therapies. Essentially, one would have to take such a stem \ncell and reverse its development back to an embryonic stage and then \nbegin the task to develop it into the specialized cell required. It is \nas if you were driving down an interstate on a trip, took an exit, made \na few turns, and then decided to back up in reverse all the way to the \ninterstate in an attempt to try another destination. This is not the \nway to get where you are going.\n  So while adult stem cells have promise--they certainly are not \ncomparable to an embryonic cell--with its potential to become any type \nof cell in the body. And even if you could turn an adult stem cell into \nan embryonic stem cell--you have simply doubled the obstacles and work \nrequired to reach your destination--which is a cure. That means \nmillions of lives lost as you pursue a convoluted course. . . .when \nembryonic stem cells provide a far more direct path to creating cures.\n  That is why I am a sponsor of the Stem Cell Research Enhancement \nAct--H.R. 810--the third bill on which we will vote. Remember that we \nshared hope for progress back in August of 2001 when the President \ndeclared research could utilize the stem cell lines then in existence. \nYet scientists have found that many of the cells were contaminated or \notherwise unusable. In part we know that even when a stem cell line is \ncreated, it cannot reproduce indefinitely. So we must address how we \nmay obtain additional cell lines for medical research.\n\n  I thank Senators Specter and Harkin, and Representatives Castle and \nDeGette for joining together to work to address the fundamental \nquestion of federal participation in embryonic stem cell research. The \nlegislation which they produced sets a very constrained set of \ncircumstances under which embryonic stems cells may be obtained in \norder to assure we can move this vital research forward within an \nethical framework. Never will an embryo be created for research \npurposes, nor does this legislation facilitate such studies. The act \nassures that an embryo may be used only when it would not ever be used \nfor infertility treatment. Donation must be voluntary, under full \ninformed consent and no financial or other inducement may be given.\n  The fact is that fertility treatment has allowed many to have \nfamilies whom otherwise could not. A consequence of this remarkable \ntherapy is that some embryos are created which will not be used. I must \nnote that under the Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act, it will be the \ncouple who will--under no bias--decide whether they will be used. This \nlegislation facilitates that donation.\n  Today Americans who have faced fertility problems are facing the \nquestion of what to do with unused embryos. Indefinite storage is not \ntruly an option--we know that we cannot maintain the viability of these \nembryos indefinitely. So given the choices available, some couples see \nthe potential to help those suffering from serious disease. It assures \nthat this gift can be given and used to help medical progress.\n  I believe many Americans who have undergone fertility treatment and \nrealized a gift of life in their families will opt to save lives \nthrough a donation which promises to save many lives. But\n\n[[Page S7607]]\n\nit must always be individual conscience that is the determinative \nfactor--and I respect the views and conscience of each and every \nindividual on this matter.\n  There can be no doubt that stem cell research will move forward. The \nreal question is whether our Nation will be engaged . . . whether our \nscientists will realize the breakthroughs . . . whether we will produce \nthe treatments. Or whether those developments will draw our best minds \nand new medical investment abroad, where American vision and oversight \nwill not influence the future of medicine.\n  I believe in stem cell research. More than 70 percent of the American \npeople believe in stem cell research. I believe in it because I cannot \nlook at a person suffering from a debilitating, and even fatal disease \nand support prohibitions which impede ethical research aimed at \nalleviating of that suffering. That is why I joined with my colleagues \nin the Senate in urging President Bush to ease the current restrictions \non the use of stem cells so that research can move forward and lives \ncould be saved. That is why I am a sponsor of the Senate version of \nthis legislation introduced by Senators Specter and Harkin. It is why I \nurge my colleagues to give that bill their support. This is the bill \nwhich will make a difference. I urge the President to reconsider this \nissue, and urge his support. Hopefully he will not veto this \nlegislation because ultimately the alternative is to accept the status \nquo. The status quo is not right for those suffering from these \ndiseases and for future generations who will.\n  I think back to President Reagan's passing 2 years ago, and remember \nthe outpouring of concern we all had for our former President, and the \nFirst Lady and their entire family. We spoke much of the tragedy of \nAlzheimer's Disease and how we must do more to alleviate the suffering. \nNancy Reagan inspired us all with her courage--and inspires us no less \nin her call for research which could alleviate the suffering from so \nmany diseases. Her recent words call out to us, ``A lot of time is \nbeing wasted . . . A lot of people who could be helped are not being \nhelped.''\n  I cannot think of a more significant living memorial to our former \nPresident than to allow more research to be done in order to find new \ncures for diseases affecting millions of people.\n  Today I ask my colleagues to consider allowing individuals--who have \nthrough modern medical science, enjoyed a gift of life, to contribute \nto saving other lives. That is exactly what H.R. 810 does, and that is \nwhy we must send this bill to the President and he must sign it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas is recognized.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, how much time remains on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 8 minutes 30 seconds.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Thank you very much.\n  I want to point out in a little different format to my colleagues \nthat when we talk about direct areas of being able to get treatments--\nwe covered this some today--this is a little bit of a different \npresentation and a little more directly related to where we are getting \ntreatments in this field, which is in the adult stem cell field. Here \nare some of the various areas where we get direct treatments.\n  The area of embryonic research, while interesting and intriguing, is \nnot producing any results. It is not producing any cures. We are \ngetting direct results from the adult, and we are not getting the \nformation of tumors in the adults. This area is working.\n  I also point out this is at no cost. People say these are embryos and \nwe are throwing them away. You look at that. And I had this morning in \nmy office and at a press conference three snowflake babies. These are \nall babies who were in in vitro fertilization clinics, were not going \nto be implanted by the natural parents, were given up for adoption. \nThey are here now, and they are beautiful and they are wonderful. They \nare absolutely precious.\n  This isn't some sort of throwaway commodity. I point out to people \nthat if you are one of those individuals who have frozen embryos--the \nnumber I hear is that 1 in 10 people in the United States suffer from \ninfertility problems. There are a lot of people who would want to and \ndo want to implant these frozen embryos and give them the nurturing \nthey need to become humans we would all recognize. I hope people will \nlook at that.\n  My other point is on President Reagan, who certainly was an \ninspiration for me to get into public office, and had a beautiful \nwinsomeness about his presentation of truth. He was a fabulous \nindividual. President Reagan was pro life. President Reagan did not and \nwould not agree with the destruction of young human life. In fact, he \nsaid at one point in time, if there is a doubt about whether it is a \nlife, if somebody was dying and there was a doubt about whether they \nare dead, you wouldn't put them in a casket and bury them. You would \ngive them the benefit of the doubt. You would say, Well, let us work to \nbring them back.\n  The same on the young end--if there is a question, you err on the \nside of life. You treat this as life. There is a kind of common sense \nabout it.\n  President Reagan was pro life. He fought for pro-life issues. He \nwould not want to see us destroy one human life for the benefit of \nanother.\n  A final point in this area: President Reagan suffered Alzheimer's \ndisease. Alzheimer's is, as I understand it being explained to me, a \nplaque disease on the brain material. It is highly unlikely it is going \nto be treated with stem cells. Parkinson's is an area where we have \nadult stem cell treatment--a different type of disease. But the disease \nPresident Reagan fell to was Alzheimer's. It is highly unlikely that \nany stem cell, even adult or cord blood, and even more unlikely \nembryonic or cloning, would deal with the area of Alzheimer's.\n  The only reason I mention that is I think we need to try to be very \naccurate in our debate in saying what is a good possibility and hope \nand what is not. That one would be unlikely. Parkinson's we have a good \nshot at in the adult stem cell, and we have some early treatments \nalready showing some promise in that particular field. But I don't \nthink it is wise that we bring that up in that particular instance in \nthe case of Alzheimer's. I think it is important that we be very clear \nabout what this is and what will work and what will not.\n  The other thing I want to make mention of when we are talking about \ncures for things in this field is let us talk about areas where we have \nreal scientific prospects of getting this done in the adult field. In \nthe embryonic, as we have said for some period of time, it is unlikely \nto produce any sort of direct benefit to patients any time in the near \nfuture. That is according to scientists who are pro embryonic stem cell \nresearch. We can do more research in this field. There is some \nunderstanding from the presentation of the Senator from Georgia talking \nabout other areas to derive embryonic type of stem cells. That is \nsomething we can do. The scientific community is producing more and \nmore results in that particular area which I think are quite helpful \nand quite promising for us. It removes the ethical dilemma on this. It \nwould be deriving embryonic type stem cells but without destroying \nembryos.\n  We are coming up with this along with the stem cell line. People are \ncoming up with this in other fields. There is no reason to go into the \nethical area--the question of destroying human life with taxpayer \ndollars to be able to get that done. I think it is important that we \npoint out those particular areas in this bioethical debate.\n  One of the bills we will be voting on is an alternative bill. I \ntalked about the fetal farming bill. I hope that passes 100 to zero so \nwe can ban fetal farming. A lot has been talked about on H.R. 810, \nwhich is expansion of the stem cell lines using embryos and Federal \ntaxpayer dollars to do that.\n  What has been talked about less is this area of the Santorum-Specter \nbill which would create embryonic type stem cells without destroying \nembryos. Here is a way for people, if they are troubled about the \nethics of destroying a young human--I really do not want to do that, \nbut you think there is a promising area of inquiry on these embryonic \ntype stem cells and you are looking at this saying, Yes, it is not \nproducing cures or results right now, but it might in a decade or two, \nso I would like to see this pursued--here is an ethical alternative for \nyou to pursue. You don't have to say, Let's destroy this young human \nlife. You can\n\n[[Page S7608]]\n\nsay, Let us go with the alternative here where we are finding \nscientifically that we can derive these types of stem cells without the \ndestruction of human life, embryos. If you like this field of inquiry, \nI raise a question about embryonic stem cells because we have invested \n$.5 billion in animal and human. We don't have any applications for it \ntoday, but if you are still saying we still ought to invest in this \nfield because it might produce something, it might produce something \nbig, you have an alternative which you can vote for in this Santorum-\nSpecter alternative bill, and say, We want to pursue the science in \nthis particular field. That is an area and a possibility that could \nwork and we can and should, I think, pursue. I think it would be a good \nalternative for somebody who is in that type of quandary about which \nway to pursue this.\n  I will have further comments later on this evening. I don't want to \ntake up the other side's time. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence \nof a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Isakson). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, we are awaiting the arrival of a Senator \non our side to speak on the stem cell issues. Until that happens, I \nwill take a couple of minutes to talk about something my friend from \nKansas brought up earlier today about adult stem cell treatments.\n  I am reading a letter from Scienceexpress, a publication of Science \nmagazine. It is entitled, ``Adult Stem Cell Treatments for Diseases?''\n\n       Opponents of research with embryonic stem (ES) cells often \n     claim that adult stem cells provide treatments for 65 human \n     illnesses. The apparent origin of those claims is a list \n     created by David A. prentice, an employee of the Family \n     Research Council who advises U.S. Senator Sam Brownback (R-\n     KS) and other opponents of ES cell research.\n       Prentice has said, ``Adult stem cells have now helped \n     patients with at least 65 different human diseases. It's real \n     help for real patients''. On 4 May, Senator Brownback stated, \n     ``I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the \n     listing of 69 different human illnesses being treated by \n     adult and cord blood stem cells''.\n       In fact, adult stem cell treatments fully tested in all \n     required phases of clinical trials and approved by the U.S. \n     Food and Drug Administration are available to treat only nine \n     of the conditions on the Prentice list, not 65.\n\n  Again, it exposed most of these as kind of being bogus. One of those \nlisted was testicular cancer. Testicular cancer is not being treated \nwith adult stem cells, at least not successfully. In fact, according to \nthe Sciencexpress article, the study that is supposed to be the basis \nfor that claim is actually a study on how to isolate adult stem cells.\n  The Senator from Kansas also has a list that included several \nleukemias and lymphomas. Let's hear what George Dahlman of the Leukemia \nand Lymphoma Society has to say about that.\n\n       On behalf of the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society, I am writing \n     in response to assertions that adult stem cells have treated \n     or cured several blood cancers, including several leukemias, \n     lymphomas and multiple myeloma.\n       As a representative of more than 700,000 patients and their \n     caregivers in this country that battle blood cancers on a \n     daily basis, our organization would like to emphasize as the \n     Senate debates H.R. 810, the Stem Cell Research and \n     Enhancement Act, that we exist today because we have not \n     found cures for these devastating diseases. Furthermore, the \n     claim that treatment of blood cancers with cord blood, blood \n     or marrow stem cells--known as hematopoietic stem cells--\n     demonstrates the potential of `adult stem cell' research or \n     is a substitute for embryonic stem cell research is \n     misleading and disingenuous.\n\n  Mr. Dahlman concludes:\n\n       The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society asks that you and your \n     colleagues pass H.R. 810, and not accept any substitutes.\n\n  All in all, according to the science journal, only nine diseases of \nthe 65 examined have proved to even respond to treatment with adult \nstem cells.\n  The authors of the analysis conclude that claims about stem cells \nbeing in general use for 65 diseases are false. Such claims ``mislead \nlay people and cruelly deceive patients.''\n  Again, we are going to hear a lot of talk about all we can do other \nthan embryonic stem cell research. This should not be a debate about \nwhether we do adult stem cells, cord blood, or all these other things. \nThey are all worthy of research.\n  Those that are for adult stem cell research, cord blood, bone marrow \nresearch, that type of thing, all say they want to do that to the \nexclusion of embryonic stem cells. Those who are in support of H.R. 810 \nsay let's do them all and do them all in an ethically acceptable \nmanner.\n  Again, we have strong ethical guidelines. One, we do not create any \nembryos with this bill. You can only use the embryos that are already \nexisting in IVF clinics that are left over that will be discarded. \nSecond, we must have written informed consent of the donors. Third, no \none can get paid; no money can change hands. You cannot entice someone \nto donate these embryos with money. We have strong ethical guidelines.\n  Lastly, I have heard comments today time and time again about how \nthis bill, H.R. 810, involves the destruction of embryos. I challenge \nanyone to show me where in H.R. 810 it provides for the destruction of \nany embryos. Under the Dickey-Wicker amendment that is now existing, no \nFederal funds can be used to destroy embryos. All H.R. 8l0 says is that \nonce stem cells are derived through private means or whatever, then \nFederal funds can be used to go to universities or to other researchers \nto study these embryonic stem cells.\n  There is nothing in this bill, and I challenge anyone to show me in \nH.R. 810 where it provides for the destruction of any embryos; it does \nnot. To say otherwise is being disingenuous. The Dickey-Wicker \namendment still applies. No Federal money can be used for the \ndestruction of embryos, plain and simple.\n  I see my colleague from Illinois is here. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator from Iowa not only for yielding but \nalso for being the leader on our side of the aisle on this issue, with \nSenator Specter on the Republican side. I am glad this day has finally \ncome. This matter has been on the calendar for over a year.\n  For over a year, millions of Americans have been wondering when the \nSenate will take this up. Finally, it has been scheduled. A lot of \npeople outside this Chamber had a lot to do with it being scheduled. \nFirst Lady Nancy Reagan stood up and spoke up when she saw the late \nPresident suffering from Alzheimer's. Her voice has made a difference. \nI salute her for that. Christopher and Dana Reeve, both gone now, in \ntheir lifetime, the dedication and energy they put on this issue made \nall the difference in the world.\n  There are three votes tomorrow. There is only one that gets to the \nheart of the issue. There are some that are going to address a lot of \ndifferent issues from different perspectives, but there is only one \nthat counts when it comes to stem cell research. The Stem Cell Research \nEnhancement Act is the only bill that expands Federal funding for \nembryonic stem cell research, the type that holds out so much promise.\n  The other two bills are well intentioned. I am not going to say \nanything negative about them. I will vote for them because, frankly, \nthey make little or no difference. One of them bans practices that \npresently are not being used. I guess that is a good thing to do. I \nwill vote for that bill.\n  The other one, by Senator Santorum of Pennsylvania, won't accomplish \nmuch. This was the question I asked of Dr. James Battey of the National \nInstitutes of Health about the Santorum bill: Can you tell me whether \nS. 2754 authorizes research on stem cells at the NIH that currently is \nnot permissible or legal?\n  He answered: No, it does not.\n  So it does not give new authority to NIH, and it does not expand \nresearch. It has some motive other than medical for being offered.\n  William Neaves, a leading stem cell researcher, has it right:\n\n       This is not a contest between adult stem cells and \n     embryonic stem cells. Instead, it is a contest between \n     society and disease.\n\n  I have listened to some of the arguments in the Senate. Some of the \narguments are that adult stem cell research has great potential. I \nbelieve that is true. I believe we should pursue it aggressively. \nHowever, the argument seems to be that if that is the case,\n\n[[Page S7609]]\n\nthen we do not have to concern ourselves with embryonic stem cell \nresearch.\n  I am a liberal arts lawyer and do not profess to know about medical \nresearch, but why foreclose a whole area of research with embryonic \nstem cells that the greatest minds in America tell us is so promising? \nWhy wouldn't we do both, both adult stem cell research, as well as \nembryonic stem cell research? From that point of view, I cannot follow \nthe logic in opposing this bill.\n  Former Senator John Danforth is another person who has thought about \nthis issue. I respect him a lot. He is an ordained Episcopal minister \nand a longtime opponent of abortion. Like tens of millions of \nAmericans, he comes from a family that knows the pain of disease. He \nlost one of his brothers to Lou Gehrig's disease. He wrote this in the \nSt. Louis-Post Dispatch:\n\n       A choice between two understandings of human life. On one \n     hand, we have millions of people who suffer from ALS, \n     Alzheimer's, juvenile diabetes, Parkinson's, spinal cord \n     injuries and cancer--and the loved ones who care for them and \n     suffer by their sides. On the other hand, we have tiny \n     bundles of unfertilized cells existing in petri dishes.\n\n  He went on to write, the people who oppose stem cell research:\n\n       should explain to the afflicted and their loved ones why \n     they care more about those cell bundles than they do about \n     the people.\n\n  This Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act has been supported by so many \ngroups. I ask unanimous consent, Mr. President, to have the names of \nsome of those groups printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                         Who Supports H.R. 810\n\n       The Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act is supported by more \n     than 200 patient groups, scientists and medical research \n     groups. They include: American Medical Association, American \n     Association for Cancer, American Diabetes Association, \n     Juvenile Diabetes Foundation, American Pediatric Society, \n     March of Dimes, the ALS Association, Parkinsons Action \n     Network, Alzheimer's Association, Parent Project Muscular \n     Dystrophy, Kidney Cancer Association, Coalition for Pulmonary \n     Fibrosis, and the Society for Neuroscience Research.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. I would say that all of the big names in medical research \nin America support this bill. They understand this is the real deal. \nThis is the bill that will make a difference. The other two may not.\n  Among the other groups supporting the Stem Cell Research Enhancement \nAct are the Republican Main Street Partnership, the B'nai B'rith \nInternational, and a long list of people representing religious \norganizations from almost every denomination in America.\n  Why do we need this? We need it because President Bush decided in \n2001 to take a position on medical research. I do not think there is a \nprecedent in American history for what he did. He basically said we \nwere going to cut off Federal funding for those who were involved in \nembryonic stem cell research, except for a limited number of lines. He \nidentified 78 stem cell lines on the day of his speech and said that \nscientists who received any Federal funding at all could work only on \nthose stem cell lines.\n  As Senator Harkin has pointed out over and over, not only were the 78 \nlines reduced to 22, they are all contaminated. They cannot be used for \nthis research anymore. So President Bush is not offering any hope when \nit comes to this area of research. I do not want to get into the moral \nargument here because it is almost religious. It is moral and \ntheological here. But if the President could rationalize 78 stem cell \nlines as being appropriate and all right for research, then he has \nfundamentally decided the research is permissible, I suppose. I do not \nfollow his logic. And I do not follow the logic of some who oppose it \nwho say that because this is a product of in vitro fertilization and \nhas the potential for life that we should not do research. We know that \nin that process, some of these fertilized eggs will end up being \nimplanted in the womb of an expectant mother in the hope she becomes \npregnant, and others will not be used. It is the nature of the process. \nThey make more of these fertilized eggs than they will need in the \nhopes that one will work.\n  Then what happens to the rest? Well, they are going to be discarded. \nThey are not used to find cures for diseases. But for those who find it \nimmoral to use the product of that process for medical research, I \nstill am troubled by the notion that they have not come to the floor \nasking that we ban in vitro fertilization, because we know that is a \nnatural consequence of this process. And if it is permissible and moral \nand legal to have a process which results in these extra cells, I do \nnot understand the moral question about using these fertilized cells to \ngive people a chance to live and to live their lives better. I just do \nnot understand that.\n  To measure the impact of President Bush's policy, Stanford University \nlooked at peer-reviewed research published in scientific journals. They \nfound that embryonic stem cell research in the United States made up \none-third of the papers published in 2002 but only a fourth of those \npublished in 2004. Research is slowing down. President Bush's decision \nis reducing the number of opportunities for embryonic stem cell \nresearch.\n  The world's best and most respected scientists--our own NIH \nleadership--tell us that this area of scientific research could lead to \ntreatments and cures. Dr. James Battey chairs the NIH working group on \nstem cells. This is what he said before the Senate Labor, HHS \nSubcommittee:\n\n       There's no scientist that I know who would argue that more \n     stem cell lines wouldn't accelerate the pace of scientific \n     research. . . . Cell lines offer scientific opportunities \n     that are right now beyond the reach of federal funds.\n\n  Other things have changed since President Bush's decision in 2001 as \nwell. We have learned more about the potential of stem cell research. \nDr. John Kessler is the chair of the neurology department at \nNorthwestern University Medical School in Chicago, which I am honored \nto represent. He is also the father of a 20-year-old daughter who is \nparalyzed as a result of a spinal cord injury. He told me personally \nthat he finds the current administration policy ``unconscionable'' in \nlight of everything we have learned since 2001.\n  H.R. 810--the real bill, the one that is important, and the one that \nwill make the difference--would loosen the handcuffs on America's \nscientists. It would allow scientists to receive Federal funding to use \nembryonic stem cell lines in their research if--and only if--two very \nspecific conditions are met. First, the stem cell lines must be derived \nfrom eggs that were produced for in vitro fertilization but are going \nto be discarded. The choice is research or destruction of these \npotential means of creating medical opportunities. Second, both adults \nto whom the eggs belong must provide written consent that the eggs be \ndonated to science.\n  It is estimated 400,000 excess eggs are being stored now in clinics \naround the country, stored in petri dishes at 300 degrees below zero. \nOpponents of this research say it is unethical to use them for \nresearch. But if they are not used, they will be destroyed. How in the \nworld can that be the right ethical, moral choice to destroy the \nopportunity for research to cure disease?\n\n  I see my colleague from Washington is here, and I know she wants to \nspeak. I will close by saying this: I have met some of the children who \nare victims of juvenile diabetes. I guess it comes home personally when \nyou sit down with these kids and their mothers, and the mothers say: I \nwake my daughter up twice in the midst of the night to take a blood \ntest to see how she is doing. Think about that for that poor little \ngirl being awakened twice each night. And think about the mother and \nher worries that that little girl, who she loves so much, may go blind \nor lose a limb or die. And think about the hope they have in their \nhearts that this research will go forward.\n  I have met the victims of ALS and diabetes and Parkinson's and \nAlzheimer's. I know they are praying we do the right thing tomorrow. I \nhope we pass this bill. I am not certain it will pass, but I am hopeful \nit will. It will have strong support on this side of the aisle, and I \nhope there will be enough votes on both sides of the aisle to enact it. \nThen the bill will go to President Bush, and he will have a moment in \nthe history of this country to make a momentous decision. If he decides \nto go forward and veto the stem cell research bill, it will be the \nfirst veto of the Bush Presidency.\n\n[[Page S7610]]\n\n  President Bush described himself politically when he ran for office \nas a compassionate conservative. His decision on the future of this \nbill will be the test of his compassion. If he has compassion for those \nwho are suffering across America, who are praying for the hope this \nresearch can bring, I hope he will pray over his decision long and \nhard. And if we pass this bill, I hope he will sign it and give these \nAmericans a chance for a better tomorrow.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I join my colleagues on the floor to \nspeak about H.R. 810. I applaud the Senator from Illinois for his \ncomments because I know he has many fine research institutions in his \nState and has met with many people who suffer from a variety of \ndiseases who could be helped if H.R. 810 is passed and signed by the \nPresident. So I commend him for his remarks.\n  I certainly thank the Senator from Iowa for being out here all \nafternoon talking about the importance of this legislation and trying \nto communicate how important it is that H.R. 810, the legislation that \nfocuses on embryonic stem cell research, be passed and signed by the \nPresident.\n  I also want to say I know the Senator from Kansas has been out here, \nand I have enjoyed working with him on a variety of pieces of \nlegislation, particularly legislation that dealt with international \nmarriage brokers, trying to protect women who come to America, making \nsure they got full information about people who were helping them apply \nfor visas before they come to the country. So I certainly have enjoyed \nworking with the Senator from Kansas on other legislation.\n  But I wish to say I think it is important we focus our debate on H.R. \n810--an important bill on embryonic stem cell research--in the context \nof science, because I believe Congress must not stand in the way of \nscience. I think tomorrow's vote is exactly what that is about. So I \nwant to be clear that I support that legislation and will work to \noverturn any attempts to veto this legislation.\n  Like my colleagues, I have met these Americans who for too long have \nwanted to have hope. They have waited to have real hope that there \nwould be a lifesaving stem cell research program. Many Americans \nbelieve we can do better. We know there are 3 million Americans who \nneed help, and we understand that by investing today we can save lives \ntomorrow. We understand, for Americans who suffer from Alzheimer's or \nALS or Parkinson's disease, it really does mean hope and a new way of \nlooking at opportunity for them.\n  We will have a debate about this continuing today and tomorrow. But \nwe need to keep in mind it is good science that is at question. For us \nin Washington State, with 35,000 Washingtonians living with Parkinson's \ndisease today, understanding what embryonic stem cell research can do \nfor them is of utmost importance.\n  We also have 300,000 Washingtonians who have been diagnosed with \ndiabetes who, obviously, are very interested in this legislation. We \nhave 160,000 Washington State residents who struggle with heart failure \nand understand there is so much that could be done in this particular \narea of research. We have 5,000 Washingtonians who suffer from spinal \ncord injuries. So there are people all over our State with various \nmedical challenges who are looking to us to make the right decision and \nto allow critical research to give them promise for opportunity in the \nfuture.\n  At the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center--I know my colleague \nfrom Iowa has visited the Fred Hutchinson Research Center--they are \napplying groundbreaking science and using adult stem cells to treat \nblood cancers such as leukemia, lymphoma, and various other diseases. \nThey are also looking to do the same for kidney cancers.\n  The Benaroya Research Institute at Virginia Mason in Seattle is \nworking with stem cells on a collaborative 5-year project to grow a \nliving heart. The effort could lead to tissue-engineered replacement \nhearts, and it means that could help us with various challenges in that \nparticular area of health care.\n\n  The University of Washington, which is in Seattle, boasts 70 \nscientists involved in aspects of stem cell biology addressing \neverything from liver disease to coronary heart disease. Three years \nago, the NIH named the University of Washington one of the three \nexemplary centers for human embryonic stem cell research. But in the \nlast 5 years, since President Bush banned the funding for embryonic \nstem cell research, it is as though our Nation has turned its back on \nthat science and that work that could be done, and I am sure not just \nin Washington State. But that is a representative example of what could \nbe done if we moved forward.\n  It is important we continue to move forward by passing H.R. 810. The \ntruth is that right now adult stem cells do not have anywhere near the \nscientific potential as embryonic stem cells. Their application is \nlimited. Their reach is finite. And we do have a better option. \nAllowing federally funded research on embryos that would otherwise be \ndestroyed would provide a much-needed expansion. Everything from \neradicating, in our past, polio to mapping the human genome, our Nation \nhas been a leader and an innovator in science and medicine. So let's \nnot fall behind now. Just as we are challenged with so many of these \ndiseases, we need to do more.\n  Of the original 78 stem cell lines the administration permitted \nscientists to work on, only 21 are available today. Lab scientists must \nturn to private investors and already struggling State governments to \ncarry on this critical research. So researchers in my State, in the \nState of Washington, say that Federal funding would increase research \nopportunities and allow scientists to use that money much more \neffectively.\n  In March of 2006, the University of Washington announced that because \nof Federal funding restrictions, it would seek to establish a stem cell \ninstitute with private money and, instead, looks to raise $100 million \nin private funds to help it move forward. The University of Washington \nplans to reflect the intense competition it faces from other \nuniversities around the country that are boosting their research into \nstem cells which have permitted them to treat a variety of diseases. So \nthe competition will continue. But we could be working together in a \nmuch more collaborative fashion, in a way that would help us extend the \nscope of that research.\n  It is very important because so many of those involved in this \nparticular area believe passionately we need this new area of \nexpansion. One of those individuals, Dr. Storb of the Fred Hutchinson \nCancer Research Center in Seattle, recently said this:\n\n       We have exhausted research on adult stem cells. They do not \n     do the trick. We have worked with them for 30 years now and \n     know that they do not make all of the tissues in the body.\n\n  He further went on to say:\n\n       If the public wants cell-based therapies, then we must \n     conduct that kind of stem cell research. We may learn more \n     from embryonic cells how to program adult cells, but we have \n     to work with embryonic cells to do just that.\n\n  So this Congress, I believe, must not stand in the way of science. We \nhave three bills we will vote on tomorrow, but only H.R. 810 actually \nclears the way for critical research that could lead to cures for so \nmany debilitating diseases.\n  There is no viable alternative to improving the research and serious \ninvestments that I believe H.R. 810 will provide. When we are talking \nto Americans who suffer from diseases such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, \nand others, I think it is important, as my colleague from Illinois \nstated, that we must keep in mind the stories of individuals.\n  Mr. President, one such individual is a 4-year-old who died of brain \ncancer. Her mother wrote to us saying how important this bill was in \nholding opportunities for other people in other families who suffer \nfrom brain cancer. To me, it is so important that we pass this \nlegislation and help those individuals and families who are suffering \nby giving them hope for promising research that we know science can \nprovide.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, today, as everybody is doing, I want to \ndiscuss the three stem-cell-research-related bills before the Senate. I \nhave been in the Senate for 26 years now. Every day, we make decisions \nthat impact Americans. It becomes difficult,\n\n[[Page S7611]]\n\nhowever, when we debate bills that involve the lives of women and \nfamilies, especially those who are sick and dying. We must be cognizant \nof their plights, but we cannot forget about those who don't have a \nvoice.\n  Tomorrow, I will vote in favor of those who are not yet brought into \nthis world. I will vote for those who don't have a chance to speak \nagainst legislation that doesn't give them a chance at life.\n  First, I intend to support S. 3504, the ban on fetus farming. This \nbill states that a person cannot solicit or knowingly acquire, receive, \nor accept a donation of fetal tissue or an embryo if the pregnancy was \ninitiated to provide such material. This bill will reduce the \nlikelihood that women will be used solely for their production of \nembryos. We have to draw the line, and we have to prevent the \ncorruption that could occur.\n  Second, I intend to support a bill numbered S. 2754, which directs \nthe National Institutes of Health to fund alternative techniques for \nstem cell research. It will allow researchers to use different \ntechniques to derive pluripotent stem cells without destroying human \nlife. This research could be done under current law, but a vote in \nsupport of this bill will send a signal to the NIH that we want to see \neven more of this research.\n  Finally, I will oppose H.R. 810 because it would expand Federal \nfunding for embryonic stem cell research.\n  Some of my colleagues will characterize the bill, H.R. 810, as a \nlifesaving opportunity for many people with diseases. The focus will be \non promises, hopes, and dreams. This focus disregards that this bill \nwill allow researchers to use and abuse embryos. And there are enormous \nmoral and ethical consequences associated with that research.\n  You cannot mess with the facts. An embryo is life. No Senator can \ndisagree with that assertion. Once you realize that fact--that an \nembryo is life--you have to realize that this bill takes life and plays \nwith it.\n  In addition, this bill doesn't prohibit cloning. In fact, it will \nmake cloning even more attractive. Why would we want to go down this \nroad of unethical research when we have a method that already works?\n  We all know that adult stem cell research has proven effective. We \nare investing the taxpayers' money in research that benefits the \nAmerican people. We in Congress have to realize that there is a \ndifference between hope and hype. I, for one, will not be misled.\n  Adult stem cells have already proven effective for over 72 \ntreatments. I will not list them all, but some of them relate to adult \nstem cells being used to treat brain tumors, multiple sclerosis, \narthritis, and Parkinson's disease. Peripheral blood stem cells have \ntreated testicular cancer, lymphoma, and breast cancer. Cord blood stem \ncells have treated leukemia. Olfactory stem cells from the nose can \ndevelop into heart cells, liver cells, kidney cells, muscle cells, \nbrain cells, and nerve cells. Bone marrow stem cells and stem cells \nfrom fat have the ability to differentiate and form other body tissues.\n\n  I wish I could list the advances with embryonic stem cell research, \nbut I cannot; there are none. There are no treatments for human \npatients. So there is no evidence on which to argue that this research \nshould be expanded with public resources.\n  I have a story about a person that I have known for 44 years, David \nFoege. I have known him since he was a page at the Iowa State \nLegislature back in 1962. He is originally from Waverly, IA, so even \nthough he lives in Florida, I still consider him a constituent. There \nis evidence, then, through Dave Foege that we should continue \nsupporting adult stem cell research.\n  Just 2 weeks ago, I had an opportunity to meet with David, who is now \n61 years old and living in Florida. This is the story he told to me. \nDavid was given a life sentence because of heart failure. Three years \nago, David was told that he had little chance of surviving. His heart \nwas losing all function and there was little that doctors could do. \nDavid then turned to stem cell therapy. He found doctors in Bangkok \nthat would harvest his own stem cells and then inject them back into \nhis own heart. His own stem cells--his adult stem cells, not embryonic \nstem cells--cured him. His heart function has improved by 70 percent. \nDavid is alive and well, playing golf, and currently taking a cruise in \nBelize. Without adult stem cell therapy, David would not be here.\n  Embryonic stem cell research, on the contrary, has not yielded this \nkind of success that we have from adult stem cells. It makes sense to \ndirect public resources to what works. Prioritizing resources: It makes \nsense for public resources to help those with heart disease, the No. 1 \nkiller in the United States. It makes sense to encourage research that \nwill work for those with Parkinson's, diabetes, cancer, and autoimmune \ndiseases. Why would we want to desert patients in the United States by \nspending dollars on research that has not been proven?\n  I will oppose H.R. 810 not only because of the ethical consequences \nbut because it doesn't prioritize our use of fiscal resources.\n  Let's be clear. There is no current policy in place that bans \nembryonic stem cell research. Everybody knows that we are doing some \nthrough the Federal Government because, being perfectly legal in the \nUnited States, President Bush, in 2001, allowed taxpayer dollars to be \nused for that research. This debate in the Senate today and tomorrow is \nnot whether we want to ban or allow research, it is whether we want to \nspend our dollars on embryo creation and destruction.\n  Today, the Congress appropriates nearly $30 billion for medical \nresearch through the National Institutes of Health. Every year, \nhundreds of advocates come to my office to say that $30 billion is not \nenough. They say these funds are important to continue research and \ntrials that are already started. So what would happen to those \narguments if there was a higher priority placed through passage of H.R. \n810? Will we have to double the budget again for NIH like we did \nbetween 1998 and 2003? I don't think that is possible given that was \nalready done starting in the year 1998. So it makes me wonder whether \nwe are prioritizing the use of Federal research dollars through the \nNational Institutes of Health the way we should.\n  We don't have an infinite amount of Federal funding. We cannot \npretend there is enough money to go around. We do have to prioritize. \nSo I urge my colleagues to realize that Congress can only disburse so \nmany funds. We can only fix so many problems. Therefore, we need to \nthink rationally. We need to make tough choices. One of those tough \nchoices might be to pursue what is proven to work, which is greater use \nof adult stem cells. The right choice, then, is to invest in what \nworks. Let's keep the ball rolling with research that has been proven.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have 5 \nminutes to talk as in morning business regarding the resolution that \nwill be on the Senate floor later tonight or tomorrow regarding \ncondemning Hezbollah.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered. The Senator from Texas is recognized for 5 minutes.\n  (The remarks of Mrs. Hutchison are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I rise today in support of legislation \nto expand the Federal investment in adult and umbilical cord blood stem \ncell research, as well as scientific ways to create embryonic stem cell \nlines without destroying human embryos.\n  It is important to point out that there are two very important \ncategories of stem cells. I know that my colleagues are going to have a \nlittle difficulty with this because I have had difficulty with this. \nThis is medical terminology.\n  The first, embryonic stem cells, as their name suggests, are derived \nfrom human embryos developed from eggs that have been fertilized in an \nin vitro fertilization clinic. Removing stem cells from these embryos \ndestroys their potential life, making their use very controversial and \nsomething I cannot morally support.\n  On the other hand, adult stem cells are undifferentiated cells found \namong\n\n[[Page S7612]]\n\ndifferentiated cells in tissues or organs. Adult stem cells can renew \nthemselves and will eventually differentiate into a special cell. \nHowever, before this occurs, the undifferentiated stem cells can be \ngathered by scientists without any harm to the individual.\n  Also included in this ethical category of stem cells are those from \numbilical cord blood derived from the placenta of a newborn baby. With \nthe birth of my seventh grandchild last summer, I learned a great deal \nabout the benefits of preserving cord blood stem cells. Once considered \nmedical waste and discarded after birth, science has determined that \ncord blood has the potential to save thousands of lives.\n  And that is exactly why I came to the floor today, to explain these \ndifferences and to highlight the unmatched value of adult and cord \nblood stem cells.\n  By the way, when I found out about the umbilical cord blood coming \nfrom the placenta, we are now freezing that umbilical cord, and each \nyear we will pay some money to maintain it. But that umbilical cord can \nbe used to help my seventh grandchild or, for that matter, the whole \nfamily. It is something more people should find out about.\n  I am concerned that the vast majority of Americans are unaware that \nsome of the most promising advances in medical research and treatment \ntoday are not attributed to embryonic stem cells; rather, they are the \nresult of noncontroversial, nonlife-ending use of adult and umbilical \nblood cord cells.\n  Unfortunately, many of the individuals who support embryonic stem \ncell research have been kept in the dark about the advances of \numbilical and adult stem cell treatments and have been oversold on \nembryonic stem cell research, which is still in its infancy.\n  While embryonic cells have never been successfully used to treat even \none disease--not used to treat one disease to date--adult stem cells \nhave been used to treat 72 diseases, such as breast cancer, multiple \nsclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, sickle cell anemia, spinal cord \ninjuries, and many others. I have read reports that adult stem cells \nfrom a young girl's own fat cells were used to repair or regenerate a \n19-square-inch section of her skull. I have also learned of a \nParkinson's patient who has been without the vast majority of the \ndisease's symptoms for 6 years after being treated with his own adult \nstem cells.\n  Even more encouraging, the potential use of adult and umbilical cord \ntherapies continues to expand. In fact, there is a real possibility \nthat these types of stem cells will be able to yield the same results \nas embryonic, or what they call pluripotent stem cells, without the \nneed to destroy human life.\n  The American Journal of Pathology recently reported that a group of \nscientists have isolated a novel population of multipotent adult stem \ncells from human hair follicles--think of that, human hair follicles--\nwhich, like embryonic stem cells, express neural crest and neuron stem \ncell markers, as well as the embryonic stem cell transcription factors.\n  In other words, what we are saying is that they produce the same \nthing we would get if we were using the embryos that so many are \nanxious to use.\n  I was introduced to the promise of adult and umbilical stem cell \nresearch by experts at the National Center of Regenerative Medicine in \nmy hometown of Cleveland, OH. The individual institutions involved in \nthis partnership--Case Western Reserve University, University Hospital, \nand the Cleveland Clinic--each bring an expertise to the center that is \nleading the Nation in the use of nonembryonic stem cells to regenerate \nnew tissue and diseased organs rather than using drugs or devices to \nimprove the function of the organ.\n  The National Center for Regenerative Medicine team has told me that \nthey are interested in the rapid translation of adult and umbilical \ncord stem cell technology into patients that is not possible today with \nembryonic stem cells.\n  Since 1976, investigators at the center have studied nonembryonic \nstem cells and performed their first stem cell transplant as early as \n1980. That is back in 1980. Investigators at the center are now able to \ncure leukemias and lymphomas with nonembryonic stem cell \ntransplantation, as well as to fix unstable bone fractures and treat \ngenetic disorders.\n\n  In the next several years, investigators at the center believe they \nwill be able to address cancer, bone, heart, and neurological disorders \nwith nonembryonic stem cell treatments. They are hopeful that the new \nadvances will lead to treatment of degenerative arthritis, will \ndecrease the severity of graft versus host disease after stem cell \ntransplantation, and allow physicians to use a patient's own stem cells \nto repair heart damage following congestive heart failure, as well as \nuse their own neural stem cells to improve function after spinal cord \ndamage. All of the things that folks are talking about because we have \nto have these embryonic stem cells because this is what we have to do--\nwe are already on our way. We are making progress with adult and with \numbilical cord stem cells.\n  The center has 10 ongoing or planned clinical trials to further \nexplore the use of stem cell therapies to reduce the risks of \nchemotherapy, treat certain heart conditions, and improve umbilical \nstem cell treatment for leukemia. I recently had the privilege to \npersonally hear two young Ohioans discuss the successful adult stem \ncell treatment received at the center for an aggressive form of \nleukemia and a severely broken bone that would not heal with \ntraditional treatment.\n  I will never forget this young woman who was there. It was a meeting \nat the regenerative center. She talked about the fact that she was in \nthis terrible motorcycle accident. She was a mountain climber, she was \na skier, she was a runner. She was told by all of her doctors that she \nwouldn't be able to run again, that she would have to hobble around. \nShe went to the Cleveland Clinic, to the regenerative center, and as a \nresult of using her stem cells, they were able to repair the problem \nthat she had in her leg.\n  Today she is running. I am getting goosebumps right now. I will never \nforget it. She started to cry. She hugged her doctor. We all started to \ncry. It was a miraculous thing using adult stem cells.\n  As a result, I support the legislation introduced by my colleagues \nfrom Pennsylvania, the Alternative Pluripotent Stem Cell Therapies \nEnhancement Act. The bill would require the Secretary of Health and \nHuman Services to develop techniques for the isolation, derivation, \nprotection or testing of stem cells not derived from a human embryo.\n  The bill would also require the Secretary to prioritize stem cell \nresearch that will reap near-term clinical benefits. It is my hope that \nthis type of progress will help eliminate the controversy surrounding \nembryonic stem cell research without any compromise of scientific \nadvancement.\n  I have the greatest sympathy for patients and their families who \ncontinue to struggle with a wide range of painful, life-ending \ndiseases. Further, I understand what it is like to watch a loved one \nsuffer and the tragedy of losing a member of your family, even a young \nchild, to a life-ending disease. I personally lost my father to \ndiabetes and my nephew C.T. to bone cancer. I have been a witness to \nthe devastating effects of Alzheimer's, arthritis, and many other \ndiseases.\n  One can hardly take issue with these individual efforts to seek out a \npotential cure, but too often, I fear, proponents of embryonic stem \ncell research provide patients with false promises from unproven, \nunexplored embryonic stem cells, while ignoring the real substantial \nprogress that has been made with adult and blood cord treatments.\n  I am gravely concerned about the possible implication of spending \ntaxpayers' dollars on an issue such as embryonic stem cell research \nthat divides Americans on moral and ethical grounds, and I believe it \nis my moral responsibility to direct the Federal Government's dollars \ntoward the areas of research that have the greatest near-term potential \nto help the largest number of Americans.\n  Since I have been a Member of the Senate, we have doubled the funding \nfor the National Institutes of Health, NIH, and greatly increased the \namount of medical research the Federal Government is able to fund, \nincluding increasing the amount of money available for research on all \nstem cells from $226 million in 1999 to $568 million this year.\n\n[[Page S7613]]\n\n  However, as you know, Mr. President, in recent years with the cost of \nthe war, the need to protect our homeland, and natural disasters such \nas Katrina, the amount the Federal budget has available for these \npriorities is getting smaller and smaller. We are seeing that now with \nthe appropriations bills in the Senate.\n  I meet with groups all the time, and they ask me for increases in \nfunding for research for diseases that personally impact on their \nfamilies. I am sure they visit your office, Mr. President, every couple \nof weeks: We want more money for NIH to take care of this, to take care \nof that. Just within my own family, I met recently with my former \nbrother-in-law in support of childhood cancer, and through my son I \nhave heard a very emotional presentation by a group of my constituents \non behalf of juvenile diabetes research. Again, if everyone in the \nSenate had been at that meeting, I think they would have said: Look, we \nhave to do more, spend more money on juvenile diabetes.\n  There is a tremendous need to pursue treatments for these and many \nother diseases, but we face a reality of limited funding. That is the \nreal world.\n  We have to be smart about spending our money, and in the current \nbudget environment, I have concerns that increasing funding for \nresearch on embryonic stem cell will take away opportunities for \nresearch in areas such as adult and umbilical cord blood research, or \neven research for treatment of specific diseases such as cancer, \njuvenile diabetes, and others that have proven their usefulness.\n  Consequently, and in light of all the advances and results science \nhas provided with adult and umbilical blood cord stem cells, I urge my \ncolleagues to continue to direct Federal funding toward the \nnoncontroversial areas of adult and umbilical cord blood stem cell \nresearch. I urge my colleagues to do that.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, as we are waiting for my colleagues to \ncome to the floor, I want to address some issues that have been brought \nforward and talked about previously.\n  Mr. President, I see my colleague from Iowa, and I am prepared to \nanswer--he had raised a question about whether we had 72 different \nareas of treatment for adult stem cells, and so I wanted to respond.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Unfortunately, the majority's time has \nexpired.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I see the distinguished Senator from \nWashington is here to make her statement on this bill, and I would \nyield the floor to Senator Murray for her comments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington is recognized.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I thank my colleague for yielding me time \ntonight on this important legislation. I rise tonight to express my \nsupport for expanding stem cell research. This innovative research \noffers us a chance to save lives.\n  Families across this country are holding out hope that we will \nfinally allow science to move forward and deliver on the promise of \nstem cell research. That is exactly what we should be doing. But, \nunfortunately, today the hands of American scientists are tied by \npolitical restrictions. I believe we can expand stem cell research \nwhile still maintaining strict ethical safeguards. That is why I will \nbe supporting H.R. 810.\n  Back in 2001, President Bush imposed restrictions on promising stem \ncell research. Since that time, we have learned that there aren't as \nmany useful stem cell lines as the President suggested. The Bush \nadministration promised us that 60 lines would be available for \nresearch. To date, only 15 are available, and it appears that all of \nthose lines have contamination problems. The President's restrictions \nhave held back American science and stalled promising research. It is \ntime to correct that mistake and allow our country to make progress.\n  Stem cell research is about improving medicine, and it is about \nsaving lives. For patients with Parkinson's or Alzheimer's, diabetes or \nmultiple sclerosis, stem cell research holds promising potential to \nprovide the tools to understand, treat, and someday cure these \ndevastating diseases.\n  I understand the challenges and frustrations these diseases cause. \nWhen I was just 15 years old, my dad was diagnosed with multiple \nsclerosis. In a few short years, his illness became very bad, so bad \nthat he couldn't work anymore, and for most of my life my dad was in a \nwheelchair. His illness had a profound impact on my entire family. My \nmom, who stayed home to raise seven kids, had to work to care for him \nand had to get a job so she could support our family. She got that job, \nbut it was never enough to support seven kids and a husband who was in \na wheelchair and with growing medical bills.\n  I can only imagine how different our lives would have been had there \nbeen a cure for M.S. Back then, we didn't have the tools to find a \ncure, but today we do, and these tools unfortunately are being blocked \nby an ideological policy that puts politics over science. I think we \ncan do better than that.\n  My dad's challenges are similar to the struggles millions of \nAmericans and their families face every day. They deserve a chance, and \nthey deserve hope. That is why we can't let the current restrictions \nstand.\n  A short time ago, I received a letter from a constituent of mine who \nlives in Mercer Island, and he wrote:\n\n       My 17-year-old son was recently involved in an automobile \n     accident and is now paralyzed from the upper chest down. Stem \n     cell research looks to be our brightest hope by far. Please \n     help give him the chance to ride a bike, go for a hike, and \n     run with his friends again. Please, support stem cell \n     research.\n\n  As that father points out, this is about people. It is about keeping \nour country on the cutting edge of science and research, and I am proud \nto represent a State that has a strong reputation for scientific \nresearch. But for our country to remain a leader in this promising \nfield, our scientists and our researchers need the support of our \nGovernment. America should never take a back seat to other countries in \nthe search for promising new cures.\n  Unfortunately, the President's current stem cell research policy is \ntying the hands of our scientists by limiting the number of lines \neligible for Federal funding. We can do better than that.\n  In fact, the majority of this Congress has been trying to correct the \nPresident's mistake for over a year now. H.R. 810 passed the House of \nRepresentatives 13 months ago. Since that date, my colleagues and I \nhave been fighting to bring this issue of stem cell research to the \nSenate floor. We wrote letters, we pleaded on the floor, and we asked \nRepublican leaders numerous times for even a few hours to debate and \npass this bipartisan bill. Our efforts to promote research and offer \nhope had been denied at every turn. But now, finally, our day has come, \nand after more than a year of obstruction, we finally have a chance to \noffer hope to millions of patients and their families. On a bipartisan \nbasis, I believe this bill will pass.\n  But, of course, we know that is not the whole story. Shortly after we \ngot word that this bill would finally come to the floor, I was dismayed \nto see headlines announcing that Karl Rove, President Bush's chief \npolitical officer and adviser, guaranteed a veto of this important \nbill. In nearly 6 years in office, President Bush has never once vetoed \na bill. It is pretty amazing to me that he would choose this bill--this \nbill which offers basic hope and opportunity to so many Americans--for \nhis first veto. I believe the President is wrong on this issue, and I \nthink threatening a veto is wrong.\n\n  I am here this evening to pledge my support for this bill and to call \non my colleagues to support it. But next, I call on them to ask the \nPresident in no uncertain terms to stand with us in support of open \nopportunity, stand with us in support of medical research, stand with \nus and, more importantly, with millions of Americans who are waiting on \na cure, in support of stem cell research.\n  For far too long, this administration's ideology has trumped \nresearch. Politics has been more important than science. With this \nbill, President Bush has a chance to change course and put people ahead \nof personal political ideology. I urge him to do the right thing.\n  For our patients, for their families, and for the future of our \nNation's research leadership, it is time for the Senate to pass H.R. \n810, and it is time for the President to sign it. Let's take the \nhandcuffs off of our scientists and\n\n[[Page S7614]]\n\nlet them find the cures that will save lives.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Washington for \nher very eloquent statement, and I thank all of the Senators who have \ncome over here today to speak on this important issue.\n  We have about 20 minutes left in this half hour. I don't have any \nother Senators right now, but if there are other Senators on our side \nwho wish to take a few minutes to speak on this bill, I would be glad \nto yield to them.\n  However, I would like to take this time to sum up, if I can, what we \nhave heard today. We have come to the end of our first day of debate on \nstem cell research, and I think it has been a very enlightening debate \nand a very good exposition of the different sides of this issue. I hope \nthe American people who have tuned in to watch this have learned a \ngreat deal about why we need to pass H.R. 810, the Stem Cell Research \nEnhancement Act. As we know, that bill passed the House by a bipartisan \nmajority over a year ago, and I think it has a strong bipartisan \nmajority here in the Senate. Certainly the bill itself is sponsored \nbipartisanly. If we can pass it tomorrow--and I am confident we can and \nwe will--H.R. 810 can go straight to the President's desk.\n  I would like to reiterate a few things we have heard today.\n  First, H.R. 810 has enormous popular support. I have here a letter \nthat was just transmitted to me, and it is a list of different advocacy \ngroups, health organizations, research universities, scientific \nsocieties, religious groups, and other interested institutions and \nassociations representing millions of patients, scientists, health care \nproviders, and advocates, writing in strong support for H.R. 810. They \npoint out in this letter that this is the bill which holds promise for \nexpanding medical breakthroughs. The other two bills, the Alternative \nPluripotent Stem Cell Therapies Enhancement Act, S. 2754, and the Fetus \nFarming Prohibition Act, S. 3504, are not substitutes for a ``yes'' \nvote on H.R. 810.\n  This letter is signed by 590 advocacy groups. I have been on this \nSenate floor now 21 years. We all get letters and things that come in \nexpressing support, but I daresay I have never seen anything as \noverwhelming as this: 590 different groups. Earlier this year, I \nsubmitted a list of 205 different groups.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at the conclusion of my \ncomments on this portion, this list of 590 groups be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  Again, those are advocacy groups and scientific associations--590.\n  How about the American people? Three out of four Americans agree: \nsupport stem cell research. The question asked in a national poll: Do \nyou support embryonic stem cell research? Seventy-two percent of \nAmericans said yes. Seventy-two percent. That is pretty overwhelming.\n  I heard the distinguished Senator from Ohio here just a few moments \nago say that one of the reasons he was opposed to the bill was because \nwe wanted to do things that would not divide Americans. He thought this \nwould divide Americans. Divide Americans? Seventy-two percent are in \nfavor of it. Over 590 different advocacy groups expressing support, and \n205 other disease-related groups all in support. This doesn't divide \nAmerica at all. Of course, there is always going to be somebody opposed \nto something around here. But I haven't seen anything that received \nthis much overwhelming support in a long time. As a matter of fact, \npassing embryonic stem cell research, H.R. 810, will pull Americans \ntogether in the fight against disease. And it is bipartisan. As I said, \nthe bill passed the House bipartisanly. The sponsors of the bill itself \nwere three Republicans and three Democrats.\n  It was stated earlier today a couple of times about a letter that \nformer First Lady Nancy Reagan had written. I thought I would have it \nblown up and put on a chart for people around the country to take a \nlook at, just to show you how this has nothing to do with partisanship. \nIt shows it is from the office of Nancy Reagan dated May 1, 2006, a \nletter to Orrin Hatch, Senator Orrin Hatch of Utah, who was one of the \ncosponsors of this bill. It says:\n\n       Dear Orrin:\n       Thank you for your continued commitment to helping the \n     millions of Americans who suffer from devastating and \n     disabling diseases. Your support has given so much hope to so \n     many.\n       It has been nearly a year since the United States House of \n     Representatives first approved the stem cell legislation that \n     would open the research so we could fully unleash its \n     promise. For those who are waiting every day for scientific \n     progress to help their loved ones, the wait for U.S. Senate \n     action has been very difficult and hard to comprehend.\n       I understand that the U.S. Senate is now considering voting \n     on H.R. 810, the Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act, sometime \n     this month. Orrin, I know I can count on friends like you to \n     help make sure this happens. There is just no more time to \n     wait.\n       Sincerely, Nancy.\n  When you have seen a loved one suffer from Alzheimer's--I am sure as \nMrs. Reagan watched the former President suffer from Alzheimer's--it \nmotivates you to say: Whatever we can do to advance the research, to \nhopefully get a cure someday, that is what we should do.\n  For those of us who have friends who have Parkinson's disease, those \nof us who have seen friends and loved ones die of Lou Gehrig's disease, \nfor those of us who have members of our family or close friends who \nhave had spinal cord injuries, this motivates us to do everything \nhumanly possible to expand this field of research.\n  My friend Christopher Reeve said, one time when we had watched a film \nof a rat, a white mouse or white rat, that had its spinal cord damaged \nso it couldn't walk and then it received embryonic stem cells and then \nit walked again, Christopher Reeve, former Superman said, ``Oh, to be a \nrat.''\n  It holds so much promise, embryonic stem cell research, to ease the \nsuffering and the pain of so many people.\n  I hear today talk about we have to do adult stem cells; maybe there \nis not enough money.\n  Again, I refer to my friend from Ohio, who was here earlier who said \nfunding for medical research is probably going down because of the war \nand because of Katrina and because of homeland security.\n  I said: Wait a minute, earlier this year this Senate voted 73 to 27, \nto put $7 billion back in the budget so we wouldn't cut medical \nresearch--73 votes in the Senate. I don't know, 73 votes is pretty \noverwhelming. It was $7 billion we were supposed to put back in to help \nmedical research. I don't know to what the Senator was referring.\n  I have heard talk today about adult stem cells and all these other \nthings and how we had adult stem cells do this and adult stem cells do \nthat. Why haven't embryonic stem cells led to treatment as much as \nadult stem cells have? Scientists have been doing research on adult \nstem cells for over 30 years, and we still, after 30 years, have not \nextracted one stem cell line from adult cells--not one.\n  Now embryonic stem cells were only derived in 1998, 8 years ago, and \nthey have only been getting Federal funding in a limited manner since \n2002, under the guidelines the President set down in 2001, which \nlimited the number of stem cell lines to then 78, which we found out \nlater was only 21 stem cell lines.\n  Again, there are no arbitrary restrictions on research on adult stem \ncells. Scientists and private companies don't have to be skittish about \ndoing the research. They don't have to worry that all of a sudden the \nFederal Government is going to ban it or limit it, so they can plan \nahead and do long-term research.\n  Let's compare that situation with human embryonic stem cells. As I \nsaid, we didn't derive them until 1998 and the first Federal grant \nwasn't awarded until 2002. Even now, only a tiny fraction of the total \nFederal budget for human stem cell research is used for human embryonic \nstem cells. The vast majority still goes for adult stem cells.\n  Here it is. I pointed this out earlier today. Human embryonic stem \ncells in fiscal 2006 from NIH, $38.3 million. Adult stem cells, $200 \nmillion. Again, only a tiny fraction going for human embryonic stem \ncells. Five times as much is going for adult stem cell research. So it \nis no wonder, after 30 years and all this research and all this money, \nthat more diseases are being treated today with adult stem cells.\n  Scientists have only been studying embryonic stem cells for 5 years, \nwith\n\n[[Page S7615]]\n\none arm tied behind their back. That one arm being tied their back by \nthe President's proclamation of August 9, 2001, that only stem cell \nlines derived before 9 p.m. that evening could receive Federal funding. \nAnything derived after 9 p.m. could not receive Federal funding.\n  I have wondered ever since, why was it morally acceptable to use stem \ncell lines derived prior to 9 p.m. on August 9 of 2001 but morally \nunacceptable for funding of stem cell lines derived after 9 p.m. Can \nsomeone please tell me the ethics of that. Can someone please tell me \nwhy 9 p.m. on August 9 of 2001 is some kind of a moral dividing line? \nIt is totally arbitrary. The President could have said stem cell lines \nderived at 10 p.m. or he could have said stem cell lines derived before \nChristmas of this year. It is the same thing. No one has taken this \nfloor to define why August 9, at 9 p.m, is some kind of a moral \ndividing line.\n  The fact is, it doesn't really matter what I think about the \npotential of embryonic stem cell research. It doesn't matter a heck of \na lot what other Senators may think about the potential of embryonic \nstem cell research. What matters is what does the great body of \nscientists think about the potential.\n  The overwhelming majority of reputable biomedical scientists also \nbelieves we should pursue embryonic stem cell research; not to the \nexclusion of others but that we should pursue it.\n  I have a letter from Dr. J. Michael Bishop who won the Nobel Prize in \nmedicine in 1989. Here is what he says:\n\n       The vast majority of the biomedical community believes that \n     human embryonic stem cells are likely to be the source of key \n     discoveries relating to many debilitating diseases. In fact, \n     some of the strongest advocates for human embryonic stem cell \n     research are those scientists that have devoted their careers \n     to the study of adult stem cells.\n\n  I have a letter from Dr. Alfred G. Gilman, who won the Nobel Prize in \nmedicine in 1994.\n\n       It has become obvious, however, that the number of stem \n     cell lines actually available under current policy is too \n     small and is controlled by a limited monopoly, which has made \n     it significantly more difficult and expensive for research to \n     be conducted. These limits have hindered the important search \n     for new understanding and treatment of devastating diseases.\n\n  I have a letter from the Director of the NIH, Dr. Elias Zerhouni.\n\n       Embryonic stem cell research holds great promise for \n     treating, curing, and improving our understanding of disease.\n\n  The breakthroughs are coming. But they take time. They take a lot of \nscientists researching. This is not something you can put two people \non. They need a lot of different lines. Embryonic stem cell research \nshould be ongoing at universities all across America, at our great \nresearch institutions, and it ought to be done under the guidance and \ndirection and ethical guidelines of NIH and the ethical guidelines that \nwe have in this bill.\n  The clampdown on embryonic stem cell research before it even has a \nchance to start shows a total lack of understanding about how science \nworks, how research works. I have often said that basic research is \nsimilar to having 10 doors and they are closed. There is a high \nprobability that behind one of the doors is the answer to your \nquestion. If you open one door, you know what the odds are of finding \nthe right answer. If you open two doors, the odds are a little bit \nbetter. If you open five doors, the odds are 50-50.\n  That is what basic research is about. It has been said here a lot of \nthe earlier research on fetal tissue came to nothing. A lot of basic \nresearch comes to nothing--in terms of an actual application. But \nalmost all basic research adds to our body of knowledge. Maybe, from \none of those basic research grants that was put on the shelf, some \nother scientist coming along later on might pick something from that, \nput two or three together and find something.\n  I am reminded of John Embers, a scientist--I believe he was at \nHarvard. I will check my facts on that, but I believe he was a doctor \nat Harvard many years ago. I am talking about a long time ago. I am \ntalking about in the 1940s. He had done some interesting research, \nbasic research on kidney cells of monkeys because they had unique \nproperties. It was a funny research. It was on certain Rhesus monkeys \nand the oddity of certain kidney cells.\n  Dr. John Enders didn't get anything for it. He did the research, put \nit on the shelf, and nothing ever came of it, until a few years later \nanother scientist, examining in another area, remembered Dr. Enders' \nwork, went back and got it, coupled it with his, and came up with \nsomething called the Salk polio vaccine. It wasn't until over 25 years \nlater that Dr. John Enders finally received the Nobel Prize for his \nresearch.\n  But I suppose someone 5 years after Dr. Enders had done his research \nwould have said: Why did we spend money on that foolish kind of \nresearch? It didn't lead to anything. It kept some scientists employed, \nbut it didn't lead to anything. But Dr. Salk came along, coupled that \nresearch with what he was doing and came up with the Salk polio \nvaccine.\n  That is a true story.\n  Again, we have to understand a lot of this is basic research. A lot \nof it will lead to nothing. But as more and more scientists get \ninvolved in examining embryonic stem cells and how they grow, how they \nmultiply, how they differentiate, how they become nerve tissue, how \nthey become brain tissue, how they become skin tissue, how they become \nblood tissues--as they begin to investigate that, I am sure there will \nbe a lot of blind alleys. But I submit that everything that is done \nbuilds the body of scientific evidence that we need, the science that \nwill eventually lead to a cure of a disease. That is the promise of \nembryonic stem cell research. To stop it now or to limit it doesn't \nmake sense.\n  People talk about the ethics and morality. I have heard talk about we \nhave to protect innocent life. This is an embryo; an embryo with 100 \ncells, 200 cells. You can take whatever view you want of that embryo. \nThe point is that the bill we are talking about does not destroy one \nembryo. It only says that we can get funding for the research on those. \nThese are embryos that are going to be discarded anyway, in in vitro \nfertilization clinics. They are being discarded every day.\n  Why don't people come out and say: Stop in vitro fertilization. Make \nit a crime. You don't hear anybody saying that because 50,000 babies \nwere born last year to people who wanted to have a baby and couldn't \nhave one and used in vitro fertilization. Once they have their \nchildren, they call up the in vitro clinic and say: I don't want the \nremaining embryos, just discard them. I ask you, what is the moral \nthing to do, just discard them or, with the written consent of the \ndonors, use those embryonic stem cells to save lives and ease suffering \nand cure disease? That, to me, is the moral and the ethical choice.\n  I see my time is up and I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 14, 2006.\n       Dear Senator: We, the undersigned patient advocacy groups, \n     health organizations, research universities, scientific \n     societies, religious groups and other interested institutions \n     and associations, representing millions of patients, \n     scientists, health care providers and advocates, write you \n     with our strong and unified support for H.R. 810, the Stem \n     Cell Research Enhancement Act. We urge your vote in favor of \n     H.R. 810 when the Senate considers the measure next week.\n       Of the bills being considered simultaneously, only H.R. 810 \n     will move stem cell research forward in our country. This is \n     the bill which holds promise for expanding medical \n     breakthroughs. The other two bills--the Alternative \n     Pluripotent Stem Cell Therapies Enhancement Act (S. 2754) and \n     the Fetus Farming Prohibition Act (S. 3504)--are NOT \n     substitutes for a YES vote on H.R. 810.\n       H.R. 810 is the pro-patient and pro-research bill. A vote \n     in support of H.R. 810 will be considered a vote in support \n     of more than 100 million patients in the U.S. and substantial \n     progress for research.

The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about stem cell \nresearch. This is a very delicate and very tough issue and these are \ndifficult decisions that we will all have to make this week.\n  Some scientists believe that advancement in research requires the \ncreation and development of new embryonic stem cell lines. The truth of \nthe matter is that there are very promising alternatives to embryonic \nstem cell research, such as stem cells from adult tissue like bone \nmarrow and umbilical cord blood. These cells have repeatedly \ndemonstrated the capability of turning into most tissue types providing \nthe basis for advanced research to find cures for many diseases, \nincluding leukemia, Parkinson's disease, juvenile diabetes, sickle cell \nanemia, heart disease and spinal cord injuries. To date, we have seen \npromising results coming from the research that has been conducted on \nthese types of cells. Doctors have successfully treated 69 diseases and \ninjuries using adult stem cells such as Lupus, arthritis, liver damage, \nbrain tumors and various forms of cancer. It is vital that we continue \nto conduct important medical research and continue producing these \ntypes of results providing hope for patients and their families.\n  I am very thankful for the accomplishments that have been made in \nmodern medicine, those of which many of us have already enjoyed or \nperhaps will in the future.\n  However, I see the life changing results that have come from adult \nstem cell research, and can't help but compare these to the lack of \nresults we have seen from embryonic stem cell research which has not \nprovided the concrete benefits to patients that we have seen otherwise. \nWe should not discount the possibilities surrounding the discoveries \nthat lie ahead within medical research, but, since we have seen results \nfrom alternative types of stem cell research, not involving embryonic \nstem cells, should we spend federal money on researching something that \nhas yielded few positive results?\n  I have seen positive results from the research we have done in the \narea of adult stem cell research. In fact, an overwhelming proportion \nof privately funded research is going towards adult stem cell research.\n  This is a strong indication of what researchers think regarding the \ndirection of future stem cell research. Adult stem cells and other \nsimilar alternatives have helped thousands of patients throughout the \nworld, while the results of embryonic stem cell research have not \nhelped any one patient yet.\n  I have seen the proven results and lives that have benefited from the \nresearch done on adult stem cells. It has been proven that the results \nof this research have created procedures that have assisted in saving \nlives, and curing illnesses. Advancements are constantly being made in \nscience, medical research, and technology and so this issue is \nconstantly changing. Just look at how far we have come in the last year \non this issue. This debate is not going to be over after this vote, \ntomorrow but rather the debate is just beginning. However, at this \ntime, I feel that the taxpayer's money should be spent in places where \nwe yield the best results for patients, and currently this is in the \narea of adult stem cell research.\n  It is my hope, Mr. President, that we continue to see monumental \nsteps made in medical research, stem cell and otherwise, and that we \nfind cures to diseases such as juvenile diabetes, cancer, sickle cell \nanemia, and Alzheimer's disease.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas is recognized.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Georgia for \nhis comments. We are about to wrap up the first full day of debate. We \nwill vote tomorrow on a package of three votes. This is an important \ndebate. This is one area that we have needed to debate for some period \nof time. We haven't had a real debate on a pending bioethics bill since \n1998. The science has changed dramatically since 1998 and the debate at \nthat point in time. We should benefit from this debate and from the \nscience. All of us are interested in people such as Jacki Rabon. I have \nshown her picture before, but I want to make the point again because \nseveral of my colleagues have talked about people with spinal cord \ninjuries. They talk about people with Parkinson's disease and what they \nwanted to do was cure that--to get something that would work for them. \nThat is what was motivating them. I just want to help this person.\n  Here is a real live person; traffic accident; paraplegic from the \nwaist down; an active athlete; excited about her future--and that all \nchanged in a few seconds.\n  We all know this story too well because we have heard it and seen it \nin our own communities. I simply ask my colleagues: What is the most \nlikely treatment route for her? Is it adult and cord blood stem cells \nor is it embryonic stem cells? We have to make choices\n\n[[Page S7619]]\n\non dollars and where you invest funds. If we take the $.5 billion that \nwe have invested in the embryonic stem cells in human and animals over \nthe last 5 years and say we are going to get people such as Jacki \nwalking again, what are we going to invest that money in? Is it going \nto be on embryonic or adult? She is already showing some improvement \nand feeling in her hip area. She is able to walk now with braces--\nthrough use of adult stem cell therapy which, unfortunately, she has \nhad to go to Portugal to get. Researchers are here, but they cannot get \ninto the FDA trials.\n  Clearly, the answer, if we want her to walk again during her \nlifetime, is to work and to fund adult and cord blood stem cells. That \nis where we are going to get the treatments. That is where it is \nworking.\n  The other areas may provide some interesting science. But if we are \ninterested in helping people such as Jacki, we have one area that \nworks, and we have another area into which we have put $.5 billion and \nit hasn't worked--and we know that.\n  I want to show you a picture of Dennis Turner. He has been brought up \nin this debate. I have had him in to testify. He is a Parkinson's \npatient. We want to cure Parkinson's disease. He was Parkinson's-free \nfor 5 years because of adult stem cell therapy. It started to come back \nafter that period of time, but he got 5 years of his life back.\n  If our objective is to have a treatment or cure for people such as \nDennis Turner, where are we going to put the money? Are we going to put \nit in embryonic stem cells, where the scientists supporting it say this \nwill take decades to find any sort of treatment, if they ever find a \ntreatment, or put it into the adult stem cell area where they are \nalready showing some results?\n  I know if I have limited resources, I would want to put my money \nwhere it is most likely to yield. It clearly is in the adult and cord \nblood stem cell area.\n  A lot of allegations and questions have been made regarding adult \nstem cells and cord blood and whether they are actually showing the \ntypes of results that I have been suggesting.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record at the end of \nmy statement the current list--it gets updated often--of 72 current \nhuman clinical applications using adult stem cells.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, next week it will may be 75, but for \nthis week it is 72.\n  My point in saying highlighting this is that some have said they \nreally question whether we are getting that many treatments. There have \nonly been nine FDA-approved full clinical trials, full treatment areas \nusing adult stem cells. Okay. I will take that. I do not know if that \nis an accurate number. But remember that FDA is the standard where you \nhave to go through clinical trials 1 and 2 to get the application and \nget it tested before it is fully used.\n  I note that people are challenging how many areas of adult stem cell \nare being treated. I welcome this debate. I think we should be looking \nat the science and where it is going. They were saying we really \nquestion whether this many areas of adult stem cell treatments are \nactually happening. They produced an addendum to their challenge on it. \nThey went through all of the 65 areas at that time. It is now 72. But \nwhen they did the review, it was 65. The Senator from Iowa was \nparticularly challenging whether we have this many treatment areas. He \npulled out one on testicular cancer and said: I don't think they are \nreally getting it there. But this addendum is the people challenging \nthe number of adult stem cell areas that have treatment. On testicular \ncancer, the researcher described a clinical evaluation showing improved \nlong-term survival of a relapsed testicular cancer patient following \nthe radical therapy that included a transplant of adult stem cells from \nbone marrow or blood. The research is actually showing that it was an \nimprovement.\n  I am not saying that these are all FDA-approved areas. This is an \narea of research. But you actually have a researcher saying it showed \nimprovement. This isn't the group who is challenging whether we are \ngetting these treatments at all. They are not cures today. This is \nresearch. But the research shows a promise even in the area that they \nchallenge.\n  Leukemia--this is from the same addendum. Two clinical studies, each \nincorporating multiple leukemia types, indicate that adult stem cell \ntransplants from bone marrow or umbilical cord blood improved the \nsurvival of children with leukemia.\n  That is not FDA approved. But it is working. This, after only a short \nperiod of time that we have been working with all these different types \nof adult stem cells. We have known about them in bone marrow for some \nperiod of time.\n  Some patients with Hodgkin's lymphoma show an overall improved \nsurvival rate when transplanted with adult stem cells from blood.\n  The list goes on and on.\n  I welcome a debate about whether we are getting treatment for areas \nwhere people are showing improvement taking place with adult and cord \nblood because the truth of matter is we are. These are not all FDA \napproved. We never said that they were. The problem is we need more \nmoney to be able to get more of these FDA trials so that we can get \nmore people treated. If we do that, there is a very promising area that \nis already showing results. Why not put your money there?\n  Let me give my colleagues a visual of this, if anybody is interested. \nThere is a notebook of showing the accumulation of recent advances in \nadult stem cell research and other alternatives to cloning and \nembryonic stem cell research. This is a one-page summary of each of \nthese areas where we are getting treatment. Note that I am not saying \ncures. I want to be very careful with my words. The treatments are \npromising in adult and cord blood.\n  Look how thick this book is. This is just one-page summaries of each \nof these various areas--cord blood, cartilage, brain damage, cancers. \nIt has been very impressive.\n  If you do not like this example or if you are still questioning \nwhether we are showing this much progress in adult stem cell, I invite \npeople to go on the Internet and look at a site called \nClinicalTrials.gov. This is an area where clinical trials are listed on \nthe Internet. I didn't know about it until today. It sounded very \ninteresting to me. It shows, as of now--I guess these numbers are \nactually growing with 565 such clinical trials currently active or \nrecruiting patients using adult or cord blood stem cells to treat \npeople.\n  If we want to cure people, if we want to find real treatments, if we \nwant to see cures for people with spinal cord injuries, Parkinson's, \ndiabetes, cancer or heart disease, the clear area to invest in is adult \nand cord blood. That is the clear area to go into.\n  Let us look on the other side of the aisle on this the embryonic stem \ncell work which is being pushed here today.\n  By the way, my colleagues have known about this for a very long time. \nWe have known about embryonic stem cells for 25 years. We have worked \nand looked at these things for a long period of time.\n  They say this is arbitrary and it is not going to support killing \nembryos. What is being talked about is using taxpayer money to expand \nthe lines of embryonic stem cell research. To get embryonic stem cells, \nyou have to destroy an embryo.\n  The President set a date, August 9 at 9 p.m, when he was delivering a \nspeech to the Nation saying, after this point in time, we are not going \nto fund it any further because we do not want to fund the additional \ndestruction of human life. We will work on it on a prior date. That is \nwhy that date was picked.\n\n  Here is a clear demarcation. We will fund it prior; we have to the \ntune of half a billion on human and animal. It is both. After that, we \nwill not fund it on humans because the life-and-death decision has \nalready been made on these designs prior to August 9 but not on future \nones.\n  Now, if we say we are going to use taxpayer money to fund any human \nembryonic stem cell research, people could go out today after we fund \nthis, destroy human embryos, develop the lines, and have Federal \ntaxpayer dollars. I again point out to my colleagues, there are no \nprohibitions in the United States today against any embryonic stem cell \nresearch. You can do it anywhere you want. We do have a\n\n[[Page S7620]]\n\nlimitation on the Federal taxpayer dollars, on where they can go in the \nfuture destruction of human life.\n  Now, with this half a billion that we have invested over the last 5 \nyears, how many human treatments do we have from embryonic stem cells? \nI have a notebook that shows the number of human treatments. I will \nshow this notebook again. This is adult and cord blood. Here are human \ntreatments on embryonic stem cell research. We do not have the \nresearch. It is not there. They do not exist.\n  It is interesting research. It has proven very problematic to get to \npeople.\n  A number of my colleagues have been pushing this bill for some period \nof time, and I do not question or challenge what they were doing. I \nthink they want to find cures. But the problem is we have not found \ntreatments in the embryonic field.\n  They were saying in the year 1999 one of my colleague's medical \nexperts testified that it may well be within 5 years of a cure for \nParkinson's disease, Alzheimer's, and a long list of other human \nailments. Stem cell research has enormous potential.\n  That is true. But it is adult cord blood stem cell research that is \nworking. It is not embryonic. The embryonic has not produced the \ntreatments. That was 1999. We are 7 years later, and it has not \nproduced a peer-reviewed treatment.\n  We have scientists who testified at a hearing in 1998. Mr. President, \nI refer my colleagues to www.access.gpo.gov/congress/senate for that \ntestimony.\n  Mr. President, when Dr. Gearhart was asked how long will it be before \nwe get these cures to Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, or cancer, he \nresponded:\n\n       I actually think within several years, to be honest with \n     you . . .\n\n  That was 1998. Eight years later, here we are. Dr. Gearhart--one of \nthe leading researchers in this field.\n  Then Dr. Thompson, one of the leading researchers on Parkinson's:\n\n       I am going to say 5 to 10 years more.\n       It will be one of the first ones.\n\n  We do have a treatment being developed. And it is adult stem cells \nfor Parkinson's. We do not need to make this life-and-death decision \nand expand taxpayer funding for the embryonic lines.\n  My point is, in 1998 the leading researchers were saying we will have \nthese cures in a few years, 5 to 10 years, and now researchers are \nsaying it is decades, if even in their lifetime, that it will happen.\n  I conclude with this point. If this were all in the abstract and we \nwere saying that we will spend another half a billion in this area, go \nahead and do that, you could say: Well, all right, we spend a lot of \nmoney around here, we will do that. The problem with it is: how many \nmillions of dollars will be spent on research, which is based on \ndestroying human embryos that become human people? This is the \nbeginnings of human life. That is the real ethical rub on top of the \nfinancial rub of whether this is the right place to invest.\n  I have cited the snowflake child, Hannah previously. Was she just a \nclump of stem cells? Early life can be very fragile.\n  This is Isaiah Royal, born to one of my staff members. Isaiah Royal \nwas born at 24 weeks of age, very early. He is a fighter. But I don't \nthink you can possibly say he is not human life. He is just 23 weeks \nafter the embryonic stage that we are talking about, 23 weeks and a \ncouple of days after that. Would you deny that he is human life? You \nwould say no, of course not. Isaiah is struggling. He weighed 1 pound \n14 ounces at birth. He is a good, tough, fighter. But we are talking \nabout fragile human life, and it should be treated as sacred. We should \nnot do research on it. Human life is important.\n  This is an important question. I urge my colleagues to vote against \nH.R. 810.\n\n                               Exhibit I\n\n     72 Current Human Clinical Applications Using Adult Stem Cells\n\n\n                    anemias & other blood conditions\n\n       Sickle cell anemia.\n       Sideroblastic anemia.\n       Aplastic anemia.\n       Red cell aplasia (failure of red blood cell development).\n       Amegakaryocytic thrombocytopenia.\n       Thalassemia (genetic [inherited] disorders all of which \n     involve underproduction of hemoglobin).\n       Primary amyloidosis (A disorder of plasma cells).\n       Diamond blackfan anemia.\n       Fanconi's anemia.\n       Chronic Epstein-Barr infection (similar to Mono).\n\n\n                          auto-immune diseases\n\n       Systemic lupus (auto-immune condition that can affect skin, \n     heart, lungs, kidneys, joints, and nervous system).\n       Sjogren's syndrome (autoimmune disease w/symptoms similar \n     to arthritis).\n       Myasthenia (An autoimmune neuromuscular disorder).\n       Autoimmune cytopenia.\n       Scleromyxedema (skin condition).\n       Scleroderma (skin disorder).\n       Crohn's disease (chronic inflammatory disease of the \n     intestines).\n       Behcet's disease.\n       Rheumatoid arthritis.\n       Juvenile arthritis.\n       Multiple sclerosis.\n       Polychondritis (chronic disorder of the cartilage).\n       Systemic vasculitis (inflammation of the blood vessels).\n       Alopecia universalis.\n       Buerger's disease (limb vessel constriction, inflammation).\n\n\n                            bladder disease\n\n       End-stage bladder disease.\n\n\n                                cancers\n\n       Brain tumors--medulloblastoma and glioma.\n       Retinoblastoma (cancer).\n       Ovarian cancer.\n       Skin cancer: Merkel cell carcinoma.\n       Testicular cancer.\n       Lymphoma.\n       Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.\n       Hodgkin's lymphoma.\n       Acute lymphoblastic leukemia.\n       Acute myelogenous leukemia.\n       Chronic myelogenous leukemia.\n       Chronic myelomonocytic leukemia.\n       Juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia.\n       Cancer of the lymph nodes: Angioimmunoblastic \n     lymphadenopathy.\n       Multiple myeloma (cancer affecting white blood cells of the \n     immune system).\n       Myelodysplasia (bone marrow disorder).\n       Breast cancer.\n       Neuroblastoma (childhood cancer of the nervous system).\n       Renal cell carcinoma (cancer of the kidney).\n       Soft tissue sarcoma (malignant tumor that begins in the \n     muscle, fat, fibrous tissue, blood vessels).\n       Ewing's sarcoma.\n       Various solid tumors.\n       Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia (type of lymphoma).\n       Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis.\n       POEMS syndrome (osteosclerotic myeloma).\n       Myelofibrosis.\n\n\n                             cardiovascular\n\n       Acute Heart damage.\n       Chronic coronary artery disease.\n\n\n                           immunodeficiencies\n\n       Severe combined immunodeficiency syndrome.\n       X-linked lymphoproliferative syndrome.\n       X-linked hyper immunoglobulin M syndrome.\n\n\n                             liver disease\n\n       Chronic liver failure.\n       Liver cirrhosis.\n\n\n                NEURAL DEGENERATIVE DISEASES & INJURIES\n\n       Parkinson's disease.\n       Spinal cord injury.\n       Stroke damage.\n\n\n                                 ocular\n\n       Corneal regeneration.\n\n\n                           wounds & injuries\n\n       Limb gangrene.\n       Surface wound healing.\n       Jawbone replacement.\n       Skull bone repair.\n\n\n                       other metabolic disorders\n\n       Hurler's syndrome (hereditary genetic disorder).\n       Osteogenesis imperfecta (bone/cartilage disorder).\n       Krabbe Leukodystrophy (hereditary genetic disorder).\n       Osteopetrosis (genetic bone disorder).\n       Cerebral X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy.\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I yield to my colleague from Virginia who is here to \nspeak on some important topics.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank my distinguished colleague. We \nhave another distinguished colleague here. It is my understanding that \nat 8 o'clock, the time of the distinguished Senator from Kansas now \nshifts to the other side of the aisle, but my colleague said he only \nwants 3 or 4 minutes.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I have other things I can cover. I understand the \ndistinguished Senator from Virginia wanted to come over and speak on a \nvery pressing matter of foreign policy. That is why I yielded the time \nto my colleague.\n  Mr. WARNER. I will try to compress my time in 10 minutes.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Good.\n  If I could, what does the Senator from Iowa desire?\n\n[[Page S7621]]\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. If the Senator would yield, I understand the Senator from \nVirginia wanted 10 minutes. I said I didn't intend to speak for half an \nhour; I just wanted to speak for about 5 minutes at 8 o'clock and yield \nback the remainder of my time and he could speak as long as he wanted \nto at that time. It is only 15 minutes from now. I thought the Senator \nfrom Kansas was probably going to use up most of the time.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I was. But I understood that my colleague wanted to \nspeak on this particular issue. If the Senator wants to summarize and \nmy colleague from Virginia wants to wait, I was offering him that \ncourtesy because he had discussed coming over here early to do that.\n  Mr. WARNER. I am here to accommodate all.\n  Would the Senator like to finish his remarks?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I say to the Senator from Virginia, go ahead and take \nyour time. I will speak later. That is fine.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Warner are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, as a long-time supporter of stem cell \nresearch, I want to commend the majority leader for working out an \nagreement that will give the Senate the opportunity to act on this \ncritically important issue.\n  I am particularly pleased that the Senate will finally have the \nopportunity to vote on the Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act. I am \nproud to be a cosponsor of this bipartisan bill which will expand the \nnumber of stem cell lines that are eligible for federally funded \nresearch, enabling scientists to take full advantage of the scientific \nand medical opportunities provided by stem cells. At the same time, it \nestablishes standards and creates a framework to ensure that this \nresearch is conducted ethically.\n  The promise of embryonic Stem cell lines lies with their potential to \ndevelop into virtually any cell, tissue, or organ in the body. As a \nconsequence, this research holds considerable potential to treat and \neven cure a vast array of diseases and conditions. Researchers could, \nfor example, potentially generate insulin-producing islet cells for \npatients with juvenile diabetes; neurons to treat Parkinson's disease, \nALS, and Alzheimer's disease; as well as bone marrow cells to treat \ncancer. It is estimated that more than 100 million Americans are \ncurrently afflicted by diseases or disabilities that have the potential \nto be treated through this research.\n  On August 9, 2001, President Bush announced that Federal funds could, \nfor the first time, be used to support research on embryonic stem \ncells. This research, however, was limited to existing embryonic stem \ncell lines created prior to 9 p.m. on that day.\n  In the 4 years since the President made that announcement, this stem \ncell policy has fallen far short of its original goals. While the Human \nEmbryonic Stem Cell Registry at the NIH lists 78 stem cell lines, at \nbest, no more than 212 lines will ever be available for research under \nthe current policy.\n  Moreover, as Dr. John Gearhart of Johns Hopkins University told the \nSpecial Committee on Aging last year, existing lines are ``contaminated \nwith animal cells, lack genetic diversity, are not disease-specific and \nare not adequate for researchers to apply to a wide variety of \ndiseases.'' Limiting researchers to these lines therefore places huge \nand unnecessary roadblocks in the way of possible treatments and cures \nfor devastating diseases like Alzheimer's disease, ALS, cancer and \ndiabetes.\n  We have learned a lot about stem cells since 2001. For example, \nscientists have now crated methods for growing stem cell lines that are \nfree of animal cells, greatly improving their potential for treating \nand curing disease. They have also created ``disease specific'' stem \ncell lines. Under the current policy, however, these ``new and \nimproved'' stem cell lines are not available to federally funded \nresearchers in the United States.\n\n  It is therefore time for us to update our stem cell policy to reflect \nwhat we have learned so that we can accelerate this important research, \nwhich hold such promise for millions of Americans and their families.\n  The Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act lifts the current restriction \nso that stem cell lines are eligible for federally funded research \nregardless of the date on which they were created. Federal funding, \nhowever, would continue to be restricted to stem cells derived from \nembryos originally created for fertility treatments that are in excess \nof the clinical need and that otherwise would be discarded.\n  The legislation also requires the informed consent of the donors and \nprohibits any financial inducement to donate. Finally, the bill calls \non the National Institutes of Health to develop strict guidelines to \nensure that researchers adhere to clear ethical and moral standards.\n  As the founder and co-chair of the Senate Diabetes Caucus, I am \nparticularly excited about the promise that stem cell research holds \nfor a cure for diabetes. Early research has shown that stem cells have \nthe potential to develop into insulin-producing cells to replace those \nthat have been destroyed in people with type I diabetes.\n  Last year, I chaired a hearing in conjunction with the Juvenile \nDiabetes Research Foundation's Children's Congress to examine the \ndevastating impact that juvenile diabetes has had on American children \nand their families. We heard heartbreaking testimony from children who \nhad traveled to Washington to tell Congress what it is like to have \ndiabetes, just how serious it is, and how important it is that we fund \nthe research necessary to find a cure.\n  Steffi Rothweiler from Falmouth, ME, told the committee that she \nactually couldn't remember having a normal life without nights and \nweekends, and every hour of every day to take care of diabetes. She \ntold us about her parents, who have given up their nights and weekends, \nand every hour of every day to take care of her and make sure that she \nstays in tight control of her blood sugar levels so that she can stay \nas healthy as possible. Steffi asked that we do all that we can to find \na cure for diabetes as quickly as possible. We simply cannot ignore the \npotential that embryonic stem cell research holds for wonderful young \npeople like Steffi.\n  I am sensitive to the ethical concerns raised by opponents of this \nresearch. That is why I have cosponsored the legislation introduced by \nSenators Santorum and Specter to encourage the development of \nalternative methods for deriving stem cells without using embryos.\n\n  The fact is, however, that the embryos that will be used for this \nresearch would otherwise be discarded. In my view, the ethical choice \nis to use them for research that may benefit millions of Americans \nrather than discard them as medical waste.\n  Moreover, what is often ignored in this debate is that embryonic stem \ncell research is occurring in the private sector, where it is outside \nthe purview of the NIH. It therefore lacks the scientific and ethical \noversight that routinely occurs with federally funded research. Dr. \nAllen Spiegel, who was then the Director of the National Institute of \nDiabetes anti Digestive and Kidney Diseases, testified at our \nChildren's Congress hearing last year. He told the committee that, \nwhile NIH routinely works very closely with the private sector, in the \narea of stem cell research, ``there is a wall.'' By expanding our \ncurrent stem cell policy, we are tearing down that wall, allowing more \nresearch but with clear ethical standards.\n  Opponents of embryonic stem cell research contend that adult stem \ncells derived from tissue, such as bone marrow, are a sufficient \nreplacement for embryonic stem cells in forwarding this important \nresearch. I believe that we need both. But, as Dr. Speigel told our \ncommittee, with regard to diabetes research:\n\n       We need to do embryonic stem cell first because it can give \n     us a better understanding of what causes Type I diabetes . . \n     . because it will actually inform our ability to work with \n     adult stem cells . . . and finally, because, and one cannot \n     guarantee or promise this, the embryonic stem cells \n     themselves, if successfully turned into insulin-secreting \n     beta cells, could be the source of cell therapy.\n\n  Mr. President, I believe that it would be tragic not to take \nadvantage of this opportunity to accelerate research that can \npotentially help millions of people. I therefore urge my colleagues to \njoin me in voting for the Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act.\n\n[[Page S7622]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I will not take the entire 25 minutes that \nare left, but I did want to close out a little bit today before we \nproceed into tomorrow by just responding to a few of the things that \nwere said today to try to clear up a couple of issues.\n  The Senator from Kansas, my good friend, was going on and on about \nstem cells, as he has most of the day, and about how all these \ntreatments and everything are out there. I could respond to every one \nof them, but I think what we have to keep in mind is that if all of \nthese diseases that the Senator from Kansas talked about have been \ntreated with adult stem cells, how come all of the patient advocacy \ngroups for these diseases support H.R. 810?\n  One has to wonder, when you listen to the Senator from Kansas outline \nall these diseases that are being helped by adult stem cells. He brings \nup the picture of the guy who had Parkinson's. He was helped with adult \nstem cells. But, again, he has now gone back and he is where he was \nbefore.\n  Well, if adult stem cells are doing so much, why is the Parkinson's \ngroup, the Parkinson's Action Network, supporting H.R. 810? Why are all \nthese advocacy groups supporting H.R. 810 if adult stem cells are so \ngreat? Are they just a bunch of stupid people out there? Have they been \nhoodwinked and misguided?\n  These advocacy groups know. They know what is going on. And they know \nthat S. 2754 is no substitute for H.R. 810. While adult stem cells are \nfine, as I pointed out earlier, they have been investigating and doing \nscience on adult stem cells for over 30 years.\n  Now, just another little thing that happened: The Senator from \nKansas, I heard him say: Well, they have been investigating animal stem \ncells for 20 years.\n  That might lead you to think: Well, we have been looking at stem \ncells for 20 years. Not so. We never derived human embryonic stem cells \nuntil 1998--8 years ago. So I wanted to make the record clear on that.\n  Now, the Senator also mentioned something about testicular cancer. He \nmade all kinds of claims about adult stem cells helping testicular \ncancer. Let me read from a letter written by Craig Nichols, MD, a \nmember of the board of the Lance Armstrong Foundation. We all know the \nLance Armstrong Foundation is basically focused on testicular cancer \nbecause that is what Lance Armstrong had. And he licked it. But let me \nquote from the letter written on July 14:\n\n       Dear Senator Frist:\n       As a member of the Lance Armstrong Foundation's Board of \n     Directors, I am writing in response to assertions that adult \n     stem cells have treated or cured the disease of testicular \n     cancer. . . . I feel that it is important to set the record \n     straight on this issue.\n       Testicular cancer is the most common cancer among men ages \n     15-35 and approximately 8,000 men will be diagnosed with \n     testicular cancer in the United States this year. While \n     testicular cancer is one of the most curable forms of cancer, \n     our organization would like to emphasize as the Senate \n     debates H.R. 810 . . . that we have NOT completely eradicated \n     the disease.\n       There is not an FDA-approved adult stem cell treatment \n     generally available to treat testicular cancer.\n\n  The Senator from Kansas kind of, in his comments, led us to think \nthat there might be. Here is what Dr. Nichols said:\n\n       Rather, adult stem cells enable testicular cancer patients \n     to withstand a higher dose of chemotherapy during treatment \n     for the disease.\n\n  The adult stem cells enable patients to withstand a higher dose of \nchemotherapy. Dr. Nichols says:\n\n       We support exploring every avenue of research, including \n     embryonic stem cell research within specified ethical limits, \n     until a cure is found. . . .\n       The Lance Armstrong Foundation asks that you and your \n     colleagues pass H.R. 810, and not accept any substitutes.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that this letter from the Lance Armstrong \nFoundation be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                   Lance Armstrong Foundation,\n\n                                        Austin, TX, July 14, 2006.\n     Hon. William Frist,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Frist: As a member of the Lance Armstrong \n     Foundation's (LAF) Board of Directors, I am writing in \n     response to assertions that adult stem cells have treated or \n     cured the disease of testicular cancer. While the mission of \n     the LAF is to inspire and empower people affected by ALL \n     types of cancer, I feel that it is important to set the \n     record straight on this issue.\n       Testicular cancer is the most common cancer among men ages \n     15-35 and approximately 8,000 men will be diagnosed with \n     testicular cancer in the United States this year. While \n     testicular cancer is one of the most curable forms of cancer, \n     our organization would like to emphasize as the Senate \n     debates H.R. 810, the Stem Cell Research and Enhancement Act, \n     that we have NOT completely eradicated the disease.\n       There is not an FDA-approved adult stem cell treatment \n     generally available to treat testicular cancer. Rather, adult \n     stem cells enable testicular cancer patients to withstand a \n     higher dose of chemotherapy during treatment for the disease.\n       We support exploring every avenue of research, including \n     embryonic stem cell research within specified ethical limits, \n     until a cure is found. The most respected scientists in our \n     field view embryonic stem cells as an area of research that \n     must be explored, and one that our government must make a \n     commitment to support. The Lance Armstrong Foundation asks \n     that you and your colleagues pass H.R. 810, and not accept \n     any substitutes.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                          Craig Nichols, M.D.,\n\n                                              Member of the Board,\n                                       Lance Armstrong Foundation.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Now, we hear claims that leukemia and lymphomas have been \ncured or treated by adult stem cells. Here is what George Dahlman of \nthe Leukemia and Lymphoma Society has to say about that:\n\n       On behalf of the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society, I am \n     writing in response to assertions that adult stem cells have \n     treated or cured several blood cancers, including several \n     leukemias, lymphomas and multiple myeloma.\n       As a representative of more than 700,000 patients and their \n     caregivers in this country that battle blood cancers on a \n     daily basis, our organization would like to emphasize, as the \n     Senate debates H.R. 810 . . . that we exist today because we \n     have not found cures for these devastating diseases. . . . \n     the claim that treatment of blood cancers with cord blood, \n     blood or marrow stem cells--known as hematopoietic stem \n     cells--demonstrates a potential of ``adult stem cell'' \n     research or is a substitute of embryonic stem cell research \n     is misleading and disingenuous.\n\n  Again, this says that the claim that treatment of blood cancer with \nmarrow stem cells demonstrates that adult stem cells is a substitute is \nmisleading and disingenuous.\n  Mr. Dahlman concludes:\n\n       The Leukemia and Lymphoma Society asks that you and your \n     colleagues pass H.R. 810, and not accept any substitutes.\n\n  Mr. President, we have heard a lot of talk about these embryos and \nthat we all started as a dot. I have often used this example. I have \nsaid: What is an embryo? I have often put a dot on a piece of paper and \nheld it up for audiences to see and said that is what we are talking \nabout. It is that big, the size of a period at the end of a sentence. \nThat is not to diminish the importance of an embryo. But I use it in \ncomparison. An embryo at the blastocyst stage has between 100 and 200 \ncells. That embryo we are talking about that is in an in vitro \nfertilization clinic and frozen in liquid nitrogen will never become a \nhuman being unless and until it is implanted into a uterus and it takes \nhold and develops. Sometimes they are implanted and they don't take \nhold and they are discharged. So an embryo is potential life--potential \nin that if it is implanted and takes hold, it could become a human \nbeing. It is potential life.\n  Look at this photo of Lauren Stanford. She says:\n\n       I am so happy to hear that the Senate is thinking of \n     passing H.R. 810. I can dream again--dream of that great day \n     when I write a thank you letter to the Senate, the House, and \n     everyone who helped me become just another girl; a girl who \n     dreamed and hoped and one day got just what she wanted; her \n     health and future.\n\n  Lauren Stanford has diabetes. She knows what will happen if she is \nnot cured. At some point in her life, she will probably become blind. \nAt some point in her life, she will probably lose a foot, a leg, one or \nmore of her limbs. At some point in her life, diabetes will take her. \nLauren Stanford. I don't know her. I don't know that I ever met Lauren \nStanford. This is not potential life; this is real life. This is a \nhuman being who is living right now.\n  That dot on the paper is an embryo. Is it alive? Of course it is \nalive. Is it a human being? No. It is potential life. Lauren Stanford \nis real life.\n  Read the bill. Read H.R. 810. Ethical guidelines. We can only use \nthose embryos that are left over from in vitro\n\n[[Page S7623]]\n\nfertilization that are going to be discarded. Read the bill:\n\n       Prior to the consideration of embryo donation and through \n     consultation with the individuals seeking fertility \n     treatment, it was determined that the embryos would never be \n     implanted in a woman and would otherwise be discarded.\n\n  Written consent.\n\n       The individuals seeking fertility treatment donated the \n     embryos with written informed consent and without receiving \n     any financial or other inducements to make the donation.\n\n  It has to be determined, before any embryo could ever be used for \nstem cell derivation, that the embryos would never be implanted in a \nwoman and would otherwise be discarded. Every day, fertility clinics \ndiscard unwanted embryos. People have IVF--50,000 babies were born last \nyear to couples who wanted to have a baby and could not and needed IVF. \nBut some embryos were left over. Well, couples who have had their \nchildren then call up the clinic or the clinic calls them and the \nclinic says: Do you want to continue to pay for us to keep these \nembryos frozen?\n  If you have had your children and you don't want to expand your \nfamily, you say: No, I don't want to pay for that anymore. Guess what. \nThe IVF clinic discards it. I have heard they basically throw them in \nthe sink and wash them down the sink. They are only as big as a period \nat the end of a sentence.\n  So the real question for us really comes down to that, unless we want \nto outlaw in vitro fertilization and make it a crime, which I don't \nhear anybody here wanting to do. As long as we have in vitro \nfertilization and have leftover embryos, the real question for us is \nthis: If the donors of those embryos, through written informed consent, \ndetermine it will never be implanted in a woman and will be discarded, \nis it better to have them discarded and flushed down the drain or used \nfor the kind of scientific research that will cure Lauren Stanford of \nher diabetes? Potential life versus real life. Potential life that will \nbe discarded versus real life. Potential life that will be flushed down \nthe drain versus Lauren Stanford, real life. That is the question for \nus.\n  We hear all of these arguments around here about we were all an \nembryo at one time. Of course we were. The question is, What happens to \nall those embryos? Right now, they are being discarded, and it is \nperfectly legal to do so. I don't see anyone here with legislation \nsaying it is going to be a crime for them to be discarded, a crime to \nhave in vitro fertilization. Really, that is the choice. Do we discard \npotential life or do we use it to save real life? This is not potential \nlife, this is real.\n  My nephew Kelly, who suffered a tragic accident on an aircraft \ncarrier 27 years ago, hasn't walked since. He keeps hope alive that one \nday he will walk again. He knows about the research that has been done \non rats and mice where spinal cords have been reconnected using \nembryonic stem cells. He knows that. I have never heard him say it, but \nI suppose he would probably echo what Christopher Reeve once said: Oh, \nto be a rat.\n  He knows that. That is real life. Kelly is a real person. He is \nalive. He is not potential life. That is our decision when we face the \nvote tomorrow on H.R. 810.\n  So all these other arguments about adult stem cells and this kind of \nstuff, fine, I have nothing against adult stem cell research. I am in \nfavor of it. We ought to keep it going. But to choke off--not what I \nsay but what the leading scientists say, the leading Nobel Prize \nwinners say, what all of these disease groups who have medical people \nsitting on their boards, what they all say is the most promising avenue \nof research for curing Alzheimer's, juvenile diabetes, spinal cord \ninjuries, Parkinson's, and ALS, the most promising is not adult stem \ncells. It is embryonic stem cells. That is what they say, not me.\n  To cut that off and to say, no, we won't do it is telling Lauren \nStanford that potential life, that an embryo the size of a pencil dot, \nyes, is life; it is human potential that is as important as she is; \nthat they have equal weight on the scales. I am sorry, Mr. President, I \ndon't think so, not when it is going to be discarded, legally thrown \ndown the drain. And as long as we have strict ethical guidelines in the \nbill--strict ethical guidelines, more than exists right now, stronger \nethical guidelines than are in the law right now.\n  To me, there is really only one answer. We should be in favor of this \nreal life of curing diseases, seeking treatments and cures in an \nethical manner, which is what this bill does. So I hope that tomorrow \nwe have an overwhelming vote in favor of H.R. 810.\n  I understand today the administration came out with a Statement of \nAdministration Policy, or SAP as it is called around here, saying the \nPresident would veto it. I hope the President rethinks this. He is \noverseas anyway. Let's face it, we are all kind of captives of our \nstaff around here. Staff tells us this and that. OMB says this, OMB \nsays that. I am hopeful this is the work of some staff, that the \nPresident hasn't thought about it. He has been overseas focused on the \nG8; now, I am sure, focused on the Middle East.\n  I hope when President Bush thinks about it that he remembers Lauren \nStanford, that he will remember the letter from Nancy Reagan and he \nwill come down on the side of real life, and he will come down on the \nside of an ethical approach to embryonic stem cell research.\n  I still believe in miracles, and I hope a miracle will occur and the \nPresident of the United States finds it in his heart to say that what \nhe did on August 9, 2001, was done with a lack of adequate knowledge. \nHe can say: Look, we thought there were 78 lines, and there were not; \nthere were only 21 lines. We didn't know they were all contaminated \nwith mouse feeder cells. They can't be used for human therapies. That \nhe will say in light of all that we know now, and with the strict \nethical guidelines we have in this bill, I see fit to sign into law \nH.R. 810.\n  That is my hope. That is the hope of Lauren Stanford. That is the \nhope of the millions of Americans out there who suffer from \nAlzheimer's, the millions who suffer from spinal cord injuries and \ntheir families and caregivers and Parkinson's and ALS, and so many \nmore.\n  Tonight they are praying--they are praying--that a miracle occurs and \nthat the President will change his mind and sign this bill. And until \nthe very moment that he vetoes it, I will remain hopeful that miracle \nwill occur.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, yesterday, July 16, was the anniversary of \none of the greatest events in American history. It was 219 years ago \nthat our Founding Fathers were meeting at the Constitutional Convention \nin Philadelphia, attempting to formulate a workable plan of Government. \nAt the time, the young American Government was operating under the \nArticles of Confederation, which every day was proving to be \nunworkable.\n  For 7 weeks, the Constitutional Convention had been working to devise \na better form of Government, a ``more perfect union.'' It would be a \nGovernment with three branches: an executive branch, a legislative \nbranch, and a judicial branch. The branches of the Government would \nhave separated powers and the ability to check and balance one another.\n  The Convention delegates had already made a number of important \ndecisions about the structure of the Congress. The Convention had set \nthe minimum age for Members of the Senate at 30 and a term length at 6 \nyears, as opposed to 25 years of age for Members of the House of \nRepresentatives, who would have 2-year terms.\n  But then came the stumbling block, how the States would be \nrepresented in\n\n[[Page S7624]]\n\nCongress. Delegates from the large States believed that because their \nStates contributed more to the Nation's financial and defensive \nresources, they should have greater representation in the legislative \nbodies. Small State delegates demanded that all States be equally \nrepresented in both Houses.\n  Hours, even days, of heated, contentious debate followed. A number of \nproposals, including one by Benjamin Franklin, were considered and \nrejected. Stalemate was in the air. Failure threatened the Convention \nand the youthful Republic was stymied, stopped in its tracks. If the \nConstitutional Convention collapsed, it meant that the American \nGovernment would have to continue operating under the flawed and \nfailing Articles of Confederation.\n  So maybe it was a miracle in Philadelphia. It may have been divine \nintervention. Who knows. Perhaps it was because there were great \npolitical leaders and they acted as mature political statesmen. \nPolitics, it is said, is the art of compromise. And this is exactly \nwhat our Founding Fathers did; they compromised. They worked out a \ncompromise, the Great Compromise, also known as the Connecticut \nCompromise because it was designed by the Connecticut delegates Roger \nSherman and Oliver Ellsworth. It provided a dual system of \ncongressional representation. In the House of Representatives, every \nState would be assigned a number of seats in proportion to its \npopulation. In the Senate, all States would have the same number of \nseats.\n  Just 8 days after the Great Compromise was adopted, the Convention \nwas able to elect a committee to draft a detailed Constitution \nembodying the fundamental principles of the proceedings.\n  Today, representation of the two Houses of Congress seems so logical \nand so accepted that we take it for granted. Perhaps it is for that \nreason that we pass this anniversary with very little notice, too \nlittle notice--that is a shame--and no fanfare. It was a crucial moment \nin history. An American moment. It should be recognized and honored and \nremembered.\n\n     Thou, too, sail on, O Ship of State!\n     Sail on, O Union, strong and great!\n     Humanity with all its fears,\n     With all the hopes of future years,\n     Is hanging breathless on thy fate!\n     We know what Master laid thy keel,\n     What Workmen wrought thy ribs of steel,\n     Who made each mast, and sail, and rope,\n     What anvils rang, what hammers beat,\n     In what a forge and what a heat\n     Were shaped the anchors of thy hope!\n     Fear not each sudden and sound and shock,\n     'Tis of the wave and not the rock;\n     'Tis but the flapping of the sail,\n     And not a rent made by the gale!\n     In spite of rock and tempest's roar,\n     In spite of false lights on the shore,\n     Sail on, nor fear to breast the sea!\n     Our hearts, our hopes, are all with thee,\n     Our hearts, our hopes, our prayers, our tears,\n     Our faith triumphant o'er our fears,\n     Are all with thee--are all with thee!\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, let me thank the Senator from West \nVirginia for reminding us, once again, of an important part of this \ncountry's great history. He educates all of us on the floor of the \nSenate, and I appreciate his comments.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator. Were it \nnot for that compromise, we would not be here today. There would be no \nSenate. There would be no Republic as we know it.\n  I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/07/17/senate-section/article/S7624-1", "month": "07", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7624-S7625]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            THE MIDDLE EAST\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Presiding \nOfficer.\n  During the course of the day, there was brought to the attention of \nthe Members of the Senate a resolution regarding the situation in the \nMiddle East. It was my understanding this resolution would be brought \nto the Senate tonight and that presumably it would be agreed to by the \nSenate.\n  My concern is that there are certain additional matters which should \nbe included. If the Senate is going to exercise the important act of \nbringing this up, seeking unanimous consent, and the message goes out \nall over the world that the Senate has spoken, I would support what is \nin this resolution. I believe now that is not going to take place \ntonight for various reasons.\n  It is imperative that I address what was to have taken place, what I \nwas told was to have taken place, assuming the unanimous consent could \nbe achieved on both sides.\n  No. 1, this matter is so important, it deserves an opportunity for a \nnumber of Senators to speak on a resolution of this import. I am now \nadvised by our cloakroom that it will not be taken up tonight, but I \nwill take this opportunity to address parts of it or at least one part \nthat I think should bear further careful drafting and possibly be \nchanged. Otherwise, it is only one section, on page 3, item 3, which \nsays:\n\n       (3) urges the President to continue fully supporting Israel \n     as Israel exercises its right of self-defense in Lebanon and \n     Gaza;\n\n  There is no question about their right of self-defense against \nHezbollah and Hamas, but I wondered whether we should draft it in this \nway.\n  I urge those, since we are not going to take it up tonight, to make \nsure there is not an ambiguity there because the people of Lebanon are \nsuffering enormously at this time, as are the people in Gaza. Many of \nthose people are not aligned with either Hezbollah or Hamas.\n  I am also concerned about the Government in Lebanon and the actions \nwhich are taking place now, what do we do if that Government were to \nfall.\n  I would vote for this resolution if it were brought up tonight. I \nwould have addressed the Senate and brought up other matters which I \nwill now discuss.\n  I turn now again to the fact that this is so important, it deserves \nthe consideration of every Senator and a debate of some length. I don't \nknow about the schedule of the Senate, but if we are going to go \nforward and send a message to the world about our position in the \nSenate with respect to the conflicts in Palestine, Lebanon, and Israel, \nand the suffering that is taking place on all borders, each side of the \nvarious borders, then it deserves very careful consideration.\n  The purpose of me taking the floor is to point out some areas which \ndeserve full consideration in that debate which are not included. I \ndon't criticize the drafter of this resolution, but it requires the \nconsideration of the whole Senate rather than a unanimous consent with \na number of Senators who may not be here tonight.\n  In the course of that debate, I urge a larger focus. For example, \nthere is no mention in the resolution of some perhaps 25,000 Americans \nwho are trapped or engulfed in one way in this conflict. How best do we \naddress this conflict to help protect those 25,000 persons? That is an \nessential part of this debate.\n  Second, I said the following on Friday night in response to a press \ninquiry when I first learned of this conflict:\n\n       While I fully recognize that Israel was a victim of \n     provocative attacks on her people and sovereignty, I urge the \n     Administration to think through very carefully how Israel's \n     extraordinary reaction could affect our operations in Iraq \n     and our joint diplomatic efforts to resolve the Iranian \n     nuclear issue.\n       This is a very critical time for the United States in the \n     Middle East, and the Israeli actions will certainly have an \n     impact beyond just Lebanon and Gaza.\n\n  I stand by that statement. That is why I urge, and I am pleased to \nsay this resolution, at such time as it would be brought up, will be \nbroadened to cover the other points.\n  First, are the 25,000 Americans trapped? Second, this Nation has made \na very great sacrifice to achieve goals established by our President \nand a coalition of forces associated with our country in both Iraq and \nAfghanistan. Over 2,500 have lost their lives in Iraq; over 300 have \nlost their lives in Afghanistan. That is U.S. forces. Our coalition \npartners have lost. We have 20,000-plus wounded, many severely wounded \nin Iraq and Afghanistan. And $436 billion is a rough calculation of \njust a part, not all, but a significant part of the investment of our \ncountry in achieving our goals in those nations, of stabilizing their \ngovernments now with free elections in both countries and hopefully \nenabling those governments to gain the strength to provide for the \npeoples of Iraq and Afghanistan, a measure of liberty and freedom and \npossibly democracy which we enjoy here and in other nations.\n  What is the effect of any statement made by the Senate? What is the \neffect on that very fragile situation in both countries? There is a \nresurgence in Afghanistan. I was just there a short time ago--and each \nof us have followed the\n\n[[Page S7625]]\n\nnews to date--a resurgence in the fighting. NATO has come in.\n  We cannot just address one portion of the Middle East conflict \nwithout seeing how the manner in which we address that could affect the \nother areas, notably Afghanistan and Iraq.\n  So I say to my colleagues, as I said Friday night, we urge our \nPresident, our administration, as they take such, hopefully, bold and \nfirm and convincing initiatives in regard to the conflicts in Israel \nand Gaza and Lebanon, to be mindful of how it could impact on our \nconflicts in Afghanistan and Iraq and our negotiations thus far with \nIran in participating with other nations--not unilaterally--to try to \nbring about some resolution of what many of us considered up until this \nconflict--and I am not sure how we are going to eventually characterize \nthe magnitude and the future potential spreading of this conflict--but \ncertainly up until this conflict, in my judgment, the potential of Iran \ngaining nuclear weapons was absolutely--there was nothing more serious, \nin my judgment, than to try to resolve that.\n  There is no reference in here to the other Arab nations. It is quite \ninteresting; some of those nations have come forward in strong \ncondemnation, joined our country, joined other nations, in condemning \nHamas and Hezbollah. That is of importance.\n  Now we see today that so many nations say the United States must take \na stronger role in trying to work our way through this conflict, yes, \nsupporting Israel but at the same time trying to bring about some \nresolution to spare the life and limb and suffering in Palestine, \nLebanon, and Israel, to see that it not spread to other areas.\n  Now, our President has indicated that the Secretary of State will \nsoon embark on a mission. What we say in the Senate must be carefully \ndrafted so it does not remove the flexibility that our Secretary of \nState--a very able person--will need in helping to resolve this \nproblem.\n  So I say that historically this Nation has stood steadfast, and I am \nproud that I have been among those in this Chamber in my 28 years here, \nto strongly support Israel. Our Nation is viewed upon as an honest \nbroker--recognizing our support of Israel but as an honest broker. If \nthe world is going to look to us as to how we can provide that \nleadership, I do not want any loss of flexibility on the part of the \nPresident and the Secretary of State and such others who may be tasked \nto try to work out this situation.\n  Yes, I conclude our support for Israel is very strong, Mr. President, \nbut it cannot be unconditional.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/07/17/senate-section/article/S7625-1", "month": "07", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7625]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          CONDEMNING HEZBOLLAH\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I rise to speak in support of a \nresolution the Senate is expected to soon consider, and which I have \ncosponsored, along with Senator Frist, who is the lead sponsor, and \nSenators Reid, Biden, Santorum, Nelson of Florida, Kyl, Bond, and \nLevin. It is a resolution that condemns Hezbollah and expresses support \nfor Israel's right to self defense.\n  All of us are watching in horror what is happening there, and I think \nit is important that the United States Senate speak forcefully in \nsupport of our President. The G-8 leaders have spoken this week to \ncondemn Hezbollah and terrorist activities and to ask the Government of \nLebanon to help find the Israeli soldiers who are being held hostage \nand free them and to disarm Hezbollah.\n  Mr. President, there should be no misunderstanding. Israel has fully \ncomplied with the United Nations mandate. They have no forces in \nLebanon and yet they have continued to withstand attack after attack \nfrom Hezbollah.\n  We watched with sadness last year when Lebanon's former Prime \nMinister was assassinated by terrorists.\n  I think we have to put the blame where we believe it lies. We know \nIran and Syria are infiltrating Lebanon with support for Hezbollah and \nHamas.\n  We know Hezbollah and Hamas are committed to the destruction of \nIsrael. Since 1948 it has been forced to continually fight for its very \nexistence, and yet in the middle of this it has stood as a democratic \nform of government, with a free economy. Israel has never backed away \nfrom its fundamental commitment to freedom and human liberty.\n  So, Mr. President, I think this is something the United States Senate \nshould stand firm with this bipartisan resolution that says we do \nsupport our President and the G-8 leaders and condemn Hezbollah. We \nencourage the Government of Lebanon, to stop these attacks on Israel, \nand locate and return the soldiers who have been taken hostage. Let's \nadd our voice to that of the unified leaders of the world who are \nsaying this should not be allowed to happen.\n  We must speak together, we must stay together, we must support \nIsrael's right to self-defense and understand that they should have the \nsupport of a unified world community, saying to the terrorists and the \ngovernments that are supporting the terrorists--Hamas, Hezbollah, Iran, \nSyria supporting them--that the world is not going to sit by and let \npeople be terrorized. This is a global war on terror, and we must \nspeak.\n  I thank the distinguished Senator from Kansas for allowing me to \nspeak. I know I am speaking during the stem cell debate. The resolution \nwill be considered soon, and I wanted to speak on the floor because I \nthink it is so important what is happening in the world today, and we \nmust speak as a unified voice in the Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/07/17/senate-section/article/S7625-2", "month": "07", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7625-S7626]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          VISIT TO NEW ORLEANS\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I recently made a brief visit to New \nOrleans to see for myself where things stand now, not quite 11 months \nafter Hurricane Katrina hit the gulf coast. Katrina, of course, was the \nfirst of two major hurricanes to ravage that area last year. I only had \nthe chance to see a small part of the area hit by that first storm, but \nwhat I did see was striking.\n  The news reports cannot fully convey the devastation or the enormity \nof the problems the region faces in trying to put things back in \nworking order. One problem feeds into another. Businesses can't get \nback up and running without employees. Workers don't want to return \nwithout a safe place to live, without a school for their children, and \nwithout health care and other essential services upon which we all \nrely. Hospitals and other health providers face the same staffing \nshortages that businesses face. The neighborhood schools face \nchallenges both in the physical infrastructure--providing a safe place \nin which kids can learn--and staffing shortages. All of these issues \nmust be addressed.\n  Housing is an overarching challenge. I saw neighborhood after \nneighborhood still empty and unlivable. The outside shell of some homes \nwas still standing, but the inside was uninhabitable because of the \nflood of toxic liquid filth that soaked into those houses.\n  I also saw lots where homes had stood but where now there was nothing \nbut a slab of concrete. While many are living in the notorious FEMA \ntrailers, many others, I understand, are having a hard time getting \napproval for a trailer. I was pleased to learn a little bit more about \nthe so-called Katrina cottages that might be an alternative to the \ntrailers, and I look forward to learning still more about them.\n  So much still needs to be done that one can be overwhelmed by the \nsize of the task that remains. I have a great deal of respect for those \nwho have made the commitment to remain in or move back to the city, for \nthose who are working to make the neighborhoods habitable again, for \nthe State and local law enforcement, the National Guard, and all the \nother dedicated individuals who are working so hard to bring the region \nback.\n  I still have a lot to learn about the particulars of what is needed \nin New Orleans and the other areas ravaged by Hurricanes Katrina and \nRita--what is working, what has not worked, what Congress can still do \nto help. My central message today is that people from other parts of \nthe country should not think that the gulf coast has recovered from \nthose two hurricanes. That simply isn't the case. People are making \nprogress, but there is still a very long way to go.\n  To put it in perspective, I will compare it to another place I \nvisited earlier this year: Banda Aceh, Indonesia. I was there in \nFebruary, a little more\n\n[[Page S7626]]\n\nthan a year after it was devastated by the tsunami in late 2004. Having \nbeen to both places, I was struck by what the people in Banda Aceh and \nNew Orleans had in common, both because of what they went through and \nbecause of the incredible resilience they have shown in the wake of \nthose tragedies. But I was just as struck by how those places \ndiffered--especially how, in many ways, New Orleans seemed worse off \nthan Banda Aceh did a year after the disaster.\n  When I visited Banda Aceh in February 2006--a little over a year \nafter the original tsunami hit--though many of the reconstruction \nprograms had yet to be completed, there was visible progress being \nmade, thanks in large part to the generosity of the American taxpayer. \nI saw homes, roads, buildings, and bridges being built with funds that \nthe American Government generously gave to the victims of the tsunami.\n  I strongly support the aid we have given to those in Banda Aceh and \nothers who were the victims of the tsunami in 2004, and no one disputes \nthat we have responsibility to help them rebuild. But we cannot let the \ndisasters of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita be forgotten. We have a \nspecial duty to the people of the Gulf Coast who still need us. Almost \na year later, after more than 1,500 people were killed and countless \nlives were disrupted, our fellow Americans do still need us. We still \nneed to stand by them as they rebuild their lives, and I know the \npeople of Wisconsin stand ready to help.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/07/17/senate-section/article/S7626-1", "month": "07", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7626]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                 HONORING THE LIFE OF A GREAT COLORADAN\n\n Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I would like to recognize the life \nof Edward G. Eid, the head of the Colorado State Soccer Association, \nCSSA, who died recently while attending the World Cup soccer tournament \nin Munich, Germany.\n  Ed Eid passionately believed in the power of soccer to bring people \ntogether. He knew that the beautiful game, as we saw in this year's \nWorld Cup, can bridge national, linguistic, racial, economic, and \ncultural gaps.\n  Ed Eid used soccer to strengthen and bind communities in our State \nand across the globe. As a coach, he took a team to compete behind the \nIron Curtain, recognizing that shared passions for sport could warm a \nrelationship between superpowers. At CSSA he reached out to teams from \nimmigrant communities, helping kids from all walks of life learn the \ngame and participate in leagues.\n  When Ed Eid immigrated to the U.S. in 1958, soccer had not yet \nentered the American mainstream. The sport thrived in immigrant \ncommunities, but the U.S. had neither a professional league nor its own \nsoccer icons. After fighting through adversity and discrimination to \nbecome a successful entrepreneur, Eid dedicated more and more time to \nhelping the game he loved gain ground. Thanks to his efforts, and the \nefforts of other visionaries like him, soccer is the most widely played \ngame in America.\n  Mr. Eid is survived by a wonderful family. He was especially proud of \nhis two grandchildren, Alex and Emily Eid. Earlier this year he saw his \ndaughter-in-law, Allison, appointed by Governor Bill Owens to the \nColorado Supreme Court. And he saw his son, Troy, nominated by \nPresident Bush to be Colorado's next U.S. Attorney.\n  The legacy of Ed Eid's life is clear. In the soccer leagues of \nColorado, in all the communities he has touched, and in a sport whose \npopularity is growing by leaps and bounds, he will be sorely \nmissed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/07/17/senate-section/article/S7626-2", "month": "07", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7626]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                         ENROLLED BILLS SIGNED\n\n  At 7:37 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the Speaker \nhas signed the following enrolled bills:\n\n       S. 655.

A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to provide for \nthe expansion and improvement of traumatic brain injury programs, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, as we face the close of the 109th Congress \nin the coming months, I feel it is important that we reauthorize the \nTraumatic Brain Injury Act. It is my pleasure to introduce this \nreauthorization bill along with the ranking minority member of the \nSenate Health, Education, Labor, and Pension Committee, Senator Ted \nKennedy, with whom I worked on the original legislation over 10 years \nago. Our colleagues on the House side, Representatives Bill Pascrell, \nJr., and Todd Russell Platts, have just recently introduced a companion \nbill with the same goal of reauthorizing the TBI Act this year.\n  Sustaining a traumatic brain injury--or TBI--can be both catastrophic \nand devastating. The financial and emotional costs to the individual, \nfamily, and community are enormous. Traumatic brain injuries contribute \nto a substantial number of deaths and cases of permanent disability \nannually.\n  Of the 1.4 million who sustain a TBI each year in the United States: \n50,000 die; 235,000 are hospitalized; and 1.1 million are treated and \nreleased from an emergency department. Brain injuries are the most \nfrequent reasons for visits to physicians and emergency rooms.\n  These statistics are more revealing when one considers that every 16 \nseconds someone in the U.S. sustains a head injury; every 12 minutes, \none of these people will die and another will become permanently \ndisabled. Of those who survive, each year, an estimated 80,000 to \n90,000 people experience the onset of long-term disability associated \nwith a TBI. An additional 2,000 will exist in a persistent vegetative \nstate.\n  Even more startling is the fact that brain injury kills more \nAmericans under the age of 34 than all other causes combined and has \nclaimed more lives since the Turn of the Century than all United States \nwars combined. Sixty-eight percent of war veterans are returning home \nwith sustained brain injuries.\n  The distress of TBI is not limited to diagnosis. A survivor of a \nsevere brain injury typically faces 5 to 10 years of intensive services \nand estimated lifetime costs can exceed $4 million. Direct medical \ncosts and indirect costs such as lost productivity of TBI totaled an \nestimated $60 billion in the United States in 2000.\n  The Traumatic Brain Injury Act is the only Federal legislation \nspecifically addressing issues faced by 5.3 million American children \nand adults who live with a long-term disability as a result of \ntraumatic brain injury. Reauthorization of the Traumatic Brain Injury \nAct will provide for the continuation of research, not only for the \ntreatment of TBI but also for prevention and awareness programs which \nwill help decrease the occurrence of traumatic brain injury and improve \nthe long-term outcome.\n  In 2006, Congress has an opportunity to strengthen the TBI Act by \nauthorizing the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, CDC, to \ndetermine the incidence and prevalence of traumatic brain injury in the \ngeneral population of the United States, including all age groups and \npersons in institutional settings such as nursing homes, correctional \nfacilities, psychiatric hospitals, child care facilities, and \nresidential institutes for people with developmental disabilities.\n\n  This legislation authorizes the Health Resources and Services \nAdministration, HRSA, to make grants for projects of national \nsignificance that improve individual and family access to service \nsystems; assist states in developing service capacity; improve \nmonitoring and evaluation of rehabilitation services and supports; and \naddress emerging needs of servicemen and women, veterans, and \nindividuals and families who have experienced brain injury through \nservice delivery demonstration projects.\n  This bill also authorizes HRSA to include the American Indian \nConsortium as an eligible recipient of competitive grants awarded to \nStates, Territories, and the District of Columbia to develop \ncomprehensive system of services and supports nationwide.\n  Furthermore, this bill instructs HRSA and the Administration on \nDevelopmental Disabilities to coordinate data collection regarding \nprotection and advocacy services.\n  The TBI Act offers balanced and coordinated public policy in brain \ninjury prevention, research, education, and community-based services \nand supports for individuals living with traumatic brain injury and \ntheir families.\n  Mr. President, reauthorization of the Traumatic Brain Injury Act will \nfurther provide mechanisms for the prevention, treatment and the \nimprovement of the quality of life for those Americans and their \nfamilies who may sustain such a devastating disability. I ask my \ncolleagues' support in promptly reauthorizing the Traumatic Brain \nInjury Act.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, today I am proud to join with Senator \nHatch in sponsoring the reauthorization of the Traumatic Brain Injury \nAct. This\n\n[[Page S7630]]\n\nbill will provide valuable assistance to the millions of children and \nadults in our nation who are facing an array of problems because of \ntheir injuries.\n  First, it is critical for us to acknowledge the important role which \nthe programs authorized under this bill can play for the large number \nof soldiers wounded in the war. As of June 2006--almost 19,000 service \nmembers have been wounded in Iraq and data continue to demonstrate that \nbrain injuries are approximately two-thirds of the injuries suffered in \nthe war.\n  On top of that, there is an extremely high incidence of traumatic \nbrain injuries among children between birth and age 14--approximately \n475,000 a year--and some of the highest numbers of injuries are among \nchildren under the age of five.\n  Soldiers and children--I cannot think of groups more deserving of our \nattention.\n  Reauthorization of the TBI Act is crucial to continued federal \nfunding for a range of traumatic brain injury programs. The bill will \nreauthorize grants that have provided vital assistance to States, \nTerritories, the District of Columbia, and American Indian Consortia in \nbuilding or enhancing coordinated systems of community-based services \nand supports for children and adults with traumatic brain injuries.\n  In addition, when Congress first authorized the Traumatic Brain \nInjury Act as part of the Children's Health Act of 2000, it had the \nforesight to include funding for the Protection and Advocacy for \nIndividuals with Traumatic Brain Injury Program. This program has \nplayed a crucial role because individuals with traumatic brain injury \nhave help in returning to work, finding a place to live, accessing \nneeded supports and services such as attendant care and assistive \ntechnology, and obtaining appropriate mental health, substance abuse, \nand rehabilitation services. Often those with brain injuries--including \nour returning veterans--are forced to remain in extremely expensive \ninstitutional settings far longer than necessary because the community-\nbased supports and services they need are not available. Effective \nprotection and advocacy services for people with traumatic brain injury \ncan lead both to reduced Government expenditures and increased \nproductivity, independence and community integration for patients. \nHowever, those who advocate for the injured must possess specialized \nskills and the work is often time-intensive.\n  This legislation also provides funding for critical CDC programs that \nprovide extremely important surveillance and injury prevention \ninformation.\n  In a time when both the administration and Congress are searching for \nprograms that provide the right kind of ``bang for the Federal buck,'' \nthe recent findings in an Institute of Medicine March 2006 report show \nthat the TBI programs work. Last year the various programs in the TBI \nbill were funded for a total of only $12 million--yet look at the good \nthey do. Not only should these programs be reauthorized, the funding \nalso should be increased.\n  The IOM calls the TBI programs an ``overall success,'' stating that \n``there is considerable value in providing funding,'' and ``it is \nworrisome that the modestly budgeted HRSA TBI Program continues to be \nvulnerable to budget cuts.'' As the IOM study suggests, this program \nmust be continued and allowed to grow in order to ensure that each \nstate has the resources necessary to maintain critical services and \nadvocacy for the estimated 5.3 million people currently living with \ndisabilities resulting from brain injury.\n  Again, soldiers and children, I cannot think of two more deserving \ngroups of people in our Nation. We owe them the services and advocacy \nthat these critical programs offer. And I urge our colleagues to \nsupport the passage of this important piece of bipartisan disability \nlegislation this year.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GRASSLEY:\n  S. 3676. A bill to amend the Congressional Accountability Act of 1995 \nto apply whistleblower protections available to certain executive \nbranch employees to legislative branch employees, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental \nAffairs.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise today to announce that I am \nintroducing a bill that will extend whistleblower protections currently \navailable to certain executive branch employees to legislative branch \nemployees.\n  This bill is long overdue. The Office of Compliance has called for \nthese changes on numerous occasions in recent years, and they are very \nsupportive of this bill.\n  I have fought for whistleblowers for many years. Whistleblowers are \nthe key to exposing a dysfunctional bureaucracy. Government agencies \ntoo often want to cover up their mistakes. Without insiders being brave \nenough to uncover these violations or waste, the American taxpayer \nwould continue to pay for them. These people should not be punished for \nbringing the misdeeds to light.\n  Whistleblowers in the executive branch have helped me do my job of \noversight. We have done a good job to make sure that whistleblowers in \nthe executive branch are protected. It is simply not fair, nor is it \ngood governance for Congress to enact whistleblower protections on the \nother branches of Government without giving its own employees the same \nconsideration. This bill merely extends those same protections that \nother Government employees enjoy to Congress's own employees.\n  I fully back hard-working Government employees who serve to protect \nour country, and I hope my colleagues will join me. Congress needs to \nmake sure that its own employees can speak up without retaliation when \nthey blow the whistle on fraud, waste, or abuse.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be \nprinted in the record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3676\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend title XVIII on the Social Security Act to \neliminate the in the home restriction for Medicare coverage of mobility \ndevices for individuals with expected long-term needs; to the Committee \non Finance.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Medicare \nIndependent Living Act of 2006 with Senators Santorum, Murray, Collins, \nAkaka, Jeffords, Kerry, Harkin, Kennedy, and Lieberman. This \nlegislation would eliminate Medicare's ``in the home'' restriction for \nthe coverage of mobility devices, including wheelchairs and scooters, \nfor those with disabilities and expected long-term needs. This includes \npeople with multiple sclerosis, paraglegia, osteoarthritis, and \ncerebrovascular disease that includes acute stroke and conditions like \naneurysms.\n  As currently interpreted by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid \nServices, CMS, the ``in the home'' restriction prevents beneficiaries \nfrom obtaining wheelchairs that are necessary for use outside the home. \nThis precludes beneficiaries who need a wheelchair to access work, the \ncommunity at-large, his or her place of worship, school, physician's \noffices, or pharmacies.\n  On July 13, 2005, 34 senators wrote Secretary Leavitt asking the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services, or HHS, to modify the ``in the \nhome'' requirement so as to ``improve community access for Medicare \nbeneficiaries with mobility impairments.''\n  Unfortunately, CMS continues to impose the ``in the home'' \nrestriction on Medicare beneficiaries in need of mobility devices. The \nresult is that people who may not need a wheelchair to get around their \nhouse but do need one to get around their communities, such as to a \njob, church, or the grocery store, can't get Medicare to pay for one. \nAs the Medicare Rights Center in a report entitled ``Forced Isolation: \nMedicare's `In The home' Coverage Standards for Wheelchairs'' in March \n2004 notes, ``This effectively disqualifies you from leaving your home \nwithout the assistance of others.''\n  Furthermore, in a Kansas City Star article dated July 3, 2005, Mike \nOxford with the National Council on Independent Living noted, ``You \nlook at mobility assistance as a way to liberate yourself.'' He added \nthat the restriction ``is just backward.''\n  In fact, policies such as these are not only backward but directly \ncontradict numerous initiatives aimed at increasing community \nintegration of people with disabilities, including the Americans with \nDisabilities Act, the Ticket-to-Work Program, the New Freedom \nInitiative, and the Olmstead Supreme Court decision.\n  According to the Medicare Rights Center update dated March 23, 2006, \n``This results in arbitrary denials. People with apartments too small \nfor a power wheelchair are denied a device that could also get them \ndown the street. Those in more spacious quarters get coverage, allowing \nthem to scoot from room to room and to the grocery store. People who \nsummon all their willpower and strength to hobble around a small \napartment get no help for talks that are beyond them and their front \ndoor.''\n  In New Mexico, I have heard this complaint about the law repeatedly \nfrom our State's most vulnerable disabled and senior citizens. People \nargue the provision is being misinterpreted by the administration and \nresults in Medicare beneficiaries being trapped in their home.\n  The ITEM Coalition adds in a letter to CMS on this issue in November \n25, 2005, ``There continues to be no clinical basis for the `in the \nhome' restriction and by asking treating practioners to document \nmedical need only within the home setting, CMS is severely restricting \npatients from receiving the most appropriate devices to meet their \nmobility needs.''\n  Therefore, our bipartisan legislation would clarify that this \nrestriction does not apply to mobility devices, including wheelchairs, \nfor people with disabilities in the Medicare Program. The language \nchange is fairly simple and simply clarifies that the ``in the home'' \nrestriction for durable medical equipment does not apply in the case of \nmobility devices needed by Medicare beneficiaries with expected long-\nterm needs for use ``in customary settings such as normal domestic, \nvocational, and community activities.''\n  This legislation is certainly not intended to discourage CMS from \ndedicating its resources to reducing waste, fraud, and abuse in the \nMedicare system, as those efforts are critical to ensuring that \nMedicare remains financially viable and strong in the future. However, \nit should be noted that neither Medicaid nor the Department of Veterans \nAffairs impose such ``in the home'' restrictions on mobility devices. \nAs Senator Brownback said to the Kansas City Star, it is important to \nlift the restriction ``to reflect our goal of ensuring that Americans \nwith disabilities are able to live independent, healthy, and productive \nlives.''\n  I thank Senators Santorum, Murray, Collins, Akaka, Jeffords, Kerry, \nHarkin, Kennedy, and Lieberman for cosponsoring this important \nlegislation, and attached is a fact sheet that I request to be printed \nin the Record. I would also ask unanimous consent to have printed in \nthe Record copies of the letter to the administration and the response \nthat was received by Capitol Hill.\n  There being no objection, the additional material was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 13, 2005.\n     Re reconsideration of the Medicare ``In the Home'' \n         requirement on wheelchair coverage.\n\n     Hon. Michael O. Leavitt,\n     Secretary, Department of Health and Human Services, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Secretary Leavitt: The undersigned members write to \n     request that you modify the ``in the home'' requirement in \n     Medicare's wheeled mobility benefit to improve community \n     access for Medicare beneficiaries with mobility impairments.\n       We commend CMS for its dedication to reducing waste, fraud \n     and abuse in the Medicare system, particularly under the \n     mobility device benefit, and fully support your intention to \n     protect precious Medicare funds and resources. Additionally, \n     we commend the agency for recently taking on the task of \n     creating a new and, hopefully, more appropriate Medicare \n     coverage criteria for mobility devices. However, we are \n     concerned that CMS' current interpretation of the ``in the \n     home'' requirement may continue to act as an inappropriate \n     restriction in meeting the real-life mobility needs of \n     Medicare beneficiaries with physical disabilities and \n     mobility impairments.\n       Recently CMS announced a final National Coverage \n     Determination (NCD) for mobility assistance equipment (MAE) \n     that fails to adequately address the concerns of \n     beneficiaries and other parties with the ``in the home'' \n     restriction.\n       In order to ensure that the ``in the home'' requirement \n     does not act as a barrier to community participation for \n     Medicare beneficiaries with disabilities and mobility \n     impairments; we ask that you modify this requirement through \n     the regulatory process. Additionally, if your agency \n     concludes that the ``in the home'' requirement cannot be \n     addressed through the regulatory process, we request that you \n     respond with such information as quickly as possible, so that \n     Congress may begin examining legislative alternatives.\n\n[[Page S7632]]\n\n       We thank you for your consideration of this matter.\n           Sincerely,\n         Jeff Bingaman, Rick Santorum, John Kerry, Joseph I. \n           Lieberman, Barbara Mikulski, Maria Cantwell, Edward M. \n           Kennedy, Patty Murray, Evan Bayh, Mark Dayton, Jack \n           Reed, Johnny Isakson, Sam Brownback, Jon S.

Charles F. Bass,\n     House of Representatives,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Bass: Thank you for your letter regarding the ``in \n     the home'' requirement for Mobility Assistive Equipment \n     (MAE).\n       The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) is \n     required to follow section 1861(n) of the Social Security Act \n     (the Act) which states ``the term `durable medical equipment' \n     includes iron lungs, oxygen tents, hospital beds, and \n     wheelchairs (which may include a power-operated vehicle that \n     may be appropriately used as a wheelchair, but only where the \n     use of such a vehicle is determined to be necessary on the \n     basis of the individual's medical and physical condition and \n     the vehicle meets such safety requirements as the Secretary \n     may prescribe) used in the patient's home (including an \n     institution used as his home other than an institution that \n     meets the requirements of subsection (e)(1) of this section \n     or section 1819(a)(1)), whether furnished on a rental basis \n     or purchased. . . .'' CMS further defined the durable medical \n     equipment (DME) benefit category at 42 CFR section 414.202 to \n     include equipment that can (a) withstand repeated use, (b) is \n     primarily and customarily used to serve a medical purpose, \n     (c) is not generally useful in the absence of illness or \n     injury, and (d) is appropriate for use in the home.\n       There are two practical requirements that must be satisfied \n     for coverage of DME which are a logical resu1t of the \n     definition of DME:\n       (1) The equipment must be appropriate for use in the home. \n     This requirement excludes a gasoline-powered vehicle, for \n     example.\n       (2) The patient must have a need to use the equipment in \n     the home. This requirement excludes equipment that is only \n     necessary for use outside the patient's home.\n       Therefore, we do not cover equipment if it is exclusively \n     needed outside of the home. However, if DME is needed in the \n     home and the beneficiary also uses it outside the home, the \n     equipment would still be covered. For example, a high \n     strength wheelchair may be covered when appropriate for home \n     use even though it may also be useful outside the home. We do \n     not have any restrictions on the use of the equipment outside \n     of the home as long as there is also a need to use it in the \n     home.\n       I hope this information has been helpful. Please call me if \n     you have any further thoughts or questions. I will also \n     provide this response to the cosigners of your letter.\n           Sincerely,\n     Michael O.

Short Title.\n       This title may be cited as the ``Border Law Enforcement \n     Relief Act of 2006''.\n       Sec. 902. Findings.\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) It is the obligation of the Federal Government of the \n     United States to adequately secure the Nation's borders and \n     prevent the flow of undocumented persons and illegal drugs \n     into the United States.\n       (2) Despite the fact that the United States Border Patrol \n     apprehends over 1,000,000 people each year trying to \n     illegally enter the United States, according to the \n     Congressional Research Service, the net growth in the number \n     of unauthorized aliens has increased by approximately 500,000 \n     each year. The Southwest border accounts for approximately 94 \n     percent of all migrant apprehensions each year. Currently, \n     there are an estimated 11,000,000 unauthorized aliens in the \n     United States.\n       (3) The border region is also a major corridor for the \n     shipment of drugs. According to the El Paso Intelligence \n     Center, 65 percent of the narcotics that are sold in the \n     markets of the United States enter the country through the \n     Southwest Border.\n       (4) Border communities continue to incur significant costs \n     due to the lack of adequate border security. A 2001 study by \n     the United States-Mexico Border Counties Coalition found that \n     law enforcement and criminal justice expenses associated with \n     illegal immigration exceed $89,000,000 annually for the \n     Southwest border counties.\n       (5) In August 2005, the States of New Mexico and Arizona \n     declared states of emergency in order to provide local law \n     enforcement immediate assistance in addressing criminal \n     activity along the Southwest border.\n       (6) While the Federal Government provides States and \n     localities assistance in covering costs related to the \n     detention of certain criminal aliens and the prosecution of \n     Federal drug cases, local law enforcement along the border \n     are provided no assistance in covering such expenses and must \n     use their limited resources to combat drug trafficking, human \n     smuggling, kidnappings, the destruction of private property, \n     and other border-related crimes.\n       (7) The United States shares 5,525 miles of border with \n     Canada and 1,989 miles with Mexico. Many of the local law \n     enforcement agencies located along the border are small, \n     rural departments charged with patrolling large areas of \n     land. Counties along the Southwest United States-Mexico \n     border are some of the poorest in the country and lack the \n     financial resources to cover the additional costs associated \n     with illegal immigration, drug trafficking, and other border-\n     related crimes.\n       (8) Federal assistance is required to help local law \n     enforcement operating along the border address the unique \n     challenges that arise as a result of their proximity to an \n     international border and the lack of overall border security \n     in the region.\n       Sec. 903. Border Relief Grant Program.
