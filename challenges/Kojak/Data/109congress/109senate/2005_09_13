Mr. President, later today, several of our Senate \ncolleagues and I will have the honor of hosting interim Iraqi President \nJalal Talabani and members of his cabinet in the U.S. Capitol. \nPresident Talabani was elected in April of this year. Since then, we \nhave seen the Iraqis form their first democratically elected Government \nin over half a century. We have also witnessed complex and painstaking \nnegotiations to draft a permanent Iraqi constitution. That historic \ndocument, that hopeful document, will be put to the people October 15, \nwhich is one short month away.\n  The draft Iraqi constitution is a solid foundation for a democratic \nIraq. It establishes a true democracy, a democratic system in which the \nvoice of all Iraqis will be heard, human rights will be protected, the \nrule of law will be respected, and women will be full and equal \npolitical partners. It is a product of deliberate negotiations that \nincluded letters from all of Iraq's ethnic and religious groups. The \nprocess required enormous patience and flexibility--in other words, the \ntools of the democratic process--and it required great courage.\n  In the face of constant terrorist threats and violence, the Iraqi \npeople showed once again their determination to secure their rights and \ntheir future as a free and democratic nation. Garnering support for the \nnew constitution is now one of President Talabani's most pressing \ntasks. In our meeting today, I will urge President Talabani to continue \nhis efforts to reach out to all segments of Iraq's diverse population. \nIt is vital that Iraqis of all walks of life participate in this \nreferendum next month.\n\n  It is also vital that the Sunni population rally behind this \nconstitution and the framework of democracy and the governance it \nestablishes. The Sunnis have raised concerns about federalism, about \nthe role of Sharia law, and the allocation of oil revenues. These are \nall important issues that concern all of us as well.\n  I look forward to hearing President Talabani's response in our \ndiscussions today. I also look forward to learning more from the \nPresident about conditions on the ground, his views on the security \nsituation, the training and equipping of Iraqi security forces, and the \npace of economic reconstruction and revitalization. I will report back \nto this body either later today or tomorrow what I learned.\n  In the meantime, I urge my Senate colleagues to continue to support \nthe democratic aspirations of the Iraqi\n\n[[Page S9944]]\n\npeople in their efforts to secure their liberty and to fulfill their \ndemocratic potential. This is an extraordinary opportunity to change \nthe course of history and bring peace and stability to the heart of the \nMiddle East. The challenge is great, but we must persevere. America's \nsecurity will depend on it. We cannot allow the terrorists to achieve \ntheir twisted aims and we cannot allow Iraq to fall into chaos or \nsectarian violence or return to those days of brutal tyranny and \nsupport for the terrorists.\n  By the same token, Iraqis must continue to persevere as well. They \nmust defeat the terrorists. They must deny them sanctuary in their \ncommunities. They must reject their heinous philosophy of murder.\n  Freedom for Iraq is essential for freedom at home, and that is why we \nmust continue to stand alongside our Iraqi partners. Over time, we will \nstep aside as they assume complete responsibility for their security \nand for their future.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Could I inquire, is the leader prepared to speak or could I \ngo ahead and make some remarks?\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senate is in a period for morning \nbusiness. The majority is in control of the first half of the time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/13/senate-section/article/S9944-1", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9944-S9945]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 IN THE AFTERMATH OF HURRICANE KATRINA\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I observe that the President pro tempore of \nthe Senate is looking quite spiffy this morning in his bow tie.\n  At this point in my life, any ray of light and happiness is welcomed. \nI will take a few minutes to sort of bring up to date my feelings about \nwhat is happening in the aftermath of Katrina.\n  I want my colleagues to know that there are some positive \ndevelopments. It is hard to know that or decipher that if one listens \nto the media and the negative things. I admit it is not a perfect \nsituation, but each day a little progress is being made.\n  My staff and I are staying in touch with mayors, supervisors, State \nofficials, and volunteer organizations, and we do feel we are making \nsome headway. I again want to emphasize, though, this is an \noverwhelming disaster that is in many ways too much for human beings to \ncomprehend or contend with. It is going to take time, patience, \ndiligence, effort, and, yes, money, that we must count on from \nvoluntary contributions and the Federal Government.\n  I do think we are making some progress. Right now the biggest problem \nis probably temporary housing. After disasters, there are always \nstages. There is the immediate aftermath where people are trying to get \ninto the devastated area, trying to save lives, then trying to get \nbasics such as water, food, generators, and gasoline. Then there is the \nmove into the early cleanup and the need for temporary housing. We are \nkind of in that phase.\n  It is very hard to deal with the logistics of moving temporary \nhousing, whether it is ships or trailers, into the area to be staged to \nmove individuals. That takes time. It is very difficult. It happens \nafter every hurricane and probably after every disaster. If we are \nlooking for a place where we need to find a way to move fast and do a \nbetter job, emergency housing is probably one of those we should focus \non.\n  I want to thank my colleagues again on both sides of the aisle for \ntheir letters, their calls, their expressions of concern and sympathy. \nBeyond that, I want to thank Senators who have taken personal action, \nthings one would never have dreamed of, such as the Senator from \nAlaska, who has made a very generous offer. We needed tetanus shots. \nThe Senator from New Jersey, Mr. Corzine, helped us get the tetanus \nshots we needed. I could go through the entire Chamber and name \nRepublicans and Democrats, people from all over America, who have taken \nhelpful actions.\n\n  At least once a week, I want to come to the floor and speak briefly \nabout the good things. There will be plenty of time to try to find a \nway to make things better in the future. I do hope the Senate will not \npass a series of rifleshot pieces of legislation, well intentioned and \nneeded quickly--we need that--but I hope we will look at a broader \nrecovery effort, something that will make sure the area does not just \nrecover and rebuild and get the economy growing but we do it in a way \nthat will be magnificent for the people, the area, and the country. We \ncan learn from this for other parts of the country when disasters hit.\n  We have the immediate problem, we have the short-term needs, and we \nhave the long-term needs that we need to think about a little bit. It \nis hard to be patient when you are flat on your back. But I do think, \nbefore we start setting up commissions to do this, a czar to do that, \nrebuilding authority to supervise something else, let's think those \nthrough carefully first. I am counting on my colleagues in the Senate, \nthe committee chairmen particularly, to think about that. But also we \nhave to make sure our leadership pulls us together and we coordinate \nour efforts.\n  I want to focus on two areas without which we could not have made it. \nOne is the military. We know how valuable our men and women in uniform \nare. But we couldn't have made it without the Coast Guard, without the \nNational Guard, without the 82nd Airborne, without General Honore, and \nwithout Thad Allen, Coast Guard Chief of Staff now in charge of \nrecovery in Louisiana and Mississippi, without the thousands of troops \nwho came in, restored order, and started cutting through the debris and \nproviding help, the Seabees out of Gulfport, MS. By the time we got to \nthe end of the first week, we had a battalion in every county in \nMississippi.\n  They were doing their work. Nobody was directing them. They found a \nproblem and they got it done. So let's not have any thought by Active-\nDuty military personnel, or anybody, that we should not think about our \nNational Guard in terms of disaster assistance and to make sure they \nhave the equipment to cut through and get through and deliver the \nsupplies we need. When I flew over New Orleans 10 days ago, it was like \na war zone. We had helicopters coming through with triaged patients. We \nhad helicopters with water buckets. We had helicopters dropping food. \nWe had helicopters picking up people. It was magnificent and marvelous.\n  Before this is over, I will have a long list of individual stories \nabout the military and particular units that went beyond the call of \nduty.\n  Some people are saying the Federal Government has not done this or \nthe Federal Government has not done that. Let me say when the National \nGuard and our military arrive on the scene, things change. We could not \nhave made it without them, period. People would have died, many people \nwould have died were it not for the Coast Guard and National Guard and \nour regular military. We have turned to our Navy, every one of our \nbranches. Keesler Air Force Base has been a major staging center and \nhelped thousands of people.\n  The other area I want to acknowledge, once again, is the incredible \nhuman kindness and initiative of individuals, volunteers, faith-based \ngroups of all kinds, and charitable groups. I told the story last week \nabout a group of men who came from Burke, FL, with a Bobcat and a \nfront-end loader. They showed up at my yard and said: Can we help? I \nasked them where they were from. I think they were from a church in \nBurke, FL. I didn't get their names. There was too much going on. I \nsaid: Could you please clear the road in that area so we can get trucks \nand equipment in there? Can you help that lady get into her house \nbecause you couldn't even get in to see what was left.\n  They went to work. I saw them off and on all day. I never talked with \nthem again. They just went to work. Through voluntarism, people have \nshown up with generators and chain saws and said: Where can I help? \nFrom all over the region--from all over America. I know personally of \nseveral churches. I will not start by denomination, but let me say \ngroups of all faiths and denominations, Protestant, Catholic, Jewish, \nand probably Muslim, too. They all went to work.\n  One I am particularly aware of was Christ United Methodist in \nJackson,\n\n[[Page S9945]]\n\nMS. They formed an organization, inspired, I think, by the wife of \nCongressman Chip Pickering. They started bringing in supplies. They got \npeople organized from all different denominations. They sorted the \ngifts, they boxed them, they labeled them, and they sent out two 18-\nwheelers a day. Nobody told them where to go. They said: What do you \nneed? And they sent it.\n  That story has been replicated over and over again. So there are \nheroes--individuals, first responders, military, people who just showed \nup and went to work, church-related groups. If it were not for the \nvolunteers, the church-related groups, Red Cross and Salvation Army, I \ndon't know where we would be.\n  Maybe that is the way it should be. This is still America. It is \nindividual Americans who respond to every crisis and will do whatever \nneeds to be done, will pay any price. I want the record to show there \nare a lot of people who have contributed so much personally. They have \ncried with us, they sweated with us, they bled with us, and they are \ndoing it now on the ground in Pascagoula, MS, Biloxi, Gulfport, Pass \nChristian, Long Beach, Bay St. Louis and Waveland and towns in the \nhinterland throughout Louisiana.\n  I thank all those who have come to our aid. It is not over yet. Keep \nit coming.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. LOTT. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. WARNER. I am going to follow on with some greater detail about, \nas you say, the extraordinary participation of the men and women of the \nArmed Forces and, indeed, the Coast Guard, which is separate from my \nreport that will be included with others today.\n  It is very important that you addressed the Senate this morning. If I \nmay say, I have been privileged to serve with you nearly a quarter of a \ncentury in this institution. I commend you for your personal courage. \nYou have faced adversity such as few of us have ever experienced. \nThroughout this year, there has been personal tragedy--loss of your \nmother, loss of your house--yet we see the leadership you have \nprovided, indeed, as has our President and this institution and others \nin the face of this hurricane.\n  The Armed Services Committee is starting its briefing this morning. \nTwo reports come from the Department of Defense to the Congress \neveryday, giving a detailed analysis with regard to the deployment of \nour troops. I left the briefing to come speak to the Senate this \nmorning. We will be changing the force structure to meet the needs. For \nexample, in all probability, the carrier can now move out, if it has \nfulfilled its mission. Frankly, as distressing as it is, there are \ntremendous assets connected with mortuary responsibilities which are \nnow being moved in by the Department.\n  I want to thank our colleague. I know the Presiding Officer, the \nPresident pro tempore of the Senate, shares these feelings with every \nMember of this body. We salute you and your family.\n  Mr. LOTT. If the Senator will yield, I do appreciate his very kind \nremarks. I hope he will convey for me and the people of my State, and I \nam sure Louisiana and Alabama, too, to the military officers with whom \nyou will be speaking, how much we appreciate what they have done. I \ndon't know the numbers but it is thousands, maybe as many as 40,000 \nNational Guardsmen. I flew in a Blackhawk helicopter a week or so ago--\nthey were from New York; and I know they are there from Nebraska and \nArkansas and all over America, literally. And of course the Active-Duty \npersonnel. But the Coast Guard is a separate story. The Coast Guard, \nbefore, during, and after the hurricane, saved thousands of lives. When \nit was over, they didn't quit. But there are so many other things they \nhave done. Channels have been cleared so we can get ships in. My \nhometown, it is navigable into our industrial site where we have a \nwater refinery.\n  The USS Comfort is providing now for our medical needs and providing \na bed to sleep in for first responders and food for people who haven't \nhad a good meal in quite some time. They came in early. I could go down \nthe list.\n  Once again, we have learned that our military is not just about \nfighting, preserving peace, and our interests around the world. They \nare there in disasters, man made and natural, in a way that nobody else \ncould be.\n  The attitude of our men and women and the professionalism of the \nofficers I met with was so impressive. I flew into the command center \nat Gulfport, MS. The National Guard was in command there. A three-star \nGeneral from Alabama was there. The Alabamians were there right after \nthe Mississippians got there because it took 7 hours to get to the \nscene because you had to cut through the pine trees on Highway 49 to \nget there. It took them 7 hours to get less than 90 miles.\n  I could go on and on, but the record needs to reveal the tremendous \njob that has been done, how important they are, as they work with us as \nwe transition into different needs.\n  I thank the Senator for his comments about my own personal situation. \nIn life you get a lot of trials. It is very hard. But what is the \nhardest is to see how these people now are still suffering in heat and \ndebris. There are so many needs, and we can't get the help there fast \nenough. This is the time to try men's souls, but will make you stronger \nand better in the end.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, our distinguished colleague has stood the \ntest----\n  Mr. LOTT. Thank you.\n  Mr. WARNER.--you and your fellow Senators from the three States most \ngrievously affected. If you wait a minute, I will give you the \nfollowing figures. Today, more than 72,000 members of the Armed Forces \nhave been deployed to the Gulf Coast, including 22,439 Active-Duty and \nmore than 45,871 members of the National Guard--of which over 400 come \nfrom my State, I say to the Senator. I went down Friday in my State to \nprepare one of the bases to receive the evacuees. But every single \nState in our Union, including the territories, has contributed their \nGuard in response to the needs of your community.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/13/senate-section/article/S9945-1", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9945-S9947]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    ARMED FORCES RESPONSE TO KATRINA\n\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank the distinguished Presiding Officer. Mr. \nPresident, I would first like to say, as I mentioned, we receive a \nreport everyday in the Senate from the Department of Defense regarding \nspecifically the Guard and Active-Duty. Then, in addition, we receive a \nreport from the Corps of Engineers. Our committee is a repository of \nthese reports, but I am happy to share them with any Senators who so \ndesire. They need only contact the Armed Services Committee or me \npersonally, and I will see they are provided with the reports.\n  I join Senator Lott and others in expressing our profound gratitude \nand pride to the men and women of the Armed Forces and indeed their \nfamilies who are left at home for their service, responding with \ncourage and untiring professionalism and compassion to our fellow \ncitizens who fell victim to this tragic disaster.\n  As you know, our military has a supporting role in the effort. I \nunderline ``supporting role'' because in no way do we mean to displace \nthe valiant efforts of those on the scene, the first responders, such \nthat were able to muster their forces and respond.\n  I wish to pay tribute to the magnificent response of all. I have \nstated the numbers a minute ago.\n  Furthermore, I wish to highlight that the National Guard forces are \nmeeting the challenge, as well as the national commitments--Afghanistan \nand Iraq. Once again, our Guard is--I don't like to use the word \n``stressed,'' but they are challenged. I have spoken with General Blum, \nwho is the Commander of the National Guard. He never once flinched when \nhe said we are doing the job and we are going to succeed. Our hats are \noff to the National Guard. The Navy deployed 20 ships, including the \nUSS Harry S Truman--it is an aircraft carrier. I remember when that \nship was named--the USS Whidbey Island and the USS Iwo Jima and the \nUSNS Comfort, the hospital ship. More than 400 aircraft, including 373 \nhelicopters and 93 airplanes, are in support of search and rescue, \nmedical evacuation, and logistical supply missions.\n  The heroism of those who pilot those helicopters and the crews who go \ndown and rescue the individuals--those chapters in our history will be \nrecorded for\n\n[[Page S9946]]\n\nposterity. They are absolutely magnificent. We have seen a tremendous \nresponse from our rotary and fixed-wing pilots.\n  Again, to date, the Active-Duty Forces have flown more than 2,783 \nsorties and the National Guard has flown more than 9,240 sorties. These \nsorties resulted in the evacuation of more than 80,000 people and the \nrescue of more than 15,000 people.\n  Additionally, more than 1,200 beds are available in field hospitals, \nand seven military installations are providing support as \ntransportation staging areas as ice, water, food, and medical supplies \nas they became available.\n  Stop and think. In our daily lives, we go to our refrigerators and \nthere is ice. Ice is something that is badly needed in these high \ntemperatures. I specifically put it in because I watched, as almost \nevery American has watched, as these individuals in their own quiet way \nask for certain things. I was particularly struck by the need for ice \nand fresh water.\n  The amount of humanitarian support provided to the region is \nastounding. More than 16 million meals-ready-to-eat--the old MRE or \nmilitary meals--44 million liters of water, and more than 175 million \npounds of ice have been delivered to date.\n  The Army Corps of Engineers has 39 of its 137 permanent pumps \noperating throughout New Orleans, with an additional 46 military pumps \noperating at a lower capacity.\n  I understand the water level in New Orleans is dropping more than 1 \nfoot per day. They have removed 94,000 cubic yards of debris and opened \nthe Mississippi River to shallow draft traffic and deep vessels less \nthan 39 feet.\n  As indicated by the tremendous support I have outlined, it is clear \nthat the deep magnitude and devastation of Hurricane Katrina has \nresulted in an unprecedented response from the Department of Defense.\n  I want to say first that I do not wish to take away anything from the \nDOD or the dedicated men and women who have responded to the \ndevastation caused by Hurricane Katrina--as it is, without question, a \ncatastrophe without parallel in modern American history, and of a \nmagnitude not seen in my lifetime. However, as many of our colleagues \nknow--and as chairman of the Armed Services Committee--I am deeply \nconcerned that the Department of Defense and our President have \nauthorities to correct standby authorities in permanent law which they \nneed to manage disasters.\n  Shortly I will engage in a colloquy, hopefully, with my distinguished \nchairman of the Homeland Defense Committee on the subject of what we \nshould do in the future to look at the framework of laws and standby \nauthorities to determine how better--I repeat, how better--not to fault \nthose who performed in this catastrophe, but how best the totality of \nall the resources of our Nation can be brought to bear should we ever \nhave the misfortune of another natural disaster or, indeed, a terrorist \nact of the magnitude that we witnessed.\n  When I was privileged to assume chairmanship of the Armed Services \nCommittee--before 9/11, I point out--our committee established a \nsubcommittee called Emerging Threats. The function of that subcommittee \nhas, is, and will be to look into the future to determine how best to \nprepare, primarily in our case, for a terrorist attack against our \nNation. But those preparations can easily be directed toward a natural \ndisaster, should it occur. I am very proud of the accomplishments of \nthat subcommittee in the years I have been privileged to be chairman. \nBut I believe the time has come that we reflect on the Posse Comitatus \nAct and other statutes which have stood by and served this Nation quite \nwell in years past.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nadditional documentation.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n      DOD Support for Hurricane Katrina Relief: Executive Summary\n\n\n                          Command and Control\n\n       U.S. Northern Command Commander is Admiral Keating in \n     Colorado Springs, Colorado.\n       Joint Task Force Katrina East (Forward) is located at Camp \n     Shelby, Mississippi--Lieutenant General Honore is on the USS \n     Iwo Jima pier side in New Orleans, Louisiana.\n       Joint Task Force Commander for the Louisiana National Guard \n     is Major General Landreneau, at New Orleans.\n       Joint Task Force Commander for the Mississippi National \n     Guard is Major General, Cross, at Stennis Space Center, \n     Mississippi\n\n\n                         Operational Highlights\n\n       72,614 Active Duty and National Guard personnel are on the \n     ground or aboard ships supporting relief operations:\n       22,439 Active Duty\n       1,895 Reserves (573 Marine Corps, 53 Army, 450 Air Force, \n     819 Navy)\n       45,871 National Guard (2,409 outside area ready to assist)\n       19 U.S. Navy ships are in the area.\n       Total aviation support in area:\n       346 helicopters (Active Duty and National Guard).\n       68 airplanes (Active Duty and National Guard).\n       DoD has provided extensive search and rescue, evacuation, \n     and medical support:\n       2,783 Active Duty sorties flown--123 in the past 24-hours.\n       9,240 National Guard sorties flown--136 in the past 24 \n     hours.\n       Total DoD medical personnel in the area is 2,037 (1072 \n     Active Duty and 965 National Guard).

Mr. President, as we face an uncertain future as it \nrelates to terrorism and the use of weapons of mass destruction, I have \nsome thoughts with regard to this law which was passed in 1878 which \nrestricts in certain ways--and the predicate for doing so is wise--men \nand women of the Armed Forces--that is, a permanent U.S. military as \nopposed to National Guard--in matters relating to law enforcement.\n  Traditionally, that has always been left to the local authorities, \nand that is the way it should be. But sometimes there may be one--I \nwill have to examine the facts--that becomes so overwhelming or so \nincapacitated by a natural disaster, or perhaps a terrorist attack, \nthat the Armed Forces may have to perform some of those duties. We want \nto make sure the President has that capability.\n  Also, there are other permanent laws on the books called the \nInsurrection Statutes. At a very minimum, I would like to see the name \nchanged that we put on this for reasons quite different than the \nthreats and challenges that face this Nation today. But that statute \nalso might be reviewed, along with the Posse Comitatus Act, to see \nwhether other permanent pieces of law should be modified to meet the \ncontingencies we face here in the future.\n  I see the distinguished chairman of the Homeland Defense Committee. I \nwonder if I might direct a question to her.\n  In the briefings we have had before our committee by members of \nvarious departments and agencies who had authorities to deal with this, \nI came away with an impression that we have to, in a very quiet and \ncareful manner, look at the totality of the permanent law and \nregulations to determine what changes should be made to meet a \ncontingency of the nature we have experienced--indeed, whether it is a \nnatural disaster or military terrorist attack in the future. I wonder \nif our distinguished chairman has progressed in her thinking on this \npoint.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. (Mr. Vitter). The Senator from Maine is \nrecognized.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, if I may respond to the Senator from \nVirginia, the distinguished chairman of the Armed Services Committee, \nfirst, let me commend the chairman of the Armed Services Committee for \nhis thoughtful approach to the issue of whether our laws and \nauthorities are adequate to deal with a disaster of the magnitude of \nKatrina.\n  He has indicated his interest in taking a hard look at the Posse \nComitatus law and also the Insurrection Act, both of which put certain \nrestrictions on the ability of Active-Duty Forces to be used for law \nenforcement purposes and in other ways. I commend him for raising these \nvery important issues.\n  It was evident from the briefing we had with FEMA and Coast Guard \nofficials last week before the Homeland Security Committee that those \non the front lines believe the current structures are inadequate to \ndeal with a catastrophe of this magnitude. We talked directly to FEMA's \nDirector of Operations as well as to a Coast Guard admiral who has been \nin charge of the search-and-rescue operation. Each of them, in response \nto questions from both of us, indicated this catastrophe has \noverwhelmed the organizational structures and requires a new way of \nthinking. Both of them indicated interest in our taking a look, a close \nexamination, at the two acts which the distinguished chairman has \nmentioned. I commend him for following up on this issue.\n  I think it is important that we look at that, as well as a host of \nother issues related to our preparedness and our response.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished chairman. I am \nprivileged to serve on her committee.\n  As a consequence of the close relationship between the Department of \nDefense and the various departments our committee--and I sit on a few--\nhas over situations such as this--I might note for the Record the \nperson from FEMA who appeared before your committee for the briefing \nwas a career employee. I found him to be very qualified. He has some 30 \nyears of experience. I think he shared with our committee some of his \nmost profound thoughts based on some, I believe, 30 years experience. \nAm I correct?\n  Ms. COLLINS. The Senator is correct. He is a career employee, a \nmember of the Senior Executive Service, with extensive experience.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank the distinguished chairman.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine is recognized.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak in \nmorning business for 10 minutes and that the allocated time be extended \naccordingly.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Ms. Collins pertaining to the introduction of S. 1690 \nare printed in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent Senator Byrd be \nrecognized at 11 a.m. and Senator Vitter be recognized at 11:30 a.m. in \norder to address the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 1670, which I have \nfiled at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from North Dakota [Mr. Dorgan] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1670.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in the Record of September 8, 2005, under \n``Text of Amendments.'')\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I will describe very briefly this \namendment--I shall come to the floor and talk about it more later--and \nthen I will use the remaining minutes that are available to talk about \nan amendment I have previously offered to the bill.\n  This amendment, very simply, deals with the contracting that our \ncountry is paying for, particularly with respect to Iraq and \nAfghanistan. It especially deals with establishment of a special \ncommittee to investigate waste, fraud, and abuse.\n  Now, I indicated yesterday that whenever you speak of the company \nHalliburton, people think you are coming to the floor to criticize the \nVice President. Let me say that is not the case. The Vice President was \nthe president of Halliburton but not during any of the time that any of \nthis has happened. But Halliburton has been, I believe, the largest \ncontractor in Iraq. Halliburton and some other companies have been \ncited in ways that make my blood boil, and I believe it has the same \nreaction with the rest of the American people.\n  Let me read some headlines, if I might. Nobody, by the way, seems to \nwant to investigate this, and nobody seems to care much about it.\n  ``Halliburton Has Failed to Account for $1.8 billion in Charges'' for \nwork performed in Iraq and Kuwait. That is from the Wall Street Journal \nof August 11, 2004.\n  ``Pentagon Auditors Have Recommended Withholding 15% of Payments to \nHalliburton.'' That is from the Wall Street Journal of December 10, \n2003.\n\n      . . . the [Pentagon's] top financial officer . . . alerted \n     [Secretary] Rumsfeld of ``significant issues regarding the \n     timeliness and adequacy of KBR price proposals'' and \n     ``deficiencies'' in its billing, purchasing, and estimating \n     systems.\n\n  ``Whistleblowers Have Documented Halliburton Waste, Fraud, and \nAbuse.''\n  ``Halliburton Overcharged $186 Million for Meals.'' That is from the \nFederal Times of June 21, 2004.\n  ``Halliburton Overcharged $212 Million for Oil Deliveries.''\n  I could go through this. I have a sheet that is eight pages long. \nAnd, yes, it talks about $85,000 new trucks that are dumped on the side \nof the road because they have a flat tire or a fuel pump that is \nplugged. What do they do with it? Well, this is direct testimony from \npeople who worked for Halliburton who drove the trucks, abandoned the \ntrucks, let them torch the trucks for a flat tire. The list is \nunbelievable when you hear what has happened.\n  A contractor pays $45 for a case of soda, $100 for cleaning a 15-\npound bag of laundry. We had one fellow who was buying towels--towels--\nfor our soldiers. He held up two towels: This is a towel we would \nnormally purchase, but we were asked by Halliburton subsidiary, \nKellogg, Brown, & Root, KBR, to buy towels with their logo on it. So \nyou doubled the price of the towel to ship to the soldiers because it \nhas the logo of the company on the towel.\n  In 1941, Harry Truman was in this Chamber. We had a Democrat in the \nWhite House. A Democratic Senator demanded an investigation of waste, \nfraud, and abuse, and a special committee was established called the \nTruman Committee. They went after waste, fraud, and abuse. I am sure it \nwas not very pleasant for Franklin Delano Roosevelt down at the White \nHouse with a Democrat in the Senate demanding an investigation of \nwaste, fraud, and abuse. The fact is, the Truman Committee uncovered \nmassive waste, fraud, and abuse.\n  Now we have a President and a Congress controlled by one party. We do \nnot even have oversight hearings on these things. I am the only one who \nhas been holding hearings in the Democratic Policy Committee and having \nthe whistleblowers come forward and talk about the massive waste, \nfraud, and abuse that exists. No oversight hearings. No accountability. \nNobody seems to care.\n  My amendment, very simply, says there ought to be established a \nspecial committee to investigate this kind of waste, fraud, and abuse. \nLet me say to those who say, Well, you are trying to legislate on an \nappropriations bill, yes, I am. I am. I tried to offer this on the \nDefense authorization bill, which is where it belongs. I did offer it \nto the Defense authorization bill, and the Defense authorization bill \nwas taken off the floor of the Senate; we are told never to reappear \nagain. So the only option we have is to offer this kind of amendment on \nthis appropriations bill.\n  So I wanted to describe what this amendment is. It would establish a \ntype of Truman Committee to investigate waste, fraud, and abuse. It is \nnot about politics. It is about, on behalf of the American people, \nasking the tough questions about waste, fraud, and abuse. We are \nshoveling money out the door, shoveling money--billions and billions, \ntens of billions of dollars--to be spent in the country of Iraq for \nrebuilding Iraq. Then we hear stories about the American taxpayer \npaying for the air-conditioning of a building in Iraq, and then it goes \nto a contractor and a subcontractor and somebody else who subcontracts \nfrom that, and by the time it gets installed, it is a ceiling fan, and \nthe American taxpayer paid for air-conditioning.\n  Guess what. It is going on all over. The company orders 50,000 pounds \nof nails, 25 tons of nails, and they order the wrong size, so \nHalliburton's nails are lying in the sand somewhere in Iraq. Does \nanybody care about that?\n  We are talking about billions of dollars of no-bid contracts. I am \ngoing to hold a hearing on Friday with the woman who rose to the \nhighest rank--the highest civilian employee in the Corps of Engineers, \nBunnatine Greenhouse. And what is happening to her? Well, she had the \nguts to speak up and\n\n[[Page S9949]]\n\nspeak out, saying these no-bid contracts were being awarded to \nHalliburton in an inappropriate way without following the rules.\n  Well, guess what happened to Bunnatine Greenhouse for raising those \nquestions. She is losing her career over in the Pentagon at the Corps \nof Engineers. She is being demoted. She always had excellent, sterling \nevaluations--until she said: You can't do this. This isn't a buddy \nsystem. You can't be awarding contracts this way.\n  For her honesty and for her courage, she is told she is either going \nto be fired or going to be demoted, against, I might say, the wishes of \nthe inspector general who is investigating it.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1665\n\n  Mr. President, let me talk for a moment about the other amendment I \nhave offered to this bill. As you know, today's trade announcement is \nwe had a $58 billion--$58 billion--trade deficit in the last month; \nabout $700 billion a year, we are going to see. That is $700 billion \na year more than we send out in exports that we purchase in imports. So \nlet me talk about this.\n\n  Here is what is happening in American trade. We are drowning in trade \ndeficits. As you know, attendant to that, we are sending jobs overseas \nat a rapid rate.\n  Fruit of the Loom--you all remember the people dressed up as grapes, \nsinging their little Fruit of the Loom songs. It used to be American \nunderwear. But American underwear is no longer American. If you are \nwearing Fruit of the Loom somewhere in America today, you are wearing \nMexican shorts or probably Chinese shorts and T-shirts. So Fruit of the \nLoom is gone, and 3,200 people who used to work for Fruit of the Loom \nare no longer employed.\n  PalmPilot--if anybody has worked on a PalmPilot, here is the last \nmessage from a young woman--I have her name, and I will not go through \nit, but I will at some other time when I have the time to do that. Here \nis the last message from a women who worked for PalmPilot. By the way, \nshe was forced to train her replacement, who is a worker from India, \nbecause those jobs went to India. Here is her last message on her \nPalmPilot: ``My job's gone to India!!''\n  I have spoken at length about Huffy bicycles. I will not speak longer \nabout them today, but all the folks in Ohio were fired. They used to \nmake Huffies. Incidentally, this little thing between the handle bars \nand the front fender, that used to be an American flag decal. They \ncleverly changed it to a globe once the jobs went to China, and all the \nAmerican workers were fired. Oh, it is still an American brand, it is \njust that Americans do not get a chance to make them any more because \nthe American workers were paid $11 an hour, plus benefits, and now they \nare made in China, but with workers who make 33 cents an hour and work \n7 days a week, 12 to 14 hours a day. They are still sold in Wal-Mart, \nKmart, and Sears. They are called an American bicycle. They are not. \nThey are not an American bicycle.\n  And the Maytag repairman--all those television commercials about this \nold bloke having nothing to do. Well, 1,600 U.S. Maytag jobs went to \nMexico and Korea.\n  I could do this for a long time.\n\n       Even as it proceeds to lay off up to 13,000 workers in \n     Europe and the United States, IBM plans to increase its \n     payroll in India by more than 14,000 workers.\n\n  That was 2 months ago in the New York Times.\n  Now, what does all this mean for our country?\n  It means our country is losing economic strength, losing jobs. We are \nhollowing out America's manufacturing base. In the last 20 years, our \nmanufacturing base has shrunk by half. We are told it is all right, and \nit is going to be fine in the long run if those who produce, yes, \nAmerican companies that produce, search for the lowest cost production \nanywhere in the world and then they land in Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, \nIndonesia, China or somewhere else and hire someone else for 16 cents \nan hour. And, yes, they do. They will hire 12-year-old kids for 12 \ncents an hour and work them 12 hours a day. If you doubt it, I will \nshow you where it happens.\n  People say: Well, that is all right because all those jobs, they are \ngoing to go elsewhere, but we will have higher wage, higher skilled \njobs in this country. They are all wrong. It does not work that way. \nThis country is losing economic strength and losing economic \nopportunity. The people who are losing their jobs because American jobs \nare moving elsewhere, in search of lower wages, those are people who \nare not able to find jobs that are equivalent jobs. In almost all \ncases, they find the next job at a lower wage rate.\n  This is a race to the bottom. Rather than aspiring to lift other \ncountries up, it is driving down wage rates and opportunities in our \ncountry.\n  There is a man named James Fyler. James Fyler died of lead poisoning. \nHe was shot 54 times. I suppose that is acute lead poisoning. He was \nshot 54 times long ago because he had the temerity to stand up for the \nability and the right of workers to organize. So he lost his life. I \ncould cite many others who lost their lives standing up for the right \nof people to organize as workers. Apparently, there are companies who \nhave decided to pole-vault all over that and produce elsewhere where \nworkers cannot organize; produce in China, where if a worker tries to \norganize, he or she can be sent to prison. If you want names, I will \ngive you names of at least a dozen people--and there are hundreds \nmore--who are sitting in prisons in China because they wanted to \norganize workers.\n  Producing in China is easier, producing in other countries is easier \nbecause you don't have to worry about child labor, about dumping \nchemicals into the air and water. You don't have to worry about workers \norganizing.\n  What is going wrong in trade is going to dramatically injure this \ncountry and its future and opportunities. I am offering an amendment \nbecause we have trade negotiators now negotiating in the Doha round who \nhave indicated it is all right and we will consider negotiating away \nour opportunity to protect ourselves against the dumping of products \ninto this country, into our marketplace at below their cost of \nacquisition, which is an opportunity to ruin the domestic industry and \ndrive domestic industry out of business.\n  We protect ourselves with antidumping laws. We protect ourselves \nagainst deep subsidies of products that are dumped into our marketplace \nwith countervailing duties. Our trade negotiators have signalled that \nthat which our trade partners want, to get rid of our countervailing \nduties or antidumping laws, basic provisions that protect American \nworkers, protect American jobs against the unfairness of trade, our \ntrade negotiators have said: It is on the table. We are willing to \nconsider that.\n  My amendment says no money will be used by the folks in the Commerce \nDepartment and the U.S. trade ambassador's office negotiating these \ntrade agreements to weaken trade protections for American workers and \nbusinesses. It is a simple amendment but important in terms of the \nfuture.\n  I notice my colleague from West Virginia has arrived. I know he is \nset to assume his address to the Senate. Let me, in courtesy to him, \nclose my remarks and simply say, I intend to come to the floor later \nthis afternoon to speak again about both of these amendments which are \nimportant, the addition of which will add significantly to this \nappropriations bill.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from West Virginia is recognized.\n\n\n                a national debate: our country's future\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, chapter 3, verses 1 through 8, of the Book \nof Ecclesiastes in the Holy Bible begins:\n\n       To everything there is a season and a time for every \n     purpose under heaven.\n\n  Let's read that again:\n\n       To everything there is a season and a time for every \n     purpose under heaven.\n\n  It is time for a national debate, and its purpose is our country's \nfuture. Sometimes it takes a catastrophe to put events into \nperspective, to shake us and to sharpen our clarity of vision. The \nwrath of Katrina, tragic and devastating for thousands, must certainly\n\n[[Page S9950]]\n\nhas caused many thinking Americans to consider anew the proper \npriorities for our country.\n  Who among us has not wondered if the efforts to rescue and evacuate \nGulf Coast residents suffered because too many National Guardsmen have \nbeen detailed and detained in Iraq? What thinking American has not \npondered why we had such a painfully slow response to a behemoth storm \nwhich we knew for days would likely turn New Orleans into a caldron of \ndespair? Is there anyone in our great country--anyone--who did not feel \nthe painful outrage of the citizens of New Orleans and Louisiana and \nMississippi, as they waited for days without food, without water, \nwithout knowledge about loved ones? Who among us did not shrink in \ndread from the specter of our fellow citizens' bodies floating in the \nmurky flood waters or stacked in hospital stairwells for want of anyone \nanywhere else to house them? Could this be happening in a major \nAmerican city? Can you believe it? Could we be so inept at dealing with \nthis tragedy?\n  The events of the past several days seem to have reduced our much \ntouted American know-how and technology to little more than children's \ntoys, strangely impotent in a real crisis.\n  I know many Americans cringed, as I did, at the vision of the callous \nneglect of our poorest and most vulnerable citizens which flashed \naround the world, making the United States appear to be a nation \nunmindful of its own, a nation unable to handle a disaster about which \nit had ample notice, a country loudly touting our form of government to \nthe world while failing to provide even the most basic protections to \nour own citizens. What a shame.\n  If Katrina has any redeeming impact, it must be to cause us to see \nourselves as others must surely see us. I regret to say that the \npicture cannot be a pretty one. That image is certainly not one that \nreflects the humanitarian goodness and morality of the vast majority of \nthe American people. The perception of the United States in these \ntroubled times should be a cause of major concern for everyone who \nholds public office--did you hear me?--for everyone who holds public \noffice, regardless of political party. It is time to look at where we \nare and where we are going.\n  Few would now argue that the war in Iraq has improved the world's \nview of the United States. Again, what a shame. What a terrible shame. \nWhat a terrible mistake. It was an unnecessary and ill-conceived \nconflict which distracted us from our proper course of bombing the \nterrorist training grounds of Afghanistan. I have never bought the \nabsurd claim by some that we are fighting terrorists in Iraq so we will \nnot have to fight them here at home. Who believes that? That claim is a \nnonsequitur at best and, at worst, a patent distortion of what has \nhappened in Iraq. The war in Iraq created a hot bed of terrorism where \nnone existed before, and it ensured Osama bin Laden an endless supply \nof recruits, now even more fanatic in their hatred after scandals at \nAbu Ghraib and the destruction of so many innocent lives in Iraq as a \nresult of our unprovoked invasion.\n  I said it then. It was a mistake. We were being misled. I said it \nthen, that Hussein did not pose a threat to our national security. I \ndidn't believe the stories that were told. And as it turned out, the \nstories were wrong.\n  For everything there is a season, saith the Bible. The season has \ncome for Americans to look homeward instead of continuing to spend \nbillions of dollars in Iraq. Let us husband our hard-earned tax dollars \nand spend them here at home. Look homeward. The Iraqi people must \nslowly find their own way now.\n  Further, U.S. dictated deadlines are counterproductive. We cannot \nforce-feed democracy in Iraq. To keep large numbers of American \nsoldiers in Iraq much longer only earns the United States more enmity, \nreinforcing our unfortunate global image as conqueror, not liberator.\n\n  Haven't we learned that? The Iraqi people must begin to take it from \nhere. In fact, there is no longer a war in Iraq. The President says we \nare a nation at war. We are not a nation at war. The U.S. military is \nat war. The Nation pays little attention to it. The newspapers seldom \nmention it. The administration is deaf, dumb, and mute on the war.\n  A national war? Guardsmen know about it. They know there is a war, \nand their families know there is a war. We started that conflict. We \nstarted that conflict, and we met the goals established at its outset. \nNow there is a slow, festering, internal political struggle pitting \nShiite against Sunni against Kurd which will play itself out perhaps \nfor decades until it either devolves into outright civil war or \nresolves into some sort of compromise which suits those who live in the \ncountry of Iraq.\n  We cannot resolve Iraq's internal issues. It is time for the United \nStates to begin to bring our troops home. What are we waiting on?\n  There are those who say if we were to leave, we would not be honoring \nthose who gave their lives in vain. That is an argument that is \neternal. We continue to feed lives into the slaughterhouse.\n  The invasion of Iraq was never supposed to be an open-ended \npeacekeeping mission with our troops mired amid the chaos of continuing \nurban warfare, the most dangerous place in the world. How would you \nlike for your son to go? How would you like for your daughter to go? \nHow would you like for your grandson to go? For what?\n  We need to bring them home with a hearty ``job well done''--a hearty \n``job well done.'' We should begin with the National Guard. Praise God, \nthe National Guard. Obviously, they are needed here. They were needed \nin New Orleans. They were needed in Mississippi. They were needed in \nAlabama. They are an integral part of our first responder team in the \nevent of a terrorist attack, God forbid, or if another national \ndisaster were to strike.\n  It is time to come home--come home, America--time to come home; time \nto come home, America; time to look within our own borders and within \nour own souls. There are many questions to be answered and many \nmissions to accomplish right here on our own soil. We have neglected \ntoo much for too long in our own backyard. Come on, wake up, wake up, \nAmerica.\n  To everything there is a season--a time to break down and a time to \nbuild up. If we had spent the money a few years back to rebuild those \nlevees on the Gulf Coast, thousands would be alive today. Perhaps we \ncan finally see the value of that budgetary stepchild called public \nworks.\n  All across this country, there are years of neglect of the basic \ninfrastructure of the United States that cry out for attention. Years \nof neglect--years of neglect--of the basic infrastructure of the United \nStates that have been crying out for attention, cry out today for \nattention, and we have delayed for decades, and the needs are only \ngrowing.\n  There are antiquated sewer and water systems built a century ago in \nour major cities. Take a look here in Washington, DC, right here in the \nNation's Capital. Washington, DC, has water not always safe to drink. \nThere are rural communities in America that live with black mud coming \nout of their faucets. There are unsafe bridges. There are aging \nreservoirs. There are schools without adequate heat or modern learning \ntools all around our land. Homeland security needs are underfunded. I \nhave time and again, time and again offered amendments to more \nappropriately fund homeland security. My amendments were defeated \nbecause the White House and the leadership of the party that controls \nthis House and the other House oppose those amendments. Yet we continue \nto commit billions of dollars to rebuild Iraq while our own needs go \nbegging. Can't we see? How long, how long, how long will we close our \neyes to these needs?\n  Is it not now painfully evident to everyone that we must make basic \ninvestment in our own country a national and urgent priority? Imagine a \nterrorist attack on the heels of a catastrophe such as Katrina. Can you \nimagine the horror, the chaos, the utter confusion? I have to believe \nthat Osama or one of his henchmen is taking notes as we struggle with \nthe devastation left in Katrina's wake.\n  Our economic resources are stretched dangerously, dangerously thin, \nand so is our military might--you better believe that--so is our \nmilitary might.\n  We have taken on too much. We have turned our backs on cooperation \nwith the international community, decided to go it alone, and pursue \nsome grandiose scheme of remaking the world in our own image. How \nsilly.\n\n[[Page S9951]]\n\n  By now it should be clear to all that grand experiments are very \ncostly. It is time for a national epiphany. The sound of Katrina's \nbugle must be heeded. We cannot continue to commit billions of dollars \nin Iraq when our own people are so much in need--not only now in New \nOrleans, but all across America--for everything from education to \nhealth care to homeland security to securing our own borders. We need \nto stop making excuses, stop spinning the facts, and come to grips with \nthe unpleasant truth. The Government of the United States is failing \nthe American people. Failing. That is the catastrophe.\n\n  Where is the national debate about our priorities which Katrina \nshould prompt? What does it take to wake us up? Hey, listen, hear me: \nIt is a debate that must begin, if not on this Senate floor, then in \nthe barber shops and in the grocery stores of America and in the print \nand broadcast media of this great Nation.\n  It is past time for that debate and high time for all of us to \nrealize that there is nothing more patriotic than taking a good, hard, \nhonest look at our national priorities. We, the people--we, the \npeople--always have that right. A strong republic depends upon just \nthat kind of periodic soul-searching. Does our moral sense of ourselves \ntranslate into Government policies? I believe that. Presently, it does \nnot. We have a disconnect in Government policy in everything from a \ntarnished U.S. image abroad to a failure to address gasoline shortages \nand skyrocketing prices that will certainly slow our economic engine \nand take their toll on working people.\n  Instead of asking the public not to buy more gas than needed, I wish \nsomebody would ask the giant oil companies to pass up some profits and \nhelp hold down gas prices as a patriotic gesture for our country. Would \nthat be so outrageous? What do you think?\n  Why have we not had the vision to invest in alternative energy \nsources on a grand scale to free us from the addiction to foreign oil? \nFor too long--for too long--our great land has been allowed to drift \ntoward balkanization, a separation between the haves and the have-nots, \nwith the lower end of the income scale at risk from a tattered safety \nnet and a neglected infrastructure, lacking the jobs and housing they \nneed, the health care to stay well, the insurance to cover hospital \nstays, or the educational opportunities to prepare for the future.\n  I remember, yes, I remember an America that used to feel more like \none country--one country, an America that shared the sacrifice of war \nand tightened its belt so we could pay for it now. But now we borrow to \ngo to war, and we cut taxes to spare those in the high brackets from \nsacrifice.\n  Where is the sense of shared destiny? It has taken nature's own \nweapon of mass destruction, a category 4 hurricane, to remind us that \nwe are all American and that our Government has a moral obligation to \nserve and protect us all.\n  This country is on the wrong track, and the course needs correcting. \nContinued denial serves no good purpose. Further loss of American life \nin Iraq may permanently sour the American people on future military \naction and damage the recruitment for our all-voluntary force.\n  To everything there is a season--a time to kill and a time to heal. \nWe have seen the fallacy of sending too many members of the National \nGuard to the Middle East. What folly.\n  As I speak, we have lost 1,886 sons and daughters in Iraq. And for \nwhat? And there seems to be no end in sight, no plan. We have 137,000 \ntroops still serving in Iraq with 2,000 more scheduled to go in \nOctober. We are building at least--now get this--we are building at \nleast four semipermanent bases in Iraq structured to hold 18,000 troops \neach. Why? That does not sound like ``staying not one day longer than \nneeded'' to me. In truth, most Americans no longer support a massive \ndeployment in Iraq. Nor do they understand the mission of that \ncontinued deployment. Despite repeated directives by the Congress, the \n``powers that be'' refuse to actually budget for Iraq, so that a total \npicture of our fiscal situation and the cost of the war is deliberately \nobscured. We are driving our country ever deeper into debt and \nstretching every resource that we possess to the breaking point. How \nmuch longer can it last? Prudence demands that we reassess our posture. \nOur inept and pathetic, pitiful response to Katrina has underlined our \nvulnerabilities and writ them large before the world. The American \npeople deserve better than this.\n\n  I call upon the leaders of this country to come together and to work \ntogether to repair our storm-ravaged Gulf Coast and help salvage the \nlives of its victims. But more than that, I call upon the Congress to \ninventory our homeland with an eye to the future. Let us look around, \nAmerica, and target our deficiencies. Let us work with State and local \ncommunities to shore up our weaknesses. We must react in a crisis, of \ncourse, but for God's sake, let us finally understand that we must also \nanticipate the future and be unafraid to commit the resources to make \nus strong at home. The lesson of Katrina most surely is that an ounce \nof prevention is worth several tons of cure.\n  We need to also learn that we cannot long remain a world power if we \ncontinue to let America crumble from within. The alarm bells are \nsounding--listen. The alarm bells are sounding and we must answer the \ncall. This is no time to play for partisan advantage. This is certainly \nnot the season to circle the wagons and hunker down. We need not \nstretch our brains to write new talking points or invent new excuses. \nAnd please, oh, please, please, let us not resort to the trusty \nbureaucratic ruse of simply reorganizing Government agencies once \nagain.\n  It is time for real leadership. It is the season for true humility. \nThe Bible says:\n\n       Pride goeth before destruction, and an haughty spirit \n     before a fall.\n\n  For years we have been getting it wrong here in Washington. But if we \nhave the will, we can begin to get it right. The American people \ndeserve leaders with the honesty to take responsibility for failures--\nquit making excuses, quit spinning the facts--and the wisdom to change \nwhen change is obviously and so urgently needed. And may God, may \nalmighty God, grant us the grace.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sununu). Under the previous order, the \nSenator from Louisiana is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/13/senate-section/article/S9951-1", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9951-S9955]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           HURRICANE KATRINA\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues, especially the \nsenior Senator from Louisiana, Senator Landrieu, and the distinguished \nSenators from Mississippi and Alabama for all of their leadership \nduring this Hurricane Katrina crisis. I thank all of my colleagues who \nhave offered their heartfelt thoughts and prayers and very concrete \nhelp over these past 2 very difficult weeks.\n  I arrived back yesterday from the battlefields of the other gulf war. \nI stand before you to offer my firsthand report. I don't mean to be \noverly dramatic in my use of the analogy to war. I mean to be accurate. \nI mean to effectively convey the magnitude of the destruction, the \nenormity and complexity of the ongoing human impacts, and, perhaps most \nimportant, the level of national resolve and commitment that we need to \nwin the recovery effort.\n  We have all seen very powerful and destructive storms come ashore. We \nhave seen them cause enormous damage, create short-term flooding, even \ntake lives. And then the next day we respond and the residents of the \nstricken area walk through their community and try to begin picking up \nthe pieces.\n  This is different. It is not just fiercer or bigger, it is wholly \ndifferent.\n  Yes, Katrina was one of the most powerful hurricanes ever. When it \nhit Louisiana's coast, it did so with sustained winds of 140 miles per \nhour. Its low pressure reading of 920 at landfall made it one of the \nthree most ferocious storms ever to hit the United States, along with \nCamille in 1969 and the Labor Day Storm of 1935. But it was much more \nthan that. Yes, Katrina was also one of the largest hurricanes ever \ngeographically. Those ferocious winds extended 100 miles from the eye \nof the storm, which means they pounded the stricken area for hour upon \nhour upon hour, a devastated area roughly the size of Great Britain; \nroughly 2\\1/2\\ times larger than the area hit by Hurricane Andrew in \n1992.\n\n[[Page S9952]]\n\n  But it was even more than that. You see, Katrina was a ferocious, \nhuge hurricane that hit a treasured coastline, an entire region, \nincluding a major American metropolitan area, and that population \ncenter is one of the poorest in the country, and it is the only one \nthat sits largely under sea level, protected by levees until some of \nthe levees broke.\n  What does that mean? Storm surges of up to 25 feet; large portions of \nsoutheast Louisiana with long-term flooding of up to 20 feet; tens of \nthousands of people who had not evacuated, most in one-story wooden \nhouses, driven to their attics and roofs, many to be trapped there.\n  The crisis did not stop or stabilize there. In the ensuing days, it \nmeant the breakdown of basic institutions: the failure of all \ncommunication systems; lawlessness, which began spiraling out of \ncontrol; thousands of evacuees collecting in safe havens such as the \nLouisiana Superdome and the New Orleans Convention Center, which \nquickly became some of the most unsafe hellholes imaginable.\n  What does it all mean now? It means a major American metropolitan \narea evacuated. This is the first time this has happened since the \nCivil War. There is that war theme again. But the difference is, \nAmerican cities have grown quite a bit since then. This metro area is \nhome to 1.3 million people. It means hundreds of thousands of \nevacuees from southeast Louisiana. These are numbers comparable to some \nof the historic dislocations during World War II, but the difference is \nit is right here in America.\n\n  During all of this I was in southeast Louisiana. My wife Wendy and I \npacked up our minivan and our four kids and drove to Memphis the \nSaturday before the storm. After leaving them safely with family, I \nreturned to Baton Rouge that Sunday, where I slept in a true safe \nhaven, the State Police compound, and began traveling into all of the \ndevastated areas beginning that Tuesday morning.\n  Much like in war, what I saw covered the whole spectrum of human \nactivity. Indeed, it tended to concentrate on the two ends of the \nspectrum: great acts of personal heroism followed by a truly awesome \nmilitary operation beginning on day five on one end of the spectrum; \nlooting and worse and bureaucratic incompetence on the other end.\n  Let me be very clear and precise about this because some reports of \nmy critique of the early relief effort have caused some consternation. \nI was quoted after the first few days as saying that the early \ngovernment relief effort was a failure. I was quoted correctly and this \nwas clearly, unequivocally, indisputably true. In that initial relief \neffort, FEMA failed us miserably and Louisiana's hurricane preparation \nand emergency bureaucracy failed us miserably, too.\n  Don't take my word for it. Talk to the mother with her young daughter \nwhom I left at the Lafayette shelter. They were still in shock, not \nfrom the storm but from the hell on Earth that they had been placed \ninto at the Louisiana Superdome. Or talk to nurse Jody Lopez, who was \nholed up in Lindsey Boggs Memorial Hospital, or Dr. Tom Kiernan, \ntrapped at Tulane Hospital, who struggled to keep critical care \npatients alive for days with no sign of help in sight.\n  Thank God that while the bureaucrats failed, others succeeded. The \nfirst group of heroes who held on and overcame amazing challenges in \nthose first few days were local leaders and citizens on the ground. \nThis was true in every community I visited--New Orleans, St. Bernard, \nSlidell, Bogalusa, Amite, Kenner, to name a few. Sheriff's deputies in \nSt. Bernard were living on a small riverboat so they could continue \ntheir vital work. Eight days after the storm most had not seen their \nhomes or talked to their families, but they were committed to keeping \nSt. Bernard safe and putting their duty above their families and \nproperty.\n  There were hundreds of private citizens such as David Fakaouri of \nBaton Rouge, who pulled his boat down to New Orleans and spent days \ncombing the city for survivors, saving more than 60 people personally. \nThese private citizen rescuers slept in their boats and trucks, using \ntheir own fuel, and witnessed suffering at a level we cannot imagine.\n  Local leaders such as State Senator Ben Nevers of Washington Parish \nworked tirelessly to secure police reinforcements, water, food, \ngasoline, even chain saws to cut out of isolated areas.\n  There was the lunch crew at Belle Chasse High School in Plaquemines \nParish who, operating on emergency power only, fed hundreds of relief \nworkers every day. When I left them, they were working to feed the Army \nRangers who had arrived to provide support and security.\n  These local leaders and private citizens were also aided by \ncounterparts from around Louisiana and around the country. These \ncounterparts collected food, water, ice, generators, fuel and other \nnecessities, and with no plan and with no budget they got it to \ndevastated areas, in many cases over a week ahead of the bureaucrats.\n  Local police units from communities in Kentucky and Illinois were \namong the first to show up and offer assistance to our local police \nforces. Similar dispatches from communities in California and Ohio sent \nsecurity reinforcements to their comrades in Gretna.\n  Wal-Mart voluntarily offered its Kenner store as the food supply and \ndistribution center for the entire city of Kenner the day after the \nstorm and then, after the Kenner store was depleted, Wal-Mart National \ncontinued to send two truckloads of relief per day to keep that effort \ngoing.\n  Members of the Young President's Organization raised millions in \nessential supplies to turn over to their fellow YPO member, State \nSenator Walter Boasso. Walter used his company barges and worked with \nother leaders to set up their own dock operation and get supplies to \nSt. Bernard. Acadian Ambulance is a private Lafayette-based ambulance \nservice whose people not only inundated the area with ambulances to \nevacuate hospitals and nursing homes, but who actually created and \nimplemented an ad hoc but effective evacuation plan while the State \nDepartment of Health and Hospitals dithered.\n  These local leaders and private citizens, heroes both from throughout \nthe devastated area and around the country, got us through those first \ncrucial days. And then another group of heroes helicoptered in, the men \nand women of our military. In fact, we turned a corner in our relief \nefforts the Friday after the storm, day five, because it became a full-\nscale military operation. And with that came a completely different \nmindset, a completely different culture than the bureaucratic one we \nhad been fighting for 5 days. ``We can't do that,'' and ``That's not \nour job exactly,'' was replaced with, not ``Yes,'' but ``Yes, sir.'' \nMembers of the Coast Guard who were out saving lives Monday afternoon, \nbefore the storm's winds even died down, rescued more than 33,000 \npeople.\n  U.S. Army LTG Russell Honore from Pointe Coupee Parish, LA, assumed \ncommand of the Active-Duty military effort in our State and personally \ntook charge to establish that can-do attitude.\n  The 82nd Airborne, which took charge of New Orleans Airport that \nSaturday, organized the operation overnight and evacuated thousands. \nThis same organization that landed in Normandy, where the Higgins boats \nmade in New Orleans were key to victory on D-Day, also helped in the \nrescue efforts by dropping in food, water, and supplies to thousands in \nneed.\n  Coast Guard VADM Thad Allen is now in charge of relief efforts and \nnow finally pushing that same can-do attitude onto the bureaucracies of \nFEMA and the State bureaucracies that floundered in the early response.\n  These groups of heroes--local leaders partnered with private citizens \nand the military--have stabilized efforts in the devastated areas, but \nenormous challenges remain. In the areas hardest hit by Katrina, these \nchallenges include reinstituting the necessities of a modern, civil \nsociety, such as a full-fledged New Orleans police force and criminal \njustice system, replacing countless miles of electricity and phone \nlines, establishing huge communities of temporary housing, bulldozing \nand rebuilding entire neighborhoods and parts of the metropolitan area, \nand bringing businesses and jobs back.\n  Beyond the devastated area, the radius of our challenges has expanded \nto wherever there are large numbers of evacuees--Houston, San Antonio, \nCharlotte, Salt Like City, Milwaukee--and\n\n[[Page S9953]]\n\nevery town and city across the rest of Louisiana. You see, so many of \nthe evacuees lived their lives paycheck to paycheck. So many others \ndepended on Social Security or other programs. They need immediate help \nin all of those areas--well beyond Louisiana. Unfortunately, the \nbureaucrats are still in charge of this.\n  As we tackle these challenges, let us remember what worked in the \ninitial relief effort and what didn't work. As we investigate--and we \nmust--let us focus on that central question: what worked and what \ndidn't work.\n  I have heard many Washington talking heads say that heads must roll. \nI am all for that, and I have my own personal list. But that alone \nisn't enough. We need to look at the big picture--not just which people \nfailed but which institutes and models failed, and, just as \nimportantly, which others worked against all odds. A new head \nbureaucrat is not the solution to a failed bureaucracy. We need to look \nat the successful can-do military culture and the startling success of \npeople-power and private initiative. Government outlays alone will not \nrebuild a great American metropolitan area and repopulate it with jobs. \nWe need mega-enterprise zones to harness private sector investment \npower and to recreate jobs. Returning to the same routine of begging \nand scraping for flood and hurricane protection will ensure that this \nhappens again.\n  We need energy royalty sharing as a stable source of revenue for \nCorps of Engineers hurricane protection projects, and we need the same \nto use and to invest in coastal restoration to protect Louisiana and \nour Nation's oil and gas supply.\n  Second, the tens of billions of dollars in government relief money \nthrough FEMA and the State OEP--the very same agencies which failed \nus--will lead to more failure. We need a Katrina reconstruction \ncommission headed by a no-nonsense, nonpolitical businessman manager so \nthat we will all have something lasting to show for this enormous \nspending.\n  I am working with my colleagues in the Louisiana delegation, Senator \nLandrieu, and all of our House Members, to introduce a comprehensive \nlegislative package for implementing these ideas, and we will be \noutlining our specific proposals in the very near future.\n  In closing, let me make one final plea; that is, as we do all of \nthis, let us do it together in a sincere spirit of bipartisanship.\n  I saw horrific scenes in the days after the storm. I smelled \nsweltering stench. But what I sometimes heard coming out of Washington \nwas more sickening--ridiculous arguments tying the suffering to the war \nin Iraq and the Reagan deficit, talk of boycotting bipartisan hearings \nand stonewalling independent commissions. Nobody in the stricken area \nis talking that nonsense. They are rebuilding lives.\n  So perhaps the best thing we can do as leaders is to follow--follow \nthe basic goodness and common sense of Louisianians and Americans. If \nwe don't, if we allow this matter to become just another partisan \npolitical football, then we will have done one thing; that is, to \nvictimize the victims of Hurricane Katrina all over again.\n  Two of Louisiana's beloved football teams--the New Orleans Saints and \nthe LSU Tigers--lifted our spirit with victories this past weekend. The \nSaints beat the odds, and the Tigers won in the game's last second with \na pass verging on a Hail Mary. It reinforced for us what we already \nknew: that even in dark times, hope springs eternal, prayers are \nanswered, and a can-do attitude pays dividends. I have no doubt that \nLouisiana's resolve and spirit will be demonstrated in the coming \nmonths as our families rebuild their lives and their communities. \nAmerica is joining us in that same spirit. Let us all follow their \nexample.\n\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I was pleased to be in the Chamber to \nhear the remarks of the junior Senator from Louisiana and want to \nsincerely say to all of our colleagues who are here that Senator Vitter \nand I offer our views about the conditions in Louisiana and the gulf \ncoast having been there, as Senator Vitter said, through almost every \nday of this horrific and devastating tragedy, a tragedy not just for \nour city of New Orleans and the parish of Jefferson but the region of \nthe gulf coast.\n  I thank Senator Vitter for his words to our colleagues about the way \nwe have urged our delegation to work in a bipartisan spirit, with \ncommonsense solutions and out-of-the-box thinking to put together a \nframework of a plan for rebuilding that calls on the best from our \nNational Government, the best from our State government, the best from \nour local government, the best from our private sector, individual \ncitizens, and nonprofit communities to rebuild this region and rebuild \nour cities and our towns, our counties and our parishes, in a way that \nhonors the spirit of the great Americans who have called this place \nhome for over 250 years.\n  I thank the Senator for his remarks. He has been a steady voice of \noutstanding confidence for the people of our State, and his views and \nhis wisdom that he shared with all of us today truly is inspirational \nto us all. I thank him very much for the personal invitation to be with \nhim as he spoke today.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coburn). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I ask the current business be set aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1703\n\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I have an amendment to send to the desk, \nand I ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arkansas [Mr. Pryor], for himself and Ms. \n     Mikulski, proposes an amendment numbered 1703.\n\n  Mr. PRYOR. I ask unanimous consent the reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To require the FTC to conduct an immediate investigation into \n            gasoline price-gouging, and for other purposes)\n\n       On page 190, between lines 14 and 155, insert the \n     following:\n       Sec. 522. Of the funds appropriated to the Federal Trade \n     Commission by this Act, not less than $1,000,000 shall be \n     used by the Commission to conduct an immediate investigation \n     into nationwide gasoline prices in the aftermath of Hurricane \n     Katrina; Provided, That the investigation shall include (1) \n     any evidence of price-gouging by companies with total United \n     States wholesale sales of gasoline and petroleum distillates \n     for calendar 2004 in excess of $500,000,000 and by any retail \n     distributor of gasoline and petroleum distillates for use as \n     motor vehicle fuel against which multiple formal complaints \n     (that identify the location of a particular retail \n     distributor and provide contact information for the \n     complainant) of price-gouging were filed in August or \n     September, 2005, with a Federal or State consumer protection \n     agency, (2) a comparison of, and an explanation of the \n     reasons for changes in, profit levels of such companies for \n     gasoline and petroleum distillates for use as motor vehicle \n     fuel during the 12-month period ending on August 31, 2005, \n     and their profit levels for the month of September, 2005, \n     including information for particular companies on a basis \n     that does not permit the identification of any company to \n     which the information relates, (3) a summary of tax \n     expenditures (as defined in section 3(3) of the Congressional \n     Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974 (2 U.S.C. 622(3)) \n     for such companies, (4) the effects of increased gasoline \n     prices and gasoline price-gouging on economic activity in the \n     United States, and (5) the overall cost of increased gasoline \n     prices and gasoline price-gouging to the economy, including \n     the impact on consumers' purchasing power in both declared \n     State and National disaster areas and elsewhere; Provided \n     further, That, in conducting its investigation, the \n     Commission shall treat as prima facie evidence of price-\n     gouging any finding that the average price of gasoline \n     available for sale to the public in September, 2005, or \n     thereafter in a market area located in an area designated as \n     a State or National disaster area because of Hurricane \n     Katrina, or in any other area where price-gouging complaints \n     have been filed because of Hurricane Katrina with a Federal \n     or State consumer protection agency, exceeded the average \n     price of such gasoline in that area for the month of August, \n     2005, unless the Commission finds substantial evidence that \n     the increase is substantially attributable to additional \n     costs in connection with the production, transportation, \n     delivery, and sale of gasoline in that area or to national or \n     international market trends; Provided further,\n\n[[Page S9954]]\n\n     That the Commission shall provide information on the progress \n     of the investigation to the Senate and House Appropriations \n     Committees, the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and \n     Transportation, and the House of Representatives Committee on \n     Energy and Commerce every 30 days after the date of enactment \n     of this Act, shall provide those Committees a written report \n     90 days after such date, and shall transmit a final report to \n     those Committees, together with its findings and \n     recommendations, no later than 180 days after the date of \n     enactment of this Act; Provided further, That the Commission \n     shall transmit recommendations, based on its findings, to the \n     Congress for any legislation necessary to protect consumers \n     from gasoline price-gouging in both State and National \n     disaster areas and elsewhere; Provided further, That chapter \n     35 of title 44, United States Code, does not apply to the \n     collection of information for the investigation required by \n     this section; Provided further, That if, during the \n     investigation, the Commission obtains evidence that a person \n     may have violated a criminal law, the Commission may transmit \n     that evidence to appropriate Federal or State authorities; \n     and Provided further, That nothing in this section affects \n     any other authority of the Commission to disclose \n     information.\n\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I will visit with my colleagues today about \na problem this Nation is facing, something very critical to our economy \nand critical to every section of this great land. It is something I was \nreminded of time and time again when I was at home in Arkansas during \nthe August recess: It is the high price of gasoline.\n  The price of gas in the last month has risen across the Nation \nanywhere from 30 to 70 cents per gallon. In Arkansas and throughout the \ncountry gas prices are at an unprecedented high. Unfortunately, \nHurricane Katrina made a bad situation worse. The Gulf of Mexico and \nthe State of Louisiana are absolutely essential in our Nation's \nproduction of crude oil and gasoline. Hurricane Katrina has caused \nmajor disruptions in the supply of these crucial commodities. This is \none reason for the recent spike in the retail price of gasoline, but I \nam certain it is not the sole cause.\n  As I traveled my home State last month, I heard from countless \ncitizens who believe the oil companies are taking advantage of them. \nCan you blame them? It is hard for the people in my State, as I am sure \nit is for the people in other Members' home States, to fill up their \ngas tanks and pay record high prices at the pump while, at the same \ntime, opening up the business page and seeing the oil companies are \nmaking record profits. That does not sit well with people.\n  I believe the consumers have a legitimate concern, a legitimate \nquestion about why prices are so high, why they have been trending up \nin the last year or so. We should have an investigation. If price \ngouging is occurring, we need to know that. If it is occurring--I am \nnot saying it is--if it is occurring, we need to stop that activity \ndead in its tracks.\n  This is why I offer this amendment to the Commerce, Justice, and \nState appropriations bill that directs the Federal Trade Commission to \nconduct an immediate investigation into nationwide gasoline prices in \nthe aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. We must find out--when I say ``find \nout,'' I do not mean speculate, not accuse, not assume but find out \nwhether gas price gouging is occurring through the supply chain or \ndistribution markets. And if price gouging is occurring, we must punish \nthose who take advantage of this national tragedy.\n  I thank my colleague from Maryland, Senator Mikulski, who has been a \nleader on this issue and who has helped shape this amendment and is one \nof the cosponsors of this amendment. I thank her for her leadership. \nShe has done a great job not just on this legislation but many others \nas we all know.\n  In the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, we have seen this country come \ntogether. It has been very heartwarming. Today I have been on the phone \nwith people all over my State who are operating these camps for people \nwho have been evacuated from the gulf coast area. It is encouraging to \nsee communities, to see people come out of the woodwork to help. It has \nbeen very encouraging to see churches in my State go the extra mile for \npeople who need it the most. I am very encouraged by that.\n  We also need to be mindful of what high gas prices do to this \nNation's economy. We need to know who the honest brokers are. We need \nto know when gas stations raise their prices, are they doing it because \nthey need to, because they are being charged, or are they doing it to \nmake a quick buck? Those are legitimate questions.\n  We also need to know what companies sold their gas at a higher price \nbecause they needed to and what companies sold their gas at a higher \nprice with greed as their motivation.\n  The people in my State and the people in your State and the people in \nall of our States have a right to know why gas prices are so high right \nnow. This will cause a great hardship for the economy, for every sector \nof this country. Everything we buy, everything we pay for, has a fuel \ncomponent built into it. We understand that.\n  As I wind down, we have had complaints from all over my State. We had \none guy write in and say the price jumped 60 cents in 1 day. I know \nother Members have had complaints. I appreciate consideration of this \namendment and appreciate my colleagues looking at it. It is important \nfor this country. It is important for the Senate to take up this issue.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, may I make a request of the Senator from \nVermont, the ranking member of the Judiciary Committee? I want to be \nable to speak on the Pryor amendment. I wonder, given what the Senator \nneeds to do and, of course, the responsibilities that are pressing, \nshould we do that after this?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, we have 20 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Twenty minutes equally divided and under the \nprevious order.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I ask the Senator from Maryland how much time does the \nSenator seek.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. It was 5, but I could get it to 3.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Could we start ours later?\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, let me \nsuggest it has been the request of some of the people on the Judiciary \nCommittee that we delay about 10 to 12, maybe 15 minutes, and that \ngives the Senator from Maryland an opportunity to be heard. Is that \nacceptable?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, why don't we begin debate on mercury, and I \nask unanimous consent we begin it at 12:17. That gives us time for the \nSenator from Maryland. I know we are going to break in the Judiciary \nCommittee, and that would give plenty of time.\n  Mr. INHOFE. We will say 20 after.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Twenty after.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the unanimous consent \nrequest that we proceed to S.J. Res. 20 at 12:20?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise as a cosponsor of the Pryor \namendment. Why? Because American people believe there is gasoline price \ngouging. We have to find out if there is. What this amendment does is \nadd $1 million for the Federal Trade Commission to investigate whether \nthere is price gouging.\n  There seems to be evidence of price gouging throughout the supply \nchain and in the distribution markets. The impact of gasoline price \nspikes on our country is severe. They impact people's day-to-day lives \nat the family level, at the small business level, and at the macro \nlevel. And the American people believe deep down there is gouging.\n  All of America knows that Hurricane Katrina had a terrible impact on \nour country, that the storm had a significant impact on oil production \nand oil refining capacity in the gulf. We understand refineries were \ndown and badly damaged, distribution pipelines were affected, shipping \nchannels were blocked due to obstructive deposits and, of course, we \nhave seen offshore drilling impacted. But these disruptions happened \nover a 3 week period. Why were the gas prices being spiked an hour and \na half after Katrina happened? We saw price spikes in Maryland even \nbefore that. Marylanders are hot about this and so is this Senator.\n  Now, my cost of commuting from Baltimore to Washington has already \ngone up $30 a week. I can afford it; I am a Senator. But I saw on a \nlocal Baltimore TV station a woman who filled up her minivan--a soccer \nmom--and it was $90. She put her head on the windshield and wept about \nhow her family was going to afford filling the family vehicle with gas.\n\n[[Page S9955]]\n\n  My Governor is also deeply concerned. He brought in the gasoline \nstation operators to find out why prices were the third highest in the \nNation. Little Maryland, behind California. And who are the other two \nhighest? New York and the District of Columbia, our neighbor.\n  What are we saying? The average price in Maryland is over $3, \ncompared to $2.46 just a month ago. Throughout the Baltimore-Washington \ncorridor, gas is selling at $3.49, $3.39. But do you know what. We \nthink there is some kind of deal going on because it can vary within a \n3-mile radius. Over where I live, gas has been selling for $3.63 a \ngallon. If you go into another neighborhood, just 5 miles away, it is \nselling for $3.03--a 60-cent-a-gallon difference.\n  Tell me, who is pulling the strings? Who is setting these prices? \nWell, right now, we could end up just with finger-pointing. I want to \npinpoint the problem.\n  First of all, I salute Governor Ehrlich for convening the meetings he \nhad. His meetings broke up, and he was not satisfied. He is going the \nnext step. I want us to now operate on facts because we see how \ngasoline prices are affecting families, such as the cost of commuting \nto work, and Maryland is a commuter State.\n  The price of gasoline is skyrocketing. It is affecting small \nbusinesses, from the florists who deliver flowers, to the pharmacies \nthat deliver prescription drugs, and so on.\n  Then, you look at our businesses. So much of our food supply comes to \nour communities, our wonderful supermarkets, by truck. Also, you go out \nalong the Chesapeake Bay where people love our crabs, but my watermen \nare just aghast at what it costs to take their boats out to harvest \nseafood.\n  So I could give story after story. But Marylanders want to know, is \nthere price gouging? If there is, we have to go after it and stop it. \nWe know there are record high profits in the oil and gas industry. We \nknow there is price variance with the oil companies. We know there is \nprice variance even block by block as to how much consumers are being \ncharged for gasoline.\n  But, most of all, we know there is going to have to be shared \nsacrifice because of Katrina. We are going to have to examine how we \nbuild refineries in our country. We have to have an oil conservation \nstrategy; conservation could be our next North Slope. We should focus \non those things.\n  But right now I am worried about what is being charged at the pump. \nWe want to make sure there is not price gouging, and that there is not \nprice fixing. We are asking the Federal Trade Commission to \ninvestigate. I want to advocate an amendment to put money in the \nFederal checkbook to do so.\n  Mr. President, know that we Marylanders want to move ahead, we want \nto cooperate, but we want to know why gasoline is so expensive and what \nis behind the price spikes and price fluctuations?\n  And hello, oil companies out there, if you are listening, if you want \nto respond to me, I am right there at 503, in the Senate Hart Building. \nI have an open line to listen to what you have to say because I am \ngetting an earful in Maryland.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/13/senate-section/article/S9955-1", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9955-S9958]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      DISAPPROVING A RULE PROMULGATED BY THE ADMINISTRATOR OF THE \n                    ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I would ask Senator Inhofe and Senator Leahy \nif we could start the 20 minutes now.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I have no objection.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will be 20 \nminutes evenly divided for debate between the Senator from Oklahoma, \nMr. Inhofe, and the Senator from Vermont, Mr. Leahy, or their \ndesignees.\n  Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I discussed this with the distinguished \nSenator from Oklahoma. I yield 3 minutes, first, to the distinguished \nSenator from New Jersey.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey is recognized for \n3 minutes.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, very quickly, we are about to vote on \nan issue that really has to touch every one of us in some form or \nfashion, if one is a parent or one is a grandparent or if one has any \ncontact with children, as to the kind of issue we are discussing.\n  I will start off by seeking unanimous consent that letters and other \nmaterial in support of this resolution from environmental, sportsmen, \nfishing, and religious groups be printed in the Record following my \nremarks.\n  The list is long. They talk about the health community having grave \nconcerns about the threat of mercury pollution to the public health, \nabout potent neurotoxins that can affect the brain, heart, and immune \nsystem. There are almost 40 organizations cited in this one letter. \nThey include organizations such as the American Academy of Child and \nAdolescent Psychiatry, the American Association on Mental Retardation. \nA lot of these groups are focused on the thought process--Cure Autism \nNow, Learning Disabilities Association, the National Autism \nAssociation, the Society of Pediatric Nurses, and United Cerebral \nPalsy.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that these materials be \nprinted in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I suspect most Americans are going to \nbe shocked to learn the administration wants to allow more poisonous \nmercury into the environment. But that is exactly what they are trying \nto do. We should not permit this vote to take place as it is.\n  I hear the arguments that are being made that reducing toxic \nemissions from coal-fired plants may in fact increase the cost of \nenergy, that it would be terrible. People are being shocked by the cost \nof fuel and energy generally.\n  But if you want to look at a bunch of children and say, ``No, we are \ngoing to risk these children having learning disabilities and to not be \nable to function properly, not be able to be an integral part of their \nschool body as would be planned,'' as opposed to perhaps--perhaps--the \nenergy we use costing a couple more cents, there cannot be any \njustification for this resolution not to pass.\n  I hope our colleagues in the Senate will look very closely at the \ndecision they are making, between children and a little extra cost for \nenergy.\n\n                                                    July 27, 2005.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n       Dear Senator: As leading national health organizations, we \n     are writing to ask that you vote to protect the public's \n     health, especially children's health, from the threat of \n     mercury pollution. The upcoming vote on the Collins-Leahy \n     joint resolution to stop EPA from implementing its new \n     Mercury Clean Air Rule is an opportunity to put children's \n     health first. Since EPA unfortunately ignored the calls from \n     health professionals, scientists, a number of states, our \n     organizations and the public when it finalized the mercury \n     rule earlier this year, we now turn to Congress to ask for \n     your intervention.\n       The health community has grave concerns about the threat of \n     mercury pollution to public health. Mercury is a potent\n\n[[Page S9956]]\n\n     neurotoxin that can affect the brain, heart, and immune \n     system. Developing fetuses and children are especially at \n     risk; even low-level exposure to mercury can cause learning \n     disabilities, developmental delays, lowered IQ, and problems \n     with attention and memory. EPA scientists estimate that one \n     in six women of child-bearing age has enough mercury in her \n     body to put her child at risk should she become pregnant. \n     Mounting evidence also indicates that mercury increases the \n     risk of cardiovascular diseases in adult men.\n       As organizations representing medical, nursing and public \n     health professionals, women, and advocates of children and \n     families, we are concerned that the American public is not \n     adequately protected from exposure to mercury in the \n     environment. Many of our members (most notably physicians, \n     nurses, and health scientists) contributed their clinical and \n     research expertise in commenting on the EPA's rule; nearly \n     700,000 comments, including the attached mercury health \n     consensus statement, were submitted to the EPA docket in \n     overwhelming opposition to this flawed proposal. Of \n     particular note:\n       The EPA's own Children's Health Protection Advisory \n     Committee (CHPAC) advised the Agency that the rule ``does not \n     go as far as is feasible to reduce mercury emissions from \n     power plants and thereby does not sufficiently protect our \n     nation's children,'' writing four letters to the Agency \n     raising significant children's health concerns about the \n     rule;\n       Important new research that EPA failed to consider from the \n     Harvard Center for Risk Analysis and the Mount Sinai School \n     of Medicine reinforces the National Academy of Sciences' \n     (NAS) determination that methylmercury exacts serious, \n     adverse effects on public health, and provides new evidence \n     that mercury pollution inflicts neurocognitive impacts on \n     developing children that affect our nation's economic \n     productivity;\n       Both the Government Accountability Office (GAO) and EPA's \n     own Inspector General documented widespread discounting of \n     scientific and public health evidence as EPA developed and \n     finalized the mercury rule.\n       As a nation we can do better. EPA articulated a sound \n     scientific basis for its decision in 2000 to list mercury \n     emissions from power plants as a ``hazardous air pollutant,'' \n     ensuring regulation under the maximum achievable control \n     technology (MACT) section of the Clear Air Act. The \n     scientific evidence of harm has only grown in the last 5 \n     years, adding significant additional weight to EPA's earlier \n     determination. Moreover, substantial evidence exists that \n     power plants can affordably install the necessary \n     technologies by 2008. Yet remarkably, the mercury rule \n     finalized in March 2005 is even weaker than the rule \n     initially proposed by EPA in 2003.\n       We urge you to protect women and children from toxic \n     mercury by supporting the joint resolution, sponsored by \n     Senators Patrick Leahy and Susan Collins under the \n     Congressional Review Act (S.J. Res. 20), to disallow the \n     EPA's flawed mercury rule. In some important respects, \n     mercury pollution is the lead of our generation and it \n     deserves to be treated as a serious threat to public health. \n     We strongly urge you to protect Americans from mercury \n     pollution by supporting the Leahy-Collins resolution.\n           Sincerely,\n       American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry.\n       American Academy of Pediatrics.\n       American Association on Mental Retardation.\n       American College of Nurse-Midwives.\n       American College of Preventive Medicine.\n       American Federation of State, County and Municipal \n     Employees.\n       American Nurses Association.\n       American Psychiatric Association.\n       American Public Health Association.\n       Association of Reproductive Health Professionals.\n       Association of Universities on Disabilities.\n       Breast Cancer Fund.\n       Center for Children's Health and the Environment, Mount \n     Sinai School of Medicine.\n       Children's Environmental Health Network.\n       Commonweal.\n       Cure Autism Now.\n       Easter Seals.\n       Families USA.\n       Healthcare Without Harm.\n       Institute for Children's Environmental Health.\n       Learning Disabilities Association.\n       March of Dimes.\n       National Association of Nurse Practitioners in Women's \n     Health.\n       National Association of Pediatric Nurse Practitioners.\n       National Association of School Nurses.\n       National Autism Association.\n       National Latina Institute for Reproductive Health.\n       Natonal Organization of Nurse Practitioner Faculties.\n       National Partnership for Women and Families.\n       National Research Center for Women & Families.\n       NoMercury.\n       Parents for Nontoxic Alternatives.\n       Physicians for Social Responsibility.\n       SafeMinds.\n       Saratoga Foundation for Women WorldWide, Inc.\n       Science and Environmental Health Network.\n       Society of Pediatric Nurses.\n       The Arc of the United States.\n       United Cerebral Palsy.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                September 9, 2005.\n       Dear Senators: As organizations that represent millions of \n     sportsmen and women nationwide, we write to ask for your \n     support of an effort underway in the U.S. Senate to require \n     the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to revisit its \n     recently finalized mercury rule for coal-fired power plants.\n       Hunting and fishing is more than a pastime in the United \n     States. It is a way of life, a tradition that is passed down \n     from one generation to the next. It's what shapes young \n     children's relationship and connection to their natural \n     world. Fishing also is a big contributor to our local \n     economies, contributing $116 billion annually to the national \n     economy.\n       Last year, many of our members expressed concern about \n     mercury's impacts on people and wildlife and urged then \n     Administrator Leavitt to strengthen its mercury rule for \n     coal-fired power plants. Unfortunately, the final rule fails \n     to adequately protect people and wildlife and delays mercury \n     controls for another decade.\n       Mercury pollution poses a threat to fisheries and to the \n     people, wildlife, and businesses that depend on clean water \n     and safe fish. Recently published research found that \n     mercury's impact on wildlife is greater than initially \n     believed. The reproduction of fish, birds, and fish-eating \n     mammals are all harmed due to mercury's toxic properties.\n       You have a unique opportunity under the Congressional \n     Review Act to send the mercury power plant rule back to the \n     EPA for a thorough review. Our members want to share the \n     experience of hunting and fishing in our nation's waters for \n     generations to come. Your leadership in reversing mercury \n     contamination in the U.S. will make this possible and help \n     ensure that our natural resources are protected for our \n     children.\n           Sincerely,\n     Jim Lyon,\n       Senior Vice President for Conservation, National Wildlife \n     Federation.\n     Tom Franklin,\n       Conservation Director, Izaak Walton League of America.\n     Steve Moyer,\n       Vice President for Government Affairs & Volunteer \n     Operations, Trout Unlimited.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                    July 21, 2005.\n       Dear Senator: We urge you to protect women and children \n     from toxic mercury by supporting a joint resolution, \n     sponsored by Senators Patrick Leahy and Susan Collins under \n     the Congressional Review Act (S.J. Res. 20), to reject the \n     Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) recent rule to delay \n     reductions in mercury emissions from power plants for years \n     to come. In particular, the resolution would disapprove a \n     rule that removes power plants from the sources required by \n     law to install strict controls to reduce their toxic \n     pollution, including mercury.\n       Mercury is a potent neurotoxin that can affect the brain, \n     heart, and immune system. Developing fetuses and children are \n     especially at risk; even low-level exposure to mercury can \n     cause learning disabilities, developmental delays, lowered \n     IQ, and problems with attention and memory. EPA scientists \n     estimate that one in six women has enough mercury in her body \n     to put her child at risk should she become pregnant. Mounting \n     evidence also indicates that mercury increases the risk of \n     heart attacks in adult men. People of color are particularly \n     at risk from the effects of mercury pollution. Research shows \n     minorities consume fish more frequently than other \n     populations and are less likely to be aware of fish \n     consumption advisories.\n       Mercury pollution is so pervasive that 44 states have \n     posted fish consumption advisories due to mercury \n     contamination. In half of these states, the advisories cover \n     every lake and/or river in the state.\n       In addition to human impacts, mercury also significantly \n     threatens wildlife. For instance, recent studies have \n     revealed widespread contamination of aquatic ecosystems. New \n     research also shows that many animals--including forest \n     songbirds and salamanders in national parks--have elevated \n     mercury burdens.\n       Power plants are the largest U.S. source of mercury \n     emissions. Yet, rather than enforce the Clean Air Act, which \n     requires each power plant to achieve the maximum degree of \n     reduction in mercury pollution (on the order of 90 percent) \n     by 2008, EPA has finalized new rules that allow significantly \n     more mercury pollution from power plants and even then delay \n     the weaker required reductions until after 2026.\n       The Leahy-Collins resolution would reject EPA's categorical \n     exemption of power plants from the highly protective emission \n     standards mandated by the Clean Air Act's hazardous air \n     pollution control program and would instead require EPA to \n     establish clean air standards that comply with the law and \n     protect public health. We strongly urge you\n\n[[Page S9957]]\n\n     to protect Americans from mercury pollution by supporting the \n     Leahy-Collins resolution.\n           Sincerely,\n         Andy Imparato, President & CEO, American Association of \n           People with Disabilities; S.

The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished \nSenator from Vermont.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I will be brief but concise.\n  This is not a vote about reducing mercury by 90 percent by 2009 or \neven 70 percent by the year 2030. That is a red herring.\n  This is not a vote about the opponents' wildly outdated claims on the \npotential cost or the availability of mercury controls.\n  This is not even a vote about the well-documented and devastating \neffects of toxic mercury on future generations of children or the \nNation's environmental health.\n  Mr. President and Senators, this is a vote about whether the \nadministration failed to comply with the law. We cannot afford to get \nit wrong now. There will be no going back.\n  After careful review, I have concluded that there was such a failure \nthat this was an intentional and illegal effort to circumvent the law, \nand that it was designed to benefit big energy companies at the expense \nof the public health.\n  This failure has been documented in reports by GAO, the Inspector \nGeneral, in the press, and in testimony before the Environment \nCommittee and the Democratic Policy Committee.\n  Our resolution sends the agency back to the drawing board to get it \nright and to comply with the law.\n  Mr. President and Senators, it is this simple: Should the \nadministration comply with the Clean Air Act? I think so and will vote \nyes. If you think so, vote yes on this resolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, first of all, let me make 10 points and \nmake them very succinctly and very quickly. I timed myself, and I can \ndo it in this time.\n  So I start off with, in reality, this is a political exercise in \nfutility. Every Senator in this Chamber knows it. Who in this Chamber \nwould truly believe the President would sign legislation to repeal his \nown administration's rule? It is not going to happen. Yesterday, the \nPresident said he would veto it. That is a done deal. That is a no-\nbrainer. We understand that.\n  Now, if you want political points with some of the far left \nenvironmentalist groups, sure, this might be your opportunity to get \nit. But you know it is not going to happen.\n  Secondly, overturning this rule would delay the rule that is already \nin effect right now. This President has a good rule. It is a cap-and-\ntrade rule. Prior to this, nobody else was able to do it. But he is \ndoing it.\n  Third--this is very important--the Senator from Vermont was \ncommenting about some people giving false financial information. I \nthink we know from the Energy Information Administration that the cap-\nand-trade rule--this approach to it--would cost about $2 billion. This \nis what is in place right now. This is what the President has done.\n  In the event they should substitute that for a MACT rule, the Energy \nInformation Administration said it would cost $358 billion. Now, that \nis how much it would cost. But I think there is a lot more than that. \nYou have to keep in mind if you pass this rule, if this were to take \nplace today, that would have the effect of shutting down coal-fired \nplants. You would have to replace them with natural gas. That natural \ngas has already gone up in price.\n  I have here today, from Oklahoma, the Oklahoma Farmers Union. They \ncan tell you, the cost of fertilizer has gone up 70 percent just in the \nlast short period of time. If you start using natural gas in the \nplants, there is going to be far less of it available. We have driven \n90,000 chemical manufacturing jobs overseas because of the problems \nthey have been having with natural gas right now. So it would be that \nmuch worse.\n  The fourth thing is, they say this is not going to work. It has \nalready been said. It was said yesterday and this morning that the cap \nand trade does not work. This is patterned after the Acid Rain Program. \nThe Acid Rain Program is considered to be a success. Many Senators--and \nI do not blame them--have resisted the idea of a cap-and-trade program. \nThey said all kinds of things were going to happen with acid rain, and \nit did not happen. Even the senior Senator from Vermont said--this is \nin 1999 when we had the acid rain proposal--\n\n       When we were debating controls for acid rain we heard a lot \n     about the enormous cost of eliminating sulfur dioxide. But \n     what we learned from the acid rain program is that when you \n     give industry a financial incentive to clean up its act, they \n     will find the cheapest way [to do it].\n\n  That is exactly what happened. That is what is going to happen in \nthis case.\n  The fifth thing is that the sponsors of this resolution talk about \nthe fact that a MACT program would give a 90-percent reduction in 3 \nyears. I think it might be very interesting for these people to go back \nand research that 2 years ago, when we were developing the cap-and-\ntrade proposal for mercury, they considered at the same time a MACT \napproach. Their modeling showed they could only cut mercury by 29 \npercent, not the 90 percent we are talking about now. It is all in the \nrecord. It is all there in the EPA. They have that information.\n  So it is not 90 percent. Even if you were to take this, it would be \n29 percent as opposed to the mandated 70-percent reduction that is in \nthe cap-and-trade proposal by the President.\n  The sixth thing is that U.S. powerplants contribute but 1 percent to \nthe global total of mercury emissions. This is kind of interesting. \nEveryone is talking about powerplants now, that we have to do something \nabout powerplants, when in fact powerplants are not the contributors. \nThe U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the Norwegian Institute of \nAir Research did a long, involved study on this issue. They said, of \nall the release--you can see it in this chart right here--only 1 \npercent comes from U.S. powerplants. So we are talking about 1 percent \nof the mercury that is released. That is all, just 1 percent.\n  The next thing I would like to mention--I will use two charts for \nthis--if we were to use, right now, the computer modeling, the first \nmap shows the mercury deposits from all sources in 2001. That is where \nit is right now. We can see it over here in this area, I say to my good \nfriends, Senator Jeffords and Senator Leahy. It is over 20\n\n[[Page S9958]]\n\nmicrograms per square meter. That is what is happening today.\n  Now, the next chart shows what would happen if you did away with all \npowerplants by the year 2020. You can see it really is not that \ndifferent. So it gets right back to that chart that only 1 percent is \naffected to begin with.\n  The seventh reason is that repealing the rule would be a rollback in \nthe first ever mercury regulation to control powerplants. I hope \neverybody understands that powerplants have never been regulated for \nmercury.\n  It hasn't happened. It has never happened. They tried it in the \nCarter administration. Many of us wanted that to happen. I wasn't here \nat that time, but the Carter administration punted it to the Reagan \nadministration. The Reagan administration didn't do it. They didn't \nregulate mercury. They punted it to the Bush 1 administration. He \ndidn't do it. He punted it to President Clinton. The Clinton \nadministration did nothing toward regulation of mercury. He punted it \nto the current administration and they are doing it. We are now \nregulating mercury for the first time in the history of this country. \nIt is this administration that is doing it.\n  The eighth reason is, of the 144 tons of mercury deposited yearly in \nthe United States, only 11 tons come from U.S. powerplants. With the \nnew rule, that amount will drop down to 3.4 tons.\n  Then, No. 9, it is easy to scare people. We are really good at that, \ntalking about how many people are going to die. It is very interesting. \nI want people who are scared because they have heard politicians \ntalking about the doom and gloom of this thing to look at the NHANES \nstudy which shows that not a single woman or child has a blood mercury \nlevel approaching the level at which even the smallest effect was \nobserved by the study.\n  Lastly, even if it worked, the technology is not there. If we should \nadopt this, the technology is not there.\n  I retain the remainder of my time and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, how much time is remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont has 5 minutes \nremaining. The Senator from Oklahoma has 2 minutes 37 seconds \nremaining.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished Senator from \nDelaware.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. CARPER. Let me be clear: Similar to everybody else, I want to \nminimize fuel switching which could drive up the cost of natural gas \neven further. I, too, want coal to continue to be the backbone of our \nelectricity-generating sector. Adopting a strong mercury rule is not \ninconsistent with either of those goals. It is consistent with \nprotecting the health of pregnant women and children, among the most \nvulnerable members of our society.\n  The fears about the impacts of a strong mercury rule on coal and \nnatural gas are unfounded. I am not aware of credible evidence that \nshows that powerplants will switch from coal to natural gas in order to \ncomply with a more stringent mercury rule. The Energy Information \nAdministration tried to say that fuel switching will occur. But listen \nto some of the assumptions they adopted to reach that conclusion.\n  First, they had to assume that natural gas prices would fall to $3.50 \nper thousand cubic feet 5 years from now in order to show that it would \nmake economic sense for powerplants to switch from coal to natural gas. \nLet me tell you how much natural gas cost last week: $12. The week \nbefore Katrina hit, it was $9.50. I don't think there is any way \nnatural gas prices are going to be $3.50 5 years from now. I hope I am \nwrong, but the odds are I am not.\n  Second, the Energy Information Administration had to assume that \ntechnology to control mercury does not exist. It does exist. There are \nalready powerplants in the Northeast that have been reducing their \nmercury pollution by more than 80 percent for the last 5 years. Last \nmonth, Colorado-based ADA-Environmental Solutions was awarded another \ncontract to install new mercury control technologies on two new \npowerplants being built in the Midwest.\n  The technology has been developed. The technology is being \nimplemented. We can do better than the Bush rule. We can do better than \nthat and we should. We have an obligation to our constituents, and we \ncan do it in a way that balances our needs to preserve coal and to \nprotect the most vulnerable among us.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/13/senate-section/article/S9958-1", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9958-S9962]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              S.J. RES 20\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr President, I strongly support S.J. Res. 20, and I \ncommend Senator Leahy for sponsoring the resolution to block the EPA's \nmercury cap and trade rule.\n  The mercury rule is a rule that only an administration bought and \npaid for by big energy could love. It's a shameful rollback of the \nClean Air Act to allow owners of fossil fuel power plants to avoid the \nexpense of installing new technology to reduce dangerous emissions.\n  Mercury is an extremely dangerous neurotoxin that accumulates in the \nenvironment. It is particularly harmful to pregnant women, and puts the \nfetus at risk of serious developmental disorders.\n  The Centers for Disease Control has reported that 630,000 of the 4 \nmillion infants born in the United States each year--16 percent--are at \nrisk for mercury-related brain damage. In the Northeast, this figure \ntranslates into over such 84,000 newborns per year.\n  Last week, the Mount Sinai School of Medicine Center for Children's \nHealth and the Environment reported that the cost to the Nation of the \nimpact of mercury on children's brain development is $2 billion a year.\n  These newborns are being poisoned by the mercury which coal-fired \npower plants spew into the air and eventually pollutes the water, and \nenters the food chain. Mercury advisories now apply to nearly a third \nof the area of America's lakes and 22 percent of the length of our \nrivers.\n  Incredible as it seems, however, EPA--the agency charged with \nprotecting the environment--has issued a rule that would actually lead \nto more of this toxin in the water we drink and the air we breathe.\n  Obviously, it's important to have adequate power to keep the lights \non. But we also need to protect our children's health. We can do both \nby requiring that power plants use the best technology to control \nmercury emissions.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote for passage on this needed resolution to \nrestore a sensible anti-mercury policy for the Nation.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to give my \nreasons for voting against the so-called Leahy-Collins resolution.\n  I believe mercury pollution is a real problem, particularly for \nvulnerable populations, including children. Given these concerns, I \nsupport efforts to reduce mercury emissions from coal-fired power \nplants, which account for 42 percent of U.S. emissions. This is in line \nwith my support for many years for clean coal technologies, which will \nallow our Nation to utilize our most abundant natural resource in a \ncleaner, more efficient manner.\n  Debate on this resolution has revolved around two regulatory \napproaches--a maximum available control technology, MACT, rule or a \ncap-and-trade rule. I suggest that there is a third option that \ncombines elements of both. A MACT system is enormously expensive on its \nown, costing up to $358 billion according to the Energy Information \nAdministration, compared to $2 billion estimated by EPA for a cap-and-\ntrade approach. However, a cap-and-trade-only system is inadequate on \nreducing pollution levels around specific plants, referred to as ``hot \nspots.'' The Leahy-Collins resolution would tie EPA's hands by \nrestricting it to a MACT-only approach.\n  Under a third option, EPA could set a national emissions level, based \non the best available science to protect public health and the \nenvironment, and implement a cap-and-trade system to meet this goal \nwith the addition of measures to take care of hot spots, EPA could \nrequire reductions at specific plants. To this end, I have written the \nAdministrator of the EPA urging this hybrid approach, which would meet \nenvironmental goals while balancing the implementation costs faced by \nconsumers.\n  I ask unanimous consent that my letter to EPA Administrator Johnson \nbe printed in the Record.\n\n[[Page S9959]]\n\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 13, 2005.\n     Hon.

Johnson,\n     Administrator, Environmental Protection Agency, Washington, \n         DC.\n       Dear Administrator Johnson: I am writing regarding the \n     Clean Air Mercury Rule announced by the Environmental \n     Protection Agency (EPA) on March 29, 2005 and urge that you \n     reconsider this rule.\n       Mercury pollution is of great concern to me. The \n     Commonwealth of Pennsylvania is party to a suit in the U.S. \n     Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit, which seeks to overturn \n     the mercury rule.\n       As you reconsider this rule, I propose that the most \n     reasonable approach to reducing U.S. mercury emissions from \n     power plants would include a national cap with plant-specific \n     reductions for those facilities found to be responsible for \n     high levels of local mercury deposition, as some call ``hot \n     spots.'' This would provide the flexibility needed by utility \n     companies to make decisions on the appropriate mercury \n     reductions at their plants, while avoiding the potentially \n     inevitable problem of fuel switching to natural gas under a \n     Maximum Achievable Control Technology (MACT) standard.\n       Reducing mercury pollution is extremely important to the \n     nation. Beyond that, there are specific concerns the \n     Commonwealth of Pennsylvania has, which concern this rule and \n     the problems Pennsylvania faces with mercury-contamination \n     fish advisories for every water body in the state.\n       Thank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward \n     to your response to these concerns.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Arlen Specter.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. I assure my colleagues and my constituents that I will \nbe monitoring this situation as the current mercury rule is litigated \nin the court system and as EPA considers further mercury emission \ncontrol options.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, today I will vote against S.J. Res. 20, the \njoint resolution of disapproval concerning the mercury emissions rules \nthat were promulgated by the Administrator of the Environmental \nProtection Agency, EPA, on March 15, 2005. At the same time, I have \nsome significant reservations about the sometimes questionable \ndecisions that the administration made to revise the regulations and \nachieve the final result. In short, I cannot condone this rule making \nprocess; I remain very concerned about the possible impacts these new \nregulations could have on eastern coal; and I urge the administration \nto increase its commitment to funding important mercury control \ntechnology programs.\n  On one hand, coal, electric utility, and other industry interests are \nconcerned that returning to the more stringent mercury control \nstandards proposed by the Clinton administration would lead to negative \neconomic impacts, including fuel switching to natural gas. They believe \nthat the intent of S.J. Res. 20 would be to force the EPA to require a \n90 percent reduction in mercury emissions from each coal-fired \npowerplant, and this would also directly impact West Virginia's \nchemical, agricultural, and industrial uses of natural gas. I am \ntherefore concerned that a vote for S.J. Res. 20 would support \nregulations that are more draconian and costly than could be borne by \nthe economy at this time.\n  However, like the United Mine Workers, I remain concerned about the \npotential impacts that the clean air mercury rule could have on eastern \ncoal. Time and again, eastern coals have sustained the brunt of the \nclean air regulations at the expense of western coals. Since the \npassage of the 1990 Clean Air Act amendments, western coal production \nhas continued to climb at a steady pace while eastern and interior \nbasin coal production, and important union mining jobs, have suffered \nsignificantly. I am troubled by evidence that, in making changes to \nthese regulations, the Bush EPA was swayed by and, in some cases, \nsimply copied recommendations by western coal industry interests.\n  Furthermore, it is important to bring to light several important \nreviews of these regulations by the Government Accountability Office, \nGAO, and the EPA inspector general. The GAO as well as the EPA \ninspector general criticized the EPA for ignoring critical information. \nBased on these reviews, the administration did a very poor job of \nanalyzing the mercury emissions data, the economic analysis, and other \ncritical health-based factors. It appears that the administration \nalready had reached a predetermined answer and then worked backwards to \nachieve that end.\n  Finally, I have been very concerned about this administration's \ncommitment to funding fossil energy research. The industry argues that \nthere is not a sufficient, reliable suite of technologies to meet these \nmercury emissions standards for some years to come. Because I believe \nthat there are negative health impacts to pregnant mothers and young \nchildren from exposure to mercury, we should take economically and \nenvironmentally sound actions to achieve these reductions. However, \nthis administration has not increased the critical funding required to \nfind the mercury control technologies that would enable the U.S. to \nmeet these emission reductions sooner. The administration could do a \nlot more to get these technologies in place by increasing funding for \nthese important programs.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, today the Senate will be voting on a measure \nthat has a direct impact on the lives of thousands of people in \nConnecticut and around the country. By voting yes today on the \nbipartisan S.J. Res. 20, Congress can reverse the EPA decision to not \nregulate mercury emissions under section 112 of the Clean Air Act. \nUnder Section 112, powerplants would be required to reduce emissions of \nmercury and other pollutants by the maximum achievable level of control \nby installing stringent pollution control equipment. In March 2005, EPA \nissued a rule rescinding an earlier 2000 finding that it is appropriate \nand necessary to regulate mercury from power plants. Instead, EPA \nadvocates a cap-and-trade system over plant-specific controls.\n  Mercury is a potent neurotoxin that affects the heart, brain, and \nimmune system. By putting forth this irresponsible rule, EPA is putting \nthe lives of millions of people at risk, especially those of children \nand pregnant women. Scientists have well-documented evidence of mercury \ntoxicity. In the Northeast, a public health crisis is looming as there \nare estimates that over 84,000 newborns each year will be at-risk for \nirreversible neurological problems and cardiovascular abnormalities.\n  While mercury is prevalent in many household, medical, and industrial \nproducts, the largest U.S. source of mercury emissions are powerplants. \nThe mercury is carried by the wind from powerplants and settles in the \nlakes and rivers hundreds of miles from the source of pollution. The \npollution knows no boundary and that is the problem facing Connecticut. \nWe do have a few less-than-perfect powerplants, but the majority of our \nmercury pollution comes from sources outside the State and region.\n  So prevalent is the pollution that 44 States have issued fish \nconsumption advisories. In some States, no lake or river is habitable. \nIn Connecticut, pregnant women and small children are advised to eat no \nmore than one meal of freshwater fish per month. All others are advised \nto eat no more than one meal of fish per week. With statistics like \nthis, it is clear to see that in addition to the public health \nconsequences, there are clear economic challenges as well. Fishing is a \nbig contributor to our local economies, contributing nearly $116 \nbillion to the national economy.\n  In 2002, Connecticut took the first step in reducing mercury from the \nwaste stream and by prohibiting the sale of many mercury products. \nFurther, the State has implemented a comprehensive public education, \noutreach and assistance program. But individual States cannot address \nthe problem of mercury emissions on their own because emissions travel \nfar and wide. The EPA has dropped the ball and we will all suffer for \nit.\n  The EPA had a chance to take a stand for the public health and \neconomic well-being of citizens across this country. Under Section 112 \nof the Clean Air Act, a nearly 90 percent reduction in mercury \nemissions by 2008 could have been achieved. Instead, the EPA chose to \npursue an emissions cap-and-trade program that will likely achieve only \na 70 percent reduction in emissions by 2018--ten years later. Because \nthe cap-and-trade system does not require plant-specific controls, \nthere are even some estimates that the reductions may not occur until \n20 years out. We can simply not afford the delay. The Northeast States \nfor Coordinated\n\n[[Page S9960]]\n\nAir Use Management, NESCAUM, have determined that cost-effective \ntechnologies to reduce mercury emissions by 90 percent or greater are \nalready commercially available.\n  Today, we have a chance to undo what the EPA is championing and stand \nup for the people of this country. There is widespread opposition to \nthe EPA rule from states, localities, health professionals, groups of \nfaith, and many sportsmen and women. I urge my colleagues to vote for \nS.J. Res. 20.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I offer my full support of the \nresolution and wish to thank Senator Leahy, Senator Collins and the \nother cosponsors of this resolution who joined Senator Leahy, Senator \nCollins and me in bringing it forward.\n  One in 12 American women of childbearing age have mercury blood \nlevels that put their fetuses at risk for developmental delays. \nDevelopmental delays are a human tragedy, often denying children their \nfull intellectual and psychological potential. This human tragedy means \nthat our schools and educational system face costs and burdens borne in \nmeeting the special needs of these children, burdens that make it that \nmuch harder for our schools to achieve their overall mission of \ndelivering the highest quality education to all Americans. At a time of \nincreasing global economic competition in which human capital may be \nour most precious resource, we simply cannot afford to squander our \npeople or divert the resources of our schools when we can prevent the \nproblem in the first place.\n  That is why in 1990, Congress passed and President George H.W. Bush \nsigned, comprehensive clean air legislation that, among other things, \nput in place a mechanism for dealing with power plant mercury emissions \naggressively.\n  Unfortunately, the EPA's Clean Air Mercury Rule defies that clear \nintent of Congress and the first President Bush by failing to achieve \nanywhere near the full level of cost-effective and timely reductions in \nthe emission of mercury from power plants, one of the critical sources \nof mercury in the environment.\n  The EPA's mercury rule depends on the agency's decision to undercut \nthe Clean Air Act's mechanism for addressing mercury emissions from \npower plants. This resolution explicitly disapproves that undercutting \ndecision.\n  The resolution should be adopted because the EPA must engage in a new \nrulemaking that is sound and that yields the proper level of reductions \nthat the Clean Air Act contemplates and public health and economics \ndemand.\n  Findings from both the Government Accountability Office and the EPA's \nInspector General suggest that the EPA has much to repair in the \nrulemaking that led to the current rule. The GAO found that the EPA did \nnot adequately evaluate the health benefits that would be achieved from \nrequiring more aggressive mercury reductions than called for under the \ncurrent rule. The EPA Inspector General determined that the agency did \nnot evaluate what level of emissions reductions were technologically \nachievable, as required by the Clean Air Act. In addition, the EPA \nignored an EPA-funded study by the Harvard Center for Risk Analysis \npointing to substantial additional cardiovascular-related heath \nbenefits associated with mercury reduction.\n  The Clean Air Mercury Rule was developed and promulgated at the same \ntime that the Clean Air Interstate Rule was. The levels of mercury \nreduction expected to occur as a collateral result of reductions in \nsulfur dioxide and oxides of nitrogen under the Interstate Rule are \nalmost exactly those required by the Mercury Rule. This seeming \ncoincidence raises the strong suspicion the EPA suborned its entire \nanalysis of the Mercury Rule to the preordained goal of requiring under \nthe Mercury Rule to effect no additional reductions in mercury than \nwould be achieved as a collateral effect of the Interstate Rule. The \nflagrant flaws in the EPA's Mercury Rule rulemaking that both the GAO \nand the Inspector General exposed only reinforce that suspicion.\n  In contrast, the Clean Air Act requires the EPA to make a \ndetermination, after careful economic, technological, environmental, \nand public health analysis whether it was ``necessary and appropriate'' \nto regulate utilities' mercury emissions as a hazardous air pollutant \nunder section 112. In December of 2000, the EPA, following the Clean \nAir Act's requirements, determined that power plant mercury indeed was \na hazardous air pollutant, meaning that regulations under Section 112 \nof the Clean Air Act were ``necessary and appropriate.'' Once that \ndetermination was made EPA was required to put in place new technology-\nbased regulations of mercury emissions from power plants, regulations \nthat would call on each electric generating unit in the country to take \ntechnologically feasible actions to reduce its harmful emissions.\n  In contrast to the clear letter and spirit of the law, the new \nmercury rule leaves hundreds of large coal-fired power plants with \nabsolutely no mercury controls until after 2020--if ever. In fact, the \nCongressional Research Service estimated that only 4 percent of \ninstalled power plant capacity is projected to require control by 2020 \nunder this rule.\n  In addition, overall reduction levels under the new rule would be far \nbelow what can be achieved cost-effectively. In June, the GAO reported \nthat the technologies exist for capturing 30-95 percent of mercury from \ncoal. Recent tests have shown average removal rates of 70-95 percent \nfor all coals, with those technologies applicable to the coals that \naccount for 90 percent of power production showing mercury capture in \nexcess of 90 percent. Currently, drastic reductions are underway in the \nState of Massachusetts, with mercury technology vendors working to meet \na State-mandated 85 percent control level. Many, including vendors, \nstate that 70-90 percent control can be achieved by the end of this \ndecade. Associated costs to electricity consumers would increase by a \nmere 1-5 percent, according to the GAO report. These findings strongly \nsuggest that the technology to control mercury is available now. By \nturning its back on a regulatory program that would achieve this level \nof control, the current EPA mercury rule turns its back on tens of \nthousands of children who will continue to be exposed unnecessarily to \nthe development risks of mercury.\n  The EPA puts great stock in the use of cap-and-trade in its rule, \nand, as my colleagues in the Senate know, I, too, believe that cap-and-\ntrade is a valuable tool for emissions control programs. In this case, \nI believe that cap-and-trade is the wrong tool to use, at least without \nspecific technology requirements and much more stringent reduction \nrequirements. Connecticut suffers from deposition of mercury emitted \nfrom upwind sources, and many highly populated areas within range of \npower plants are seeing significant deposition. To deal with mercury \nemissions, the case is strong, and the Clean Air Act reflects this, for \nrequiring plant-by-plant controls.\n  At the same time, the EPA did next to nothing in its rulemaking to \nrefute this case and to demonstrate that power plants' mercury \nemissions were only widely dispersed and yielded no local deposition. \nInstead, the EPA used an atmospheric model that masked, rather than \nrevealed, whether mercury emissions have local deposition impacts. The \nEPA's model divided the Nation's atmosphere into a hypothetical grid of \nindividual parcels that, at 500 square miles each, were so big that the \nmodel simply could not detect local emissions plumes and deposition \neven if it were occurring. When the model is run, the emissions of any \nlarge power plant within any of the model's grids are immediately \ndispersed by the model throughout the entire volume of that 500 square \nmile grid; the model simply cannot detect localized deposition \noccurring in any area smaller than 500 square miles! Thus, this \ntechnique cannot possibly reveal local effects occurring downwind of a \nlarge source. In effect, the model design itself created a self-\nfulfilling prophecy, which could only show the result that EPA wanted--\nthat power plants emissions were dispersed, with no local deposition. \nIn these circumstances, EPA has failed to make its case that cap and \ntrade is the right tool to achieve both overall reductions and prevent \nharmful local effects.\n  Lastly, there is reason to believe that EPA overstated the role of \nglobal mercury emissions in high-deposition areas. If so, the case for \nplant-specific reduction requirements is even stronger. At the same \ntime, even if one of the\n\n[[Page S9961]]\n\nkeys to addressing mercury deposition in the U.S. is inducing other \ncountries to reduce their emissions, there can be no more effective way \nto accomplish that than if the U.S. itself adopts stringent controls on \nits own power plants and thus stimulates the development and widespread \nuse of the technologies to achieve those reductions. If we want other \nNations to follow our policies and use our technologies then we must \nact first.\n  For these reasons, Congress must adopt this resolution and the EPA \nmust go back to the drawing board and produce a mercury program that \nwill truly protect the American people.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, earlier today I was necessarily detained \nfrom voting on S.J. Res. 20, ``A Joint Resolution disapproving a rule \npromulgated by the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency \nto delist coal and oil-direct utility units from the source category \nlist under the Clean Air Act.''\n  Mercury emissions and rulings by Federal agencies concerning the \nenvironment are extremely important. Although my vote would not have \nchanged the outcome, I respectfully request that the Record show that \nhad I been able to cast my vote, I would have joined with the majority \nof Senators who voted to uphold the administration's rulings and \nagainst the resolution of disapproval.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Three minutes.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, we make a mistake when we say this is a \nmatter of cap and trade. It is not. We are talking about a toxic waste, \none that causes birth defects, IQ loss, mental retardation, and \ncontinues to poison children and pregnant women. One-sixth of pregnant \nwomen are affected. That is not cap and trade. This idea that we are \nonly talking about 1 percent, of course, is not the case. Forty percent \nof the mercury comes from the United States. We are talking about the \n40 percent that is affecting our rivers, our streams, our children. Do \nwe simply ignore the proliferation of warnings all over the country \nthat fish caught in our streams and lakes and rivers are unsafe to eat? \nDo we allow this rule to move forward when it has been harshly \ncriticized by the Bush administration's own EPA inspector general? When \nthe Government Accountability Office has said there are major \nshortcomings in the analysis? Or do we uphold the bipartisan work that \nproduced the Clean Air Act that protects the health of pregnant women \nand children and try and clean this up now?\n  Every one of us will give speeches about how family friendly we are. \nWe are talking about children. We are talking about pregnant women. I \ncan't think of anything more family friendly than to remove this threat \nof mercury from them. If we vote this down, we are telling a whole \ngeneration of women and children their health is less important than \nenergy company profits. We are going to tell them, rather than go to \nthe scientists, rather than go with what the Bush administration's own \ninspector general said, instead we will take the regulations that were \nwritten, in many parts, verbatim by the industry.\n  What are we going to say to the families who live in the hotspots of \ntoday or tomorrow? This rule is a danger to America's women and \nchildren. It is time to do it over and do it right. I hope my \ncolleagues will support the resolution. This is not a moot point. If we \npass this resolution, maybe it will be enough of a signal to have \npeople go back and do what the inspector general of the EPA said, what \nthe Government Accountability Office has said, and actually do it \nright, actually follow their own procedures.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, let me address a couple things that were \nstated. First, let me inquire as to the time remaining.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 2 minutes 30 seconds \nremaining. The Senator from Vermont has no time remaining.\n  Mr. INHOFE. First, it is the Energy Information Administration that \ncame out and did the study on this. They said that there would be fuel \nswitching. I only have to ask the question, if you are not able to use \ncoal-fired plants, what are you going to switch to? Is it going to be \nwindmills? There would be fuel switching, and it would have a \ndevastating effect in terms of the problems that already exist in terms \nof the cost of natural gas.\n  The Senator from Vermont is passionate on this subject, and I don't \nwant to be critical. But in talking about hotspots, that is the same \nthing that they said about acid rain--there are going to be hotspots--\nand it didn't happen. Thirdly, the point that was brought up on being \nfamily friendly. When you look at the fact that they say studies show \nthat not a single woman or child has a blood mercury level approaching \nthe level at which even the smallest affect was observed in any study, \nwhere is the real problem there? If you want to be family friendly, \nlet's be a little concerned about the cost of fertilizer, about the \ncost of heating our homes when winter comes.\n  This is an exercise in futility. The President has already announced \nif this thing should pass--they will feel good and rejoice--he will \nveto it, and you can't override a veto. It is a done deal. The current \nrule regulates mercury for the first time. The current rule's cost is \n$2 billion, as opposed to $358 billion, a huge difference. A vote for \nthis rule is a vote to drive the remaining chemical plants overseas. A \nvote for this rule is going to be a vote to increase the cost of \nfertilizer for every farmer in America. The cap and trade worked on \nacid rain, and it will work accurately now. All the talk about U.S. \npowerplants. They only contribute 1 percent of the mercury that is in \nthe system now globally.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired. All time \nhas expired.\n  Under the previous order, the Senate will proceed to a vote on \npassage of the joint resolution.\n  The question is on the engrossment and third reading of the joint \nresolution.\n  The joint resolution was ordered to be engrossed for a third reading \nand was read the third time.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The joint resolution having been read the third time, the question \nis, Shall it pass?\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senators \nLevin, Schumer, Obama, Clinton, and Boxer be added as cosponsors of \nthis amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, all of America is hurting with the \nKatrina victims and their families. We are finding ways to help, to \nreach out, to make a difference in these critical weeks following the \nhurricane and the horrible disaster. Americans are donating record \namounts of money, time, and supplies to help those displaced by the \nhurricane. The most important thing to do now is to save life, to \nprovide shelter, food, and medical care for the people affected by this \ntragedy.\n  As is happening in many States, last week two jetliners arrived in \nMichigan with the first group of 289 hurricane evacuees. Troops and \nvolunteers at our Battle Creek Air National Guard base are providing \nclean shelter, food, and clothing to all of these Americans. Last \nFriday, 46 more Americans were welcomed into Michigan, and we expect \nmany more in the coming weeks.\n  We also have several Michigan State police teams, and more than 500 \nmembers of the Michigan National Guard in Louisiana and Mississippi \nassisting with relief efforts.\n  There are stories about people all across our great Nation who are \nanswering the call to help the men and women who have been displaced \nand hurt by the hurricane. In Michigan, families and businesses are \nworking together to help the victims. Michigan-based Whirlpool, for \nexample, is donating $1 million in cash and products for Hurricane \nKatrina relief efforts.\n  On Friday, the State of Michigan held a statewide on-air fundraiser \nwhere Michiganians generously donated time and dollars for Red Cross \nhurricane relief efforts.\n  There are so many individual stories of heroism and generosity rising \nfrom the depth of this catastrophe, both in the States affected by the \nhurricane and in communities such as mine all across America. These are \nimportant stories right now--saving lives, finding shelter, food, and \nmedical care, and raising money to help hurricane victims. But there is \nanother story to tell here as well. It is about the Federal Government \nand our responsibility to all Americans to be prepared not only for \nthis kind of disaster but for a coordinated response to help save lives \nand prevent chaos.\n  We all watched in horror the images of families trapped in New \nOrleans after the hurricane; mothers with babies and young children \nstranded on highway overpasses, making their desperate pleas for help; \nfamilies clinging to the roof of their flooded home, waving the shirts \noff their backs for help; senior citizens trapped in flooded nursing \nhomes without food, water, and medical care. An estimated 55,000 people \nwere stranded in the New Orleans Superdome and convention center, left \nfor days--left for days--without food, water, and working bathrooms, \nwaiting to be rescued. Thousands of people sat outside the Superdome in \nthe heat and the filth for days waiting for convoys of buses which were \nslow to arrive because of FEMA's lack of planning and poor \ncommunication.\n  How could this happen in the United States of America, the greatest \ncountry on Earth? How could this happen? How could we allow stranded \npeople to die without getting them water and food and medical care?\n  In this time immediately following this disaster, we have an \nobligation to correct the mistakes on crisis response. We need to \naddress how the Federal Government could have better handled the \nresponse to Hurricane Katrina and what should have been done to prevent \nthe disorder and death that followed this tragedy. It is absolutely \ncritical that local communities have the tools they need to \ncommunicate, coordinate, and respond effectively when disaster hits. \nThey did not have that in New Orleans and the other places that were \nhit, where the police departments in three nearby parishes were on \ndifferent radio systems. They did not have enough satellite phones. \nThey had ground and cell phone lines that were taken out with this \nstorm. The communications systems they did have, like most in local \ncommunities across the Nation, were not interoperable. They were not \nconnected. They didn't work together. Police officers called Senator \nLandrieu's office, and I am sure Senator Vitter's office as well, \nbecause they could not reach commanders on the ground in New Orleans.\n  In the absence of communication with other emergency responders due \nto the lack of interoperability, power, or dying batteries, responders \nshared satellite phones that were in short supply.\n  According to Aaron Broussard, president of the Jefferson Parish, FEMA\n\n[[Page S9963]]\n\ncame in, and, without warning, cut the emergency communication lines \nfor local law enforcement and hooked up their own. Local law \nenforcement and first responders were left without any way to \ncommunicate with each other.\n  This collapse in communications was not just a local and State \nproblem. FEMA, who is supposed to be coordinating the Federal response \nand helping rescue evacuees, was working in the dark. In several \ninterviews, former FEMA Director Brown admitted that FEMA learned about \n25,000 hungry, and in some cases dying, people trapped in the New \nOrleans convention center from listening to news reports. Even he \nconceded that emergency assistance and delivery problems were caused by \n``the total lack of communication''--the inability to hear and have \ngood intelligence on the ground. We knew before Katrina hit that too \nmany of our police and fire and emergency medical services and \ntransportation officials cannot communicate with each other, and our \nlocal departments are not able to link their communications with State \nand Federal emergency response agencies.\n  The September 11 attack highlighted the interoperability crisis when \nNew York police and firefighters, while on different radio systems, \ncouldn't communicate when we had police officers and firefighters \nrunning in the buildings that they should have been running out of \nbecause they weren't able to communicate with the others on floors \nabove them to know what was happening. Over 50 different public safety \norganizations from Maryland, Virginia, and the District of Columbia \nreported to the Pentagon, but they could not talk to each other. The \nresult of this lack of connectedness in communications is nothing short \nof chaos.\n\n  This past Sunday, Thomas Kean, the former Republican Governor of New \nJersey, an esteemed cochair of the 9/11 Commission, said that the \nFederal Government's response was similar to September 11, including \nfirst responders not being able to talk to each other and a lack of \ncommand and control. The Commission's cochair, Lee Hamilton, also told \nCNN that ``he has had an uneasy feeling for a long time that the \ngovernment simply was not acting with a sense of crisis, with a sense \nof urgency.'' Now I hope and pray we have that sense of urgency.\n  A June 2004 U.S. Conference of Mayors survey found that 94 percent of \nour cities do not have interoperable capability between police, fire, \nand emergency medical services, and 60 percent of our cities do not \nhave that same capability with the State emergency operations centers. \nMajority Leader Frist spoke in the Senate last week about seeing this \nproblem firsthand in the gulf coast, how people were working without \nfunctioning radios and could not communicate from one end of the \nairport terminal to the other, much less to another building or another \npart of town.\n  Almost half of the cities surveyed said that a lack of interoperable \ncommunications had made response to an incident within the last year \ndifficult. The most startling finding was that over 80 percent of \ncities do not have interoperable communications with the Department of \nHomeland Security or the Department of Justice. Heaven forbid, if there \nis another natural disaster or terrorist attack soon, our communities \nwill not be able to communicate with FEMA or the Department of Homeland \nSecurity.\n  Michigan first responders have told me, as I have said before in the \nSenate, that they have to watch the cable news to get notifications of \nraised alert levels because they are not able to be contacted by the \nDepartment of Homeland Security. As I mentioned before, FEMA found out \nabout the 25,000 people trapped in the New Orleans convention center \nfrom watching the news reports.\n  Last Sunday was the fourth anniversary, as we all know, of the \nhorrendous attacks on September 11, and this is the State of our \nFederal communications and emergency response system? We can do better. \nIt is time to have a sense of urgency and do better.\n  They are only beginning the process of recovering the bodies of the \nKatrina victims in the gulf coast. Some of these victims lost their \nlives because of the hurricane. How many lost their lives because of \nthe poor disaster response and the total lack of communications? How \nmany lost their lives because they were left without food or water for \ndays, without any hope of aid, and no ability to communicate? How many \nlost their lives because they were trapped in their homes, in churches, \nand highway overpasses waiting to be rescued? How many lost their lives \nbecause they were elderly and sick or dying and stranded without \nmedical care or medicine? How many of these lives would have been saved \nif FEMA had been able to communicate with local first responders and \nhospitals and get good information on where to send help first, what \nwas most urgent? FEMA failed these victim and their families. There is \na wide understanding of that. This is unconscionable in terms of the \nlack of infrastructure and communications. The lack of communications \nis a crisis, and we are putting our communities in danger. We need to \naddress this now. We all need to address it, together.\n  Two months ago in the Senate, I offered an amendment to provide $5 \nbillion for interoperable communications equipment grants for first \nresponders to the Homeland Security appropriations bill. The amendment, \nunfortunately, was defeated. Why? Many stated it was a local \nresponsibility to pay for this equipment. But how is communication, \nconnecting all across the country--local, State, and Federal--to \nrespond to a national emergency or regional emergency, how is this a \nlocal responsibility when we have seen what happened?\n  I know none of my colleagues believe rebuilding from the devastation \nof Hurricane Katrina is a local responsibility alone or that somehow \nhelping those who have lost their homes, lost so much, that somehow \nthat is a local responsibility alone. We understand we have a \nresponsibility, together, to help these Americans, and everyone is \ncoming together to do that. No one in the Senate is saying it is a \nlocal responsibility to rebuild the gulf coast.\n  After September 11, we came together. The terrorists did not just \nattack New York and Washington, DC; they attacked the entire country. \nWe responded by coming together and having a Federal response. Why is \nit, then, that communications equipment that would allow local, State, \nand Federal first responders to coordinate and work as a team has been \nconsidered a local responsibility? I hope that will no longer be the \ncase. Coordinated communications would decrease the loss of life and \nthe devastation of a natural disaster such as Hurricane Katrina and in \nthe case of terrorism could very well prevent an attack.\n\n  That is why I am again offering my amendment. My amendment provides \n$5 billion for interoperable communications grants for America's first \nresponders to provide a strong Federal commitment to address this \nproblem.\n  Estimates from the GAO and the Congressional Budget Office place the \ncost of equipping America's first responders with interoperable \ncommunication in excess of $15 billion. In November 2003, the CBO \ntestified before Congress that there is insufficient funding in place \nto solve the Nation's interoperability problem and that it would cost \nover $15 billion to move us in the direction of solving the problem. \nThis $5 billion provides a strong Federal commitment toward the goal. I \nhope we will make that commitment to do that investment this year, next \nyear, and the year after, and complete this issue and get it right, \nsolve this problem. There is no time to wait. We need to act now. We \nshould have acted before. I am hopeful we will come together now and \nact.\n  The Federal Government has not made a significant commitment to solve \nthis problem up to this point. In previous years, tiny amounts of money \nhave been allocated to interoperability projects on a very small scale. \nObviously, it has been not enough to get the job done. According to the \nDepartment of Homeland Security, since September 11 the Department of \nHomeland Security has spent only $280 million directly on interoperable \ncommunications. None of these funds have been provided to help State \nand local emergency responders purchase the equipment they need so they \ncan talk with each other.\n  Nearly 4 years after September 11, 2001, the top request for support \nI receive each year from communities in Michigan is for communications \nequipment and connectedness, the ability to\n\n[[Page S9964]]\n\ntalk with each other. In Michigan, we still have police departments \nthat cannot talk to the fire department, the sheriff who cannot talk to \nthe local community, and those who are not able to talk with Homeland \nSecurity or State authorities.\n  We in government failed the people of the gulf coast because we did \nnot address this sooner. Now we need to provide the resources to make \nsure the communications equipment works, it is interoperable, and that \nthey can get the job done in the future to save lives and respond--\nwhether it is a terrorist attack or a natural disaster.\n  This shock and horror of the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina will live \nwith us forever. We salute the heroes of this disaster, and our prayers \nare with the victims.\n  The American people, as they always do, rose to the challenge and are \nhelping out all across this great country. I again am so proud of all \nwe are doing in the great State of Michigan. We have to step up and \nshow leadership and do our part, do what we can and should do but only \nwe can do, and that is to make sure that across the country we have \ndone the job to put together the communications infrastructure to make \nsure in case of emergency all of our citizens--State, local, Federal \nofficials--can talk to each other, can respond with efficiency and \neffectiveness, and can do what needs to be done to save lives and save \ncommunities. We have the power to do that.\n  I ask support for my amendment and urge all of my colleagues to \nsupport this effort to get this done. We need a sense of urgency. If we \ndo not feel it now, I don't know when we will. I hope we will get this \ndone.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I rise to lend my support to amending \nthe Commerce-State-Justice appropriations bill for the purposes of \nproviding additional grant money to fund interoperable communications \nfor our first responders.\n  I compliment my colleague from Michigan, Senator Stabenow, for \nbringing this up and helping us to address, in an expeditious fashion, \nsome very dire needs that exist out there among those on whom we depend \nthe most.\n  In many instances, whether it is a natural disaster or any kind of an \nemergency circumstance, we find our first responders, without a doubt, \nare those who come to our aid first and foremost.\n  Without a doubt, in this age of technology and advanced \ncommunications, there is no excuse for us, as a nation, to not be able \nto provide to our first responders and to all of our Government \nassistance agencies the kind of communication that keeps us connected.\n  This past week, I visited some evacuees from Katrina in my home State \nof Arkansas. Our people in Arkansas are our greatest asset. I have \nalways said that. Watching the Governor, he moved quickly to put people \ninto place and to put systems into place to find available beds at \neverything from church camps to gymnasiums and other places, to move \nquickly to put into place something the Red Cross could respond to and \nso that evacuees could get to a place where they could begin to find \nsome comfort and to be able to relax a little bit from the unbelievable \nexperiences they have been going through.\n  I found, in one of these evacuee camps, the Red Cross had gone in and \nhad taken a lot of the registry information of individuals so they \ncould help reconnect them with their families and make sure they could \nmake available the information that they were safe and where they were \nlocated. They did this for a tremendous number of evacuees, only to \nfind that when FEMA finally arrived in Arkansas, several days later, \ntheir communication systems were not compatible. So we had to get \nvolunteers from the local school to come in and reenter all of the \ninformation about these evacuees so they could also get their presence, \nthrough the FEMA modes of communication, out to all the different \noutlets where, hopefully, they could reconnect with their families.\n  We are in a day and age where communication should be easier than we \nare making it. There is no doubt there is technology that is more \nadvanced than what we are providing in cases of emergency and \nparticularly to our first responders.\n  A little over 4 years ago, this Nation confronted an attack like no \nother. We remembered, on September 11 of this year, September 11 of \n2001. It was a day none of us will ever forget. That day showed us our \nweaknesses as well as our strengths. We vowed, at that time, to learn \nfrom our mistakes, great and small. One of the issues we learned we \nneeded to address was the ability of our first responders, whether they \nbe Federal, State, or local, to communicate with one another in an \nemergency situation in order that they all may do the best job possible \nfor those whom they are trying to serve.\n  Four years have passed since we, as a nation, became painfully aware \nof the need to address this deficiency in our communication systems.\n  With twin boys who are 9 years old, who are quickly getting into lots \nof different types of activities--whether it is baseball or soccer, \nwhether it is the chess club or learning how to play a musical \ninstrument--I continually tell them: Just do your best. Just do your \nbest. All anyone can ask of you is to do your best. Then you can be \nconfident you have given your all and that you have done your best. And \nas you continue to try to do your best, you will always improve.\n  Think of how our first responders must feel when they know, with a \nlittle bit of today's technology, they could be doing better, they \ncould be doing their best. They could be doing their best saving lives, \nreuniting families, bringing to people the kind of help and aid they \nhave been trained to bring. There is no greater, more horrific feeling \nthan to know you are capable of providing something such as that and \nyet are handicapped in being able to do your very best.\n  We recently had our first wide-scale test of what progress we have \nmade with respect to this problem in communication. The results have \nbeen less than stellar. It is painfully clear we have not made the \nstrides we must if we are to have the American people's confidence that \ntheir Government maintains a basic level of competence in times of \nemergency.\n  Emergency responders from my home State, the State of Arkansas, \nrushed to Louisiana after Hurricane Katrina hit. Being a neighbor to \nthe north, we wanted to do all we possibly could do to help our \nneighbors in their time of need. When they arrived, they found they \ncould not communicate properly with officials in the area. They lost \nprecious time which could have been better spent getting help to \nvictims, saving lives, rescuing individuals, doing their very best.\n  In considering whether to support this amendment, I asked myself a \nsimple question: Are the communications tools that our brave first \nresponders have at their disposal the best we have to offer? The answer \nis clearly no. We as a nation, we as a people, we, as a human race, \nwith the good minds that God has given us, have produced technology \nthat can assist them in doing their very best as responders in \nemergency situations. We can do better. With this amendment, we will \ngive our first responders the ability to respond, using the skills, \nusing the talents they have developed, using the very courage that is \nin their hearts and in their minds to help their fellow man.\n  I have seen what happens when we put our minds to correcting similar \ncommunications problems. We have an example in our own State of \nArkansas called Justice Exchange. It is an innovative program that \nallows law enforcement officials to check the records of people they \nhave arrested from around the country. It started with a small grant we \nwere able to get for our Sheriffs' Association in the State of \nArkansas. Working with computer operators and technology, we were able \nto design a system that was compatible, Web-based, so we could, in \nturn, share it with other States, other law enforcement agencies across \nthe Nation.\n  A great example: A deputy in one of our counties southwest of Little \nRock picked up a man on a traffic violation,\n\n[[Page S9965]]\n\nbut he had a little bit of a suspicion. He held him, detained him for a \nwhile, and tried to look him up on the computer. The name did not \nproduce anything. So he asked one of the other deputies to go back and \nsee if he could get a real name from this gentleman. In building that \ntrust, he got a real name. He put it in the computer and found out that \nindividual was wanted for two counts of murder--two counts of murder--\nin New Jersey or one of the other east coast States.\n  The fact is, in communicating, in building a system where people can \nshare information and work together, such as in our law enforcement, we \ncan solve so many of these problems.\n  This is not technology that is brand new. Much of it has been here \nfor the last decade, to be able to connect and to use compatible \nsoftware and compatible technology so these groups can communicate.\n  I think this amendment represents a very important step toward \nhelping our first responders save lives. I believe it is the best \nreason to support this amendment. I encourage my colleagues to \nrecognize the opportunity we have to say, after the horrific natural \ndisaster that occurred in the Gulf Coast, we have learned enough to \nknow our first responders need our help. They need current-day \ntechnology to be able to do the very best they are trained to do.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coleman). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1665\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I have offered an amendment that is \npending on this appropriations bill, and I wanted to speak to that \namendment in the hope that we will be able to get a vote on that \namendment at some point soon.\n  The amendment deals with trade, and because this appropriations bill \ndeals with funding for the Department of Commerce and also the U.S. \nTrade Representative, this is the right place to propose that \namendment.\n  Let me begin by talking for a moment about what is happening in \ntrade. As you know, we have the largest trade deficit in the history of \nour country by far. It continues to grow and grow and grow and grow. \nThis trade deficit is dangerous. It is irresponsible for us to continue \nto run these kinds of trade deficits. Yet nearly every day in this \ncountry, 7 days a week, all year long, we are importing about $2 \nbillion more than we are exporting. We are importing a substantial \namount of product--yes, energy and food but shirts and shoes and \ntrinkets and trousers--from every part of the world, and the fact is we \nare exporting American jobs.\n  Let me describe a couple of those jobs, and then I am going to \ndescribe what my amendment does.\n  A young woman named Natasha Humphries did what we are supposed to do \nin this country. She did everything American workers are supposed to do \nto compete in this global economy. She got a degree from Stanford \nUniversity in 1996. She went to work for Apple Computer. She continued \nto acquire all kinds of new skills in high tech through classes and \nseminars. And she moved down to become a senior software testing \nengineer at palmOne, the company that makes the well-known hand held \ncomputing device called Palm Pilot. I want to show you the last message \nthat this young woman left on her Palm Pilot. Natasha Humphries left \nthis message on her Palm Pilot:\n\n       My job has gone to India.\n\n  She lost her job. Natasha Humphries got fired and the company moved \nall those jobs to India. Oh, there is one more thing. Natasha was \nrequired by her company to train the Indian workers who took her job. \nAnd so the company, searching for lower priced labor, fires American \nworkers and moves their jobs to India. That was 2002 that palmOne's \nmanagement decided to move all their product testing to India and China \nwhere they can pay $2 an hour and less. They learned that some of those \nworkers were not quite as productive as the American workers, but they \ndecided to make a change, so that the workers in India were more \nproductive, by sending American engineers to India. And so they sent \nAmerican workers to India, trained the Indian engineers and then came \nback and fired the American workers. And so Natasha was laid off August \n2003, along with 40 percent of her U.S. coworkers. She sued palmOne for \nwrongful termination. She also filed a reverse discrimination case.\n  Then she found herself on the unemployment line struggling to cover \nhealth care costs for her 6-year-old son who has sickle cell anemia. So \nthis is a message from this Stanford graduate, this engineer:\n\n       My job has gone to India.\n\n  It could have been a message repeated 1.5 million times. Oh, not by \nanybody who wears a blue suit, though, who is in the Senate; nobody who \nwears suspenders and smokes cigars and wears blue suits and in big \nbusiness or politics ever loses their jobs. It is the other folks who \nlose their jobs.\n  Let me describe a few. You recognize this. Fruit of the Loom. You \nknow Fruit of the Loom; they had advertised with the folks who wear \ngrape outfits, red grapes, apples, the fruit folks, catchy little \ncommercials on television, except that Fruit of the Loom has now left \nAmerica. If you are wearing Fruit of the Loom shorts today, you are \nwearing Chinese shorts or Mexican shorts. Or you are wearing Chinese T-\nshirts or Mexican T-shirts. Yes, it is clever and cute, except that \n3,200 people who worked for Fruit of the Loom in the United States of \nAmerica don't work for them anymore because these shirts and shorts and \nthe things that Fruit of the Loom makes are gone. They are gone in \nsearch of 30-cent-an-hour labor.\n  I will not speak at great length about Huffy bicycles because I have \nspoken at great length about Huffy bicycles so often, except to say \nthis. This is a new decal between the handlebars and the fenders, and \nyou will see it is a decal of the globe. That used to be an American \nflag when American workers produced them, but the American workers made \n11 dollars an hour plus, so all those jobs went to China.\n  Now Huffy pays its workers 33 cents an hour, 7 days a week, 12 to 14 \nhours a day and, by the way, there is no more American flag on this \nbike. It is a globe. Oh, they still call Huffy an American brand. It is \njust not made in America, and all the American workers who used to make \nit lost their jobs.\n  You remember the television commercials about the Maytag repairman \nreally struggling to stay awake because you don't repair a Maytag. \nWell, 1,600 Maytag U.S. jobs have gone to Mexico and Korea.\n  Big Blue, IBM. It is interesting, the paper trail from IBM; 13,000 \nIBM workers in Europe and the United States went to India where they \nhired more than 14,000 workers, and if you look at the internal \ndocuments, IBM said, Oh, by the way, we do not want to suggest to our \nemployees this is offshoring or outsourcing; never use those words.\n  The last thing they wrote to their employees was: This has nothing to \ndo with your performance. Oh, no, it is never personal, is it? It has \nnothing to do with your performance that you are losing your job.\n  Trade deal after trade deal, trade agreement after trade agreement, \nthrough Democratic and Republican administrations, have been \nincompetent, fundamentally incompetent in standing up for the economic \ninterests of this country. Who on Earth is going to stand up for the \ninterests of American workers?\n  People say: But you don't understand, Senator Dorgan, this is the way \nof the future; this is a global economy. It is global all right. We \ngalloped along toward the global economy, but the rules have not kept \npace. So we are now able to go to the big box stores and buy products \nthat were made by sweat labor of people who all too often are earning \n20, 30, 40 cents an hour, maybe $1 an hour, and no benefits, working 6 \ndays a week, 7 days a week. And we say to the American workers, that is \nwhat you should compete with?\n  We have been through a trade agreement called GATT, a trade agreement \nwith the United States and Canada, one with the United States and \nCanada and Mexico called NAFTA, a trade agreement called CAFTA, the \nCentral American Free Trade Agreement. We have been through all these \nfree-trade agreements. Every trade agreement we\n\n[[Page S9966]]\n\napproved--I should say without my vote in support--has resulted in a \nlarger trade deficit for this country.\n  Why is that the case? They are negotiated incompetently by American \nnegotiators who do not stand up for the economic interests of this \ncountry. They feel they have nothing to protect.\n  Right now we have something called the Doha round. Have you been to \nDoha recently? I suspect not. There is a reason they do these trade \nrounds in far, out of the way places. In Doha, they are negotiating new \ntrade agreements behind closed doors, in secret. Does anybody here know \nwhat those trade agreements are, what might be in them? We know this: \nThere are 100 separate proposals in this round of trade negotiations, \n100 separate proposals by other countries that would weaken the \nremedies in American trade law to protect our interests.\n  We also know our trade negotiators have said everything is on the \ntable, meaning they are willing to negotiate away, if necessary, the \nprotections in our trade laws. These are the laws that allow us to \nimpose countervailing duties on other countries that wish to sell \nunfairly subsidized products into our marketplace and destroy a \ndomestic industry. They are willing to negotiate away our antidumping \nlaws that would allow another country to dump products into our country \nat below cost and destroy an American industry or business and jobs.\n  Why would American negotiators be willing to put that on the table? \nAre they not willing to stand up for this country's economic interests, \nfor this country's jobs, good jobs?\n  The amendment I have offered is very simple, painfully simple. \nInterestingly enough, the White House has issued a veto warning should \nmy amendment prevail in the Senate today.\n  My amendment is very simple. My amendment says no funds in this act \nfunding the U.S. Trade Representative's office and the Commerce \nDepartment may be used to be involved in negotiations that will weaken \nAmerica's protections in trade law, the protections that exist--\ncountervailing duties, antidumping--nothing shall be done or can be \ndone using these funds in this act to weaken America's trade laws to \nprotect our economic interests.\n  For that, we get a letter from Secretary Gutierrez and Rob Portman, \nthe U.S. Trade Representative, saying they strongly oppose this \namendment. We heard all morning the administration will recommend a \nveto if this is adopted.\n  Let me give a bit of background. On May 14, 2002, 61 Senators voted \nfor an amendment that Senators Dayton, Craig, and I cosponsored. That \namendment said that any trade agreement that weakened U.S. trade laws, \nespecially remedies that protect our country against unfair trade, \ncould not be considered by the Senate under fast-track rules. Sixty-one \nSenators voted for that amendment. It is essentially the same as the \namendment I am offering today.\n  The question is, Are you going to stand up for the economic interests \nof this country?\n  I don't even know where to start or stop when I talk about trade \nbecause the pain of bad trade agreements is not a pain inflicted on \nthose who are privileged, and that includes all of us because we have \nnot lost our jobs. But no country will long remain a world economic \npower if it does not have a strong, vibrant manufacturing base. The \nmanufacturing jobs traditionally and historically in this country have \nbeen the jobs that pay well, the jobs that have good benefits.\n  It is interesting, when we take a look at the changes from 30, 35, 40 \nyears ago, the largest corporation in our country was General Motors. \nThey paid good wages, they paid very substantial benefits, and most \npeople who went to work for General Motors worked there for a lifetime. \nNow the largest American corporation, I am told, is Wal-Mart. Their \nwages are not so hot, do not have many benefits for a lot of their \nworkers, the average wage is $17,000 a year, and their turnover is \nabout 70 percent. If those figures are wrong, perhaps someone can \ncorrect me.\n  The point I am making simply is this: Times have changed. Those who \ncontrol the economic levers in this country--bigger and bigger \nenterprises--have decided that it is in their interest to find the \nlowest cost labor in the world with the least nuisance attached to that \nlabor. That is the nuisance of not being able to hire children, the \nnuisance of not being able to pollute the rivers or pollute the air. If \nthey can find labor under those circumstances, employ it, and then \nproduce the shirts, socks, shoes, trinkets, and toys, and ship them to \nthe American marketplace, have them sit on the store shelf in Los \nAngeles, Fargo, Denver, Tampa, or New York and have the consumers buy \nthose products, that somehow everyone will be better off. That is as \nflawed a set of economic assumptions as I have seen in my studies of \neconomics. This is not working, and yet everyone insists it is.\n\n  Let me put up the chart that shows our trade deficits. I went to a \nsmall school, I told my colleagues before, a high school senior class \nof nine in a small farming community. I was in the top five, and that \nqualified me for the Senate from back home. But I was smart enough \ncoming from that school to understand what this is. This is a barrel \nfull of trouble--deep, deep, and deeper Federal trade deficits every \nsingle year. This is running in the wrong direction and hurting our \ncountry.\n  Does anybody seem to care much at all? Is the President paying any \nattention to this? Does Congress pay much attention to this? Nobody. \nNo, we all have to pretend this is working well, like this is good for \nour country. We put on our pressed blue suits every morning and talk \nabout how wonderful all of this is.\n  Maybe if the politicians' jobs were at stake, maybe if some CEOs' \njobs were at stake they would have a different view.\n  Let me give a couple examples of what concerns me. I have talked at \ngreat length about unfair trade. I could give you a good many examples. \nOne example: We are now negotiating with Korea. Let me talk about \nautomobile trade with Korea.\n  Last year, we took from Korea about 680,000 automobiles into our \nmarketplace for the American consumer to purchase; 680,000 Korean cars \ncame here from Korea. Guess how many American cars we sold in Korea--\n3,800. That is right, 680,000 coming in this direction, and we sold \n3,800 cars in Korea. Is that because they don't want American cars in \nKorea? No, it is because the Koreans don't want cars sold in Korea \ncoming from the United States, and they have all kinds of policies and \ninteresting devices to try to shut down the sale of U.S. automobiles to \nKorea; otherwise, what would explain that dramatic imbalance?\n  That is how out of whack our trade policy is. Let me describe to you \nanother example of this incompetence. This country did a bilateral \ntrade agreement with China just a few years ago. The agreement said \nthat after a phase-in, any U.S. cars we would sell in China would bear \na tariff of 25 percent. Any Chinese cars they would sell in America \nwould bear a tariff of 2.5 percent. So our negotiators sat down with a \ncountry with whom we had a trade deficit of somewhere around $100 \nbillion a year and said: With respect to automobiles, you can charge a \ntariff that is 10 times higher than that which we will charge on \nbilateral automobile trade.\n  That is just incompetence, in my judgment, and a failure to stand up \nfor this country's economic interests.\n  Oh, yes, this is a footnote: China is ramping up a very significant \nautomobile industry. General Motors, as a matter of fact, has sued an \nenterprise in China called Chery, C-h-e-r-y, one letter away from \n``Chevy.'' By the way, General Motors sued them for stealing production \nline blueprints for a car called QQ. And China is moving very rapidly \nto develop an automobile industry, a robust industry, and one that will \nbe an export industry.\n  Mark my words, Chinese cars will be sold in this country because our \nnegotiators agreed to a proposition that they could impose a tariff 10 \ntimes higher on U.S. cars sold in China than we would impose on Chinese \ncars sold in the United States.\n  I would like to find the name of the negotiator who agreed to that \nbecause that person was not standing up for American workers, American \nbusiness, or America's economic future.\n  I talked about cars from Korea, and a bilateral agreement on \nautomobile trade from China. I could talk about dozens and dozens of \nsimilar circumstances. The list goes on and on.\n\n[[Page S9967]]\n\n  The letter I received from the White House with respect to this \namendment is a letter that says:\n\n       By taking off the negotiating table any agreements that \n     would lead to changes in U.S. trade remedy law, the amendment \n     would prevent us from negotiating agreements to improve \n     protections against foreign unfair trade practices.\n\n  What a lot of rubbish. Does anybody really think that they are going \nto negotiate an improvement to protections for this country in trade? I \ndon't think so. They don't intend to negotiate improvements. What is \ngoing to happen is, they will put the antidumping and countervailing \nduty laws on the table for negotiating. They have said they are willing \nto put them on the table, and they will get negotiated away.\n  These negotiations are not about any strengthening of our trade \nprotections. I know ``protection'' is a dirty word among those who \nstand on the street corners in robes and chant free trade, but we do \nhave to protect our interests when another company decides to dump into \nour country products that are produced at a much higher cost than they \nare willing to be sold in this country because they want to destroy a \ndomestic industry. We have to protect ourselves in that circumstance.\n  The Commerce Secretary and Mr. Portman, the trade ambassador, are \nsaying this amendment would prevent them from improving protections. \nPlease. Our foreign trading partners don't come to the negotiating \ntable looking to strengthen America's trade protections. They come to \nweaken them. And our negotiators are all too willing to trade away our \ntrade laws.\n  No one wants to address this trade crisis. The President has been \nbusy gassing up Air Force One trying to privatize Social Security the \nlast 9 months or so.\n  What I think we ought to do is stare this problem straight in the \neye, just stare this problem straight in the eye and say: This is a \nproblem for our country. This is about America's future. It is about \neconomic growth. It is about opportunity and jobs for our kids. But \nnobody wants to do much of that anymore.\n  Oh, we can compete, they say. Go to school, get a little better \neducational resume, and we can compete. I just described the \ncircumstance of a young woman who competed, and her last message on her \nPalm Pilot, as that young engineer from Stanford lost her job was: My \njob is going to China.\n  This is not a tough choice, it seems to me. This amendment I have \noffered is very straightforward. It will, I am sure, not be the subject \nof substantial debate. I would love to have a debate on the floor of \nthe Senate about this issue. I do not expect to have much of a debate \nbecause those who support all of this trade strategy that has begun to \nweaken this country, the trade strategy that has produced choking trade \ndeficits, they don't talk much about it publicly; they just vote for \nall of this nonsense.\n  My hope is we will have a vote on this.\n  My guess is that at some point in the future, we are going to look \nback and we are going to say, What on Earth happened in this country? \nIt is not as if we didn't have notice. There has been a lot of \ndiscussion these days: Did we have notice? Were we prepared? Did we \ntake action?\n  Let me talk about this crisis, about the loss of American jobs, a lot \nof them. Ask yourself, Did we have notice about this? In the last 10 \nyears, did we have notice that company after company after company did \nnot say the Pledge of Allegiance in the boardroom anymore because they \nare not American companies, they are international enterprises \nresponsible to their stockholders, believing if they can find 30-cent-\nan-hour labor in Indonesia or India or Sri Lanka or China or \nBangladesh, that is where they ought to produce and they ought to do \nthat at the expense of American jobs? My guess is somebody is going to \nlook back at some point soon and say, What on Earth were we thinking, \nsleeping through this problem, deciding that once we had lifted \nourselves up as a country, once we had lifted America up as a country, \nwith minimum wage, safe workplaces, the right to organize, the right to \nunderstand you should not pollute the air and the water as you produce, \nall of those things we did that made this a better place in which to \nlive and all those things we did that grew a middle class in America--\nthat once we decided that, that we ought not to protect it? We are \ngoing to say, Why didn't we decide to protect that? Instead of pushing \nus down, that our goal would have been to pull the others up? Yet that \nhas not been the case. That has not been the strategy. Our strategy is, \nif companies can find cheaper labor, then you just get rid of American \nworkers.\n  I wish to make this point. We have a century of history about these \nissues that many people, especially those who debate this trade issue, \nwant to forget. I mentioned this morning, and I probably should not \nhave, a man named James Fyler. I said James Fyler died of lead \npoisoning--he was shot 55 times. I should not make light of that at \nall. James Fyler was a hero. He died being shot 55 times because on \nApril 20, 1914, he was out demonstrating with other workers in coal \nmines, demanding fairness for workers, demanding the right for workers \nto organize, demanding to lift themselves up for that. He gave his life \nfor that. Think of what people have given of themselves in a century to \nbuild what we built in this country: an understanding that workers have \nrights, an understanding that we have obligations to each other.\n  James Fyler is dead. But what he and others built is an understanding \nabout the freedom to organize--something very important. I could give \nyou names of people who are sitting in prison right now in China who \ndecided to organize their workforce. They were prosecuted, and they are \nsitting in prison in China because you can't organize a workforce \nthere. It doesn't matter what they do to you as a workforce, they have \na right to do that to you, and if you try to organize, you go to \nprison. First you get fired, and if you are lucky that is all that \nhappens. Otherwise you go to prison. All of this somehow seems \nforgotten when you pole-vault over all these issues.\n  Because no one else is here to speak, I wish to make this point a \nlittle differently. I know it is somewhat off of this specific topic, \nbut it relates to it. I was asked some while ago by a young high school \nkid: What is the best speech you have ever heard?\n  You know, I heard a lot of great speeches at various venues, but one \nof the memorable speeches I told him about was a speech in the House of \nRepresentatives to a joint session of the Congress, a speech at which \nthe House and Senate are seated and they normally receive a message \nfrom the President, in most cases the State of the Union. On this date, \nperhaps 15 years ago now, I was seated in the House Chamber when the \nSpeaker was announced by the doorkeeper to the joint session of \nCongress. He walked to the front of the room. He was kind of a chubby \nfellow, about 5 foot 8, handlebar mustache, and the applause waved over \nhim for a long period of time. And then he began to speak. His speech \nwas so unbelievably powerful.\n  He described something we knew from our history books at that moment. \nHe described a Saturday morning in a shipyard in Gdansk, Poland. He \nsaid he had been an unemployed electrician and had been fired from the \njob because he was leading a strike against the Communist government \nfor the right of laborers to be free to organize. On that Saturday \nmorning, he was beaten severely with clubs and fists and, bleeding, he \nwas taken to the edge of the shipyard, hoisted to the top of the \nbarbed-wire fence, and thrown over the shipyard fence into the dirt. He \ntold us he lay in the dirt facedown, bleeding, wondering what to do \nnext.\n  Our history books tell us what he did next. He pulled himself back \nup, and he climbed right back over the fence into that shipyard. Ten \nyears later, this unemployed electrician was introduced to a joint \nsession of Congress as the President of his country. His name was Lech \nWalesa.\n  He said to us this. He said: The Communists in Poland had all the \nguns. We had none. The Communists had all the bullets. We had none. We \nwere armed only with an idea--that people ought to be in control of \ntheir own destiny. Workers ought to have the right to organize. He \nsaid: Ideas are more powerful than guns.\n\n  This common man with uncommon courage--no diplomat, no scholar, no \nmilitary general, no politician, an unemployed electrician--became \nPresident of his country on the power of an\n\n[[Page S9968]]\n\nidea, an idea that this country has embraced for well over a century, \nan idea that seems somehow to be diminished these days by those who \nbelieve it doesn't matter what workers are used. Workers are like \nwrenches--use them, discard them when you are done. Find a wrench on \nthe other side of the globe that is this much less expensive and \nsomehow it will benefit a consumer on this side of the globe, that \nsomehow none of this matters because it is not interconnected. They are \ndead wrong in a manner that is hurting this country and will hurt this \ncountry's future. I want things to be better in other countries, but I \nwant our country to take care of things here at home first and then \naspire to help others to lift themselves up. But it is important that \nour first obligation is to take care of things here in this country. \nThese trade negotiators and these trade agreements are trade agreements \nthat I believe have undermined the economic strength of our country.\n  Once again, I would love to spend 2 hours someday on the floor \ndebating trade issues with my colleagues, but that likely will not \nhappen. That is because while there are plenty of votes for fast track \nand plenty of votes for trade agreements, and it doesn't matter what \nthey contain, there are not many people who want to debate specifics of \nbilateral trade with China or Korea or Europe or Japan. I would love to \ntalk about beef and Japan. I would love to talk about trade sanctions \nwe have taken against the Europeans. Oh man, are we tough. I talk about \nour trade negotiators having no backbone or spine or willingness to \nstand up. We took action against the Europeans when we got upset. We \ndecided to slap duties on truffles, Roquefort cheese, and goose liver. \nThat is going to make our trade partners quake in their boots. My God, \nyou are going to put tariffs on truffles and goose liver.\n  When will this country's trade negotiators and its politicians have \nthe backbone to stand up for the economic interests of that which we \nhave built--a country that produces good jobs that pay well and have \nbenefits, a country that produces that without having to apologize for \nit but that decides it is good for our country to have good jobs that \npay well with good benefits?\n  Mr. President, I spoke far longer than I intended. This amendment is \nan amendment that I have offered. It is germane. It will require a \nvote. My hope is that enough of my colleagues, sufficient numbers of my \ncolleagues will vote to support this and we will send another very \nstrong message to our trade negotiators.\n  I have said earlier that this has happened through Democrat and \nRepublican administrations. Nothing has changed. I would like to see it \nchanged, and I would like to see it changed now. Perhaps with this \namendment we can take a first step in making that change.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I wish to speak briefly. Later on, we are \ngoing to have a vote on the amendment offered by Senator Biden for a \nbillion-dollar expansion of the COPS Program. That proposal is put in \nthe context of Katrina and the effects of Katrina on the Gulf States.\n  I have come to the Chamber a number of times in the last days, \ntalking about how we put forward an orderly process in addressing the \nissue of trying to restore and rehabilitate and help the people who \nhave been impacted by Katrina. The leader, much to his credit, has \nbegun and initiated that process, using the strength of the authorizing \ncommittees that have jurisdiction.\n  What I do not think we want to do is end up with a haphazard, \nrifleshot ``I have a good idea; let's come to the floor and offer an \namendment'' approach to this because we are talking literally of tens, \npotentially hundreds of billions of dollars. We have already spent $60 \nbillion and aggressively stepped forward as a Congress to do that. It \nwas appropriate, and the leader again needs to be congratulated for his \ninitiative when he moved $10 billion when we were essentially on break \nas a Senate and then got up the additional $50 billion last week.\n  But as we move down the road, we need to put coherence and \nthoughtfulness into the money we are spending so the American people \nknow those dollars are going to the people who need them and that they \nare going to help a region that has been dramatically impacted in a way \nthat is effective so the American people can feel their tax dollars are \nbeing used aggressively to support these folks who have been so \noverwhelmed by this catastrophe and that their tax dollars are not \nbeing wasted or misdirected or put into another program or some program \nthat just happens to be a project of interest to a Member of the \nCongress but is not necessarily an immediate issue relative to Katrina.\n  Regrettably, the proposal by Senator Biden falls into that second \ncategory. It is an idea which the Senator has come to the floor with \nmany times. In fact, every time this appropriations bill comes to the \nfloor, the Senator from Delaware proposes an expansion of the COPS \nProgram.\n  I had the good fortune to chair the subcommittee for many years. I \ndealt with the Senator on this issue for many years. For many years, he \nmade the same proposal, and there was no Katrina, there was no \ndisaster, but the proposal was brought forward. Once again, the \nproposal is being brought forward to continue a program, the COPS \nProgram. When President Clinton set it up, he said: We are going to \nhave a COPS Program. We are going to put 100,000 cops on the street, \nand then the program is going to end. That is exactly what he said when \nhe set it up. I was here then, too.\n  We set it up and we funded it, myself and Senator Hollings at the \ntime--Senator Hollings was chairman; I was chairman. He was chairman \nand I was chairman. We funded it until we got to 100,000--in fact, \nuntil we got to 110,000 police officers on the street. Then we said: \nAll right, we have met the goals of this program. Let's, in a unique \nact, at least a unique act for the Federal Government, agree we have \ndone what we said we would do and stop the program, phase it out. We \nhave come close to doing that. Now we have a program focusing on \nputting police officers in school systems that need assistance. That is \nwhat is left of the COPS Program to the extent it is initiated.\n  But to restart this program and say we need to put another $1 billion \ninto it in the name of Katrina is simply not the best way to legislate. \nIt is arbitrary, probably haphazard. Who knows whether that will be a \ndecision that is tied into what the final needs are of the region. Yes, \nthere will be needs, obviously, for assistance to law enforcement in \nthat region, but the original $60 billion put in there--plus, a lot of \nthat is clearly going to flow to first responders--police, fire, \nmedical--because that is what FEMA does. So to suddenly throw this \nout--this is an idea we have to throw into the Katrina mix--is not a \ngood way to legislate. It is especially not a good way to legislate in \nthe context of what we know is going to be a huge effort by us as a \nCongress to address Katrina and where we know under the leadership of \nSenator Frist we are developing a process where the authorizing \ncommittees take a look at what should be done and could be done and \nthey put forward those ideas in an orderly way and prompt way, that \nshould be enforced, and then we can get relief out to these people who \nhave been impacted so dramatically. But it isn't just some idea of some \nSenator who happens to have a project which he has always supported and \nwhich he feels is a good project.\n\n  At some point, as chairman of the Budget Committee or maybe some \nother Senator as a member of the Appropriations Committee, a point of \norder will lie against this amendment because it is outside the budget \nand it is outside the appropriations bill. It should not be brought \nforward in this manner.\n  What we need to do in addressing the issue of what police needs are \nin that region and law enforcement needs are in that region is do it in \nthe context of an overall solution, which is moving through this Senate \nrather rapidly--already $60 billion in the pipeline--but which is done \nin concert with the authorizing committee, in concert with the \nleadership, and in concert, obviously, with the administration.\n  At the correct time, I think we will have some more discussion on \nthis bill.\n  I wanted to lay down at least a few guidelines here because if we \ncontinue on this course, we are going to be waking up 2 or 3 months \nfrom now and we\n\n[[Page S9969]]\n\nwill have probably 10, 15, 20, 30, or 40 new programs or programs which \nhave been expanded with no orderly, constructive, thoughtful process \nbehind them other than the fact that somebody had a good idea and came \nto the floor and said: Let's spend money on that. That isn't going to \nhelp people in that region. That will not make sense to them. What will \nmake sense to them will be to get money to them through an orderly \nmanner, with effective leadership. That is being done--granted, not as \nquickly as it should have been, but it is being done now.\n  We should continue the process of making sure we set priorities and \ndo this in a manner which allows for the money to go where it can be \nmost effectively used, where the American taxpayers know their dollars \nare being used to help the people who have been impacted by this \nhurricane and not simply assist in setting up a program which some \nSenator feels is a nice idea or a good idea or wants to continue.\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a vote occur \nat 4:30 today on the motion to waive with respect to the Biden \namendment, No. 161, with no amendments in order to the amendment prior \nto the vote; provided further that there be 15 minutes equally divided \nfor debate prior to the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, in a few minutes we will begin voting. As \nmost people know, we are on a very important piece of legislation, the \nCommerce-Science-Justice appropriations bill. We have been on it for \nseveral days.\n  As I look through the amendments coming forward, indeed, the \namendments we are considering over the course of the afternoon and \nevening, it is clear we have a challenge. The challenge is to be able \nto comprehensively address the bill with debate and amendments but at \nthe same time not open up the bill to lots of legislation which in many \nways are rifleshots that are related to Katrina or that people are \nattempting to relate to Katrina.\n  I say that in part because it is important we address the underlying \nlegislation which does have some Katrina-related aspects to it. Looking \nat our response to Katrina, I believe there is a right and wrong way to \naddress that natural disaster. We have tried to act and I believe we \nhave acted in this Senate in a very responsive way in terms of having \nan emergency session with the initial $10 billion, having another \nsupplemental for $51.8 billion from two nights ago, authorizing the \naffected courts to meet appropriately outside their jurisdiction, \nannouncing a joint committee we are still working on in terms of the \ncomposition to look at what went right and what went wrong, passing \nlegislation last night on the national flood insurance program. We are \nworking very aggressively to respond in an appropriate way.\n  What I fear and what simply cannot happen is to have individuals \nfocus on the underlying bill and bring in Katrina-related responses \nwhen we are doing our very best and in a bipartisan way using the \ncommittee structure, using the authorizing committees to address \ncomprehensively, rapidly, the emergency that is playing out before us. \nOnce we complete the Commerce-Justice-Science bill, we will move it \nimmediately to conference with the House and get the bill to the \nPresident for his signature prior to the beginning of the new fiscal \nyear, which is 17 days away. That is why I want to stay on the \nappropriations process and do the appropriations related to the \nunderlying bills and not use Katrina to try to pull in other \namendments.\n  Pending to this bill are a whole bunch of amendments. There is a \nwhole long list of amendments the manager and ranking member are \nworking with, offered by my colleagues, many from both sides of the \naisle, but from the other side of the aisle predominantly, that \nostensibly are for Katrina but which increase funding and authorize new \nmajor governmental programs. This is not the place for that.\n  I pledge to work with both sides of the aisle, with the leadership on \nthe other side, to have that appropriate authorizing language addressed \nbut through the appropriate committees and not on these appropriations \nbills. I observe that while Katrina is the reason that is given for a \nlot of these amendments, as we look through them, in many instances \nthey simply increase funding for an existing program, regardless of \nwhether it provides assistance or help directly or even indirectly to \nthe victims of Katrina. I argue that the Biden amendment falls under \nthat category by increasing the COPS Program another $1 billion with no \nspecific targeting to those who are directly affected.\n  I say this after having over the last 10 days directed this Senate, \ndirected and signed by law over $60 billion in immediate assistance to \nthose who are affected by Katrina. In conjunction with the \nadministration and those directly involved in the recovery and \nrebuilding effort in the United States, we have a lot more we are going \nto have to do in the coming days, weeks, and months. But this is not \nthe appropriate bill to be adding spending that has not been vetted \nthrough the various committees of jurisdiction.\n  In our leadership office we have set up an assessment team and look \nforward to working with the Democratic leadership in doing the same \nthing so we can give focus to consider the emergency responses we need \nto consider and also the longer rebuilding and reconstruction responses \nthat have arisen and which we will respond to in a comprehensive, \nexpeditious way with regard to Katrina. That sort of mechanism will \nfacilitate and will better coordinate, rather than having individual \namendments come to the Senate that are in many cases authorizing or \nincreasing spending for preexisting programs, without looking at it in \na more comprehensive way.\n  We owe that to the people affected by the tragedy as well as allowing \na reasonable, efficient operation in the Senate. I will oppose \namendments on the bill that have not gone through a vetting of the \nissues. I promise we will be moving forward on a whole range of these \nissues that are targeted and an appropriate response to Katrina.\n  The manager has spoken directly to this, as well, and I believe the \nchairman of the Committee on the Budget has.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Parliamentary inquiry: Do we have a vote set?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We have a vote at 4:40.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent I be able to speak--I hope to \nfinish in 5 minutes, but if I don't, I ask consent I be allowed to \ncomplete my statement before the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I understand the consternation of the \ndistinguished majority leader. I spend a lot of time with him. It is \nhard to manage this unwieldy body. I understand that. I try to help as \nI can. Sometimes I am not as much help as he would like.\n  Take, for example, this bill. We have been working on this bill and I \nam convinced the end is in sight for this bill. I don't know the exact \nnumber. There are probably five or six Katrina-related amendments on \nthis bill. They are good amendments if they relate to spending on \nKatrina for the victims, education, housing, medical. We should vote on \nthose. If there is a problem with them, work with our managers.\n  For example, we tried to accept the amendment related to medical that \ncame over from the House. We cannot do that. Even on Public Radio this \nmorning--not actually a bastion of democratic liberality--Public Radio \nhad an example of what the bill passed\n\n[[Page S9970]]\n\nin the House would do or not do. They give an example of a woman who is \nfrom Louisiana who was sent to the Astrodome, 55 years old, heart \ncondition, diabetes. Under the House provision we have now, she could \nnot get help. Under our provision, she could. We are trying to help the \npeople who got hurt, and there are a lot of people who got hurt.\n  I agree we need to do more on these appropriations bills. We should \nnot have a big omnibus bill. I was happy to see the distinguished \nSenator from Mississippi, the senior Senator from Mississippi, the \nchairman of the Committee on Appropriations, say he did not want an \nomnibus bill. I congratulate him.\n  However, I say to my friend, and I have said this privately and I \nwill say it publicly to the distinguished majority leader, we have to \nget conferences done on the appropriations bills. I, along with Senator \nDomenici, have done the Energy and Water Appropriations Subcommittee \nfor many years. We have never had figures like this. We cannot go to \nconference. The House refuses to sit down and talk to us. We have to \nwork this out. Among other things in the Energy and Water \nappropriations bill, we fund the Corps of Engineers. We are going to go \nthis year on some kind of a continuing resolution and not take care of \nthe Corps of Engineers and the other matters within the confines of \nthat subcommittee? We should not do that.\n  We have not done anything with Homeland Security. If there was ever a \ntime in the history of this country where we could have a civilized \nconference between the House and the Senate and take care of the \nHomeland Security appropriations bills, this should be the time. Let's \nget that done. That should not be an omnibus.\n  Foreign operations bill, my Energy and Water Subcommittee, July, \nAugust--it has been there for 60 days and we have not done anything. I \nspoke to the distinguished majority leader a few minutes ago and he \nsuggested three of his top staff people and my top staff people see \nwhat we can do to focus on some of the things on Katrina. We can never \nget to the victims of Katrina unless we have floor time to do it--\nwhether they come from committees or amendments offered by Members from \nthe floor.\n  So I would hope we could finish the bill before us, the Commerce \nbill. We should do that. There is an amendment dealing with COPS. We \nwould have to waive the budget on that one. We know it takes 60 votes \nto do that. I understand there is one on small business they are about \nready to work out. There is a possibility that can be worked out. So I \nwould hope there wouldn't be a cloture motion filed on this bill. I \nthink we are about to finish it. But I cannot control that.\n  I want the Record to be spread with this: We are willing to work \nlate, early--it does not matter--toward what we think needs to be done \nto help the gulf victims.\n  I would also say we have lived up to our bargain on Judge Roberts. We \nmade a commitment to those involved that we would do our utmost to \nfinish this by the beginning of the October term in the Court. I think \nwe are along the road to doing that. We have not in any way thrown up \nany roadblocks. We have tried to cooperate.\n  We realize we are in the minority, but we realize we are also in the \nSenate that is a body governed by rules that give the minority the \npower to do a lot of things. We are going to continue to do a lot of \nthings to see if we can move this along.\n  But I say to the distinguished majority leader, we will be as helpful \nas we can. Hopefully, we can work more together than apart. I think \nthat would be good for the country. I think the country is looking for \nsome good bipartisanship.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, will the distinguished Democratic leader \nyield for a question?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I yield to the distinguished floor manager \nof the bill.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, is the distinguished Democratic leader \naware we have amendments that require votes--and that would help us--\nbut we have seven that are not Katrina related? So while the \nnegotiations are going on, on Katrina, is the distinguished Democratic \nleader aware that we do have seven votes, but we do not have a time for \nthose votes? Also, we have about five votes on Katrina. So if we could \ndispose of the non-Katrina amendments, is the Democratic leader aware \nof the number of amendments?\n  Mr. REID. I am aware of the non-Katrina amendments. As I indicated, \nsome of those I think, with the two managers, can be worked out. The \nothers will not be able to be worked out. They will go the way of \namendments that are not able to be brought before the Senate.\n  I think the point of the distinguished Senator is we can finish this \nbill fairly quickly.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. If we have votes.\n  Mr. REID. Yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I appreciate the importance of ensuring \nthat the gulf region has all of the resources necessary to fully \nrecover. My home State of Alabama was directly affected by Hurricane \nKatrina, perhaps not to the extent of a lot of areas in Mississippi and \nLouisiana, but still affected. So I can safely say I have more than a \npassing interest in ensuring that all response and recovery missions \nare fully funded here in the Senate.\n  In the last few weeks, I have spent considerable time viewing the \ndamage in the region, in Alabama and Mississippi. I plan to go to \nLouisiana this weekend. While I believe it is critical the Congress act \nswiftly to ensure emergency funding is available for hurricane-related \nrecovery efforts, I do not believe the Commerce-Justice-Science bill, \nwhich is before the Senate now, is the appropriate place to do that.\n  I believe it will be some time before we have a true understanding of \nthe actual damages and recovery needs in the region. We have already \nacted, and we will continue to act in the Senate on both sides of the \naisle to make sure the victims have everything they need to be made \nwhole, to be back on their feet, make no mistake about it.\n  But I believe it is important we maintain our current track and allow \nthe recovery effort to continue, step by step, which it is doing. The \nfunding we approved last week will allow the effort to move forward. I \nbelieve we must monitor that effort closely to ensure we have the \nnecessary resources we keep talking about. At the same time, I believe \nwe must allow the damage assessments to move forward to truly address \nthe needs of those in the gulf region, including my people in Alabama, \nthe people in Mississippi, and the people in Louisiana.\n  Adding emergency funding to a regular spending bill, such as this CJS \nbill, frankly, is not the way I believe we should do business. We need \nto approach the hurricane funding needs in a coordinated manner--I \nbelieve we have been doing a lot of this--not in an ad hoc way, \nthrowing add-ons on a bill that is not even the main disaster recovery \nbill.\n  I am going to be standing on the floor making sure, the best I can, \nwe pass the necessary funding for these victims, including, as I said, \nthe people of Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama, you can be sure of \nthat, but not on this bill today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I say to my dear friend, the senior Senator \nfrom Alabama, I agree that we need to make sure that money goes to the \npeople who need it. That is what we are trying to do. We have not had \nthe ability to bring Katrina amendments to the floor and act on them. \nThat is what we need to do.\n  It is not as if we were working in a vacuum. We have a model we know \nworks. After 9/11, we worked in a bipartisan fashion and created \nlegislation that was unique. But most important to the families of the \n3,000-plus people who got killed, plus the fact there were billions of \ndollars in damages, we did $20 billion worth within a matter of days to \nget relief to the people of New York, the people of Virginia.\n  So we know how to effectively address issues of concern. We have done \nthat in the past. We relied then on committees to produce legislation \nthrough the regular process. I believe that is what I heard the \nmajority leader say. We are willing to do that. But in following \nthrough on that, we have to be able to have some time on the floor to \ndebate and vote on those issues. That is what we need to do.\n\n[[Page S9971]]\n\n  Although there are a few exceptions to this, for the most part, the \nmajority has not followed this process, and we have not been permitted \nan opportunity to address these issues on the Senate floor. We have \nbeen trying for 2 weeks to do that.\n  So let's empower every one of our chairmen and ranking members to sit \ndown together and see what the committees can produce to address the \nneeds of the survivors in the communities hit by this catastrophe. And \nthen let's commit to give them the floor time to deal with their \nlegislation. We badly need to do that.\n  Yes, we have had two emergency supplemental appropriations bills for \nmore than $60 billion, but a lot of that money cannot go to the people \nwho need it because it is illegal. We want to refine the law so we can \nget people the money they need.\n  I apologize to everyone. I know there is a vote pending. I have said \nenough. I hope I made my point.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1661\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time for debate has expired.\n  The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, the Senator from Delaware has not had a \nchance to speak on his amendment. I think we agreed he would get some \nwrap-up time. I ask unanimous consent the Senator from Delaware be \ngranted 2 minutes and I be granted 2 minutes in response and to make a \npoint of order on his amendment.\n  Is that agreeable?\n  Mr. BIDEN. I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Delaware is recognized.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, let me begin by asking unanimous consent \nthat Senator Landrieu be added as a cosponsor of this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, we are decimating the COPS program. \nChairman Sensenbrenner, in the House, is no fan of the program. He \nasked for a study to be done by GAO. It concluded: Use of the COPS \ngrants resulted in less crime, use of COPS grants resulted in more \ncommunity policing, use of COPS grants resulted in more officers on the \nstreets. This is a time when we need more officers on the streets, not \nfewer officers on the streets.\n  The idea we are going to deal with natural disasters as well as \nterrorist attacks by using special forces soldiers and not cops on the \nstreet seems to me to be a little silly. We need more cops on the \nstreets.\n  There are 8,000 applications pending. The bill would allow for 25 of \nthose applications to be filled. This is a mistake.\n  One of my colleagues--it may be the chairman of the committee; I am \nnot sure--said we have to prove we can end a program. Why do we end a \nprogram that is working, and working so well, in the interests of the \ncountry?\n  My time is probably up. I thank my friend from New Hampshire for the \ncourtesy of allowing me to take a few minutes to speak to my amendment.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the amendment.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise to speak on Senator Biden's \namendment to add over $1 billion to the COPS Program. I am troubled by \nthis amendment because it would declare these funds an emergency, \nsiphoning away much needed funds that should go directly to the \nhurricane effort. The definition of an emergency includes situations \nthat are necessary, or vital, sudden, urgent, and unforeseen. This \namendment does not fit those characteristics.\n  I must also oppose this amendment because it lacks an offset. As a \nsenior member of the Budget Committee and the chairman of the Finance \nCommittee, I believe that we owe it to the taxpayers to be fiscally \nresponsible with their tax dollars. Congress passed a budget, and we \nshould stick by it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, this amendment has been offered in the \npast, and it is a reflection of the support of the Senator from \nDelaware for this program. But we have to remember this program was \ncreated in 1994 by President Clinton, with a clear statement it would \nend after 100,000 police officers were put on the streets.\n  Under this program, we have already spent over $12 billion. We put \nhave put 118,000 police officers on the streets. This amendment would \nsimply continue the program. Quite honestly, this is a program that \nshould be phased out or just focused on police officers in schools. It \nis not a program that should be continued, and it certainly should not \nbe continued in the context of the hurricane and the disaster in the \nGulf States because it would have a marginal impact on that region.\n  So, Mr. President, pursuant to section 402(b)(5) of House Concurrent \nResolution 95, the fiscal year 2006 budget resolution, I raise a point \nof order against the emergency designation provisions contained in the \npending amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, pursuant to section 402 of House Concurrent \nResolution 95, the concurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal year \n2006, I move to waive section 402 of that concurrent resolution for \npurposes of the pending amendment, and I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. The following Senator was necessarily absent: the \nSenator from Louisiana (Mr. Vitter).\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from New Jersey (Mr. \nCorzine), and the Senator from West Virginia (Mr. Rockefeller) are \nnecessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Alexander). Are there any other Senators \nin the Chamber desiring to vote?\n  The yeas and nays resulted--yeas 41, nays 56, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 226 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--41\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Byrd\n     Cantwell\n     Carper\n     Clinton\n     Dayton\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Harkin\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Kennedy\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     Mikulski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Obama\n     Pryor\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Salazar\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Stabenow\n     Talent\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--56\n\n     Alexander\n     Allard\n     Allen\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Burr\n     Chafee\n     Chambliss\n     Coburn\n     Cochran\n     Coleman\n     Collins\n     Conrad\n     Cornyn\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     DeMint\n     DeWine\n     Dole\n     Domenici\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Frist\n     Graham\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Hatch\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Isakson\n     Johnson\n     Kyl\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     Martinez\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Murkowski\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Roberts\n     Santorum\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Sununu\n     Thomas\n     Thune\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n\n                             NOT VOTING--3\n\n     Corzine\n     Rockefeller\n     Vitter\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. On this vote the yeas are 41, the nays are 56. \nThree-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn not having voted in \nthe affirmative, the motion is not agreed to. The point of order is \nsustained. The emergency designation is removed.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, the spending in this amendment would cause \nthe underlying bill to exceed the subcommittee's section 302(b) \nallocation. Therefore, I raise a point of order against the amendment \npursuant to section 302(f) of the Budget Act.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The point of order is well taken and \nsustained. The amendment falls.\n  Mr. SHELBY. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. TALENT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S9972]]\n\n  Mr. TALENT. Mr. President, I rise for a few moments to speak in favor \nof an amendment offered by Senator Dayton, which I am pleased to \ncosponsor along with many others, that would increase funding for \nJustice assistance grants by $275,000.\n  Justice assistance grants, as the Senate knows, incorporate what used \nto be called the Byrne grants and the Local Law Enforcement Program \ngrants and are used to fund a number of important law enforcement \ninitiatives, among which include multijurisdictional task forces.\n  I wish to speak briefly about that side of this important amendment \nbecause as the Senate may know, I have done a lot of work on the \nsubject of fighting methamphetamine. Earlier in the debate on this \nbill, the Senate adopted an amendment which consisted of legislation \nthat Senator Feinstein and I have introduced, the Combat Meth Act, \nwhich was a comprehensive antimethamphetamine program designed to put \nthe Federal Government squarely and aggressively on the side of local \nlaw enforcement which is fighting this terrible drug. And it is a \nterrible drug. It is the worst single drug threat that I have \nconfronted in my 20 years in public life.\n  Methamphetamine is seriously addictive, maybe more so than any other \ndrug of which I am aware. It is almost instantly addictive for a lot of \npeople. It changes the physical nature of the brain. Even if you get \noff methamphetamine, which is difficult, and I will speak more on that \nin a moment, that will not necessarily fix the damage because it can \nchange the structure of the brain. It tends to make the people using it \nmore aggressive rather than less aggressive. Some drugs tend to make \npeople more passive, and as bad as they are, at least it doesn't cause \nthem to go out and attack other people, but methamphetamine does.\n  In addition, there is no known treatment for methamphetamine. There \nis no methadone for methamphetamine. So we sponsored, and the Senate \nadopted, a measure which had been cosponsored by more than 40 other \nSenators to help the Federal Government get aggressively into the \nbusiness of fighting methamphetamine. It was a series of grant programs \nalong with legislation that would put pseudoephedrine, the precursor \ndrug for methamphetamine, behind pharmacy counters. I think that was \nvery important, and I said at the time I was grateful to the bill \nmanagers for working with us on that issue.\n  One of the worst things about methamphetamine is that the drug is not \njust used in our neighborhoods and sold in our neighborhoods, it is \nmade in our neighborhoods. It is made in local labs that can operate \nout of a cabin, out of a house, in a kitchen, in a van while it is \nbeing driven around, on the side of a road, or in the woods in a \ncountry area.\n  The process by which methamphetamine is made is literally toxic. The \nchemicals in it are chemicals that should not go anywhere near the \nhuman body, but they do.\n  These labs have cropped up all over States such as Missouri. It is \nlike a cancer that spread throughout our States in the Midwest and now \nin other States as well. It is a terrible problem in the South and in \nthe West and the Southwest. I do not think there is a State in the \ncountry which is not experiencing growing problems with it.\n  The National Association of Counties surveyed its members. The No. 1 \nproblem reported more often than any others was methamphetamine. Not \nthe No. 1 law enforcement problem, the No. 1 problem because the drug \ncauses terrible social service problems and health care problems, and \nit is also overwhelming local budgets, in particular law enforcement \nbudgets.\n  Think of the situation when you have a sheriff's department in a \ncounty with maybe 6 or 10 deputies, or a bigger county with 20 or 25 \ndeputies: With all the jobs that local law enforcement has to do--\nsecurity for the county fair, domestic violence issues, all the typical \nwork they have to perform--and then you superimpose on that 10 or 15 or \n20 methamphetamine labs in the county, it is very difficult to track \ndown those labs. It is difficult to break them down. These deputies \nhave to get trained in environmental chemistry to break these labs \ndown.\n  It is an enormous burden on local budgets. One of the ways we can \nhelp our sheriffs, our local law enforcement officers in dealing with \nthese meth labs is multijurisdictional task forces where they are able \nto get grants from the Federal Government, band together in regional \ntask forces, and use that manpower efficiently to help go after labs. \nThat is what the Dayton amendment is designed to support, and that is \nthe big reason I am so strongly supportive of it.\n  The amendment would move funding for these programs back to where \nthey were in fiscal year 2003. It is a substantial increase, but I can \nassure you, Mr. President, based on my experience with this issue, it \ncertainly is no more than is needed. If we don't get ahead of this \nmethamphetamine problem, if we don't start winning it--I would not say \nwe are winning it now. We have heroic efforts by local law enforcement, \nbut they are telling us we are not gaining yet--if we don't start \nwinning, we will have increasing costs in terms of effect on kids, \nneighborhoods, jobs, costs that would dwarf what this amendment would \nadd to the bill.\n  This amendment is offset. This drug is destroying lives all over \nStates such as Missouri, all over the country. We can do something \nabout it--not by the Federal Government taking this over but by the \nGovernment assisting local law enforcement in efforts that they are \ntelling us are going to work. That is why this amendment is so \nimportant.\n  I appreciate the managers working with Senator Dayton and the other \ncosponsors, and I hope the Senate will adopt it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I rise today to express my support for \na provision in the Commerce, Justice, Science appropriations act that \nwill make significant headway in the fight against methamphetamine or \nmeth manufacture and use.\n  The Talent-Feinstein amendment incorporating the provisions of the \nCombat Meth Act into this bill is the culmination of several months of \nbipartisan collaboration. The provision takes aim at the biggest \nproblem faced by law enforcement in dealing with meth choking off the \nsupply of essential materials needed to manufacture the drug.\n  Meth is of particular concern to me and to the entire Tennessee \ndelegation because Tennessee has been plagued by a growing number of \nmeth labs--ad hoc laboratories in backwoods shacks, out-of-the-way \nhotel rooms, and just about anywhere else you can cram in a supply of \nhot plates, glassware, and noxious chemicals necessary to make meth. In \n2004, Tennessee ranked second in the Nation in the number of meth lab \nseizures, according to data from the Office of National Drug Control \nPolicy. The Drug Enforcement Agency calculates that Tennessee accounts \nfor 75 percent of the meth lab seizures in the Southeast. My colleagues \nin Missouri, Kentucky, Oklahoma, and many other States can cite related \nalarming statistics.\n  What is of particular concern about these meth labs is that they are \nappearing in places where drug production and abuse has not been a \nsignificant problem. In Tennessee, the largest numbers of seizures of \nmeth labs have occurred in rural counties such as Monroe, Marion, \nWarren, and Coffee. These areas are often not fully prepared to cope \nwith the demands of seizing such labs and cleaning up the aftermath.\n  The Talent-Feinstein amendment is a critical step in dealing with the \nmeth problem. Others will have already praised various aspects of this \nbill, but I would like to particularly congratulate the Judiciary \nCommittee for producing a bill that does not undermine State and local \nefforts to combat this problem. Law enforcement begins at home, and by \ncrafting legislation that directs a Federal response that supports \nState and local law enforcement rather than preempt it, the Senate has \nupheld the principles of federalism that are at the core of our system \nof government.\n  This legislative step is only one part of a comprehensive strategy to \ncombat this addictive drug. The problems presented by meth are myriad \nand many are unique. Meth production and use targets a different \ndemographic of users than other drugs. Production of meth creates a \ntoxic stew of chemical byproducts that can contaminate a lab site for \nyears to come. Precursor chemicals used in meth production can\n\n[[Page S9973]]\n\ncome from a wide variety of sources. Hospitals and child welfare \nagencies are overwhelmed by burn victims and abuse cases from homes \nwhere meth is made. The court system is inundated with cases involving \ndrug crime, and the inability to provide more individual attention \nprevents people from getting treatment that might discourage \nrecidivism.\n  We also need to remember that while combating meth has risen to the \ntop of the agenda thanks to media and government attention, this \ncountry is still threatened by the illegal use of a variety of drugs. \nAccording to the National Household Survey on Drug Abuse, 15.9 million \nAmericans ages 12 and older reported using an illicit drug the month \nbefore the survey was conducted. Of those, 12.1 million reported using \nmarijuana in the past month; 1.7 million reported using cocaine; and \n1.3 million reported using hallucinogens such as LSD, PCP, and Ecstasy. \nMeth use has not yet risen to these levels, but if left unchecked the \nmeth problem could soon rise to similar levels.\n  So as we focus on meth, we must also recognize that even if we are \nsuccessful in our efforts to curb meth use and production, millions of \nAmericans are threatened by addiction to other, just as dangerous \ndrugs, and the next big drug is probably simmering in a beaker or \ngrowing in a field right now.\n  The Bush administration is confronting the drug problem head on in \nthis country. In 2005, the Office of National Drug Control Policy \nreported that there has been a 17-percent reduction in youth drug use \nin the last 3 years thanks in part to Federal and State efforts to \nbolster enforcement and increase awareness of the dangers of drugs. \nAttorney General Gonzales recently visited Nashville with HHS Secretary \nMike Leavitt and Office of National Drug Control Policy Director John \nWalters to announce new measures to support State and local governments \nin combating the meth problem.\n  I commend my colleagues for their work on the Combat Meth Act, and I \nlook forward to more such efforts in our mission to eliminate the \nscourge of illegal drugs from our communities.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n\n\n        Interoperable Communications for Public Safety Officials\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I have watched the news coverage, along \nwith so many Americans, during these past 2 weeks and have been shocked \nand saddened by the devastation in the gulf coast region. It continues \nto amaze me that an act of nature can bring about such destruction and \nruin the lives of so many.\n  My deepest sympathies and prayers go out to the residents of Alabama, \nLouisiana, and Mississippi, and I know that as a country we will come \ntogether, as we are, to assist these residents and help them rebuild \ntheir lives. In my home State of Arizona, I am proud to report that \nvalley residents have welcomed over 1,000 residents of New Orleans.\n  This was a tragedy of great proportions that caught local, State, and \nFederal officials unprepared. Like many Americans, I, too, have been \nconcerned about the local, State, and Federal initial response to this \ndisaster. It was unacceptable and inadequate. I know there will be an \nappropriate time for a comprehensive review of the local, State, and \nFederal response efforts to determine what went wrong and what went \nright. The oversight investigations being held by Senators Collins and \nLieberman are a very important undertaking. I believe Congress and the \nNation have a lot to learn from Hurricane Katrina.\n  One thing already evident is that the country's local, State, and \nFederal first responders remain unable to communicate with each other \nduring an emergency response. We saw the horrors brought on by the lack \nof communication on 9/11 when New York's fire, police, and port \nauthority officers were unable to talk with one another when responding \nto the collapse of the Twin Towers. I have now been told that the first \nresponders in Louisiana experienced similar problems because New \nOrleans and the three nearby parishes all use different radio equipment \nand frequencies. In addition, Federal officials use entirely different \ncommunications systems than localities, which hindered relief efforts.\n  I read that New Orleans officials had purchased equipment that would \nallow some patching between local and Federal radio systems, but that \nthe equipment was rendered useless by flooding. Nonetheless, short-term \nsolutions to link incompatible systems are not the right approach to \nthis critical problem. The better approach is for this Nation to get \nserious about public safety communications by developing and funding an \ninteroperable communications system for all local, State, and Federal \nfirst responders.\n  The Federal Government needs to, one, develop a comprehensive \ninteroperable communications plan and set equipment standards; two, \nfund the purchase of interoperable communications equipment; and three, \nprovide public safety with additional spectrum so first responders can \ncommunicate using the same radio frequencies and equipment in the event \nof an emergency.\n  Congress has taken some steps toward achieving an interoperable \ncommunications system for local, State, and Federal first responders. \nLast year, I offered an amendment that was enacted as part of the \nintelligence reform bill that authorized the Department of Homeland \nSecurity's Office for Interoperability and Compatibility, otherwise \nknown as SAFECOM. SAFECOM assists local, regional, State, and Federal \nagencies in developing interoperable communications plans and \naccelerating interoperable communications equipment standards. They are \nin the process of doing so, and I urge them to move forward \nexpeditiously.\n  Congress has also begun to fund the purchase of interoperable \ncommunications equipment for localities. Some 50,000 local, State, and \nFederal agencies make independent decisions about communications \nsystems and use various frequencies. This is unacceptable and a waste \nof Government resources. The Department of Homeland Security has \nalready spent over $280 million for the purchase of interoperable \ncommunications equipment. The Senate-passed Department of Homeland \nSecurity fiscal year 2006 appropriations bill would provide over $2.6 \nbillion for localities to purchase interoperable communications \nequipment. This bill is currently in conference with the House.\n  Obviously, interoperability will come with a cost. Some estimate as \nmuch as $15 billion. But even this may be a small price to pay in order \nto save thousands of lives in the event of another disaster.\n  Let's remember that Congress also provided additional spectrum for \nfirst responders in the Telecommunications Act of 1996. So after \nspending millions of dollars in funding in additional spectrum for our \nNation's first responders, why are we not better off than we were on 9/\n11 when it comes to interoperable communications? Because the spectrum \nCongress provided to first responders in 1996 is being held hostage by \ntelevision broadcasters, even though broadcasters have now been given \nnew spectrum.\n  It was almost 20 years ago that broadcasters began their journey \ntoward becoming spectrum squatters. In 1987, broadcasters first asked \nthe FCC to look into the potential of digital television technology and \nwhether additional spectrum would be necessary. Upon the broadcasters' \nrequest, Congress provided new spectrum in 1996 to the broadcasters for \nfree. I have often referred to this as the great $70 billion taxpayer \ngiveaway. In return, broadcasters promised to give back their current \nspectrum by December 31, 2006, and make it available to first \nresponders for interoperable communications.\n\n  But before the ink was dry on the Telecommunications Act of 1996, \nbroadcasters persuaded certain Members of Congress to include an \nexception to the December 31, 2006, date in the 1997 Balanced Budget \nAct. Last year, during a Commerce Committee hearing, then-FCC Chairman \nMichael Powell testified that this exception could result in the first \nresponders not receiving this spectrum for ``decades or multiple \ndecades.'' As evidenced by the tragedies from Hurricane Katrina, we \ncannot wait decades. Broadcasters are blocking access to spectrum for \nfirst responders who serve over 50 percent of the country.\n  Providing first responders access to this spectrum is one of the key \nrecommendations of the 9/11 Commission\n\n[[Page S9974]]\n\nand remains a top priority for Chairman Kean and Vice Chairman \nHamilton. I introduced legislation last year to implement this \nrecommendation, and it was voted out of the Commerce Committee. I then \nadded the provisions, an amendment to the intelligence reform bill last \nfall, to provide this spectrum to first responders. Unfortunately, this \nlanguage was removed in conference and replaced with a ``sense of \nCongress'' that such legislation be voted on during the first session \nof the 109th Congress.\n  Senator Lieberman and I reintroduced our legislation to provide \nspectrum to first responders. Yet Congress has yet to act this year as \nenvisioned by the sense of Congress. S. 1268, the Spectrum Availability \nfor Emergency Response and Law Enforcement to Improve Vital Emergency \nServices Act, otherwise known as the SAVE LIVES Act, would provide \nfirst responders with the spectrum by January 1, 2009. Upon \nintroduction, I suggested this date is a compromise between public \nsafety organizations, equipment manufacturers, localities, and \nbroadcasters. However, after watching citizens suffer during recovery \nefforts in New Orleans, I believe this date should be moved up to \nJanuary 1, 2007, as originally contemplated by Congress in the \nTelecommunications Act of 1996.\n  Yet here we are 9 months into the first session with another horrible \ndisaster having taken place, and Congress has yet to take up the SAVE \nLIVES Act or any other legislation providing first responders their \npromised spectrum.\n  To what level of crisis must this country endure before we act? Is \nthe devastation from Hurricane Katrina still not enough to bring \naction? Chairman Stevens has stated his intention to include such \nlegislation in the Commerce Committee's response to budget \nreconciliation. I will be watching to see if the broadcasters find a \nway to once again delay the hand off of this spectrum to first \nresponders. I will do all I can to move our legislation.\n  In 1997, the President of the National Association of Broadcasters \nstated on ``The News Hour with Jim Lehrer'' that broadcasters' use of \nspectrum allocated to first responders was merely a ``loan to \nfacilitate an orderly transition.'' Mr. Fritts, this ``loan'' has gone \non long enough. Congress must now call in your ``loan.'' You got your \nspectrum, now give the first responders their spectrum.\n  I will conclude by sharing 9/11 Commission Chairman Kean's comments \nas stated on CNN's Late Edition this past Sunday:\n\n       [w]hat's frustrating is it's the same thing over again. I \n     mean, how many people have to lose their lives? It's lack of \n     communication, our first responders not being able to talk to \n     each other. . . . Basically it's many of the things that, \n     frankly, if some of our recommendations had been passed by \n     the United States Congress . . . could have been avoided. But \n     on the ground, the people that get there first can't talk to \n     each other because the radio communications don't work. They \n     haven't got enough what's called spectrum. So there is a bill \n     in Congress to provide first responders spectrum. The bill \n     has been sitting in Congress, nothing has been happening, and \n     again, people on the ground--police, fire, medical \n     personnel--couldn't talk to each other. That's outrageous and \n     it's a scandal and I think it cost lives.\n\n  I couldn't agree more.\n  I want to end by thanking all of the first responders who are \nassisting in rescue efforts in Alabama, Louisiana and Mississippi. They \nare heroes and make me proud to be an American. For over 2 weeks now, \nthey have slept very little and eaten very little, but done so much for \na region in need. In appreciation, we owe them better communications \nsystems so that when they are called upon to assist in the next \ndisaster, they have the tools necessary to protect themselves and those \nthey are working to protect.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, the pending Commerce, Justice, Science and \nRelated Agencies Appropriations Bill for FY 2006, H.R. 2862, as \nreported by the Senate Committee on Appropriations provides $48.875 \nbillion in budget authority and $49.495 billion in outlays in fiscal \nyear 2006 for the Departments of Commerce, Justice and related \nagencies. Of these totals, $229 million in budget authority and $241 \nmillion in outlays are for mandatory programs in fiscal year 2006.\n  The bill provides total discretionary budget authority in fiscal year \n2006 of $48.646 billion. This amount is $2 billion less than the \nPresident's request, equal to the 302(b) allocations adopted by the \nSenate, and $36 million more than fiscal year 2005 enacted levels.\n  Mr. President, I commend the distinguished chairman of the \nAppropriations Committee for bringing this legislation before the \nSenate, and I ask unanimous consent that a table displaying the Budget \nCommittee scoring of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n   H.R. 2862, 2006 COMMERCE, JUSTICE, SCIENCE APPROPRIATIONS--SPENDING\n                    COMPARISONS--SENATE-REPORTED BILL\n                     [Fiscal year 2006, $ millions]\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                     General\n                                     Purpose     Mandatory      Total\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSenate-reported bill:\n    Budget authority.............       48,646          229       48,875\n    Outlays......................       49,254          241       49,495\nSenate 302(b) allocation:\n    Budget authority.............       48,646          229       48,875\n    Outlays......................       49,254          241       49,495\n2005 Enacted:\n    Budget authority.............       48,610          242       48,852\n    Outlays......................       48,376          228       48,604\nPresident's request:\n    Budget authority.............       50,655          229       50,884\n    Outlays......................       49,185          241       49,426\nHouse-passed bill:*\n    Budget authority.............       57,452          361       57,813\n    Outlays......................       58,563          373       58,936\nSenate-Reported Bill Compared To:\n    Senate 302(b) allocation:\n        Budget authority.........            0            0            0\n        Outlays..................            0            0            0\n    2005 Enacted:\n        Budget authority.........           36          -13           23\n        Outlays..................          878           13          891\n    President's request:\n        Budget authority.........       -2,009            0       -2,009\n        Outlays..................           69            0           69\n    House-passed bill:*\n        Budget authority.........       -8,806         -132       -8,938\n        Outlays..................       -9,309         -132       -9,441\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n* House and Senate subcommittees have differing jurisdictions.\n NOTE: Details may not add to totals due to rounding.

Mr. President, I want to bring to the administration's \nattention an issue of vital importance to the victims of Hurricane \nKatrina.\n  As you know, FEMA provides crucial financial assistance to eligible \nindividuals, households and to local and State governments following a \ndisaster. Many of FEMA's programs require local governments or States \nto provide a 25-percent match.\n  I commend President Bush's decision to waive the matching \nrequirements for certain FEMA programs for 60 days. Given the \nunprecedented destruction resulting from Hurricane Katrina, however, I \ncall on President Bush to immediately direct FEMA to reimburse all \neligible recipients the full 100 percent of costs eligible under FEMA's \nvarious relief programs for as long as necessary. This waiver should \napply to all entities that are providing assistance in the entire gulf \ncoast area impacted by Hurricane Katrina.\n  As seems obvious to all, 60 days will simply not provide enough time \nfor local and State governments to get back on their feet.

Mr. President, I will spend a few minutes talking about \nIraq this afternoon. I start with my conclusion and then go into the \nbody of my remarks after I state what that conclusion is.\n  The administration's position that we will stay as long as the Iraqis \nneed us to is too open-ended and sends the wrong message to Iraqis that \ntheir failure to make the necessary political compromises will not \naffect how long we stay, and it makes it less likely that those \ncompromises will be reached.\n  Our military commanders have repeatedly stated there is no purely \nmilitary solution in Iraq and that a political settlement is a \nnecessary element for success. In view of that, I believe, unless the \nIraqis achieve a political settlement by the end of this year, we must \nconsider a timetable for the withdrawal of U.S. forces from Iraq, and \nwe must make that point clearly to the Iraqis now while they are in the \nprocess of deciding whether to come together through consensus.\n  The Iraqi National Assembly approved a draft Constitution on August \n28, despite objections from the Sunni Arabs over provisions relating to \nfederalism that most Sunnis believe will disadvantage the areas of \nSunni concentration. Those provisions essentially would enable the \nKurds in the North and the Shiites in the South to establish autonomous \nregions in which most of the country's oil reserves are located. Sunni \nArab voters who chose to boycott the last election, and thus were \nunderrepresented in the National Assembly and on the constitutional \ndrafting committee, registered in large numbers for the referendum on \nthe Constitution scheduled for October 15, with the apparent objective \nof rejecting the existing draft. If two-thirds of the voters in 3 or \nmore of Iraq's 18 provinces vote no, the Constitution will be rejected, \nand the elections scheduled for December will elect a new National \nAssembly, which will start the constitutional drafting process anew.\n  Additionally, there are reports that firebrand Shiite cleric Muqtada \nal-Sadr will exhort his followers to reject the Constitution because he \nfavors a unified Iraq, and he sees the existing draft leading to the \ndissolution of Iraq as a single State. Muqtada al-Sadr has a huge \nfollowing in Baghdad, which lacks oil resources, and thus is \ndisadvantaged in a manner similar to the predominantly Sunni Arab \nprovinces.\n  Meanwhile, the administration is urging the American people to ``stay \nthe course.'' That is a bumper sticker slogan not a strategy.\n  Secretary Rice, among others, has stated we will be in Iraq as long \nas we are needed, adding no incentive, therefore, to Iraqis to reach a \npolitical settlement. An open-ended commitment to keep our troops in \nIraq, even in the absence of a political settlement by the Iraqis, \nflies in the face of our military commander's assessment that there can \nbe no military success in the absence of an Iraqi political coming \ntogether.\n  U.S. forces, particularly the U.S. Army, are stretched thin, despite \nthe unprecedented use of a large segment of our National Guard in Iraq. \nTheir lengthy and repeated deployments mean that much of a unit's time \nis devoted to recovery from a previous deployment and preparation for \nthe next one, thus leaving little time for training to develop war-\nfighting capabilities or sustaining readiness for other contingencies. \nThese actions, in turn, mean less time at home for soldiers with their \nfamilies and lower morale, which threatens recruiting and retention.\n  The level of participation of the Armed Forces of other countries has \nbeen disappointing, leaving the United States to bear most of the \nburden. The absence of forces from Muslim countries is deeply \ndisappointing, since the outcome in Iraq has effects throughout the \nworld and also impacts the future direction of Islam. While it would \nlikely be unwise for Iraq's neighbors to supply any forces, the failure \nof the Arab states to express their condolences over the recent \nstampede, in which almost 1,000 Iraqis were killed, was noted angrily \nby Iraq's President and Prime Minister, as was the lack of Arab \ndiplomatic representation in Baghdad.\n  The administration should take advantage of the presence of so many \nnational leaders at the United Nations later this week to press nations \nwith substantial Muslim populations, other than those neighboring Iraq, \nto send forces to Iraq. The President should also make clear to the \nIraqi leaders that we expect them to extend invitations to such \nnations.\n  Speaking as a Senator, I delivered that message to President Talabani \nthis afternoon in Senator Frist's office. It is a message that I \ndelivered on a number of occasions and directly in the past to Iraqi's \nleaders in Iraq.\n  U.S. Ambassador Zalmay Khalilzad wrote in the Washington Post that \none of the two standards to evaluate the Iraqi Constitution is ``its \npotential to be a national compact that brings Iraqis together and \nundermines the insurgency.''\n\n  He went on to say:\n\n       If Iraqi voters ratify the draft overwhelmingly, it becomes \n     a national compact. If they reject the draft, the next \n     Assembly will negotiate anew.\n\n  He continues:\n\n       Under all scenarios, the United States will continue to \n     encourage Iraqi leaders and communities to come together.\n\n  But Ambassador Khalilzad failed to mention that there is another \nscenario; namely, that the Sunni Arabs vote overwhelmingly against the \nConstitution but fall short of achieving a two-thirds negative vote in \nthree provinces. In such a case, the violence and insurrection is more \nlikely to continue and even civil war could result. Moreover, the \nAmbassador's words fail to display urgency that Iraqis reach a \npolitical settlement and unwisely suggest the U.S. forces may stay in \nIraq indefinitely until legal consensus is achieved.\n  Despite the National Assembly's approval of the draft Constitution, \nthe Iraqis continue to negotiate and make changes to the draft. For \nexample, the Washington Post reported on September 6 that President \nTalabani said in his statement that he had agreed to changes that would \nease concerns among Sunni Arabs that the wording of the draft loosened \nIraqi ties to the Arab world. And Reuters reported on Sunday that the \nUnited Nations is unable to start printing Iraq's draft Constitution \nbecause the National Assembly had not yet certified the text and now \nhas set Sunday, September 18, as the date by which any changes to the \ndraft Constitution can still be met.\n  This week provides a critically important opportunity for the \nadministration to make clear to the Iraqis that U.S. forces cannot be \nin Iraq indefinitely. We must make it clear to the Iraqis that they \nhave a limited time to achieve a political settlement and that if they \ndo not do so, one way or another, by the end of this year, we will \nconsider a timetable for withdrawal of our forces.\n  Speaking as one Senator, again, I delivered that viewpoint to \nPresident Talabani in Senator Frist's office earlier this afternoon.\n  We cannot write a constitution for Iraq, and we should not dictate \nthe compromises they need to make to achieve a political settlement. \nBut we do control whether our troops stay in Iraq and how long they \nstay.\n  The framework for agreement appears to be at hand. Some Shiite \nleaders reportedly have come to realize the existing draft of the \nconstitution, which grants a high degree of control over natural \nresources to autonomous regions, would apply to water resources as well \nas to oil resources. That could negatively impact on the amount and \nquality of water available to predominantly Shiite areas. The Shiites \nare mainly located in the south, downstream of both the Kurds in the \nnorth and the Sunni Arabs in the center, who are able to dominate the \nflow of Iraq's two great rivers, the Tigris and Euphrates.\n  If the Shiites give up their ability to form an autonomous region or \nregions,\n\n[[Page S9981]]\n\nor agree to greater control by the central government over the \ncountry's natural resources, the Sunni Arabs might then be able to \nsupport a revised draft constitution which would be a critical step in \nachieving a political settlement.\n  The administration needs to move quickly. Both President Talabani and \nPrime Minister Jaafari--the leading Kurd and Shiite, respectively, in \nthe transitional Iraqi Government--are in Washington this week and \navailable for straight talk from the President and his Cabinet.\n  The United States has done and is doing more than our part in Iraq. \nIt is up to the Iraqis now to step up to the political compromises \nwhich need to be made if Iraq has a realistic chance to defeat the \ninsurgents and to become a nation.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chambliss). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thune).

Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the need for \nhate crimes legislation.

Likewise, each Congress I have come to the floor to \nhighlight a separate hate crime that has occurred in our country.\n  On August 9, 2005, two men were walking near 18th Street in New York, \nNY, when they were attacked by two other men. The apparent motivation \nfor the attack were the victims sexual orientation. According to \npolice, the two men made numerous antigay comments as they passed \nbefore hitting one of the gay men in the face.\n  I believe that the Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, \nto defend them against the harms that are born out of hate. The Local \nLaw Enforcement Enhancement Act is a symbol that can become substance. \nI believe that by passing this legislation and changing current law, we \ncan change hearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/13/senate-section/article/S9981-3", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9981]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          FEDERAL LAW ENFORCEMENT TRAINING CENTER ANNIVERSARY\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise today to commemorate the 35th \nanniversary of the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center, commonly \nknown as FLETC. Since its inception in 1970, FLETC has provided primary \nand advanced law enforcement training for at least 81 Federal agencies. \nIt also serves as the project manager for the International Law \nEnforcement Academies. Over the past three and one-half decades, FLETC \nhas grown from a fledgling organization into the world's premier law \nenforcement training center. For this, and for the countless lives that \nhave been saved by the proud graduates of FLETC, I extend my heartfelt \ncongratulations.\n  When FLETC was first conceived 35 years ago, the training of Federal \nlaw enforcement agencies suffered from varying levels of quality. The \ncosts of providing high-quality training were far too high for any \nsingle agency to bear. It was in these prevailing circumstances that \npeople started to talk about standardizing and consolidating training \noperations for law enforcement agencies with similar operational \nskills. That FLETC has managed to save taxpayers dollars by creating \nhigh-quality and cost-effective training programs is a tribute to its \nleaders, instructors, and graduates.\n  I have a personal connection to FLETC because there is a FLETC campus \nin my home State of New Mexico. The town of Artesia in the southeastern \nsection of New Mexico has played a special role in the history of \nFLETC. First opened in 1989, FLETC-Artesia is one of three full-scale \nresidential training facilities currently in operation. Although \noriginally a small college campus, FLETC-Artesia is now a 2,540-acre \nsite that includes grounded aircraft, large classrooms, drug and \nfingerprint labs, physical techniques facilities, outdoor firearms \nranges, vehicle proficiency courses, and a number of dormitory \nbuildings.\n  These and other training tools have proven valuable to multiple \nFederal law enforcement agencies. In the weeks and months following the \ndevastating attacks on September 11, 2001, the training environment at \nFLETC was reoriented to address the American people's demands for \ngreater in-flight security. The number of students being trained at \nFLETC-Artesia swelled from an average of 150 per day to 700 per day as \npart of this mobilization. Air marshals continue to be trained by FLETC \nand the Federal Flight Deck Officer training module was transferred to \nArtesia in the fall of 2003. The Border Patrol has also consolidated \nits training activities in New Mexico. It is therefore no stretch of \nthe imagination to say that FLETC-Artesia is at the forefront in \nprotecting our Nation's skies and borders.\n  Mr. President, I offer my congratulations to those who have worked at \nFLETC over the past 35 years. They have done their country a great \nservice. The fact that FLETC trainees continue to excel is a tribute to \ntheir hard work. I am proud to have played a role in establishing a \nFLETC campus in my home State and I look forward to working with FLETC \nin the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/13/senate-section/article/S9981-4", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9981]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              BARBARA DAVIS CENTER FOR CHILDHOOD DIABETES\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, today I wish to honor an exceptional \norganization. The Barbara Davis Center for Childhood Diabetes provides \ncare and support for over 5,000 children and young adults with type one \ndiabetes, including their families. For their dedicated work and \nunrelenting commitment to excellence, I wish to honor the Barbara Davis \nCenter for Childhood Diabetes here today.\n  Since 1980, The Barbara Davis Center has grown to become the largest \nfacility in the Nation dedicated to pediatric diabetes and is now \nlocated on the Fitzsimmons Campus of the University of Colorado at \nDenver Health Sciences Center in Aurora, Colorado. The staff at the \nCenter has worked tirelessly to meet the needs of countless children \nthroughout Colorado and the entire world who suffer from type one, or \ninsulin-dependent diabetes.

In addition, the Center is a first-\nrate teaching and research facility on the forefront of the \ninvestigation into the cause, treatment, and elimination of diabetes.\n  The Barbara Davis Center for Childhood Diabetes is relentless in its \nefforts to treat children with diabetes, support their families, and \nfind ways to prevent and ultimately cure this devastating disease.

Chris \nand his group have undertaken the initiative known as One Church, One \nChild. This program which has branches in about 30 States was started \nin my State in December 2001, thanks to the leadership of Chris Wood \nand Mission West Virginia. Its goal is to raise awareness and interest \nin adoptions from foster care throughout the community, but \nparticularly focusing on faith communities. Since its inception, \nhundreds of West Virginians have inquired about potential adoptions. \nAbout 40 adults have been registered and certified as foster and/or \nadoptive parents. But the best news is that 25 children have been \nadopted into safe, permanent homes. Others are still in the process. \nThis is real progress, and it is changing the lives of children and \nfamilies.\n  This is a remarkable program. I am also pleased to note that my West \nVirginia colleague has nominated Drew Ornbaun as her Angel in Adoption. \nDrew is a teenager who was adopted from foster care, and he has become \na compassionate spokesperson for this initiative and its vital goal--a \nsafe, permanent home for every child.\n  Chris Wood, executive director of Mission West Virginia, is doing \nimportant work on behalf of children and families through the One \nChurch, One Child program.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/13/senate-section/article/S9982-1", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9982]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n RECOGNITION OF THE RETIREMENT OF MAJOR GENERAL REGINALD CENTRACCHIO, \n                        U.S. ARMY NATIONAL GUARD\n\n Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the \naccomplishments of MG Reginald Centracchio, the Adjutant General of the \nState of Rhode Island and the commanding general of the Rhode Island \nNational Guard. Major General Centracchio retired on September 1, 2005, \nafter 48 years in the Rhode Island Army National Guard. He is the only \nadjutant general from Rhode Island to serve his entire career within \nthe Rhode Island National Guard, rising from private to the position of \nadjutant general.\n  Major General Centracchio enlisted as a private in the National Guard \nin September 1957. He graduated from Officer Candidate School in 1962, \nand was commissioned a second lieutenant, Air Defense Artillery.\n  Over the past four decades, Major General Centracchio held a wide \nvariety of important command and staff positions, including platoon \nleader and battery commander on various missile sites throughout Rhode \nIsland; field artillery tactical intelligence staff officer and \nadjutant; recruiting and retention manager; plans, operations and \nmilitary support officer; director of personnel and administration; and \ndirector of plans, operations and training, Rhode Island Army National \nGuard.\n  Major General Centracchio was appointed the Adjutant General, State \nof Rhode Island, and Commanding General, Rhode Island National Guard, \nby Gov. Lincoln Almond on August 1, 1995. On August 1, 2002, he \nachieved the State rank of lieutenant general. On July 1, 1996, he was \nappointed director of the Rhode Island Emergency Management Agency, \nRIEMA, merging the National Guard and Emergency Management Agency. On \nJanuary 21, 2003, he was reappointed by Gov. Donald L. Carcieri as the \nAdjutant General of Rhode Island; he was then appointed Rhode Island \nHomeland Security Advisor. Major General Centracchio is the first \nadjutant general to hold all three positions simultaneously.\n  During his tenure as Adjutant General and Commanding General of the \nRhode Island National Guard, Major General Centracchio's leadership and \ncommitment were essential in ensuring the Rhode Island National Guard \ntrained, equipped, and deployed soldiers and airmen in support of \nUnited States military missions at home and abroad. His experience and \nknowledge were constantly sought during numerous State emergencies in \nwhich Rhode Island National Guard troops were employed to ensure public \nsafety. Under his direct supervision, the Rhode Island National Guard \nmobilized and deployed over 3,500 troops in support of Operations Noble \nEagle, Enduring Freedom, and Iraqi Freedom. This represents the largest \ndeployment of Rhode Island National Guard Troops since the First World \nWar.\n\n  General Centracchio exemplifies what it means to be a ``soldier.'' He \nwas utterly committed to accomplishing his mission and completely \ndedicated to the welfare of his troops. He led by example. His service \nand sacrifice sustained the men and women of the Rhode Island National \nGuard and will continue to inspire them in the years ahead.\n  I also want to commend his wife, Linda. She also served by his side \nto provide for the men and women of the Rhode Island National Guard. \nTogether they made an extraordinary contribution to our Nation and to \nRhode Island.\n  Major General Centracchio's superb sense of duty and responsibility \nprovided the citizens of Rhode Island with solid evidence of the \nNational Guard's commitment to the State and Nation. On behalf of the \nresidents of Rhode Island, I thank Major General Centracchio for a \nlifetime of selfless service. I wish him well and salute him with the \ntitle that he has earned and honored. ``Sir, you are a \nsoldier.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/13/senate-section/article/S9982-2", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9982]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       NEW MEXICO JUNIOR COLLEGE\n\n Mr. DOMENICI.

This southeastern New Mexico town is known for \nits abundant natural resources, agriculture, attractive yearlong \nweather, and small town charm. Hobbs has long been known as the hub of \nNew Mexico's oil industry, and home to the world's gliding community. \nNow, Hobbs is the home of the No. 1 junior college baseball team in \nAmerica.\n  The Thunderbird baseball team has a distinguished local and national \nreputation for excellence. More than 85 New Mexico Junior College \nplayers have been drafted by professional teams, and two of those \nrecently won Major League Baseball championships with the Florida \nMarlins and Anaheim Angels. However, this is the first national \nchampionship in the school's storied baseball history.\n  The 2005 season added to the list of accolades for the New Mexico \nJunior College Thunderbirds. The team finished the season winning 55 \nout of 65 games, and outscored their opponents 44 to 19 during their \nchampionship run. Head coach Ray Birmingham won his 700th game along \nthe way and received the award for NJCAA coach of the year. The team \nfinished with the highest batting average in the country. Seven \nThunderbirds, from a variety of positions, received all-conference \nhonors.\n  Besides being great athletes, the Thunderbirds continue to show \nremarkable character off the field. Four players earned Academic All-\nAmerican honors this season, highlighting the high academic standards \nof the program. I have always believed that the ability to shine on and \noff the playing field is a truly crowing achievement.\n  This New Mexico Junior College baseball team demonstrated remarkable \nteamwork and selflessness throughout the season. Players born in New \nMexico, Venezuela, Puerto Rico, Australia, Canada, and across the \nUnited States came together to realize their dreams this season. For \nthat, and for all their accomplishments, I commend each and every \nplayer and coach of the Thunderbird team here in this Record. May their \nsuccess be only a prelude to future accomplishments, and may they \ncontinue to represent their school, Hobbs, and the State of New Mexico \nwith distinction.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/13/senate-section/article/S9982-3", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9982-S9983]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              CONGRATULATING WILLIAM H.

The Rose Ann Vuich Leadership Award, sponsored by the \nKenneth L.\n\n[[Page S9983]]\n\nMaddy Institute at California State University, Fresno, the Fresno \nBusiness Council and the Fresno Bee, is a prestigious award that \ncelebrates excellence and integrity in public service.\n  Harry Armstrong began his distinguished career in public service when \nhe was appointed to the Clovis Planning Commission in 1966. In 1970, \nHarry was elected by the residents of Clovis to serve on the city \ncouncil for nine consecutive terms. During this period, Harry also \ncompleted four highly successful terms as the mayor of Clovis. He is \ncurrently the longest-serving councilmember in California.\n  Harry Armstrong's remarkable tenure on city council has coincided \nwith the growth of Clovis from a quiet small town to one of the most \nvibrant and dynamic communities in the Central Valley. Clovis' status \nas one of the most desirable places to live, raise a family, and \nconduct business is made possible in no small part by Harry's \nextraordinary vision and steadfast commitment to serve the overall good \nof the community and advance the interests of his beloved constituents.\n  In addition to his immense contributions to the city of Clovis, Harry \nArmstrong has been very generous in lending his considerable talents \nand passion for public service to a number of other statewide and \nregional causes over the years.

Mr. President, I rise today to honor the Rancho \nBuena Vista Little League Team of San Diego, CA, that represented the \nWestern Region in the Little League World Series.\n  The Rancho Buena Vista Team treated fans to a thrilling season, \nincluding an amazing 24-game winning streak. Their season culminated in \na 5 to 4 victory over the team from Chiba City, Japan to win third \nplace at the Little League World Series in Williamsport, PA. On August \n14, 2005, Rancho Buena Vista defeated Tracy, California 7 to 2 in the \nWest regional championship game, finishing with a 6 to 0 record. The \nVista Little Leaguers became the sixth U.S. region representative and \n14 overall to qualify for the 2005 Little League World Series.\n  The team displayed commitment to teamwork, gamesmanship, and a love \nof baseball as a team sport as they each played fair, strived to win, \nand always did their best. Vista's pitcher Kalen Pimentel struck out 18 \nbatters in 1 regulation game to tie a Little League record.\n  On September 10, 2005, in the City of Vista, the Rancho Buena Vista \nTeam will celebrate their victory with fellow San Diegans. The team \nwill be joined by their friends, family, supporters, and coaches Randy \nReznicek, Joseph Pimentel, and manager Marty Miller in a parade. They \ncome together to celebrate the team's strength of character, level \nheadedness, pride, and commitment which lead them to victory.\n  It is with great pleasure that I commend the athletes of the Rancho \nBuena Vista Little League Team for the determination, composure, and \nsportsmanship they exhibited throughout the 2005 Little League World \nSeries and for their many accomplishments on the field throughout the \ntournament. I wish them great success in the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/13/senate-section/article/S9983-2", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9983]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            CELEBRATING THE 50TH ANNIVERSARY OF EVANGEL HOME\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise to commemorate the 50th \nanniversary of Evangel Home. Evangel Home is a shelter for needy women \nand children located in downtown Fresno. Now in its 50th year, Evangel \nHomes has been instrumental in helping hundreds of women and children \npiece together their broken lives.\n  Evangel Home was established in 1955 by Ms. Pauline Baker Myers as a \n``Home for Needy Women and Children.'' Saddened by the lack of help for \nwomen in need at local homeless shelters, Pauline Baker Myers \nenvisioned a shelter for women designed to help them put their lives \nback together. Evangel Homes became one of the first shelters of its \nkind in the nation.\n  Evangel Home helps women through a variety of programs. Women enter \nEvangel Home through Crisis Home, an emergency shelter where women may \nstay for up to 28 days. At Crisis Home, up to 24 women and children can \nreceive services such as meals, shelter, clothing, and counseling.\n  Following the initial stay at Crisis Home, women may be eligible for \nthe CrossRoads Residential Program. Through the CrossRoads Residential \nProgram, Evangel Homes offers a 9-month program of courses and services \nto help women make better choices for themselves and their families. \nThe courses are intended to help residents develop their life skills \nfor parenting, finances and setting boundaries.\n  The GARDEN Residential Recovery Program, or God Answers, Redeems, and \nDelivers Everyone who draws Near to Him, is an alternative sentencing \nprogram. It is designed to rehabilitate women in a structured \nenvironment as an alternative to serving a jail or prison term. The \nGARDEN program accommodates as many as six women and includes courses \nand counseling programs tailored to teach women responsibility and \ndecision making skills.\n  Lastly, the Community Connection Graduate Program involves graduates \nfrom the CrossRoads and GARDEN programs. Community Connection \nencourages women to work and attend school while providing them with a \nsupport network to ensure their success.\n  The success of Evangel Homes is evident in the many women and \nchildren who have walked out of its doors to productive and successful \nlives. Annually, Evangel Homes gives shelter to more than 300 women and \n200 children. The mission of Evangel Homes goes far beyond giving \nmaterial support to women in need. Instead, Evangel Homes gives women \nnurturing support in a structured environment so that they may be \ntaught self-reliance and responsibility.\n  Evangel Homes recognizes that those who seek its help have the \nability to make their own choices. Through spiritual guidance and \ncounseling, Evangel Homes strives to erase the effect of what it calls \n``disaffiliation'' or the feeling of isolation and disassociation from \nanything positive in their lives that many women and children feel as \nan effect of their disordered lives. Through programs designed to give \nwomen and children the structure, the hope, and the tools for \nrebuilding their lives, Evangel Homes gives women and children a \n``chance for change.''\n  I congratulate Evangel Homes on their 50th anniversary and wish them \nmuch continued success.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/13/senate-section/article/S9983-3", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9983]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/13/senate-section/article/S9983-4", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9983]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations and a treaty which were referred to the appropriate \ncommittees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/13/senate-section/article/S9983-5", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9983-S9984]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 4:50 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby\n\n[[Page S9984]]\n\nMs. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, without amendment:\n\n       S. 252.

 By Ms. COLLINS (for herself and Ms. Snowe):\n  S. 1690. A bill to provide for flexibility and improvements in \nelementary and secondary education, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about a bill that \ngives students, parents and teachers options and flexibility for \nmeeting accountability and proficiency standards--the No Child Left \nBehind Flexibility and Improvements Act. My colleague, Senator Collins, \nand I have been working hand-in-hand with Maine's educators to identify \nproblems with the No Child Left Behind Act and develop practical \nsolutions to these issues. The bill we introduce today is the product \nof our combined efforts.\n  In 2001, with the passage of the No Child Left Behind Act, Congress, \nin a bipartisan fashion, set forth a truly ambitious education reform. \nThis is a law that was conceived and created with the worthy intention \nto provide equal educational opportunity for every American child. Upon \nimplementation of the No Child Left Behind Act some unforseen \ncomplications of the Act have become apparent. And that is why Senator \nCollins and I called for the creation of No Child Left Behind Task \nForce in 2003 in response to the concerns we heard in meetings with \nMaine's education professionals.\n  As described by the Task Force, ``the challenge that the Task Force \nfaced was to confront the issues raised by No Child Left Behind, to ask \nhow the common State and Federal objectives could be met, and to assess \nhow No Child Left Behind and the Maine Learning Results could be \ncoordinated better to the benefit of the citizens of Maine.'' The \nmembers of this Task Force have their fingers on the pulse of their \nstudents' needs and are therefore uniquely qualified to assess this law \nand make recommendations on how to improve it. In March of this year we \nreceived the Task Force report, and it is with these recommendations \nthat Senator Collins and I could understand its impact on our state and \nour children, so that we can move forward to improve this law in a \nmeaningful manner.\n  Maine's No Child Left Behind Task Force issued several \nrecommendations in five major areas: annual yearly progress, assessment \nand accountability; reading and limited English proficiency students; \nspecial education; highly qualified teachers; and funding. The No Child \nLeft Behind Flexibility and Improvements Act addresses each of these \nareas in several ways. For example, our bill allows local education \nauthorities to use local assessments as opposed to a state-wide test to \nmeasure adequate yearly progress.\n  The Act also gives States additional options for deeming a teacher \nhighly qualified, give schools the discretion to use reading activities \ngrants in a manner that will best address the needs of their students \nand allows schools flexibility with limited English proficiency \nstudents. This is only a sample of the many modifications our bill \nmakes that will results in No Child Left Behind being more effective in \nthe State of Maine.\n  One of our democracy's most noble goals, still a work in progress, \nhas been to create a level playing field on which our children may \nstrive to learn and reach their potential. Clearly, education, along \nwith the family, plays an integral role in achieving this great \nimperative, which distinguishes our nation and helps make us worthy of \nthe world's emulation. The No Child Left Behind Flexibility and \nImprovements Act will help to further this goal.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, along with the senior Senator from Maine, \nSenator Snowe, I am today introducing the No Child Left Behind \nFlexibility and Improvements Act. Our legislation is designed to \nprovide State and local decision makers with greater control options \nand flexibility in the implementation of the No Child Left Behind\n\n[[Page S9987]]\n\nAct of 2002. It would provide commonsense reforms in keeping with the \nworthy goals of this landmark law.\n  Since the law's enactment in 2002, I have had the opportunity to meet \nwith many educators, administrators, parents, and officials from my \nhome State to discuss their concerns regarding the implementation of \nthe No Child Left Behind Act reform. In response to their concerns, \nSenator Snowe and I commissioned a Maine NCLB task force in March of \nlast year. Our task force included members from every county in our \nState, and had superintendents, teachers, principals, school board \nmembers, parents, business leaders, former State legislators, special \neducation specialists, assessment experts, officials from the Maine \nDepartment of Education, a former Maine commissioner of education and a \ndean from the University of Maine's College of Education and Human \nDevelopment. In other words, it was a broad-based commission that \nbrought a great deal of expertise, experience, and perspective to the \ntask force's work. I am very grateful for their dedicated service and \nhard work.\n  Senator Snowe and I charged the task force with three core missions: \nFirst, to examine the problems facing Maine schools, particularly those \nin rural areas of our State in implementing the No Child Left Behind \nAct and to recommend improvements in current regulations and policies; \nsecond, to make recommendations for statutory changes in the Federal \nlaw; and, third, to provide greater clarity to Maine's educators, \nparents, and citizens about the law's goals, requirements, and \nrelationship to Maine's own State education reform effort which is \nknown as Maine Learning Results. What we found is there was some \nconfusion about what was required by No Child Left Behind versus what \nwas required by Maine Learning Results and how the two interacted.\n  The task force met numerous times over the course of the year with \nthe goal of gaining a clearer understanding of NCLB and the \nimplementation issues facing Maine under federal and State education \npolicies. The task force also had the benefit of meeting with officials \nfrom the U.S. Department of Education, including then-Deputy Secretary \nHickok who twice traveled to Maine to meet with the task force. The \ntask force also met with other state officials who shared their \nexpertise in particular areas.\n  After the task force completed its work, Senator Snowe and I met with \ntask force members at the University of Maine in Orono to receive the \nfinal report and to discuss the greatest challenges facing Maine with \nthe implementation of both federal and State education initiatives.\n  I was very impressed with the reports we received from the task \nforce, both the depth and the quality of the task force's analysis, as \nwell as the practicality of its recommendations. I shared the report \nwith several of my Senate colleagues, including the chairman and \nranking member of the Health, Education, Labor, and Pension Committee, \nas well as with the Secretary of Education Margaret Spellings, and \nMaine's education commissioner.\n  I note Secretary Spellings responded with a letter praising the task \nforce for its hard work.\n  The task force report included 26 recommendations for changes to the \nNo Child Left Behind law or the regulations governing its \nimplementation. The task force provided recommendations in five core \nareas: Annual yearly progress and assessment, reading and limited \nEnglish proficiency students, special education, highly qualified \nteachers and funding. The task force recommendations highlighted the \nneed for greater flexibility for the Maine Department of Education, for \nlocal schools to address various implementation concerns facing Maine. \nThose 26 recommendations provide the foundation for the legislation I \nam introducing today.\n  Over the past several months, Senator Snowe and I have taken these \nrecommendations and worked together to translate them into \ncomprehensive legislation. Our legislation would make significant \nstatutory changes designed to provide greater local control to Maine \nand greater flexibility to all States in their implementation efforts, \nnot just Maine.\n  For example, the task force recommended that States be allowed to \nmeasure student performance using different models, such as growth \nmodels, and that special education experts on the IEP team be allowed \nto determine the best assessment for special education students. Both \nof these recommendations are included in our legislation.\n  We believe that our legislation will provide a strong basis for \ncontinuing discussions about the implementation challenges facing the \nStates and will highlight key issues requiring further consideration \nduring the reauthorization process, expected to begin later in the \n109th Congress.\n  Although our legislation seeks to improve the NCLB implementation \nprocess through specific statutory reforms, we recognize that, in some \ncases, the goals of our legislation may be accomplished more quickly \nthrough changes to guidance and regulations from the Department or \nEducation, or through amendments to the states' own implementation \nplans. We will continue to seek additional flexibility through these \navenues to address the immediate implementation concerns facing the \nStates, and believe that our legislation provides a useful guide to \nfederal and State officials in these efforts.\n  Our legislation is a comprehensive effort to address the concerns \nraised by our task force and includes the following provisions:\n  First, our legislation would provide new flexibility in the design of \nstate accountability systems used to determine ``adequate yearly \nprogress'' or AYP. Our legislation would explicitly permit a state to \ninclude additional models ``discussed further below'' in its State plan \nto demonstrate student progress. Even if a school is unable to meet the \ntrajectory targets set by the NCLB time-line, a school would not be \nidentified as failing to make AYP provided it demonstrates improved \nstudent achievement according to these additional models. The principle \nhere is one of more accurately assessing whether all students are \ncontinuing to make progress.\n  Our legislation specifically outlines three additional models that \nwould be permitted under the statute: No. 1, a cohort growth model, \nwhich demonstrates student progress by following the same cohort of \nstudents over time; No. 2, an indexing model, which demonstrates \nstudent progress through improved performance for students below the \nproficient level--for example, improvement from a below basic to a \nbasic level; and No. 3, ``top performing schools'' model, which \ndemonstrates improvement through progress in closing the achievement \ngap between the lowest performing students and, for example, student \nperformance at the State's top 20 percent of schools.\n  The list of models in our legislation is not exclusive, and this \nsection reflects our interest in permitting a far greater diversity in \nthe types of State accountability systems acceptable under the statute. \nWe would also require the Secretary to provide examples of these models \nto give practical assistance to States in the design of these systems. \nWhile the trajectory goals set in the statute are certainly valuable, \nour legislation seeks to clarify that States should be granted greater \nflexibility in the design of different accountability systems provided \nthat they are consistent with the principle of improved student \nperformance.\n  Second, our legislation would modify the existing ``safe-harbor'' \nprovision to allow more schools to take advantage of this provision. \nThe ``safe-harbor'' provision in the law is really another example of \nan improvement model already permitted under the statute. In order to \nqualify for the safe-harbor provision under current law, schools must \nreduce the number of students scoring below the proficient level by 10 \npercent in a single year.\n  As the task force found, this has proven to be a difficult threshold \nto meet, which has resulted in an underutilization of the safe harbor \nprovision. Therefore, we have modified the safe harbor to require only \na 5 percent decrease in the number of non-proficient students, or an \naggregate decrease of 10 percent over 2 years. Our modification would \nreflect what education assessment experts already know: Significant \ngains in academic achievement tend to occur gradually and over time.\n\n[[Page S9988]]\n\n  Third, our legislation also would provide new flexibility related to \nthe statute's 100 percent proficiency requirements for 2013-2014--\nanother specific recommendation of the task force. Our bill would \nrequire the Secretary of Education to conduct a review every three \nyears to determine the progress of the 50 States towards meeting the \n100 percent goal of the statute by 2013-2014. The Secretary would then \nbe permitted, at her discretion, to make modifications to the \nrequirements of the 12-year time-line if she determines modifications \nare necessary and in keeping with the broader purposes of the law.\n  Fourth, our legislation would also provide greater predictability to \nthe school identification process, and limit school identification to \nthose schools most in need of improvement. Currently, a school is \ndesignated as ``in need of improvement'' after it fails to make AYP for \n2 years in a row in the same subject, regardless of what subgroup has \nfailed to make AYP. Our legislation would require that in order to be \nfound in need of improvement, a school would need to fail to make AYP \nin both the same subject area and with respect to the same subgroup of \nstudents 2 years in a row.\n  As our task force noted, the current rules can be extremely \nfrustrating for school administrators who work hard to address a \nreading concern with one group--for example, LEP students--in year one, \nonly to subsequently be identified in need of improvement when they \nlearn that a different subgroup--for example, special education \nstudents--failed to make AYP in year two.\n  We must provide our schools with notice and an ability to work to \nimprove student performance before they are identified as in need of \nimprovement. I share the task force's concern that without these \nmodifications, we risk quickly reaching a point where so many schools \nare found to be in need of school improvement, that the identification \nbecomes meaningless. Worse yet, over-identification of schools creates \nthe risk of having improvement resources spread too thin to make a \ndifference in helping the schools that truly need assistance.\n  Fifth, our legislation would provide additional flexibility for \nteachers of multiple academic subjects at the middle and high school \nlevel in meeting teacher quality requirements. The task force heard \nfrom many teachers in Maine about the burden the current requirements \nhave placed on teachers in small and rural schools. Our legislation \nprovides new options for these teachers to become highly qualified. It \nalso would allow teachers of history, geography, civics, and related \nsubjects to demonstrate subject area knowledge through the obtainment \nof a general State social-studies certificate.\n  Sixth, our legislation addresses concerns about limited English \nproficient students. The task force was concerned about an unintended \nconsequence of the current law, whereby once a student becomes \nproficient in English, that student may no longer be included in the \nLEP subgroup. Federal officials have taken steps to address this issue, \nbut our legislation would go further to correct this problem. Our bill \nwould allow a school to continue to count students who have attained \nEnglish proficiency for purposes of calculating AYP until the student \ngraduates from high school.\n  Seventh, our legislation would clarify that local assessment systems \nare permissible under NCLB. This was an issue of some confusion in \nMaine, despite the fact that I had written a letter to then-Secretary \nPaige and received strong assurances of the acceptability of \nsuch systems. Both Nebraska and Iowa have been approved to use local \nassessment systems to meet NCLB assessment requirements. Although Maine \ncontinues the process of developing its own local assessment system \npursuant to state requirements, I am confident that nothing in the \nfederal statute would preclude Maine from incorporating a local \nassessment system at a time when state officials decide they are ready \nto pursue this option. But our bill makes this crystal-clear.\n\n  Eighth, our legislation would also revise upward the minimum amount \nof funding required for the assessment provisions to go into effect for \nfiscal years 2006 and 2007. This change is based on a recommendation by \nthe task force that efforts be made to ensure adequate funding for the \nrequirements of the statute.\n  These revised levels are based on a GAO report that I required as \npart of the conference report to NCLB. The GAO report estimated that \nalthough most States, including Maine, had the majority of their \nassessment costs covered, particularly in the early years, additional \nresources would be needed in future years as the assessment \nrequirements increased. The report estimated that Maine would have 86 \npercent of its assessment costs covered through 2007, and while this is \nsignificant funding, additional funding will ensure that all States \nhave the resources they need, particularly for the adaptation of tests \nfor LEP and special education populations.\n  Finally, our legislation would also address concerns that some \nspecial education students are being required to take grade-level \nassessments that are inappropriate for them. Our legislation would \nbuild on the important new flexibility the Secretary has provided in \nthis area. Our legislation would allow the student's IEP team to \ndetermine the appropriate test for a student, and if a special \neducation student achieves a proficient score on this test, the student \nwill be deemed proficient for AYP purposes. The IEP requirements of the \nIndividuals with Disabilities Education Act--IDEA--will ensure both \nparent involvement in this process, and increasingly higher \nexpectations for these students. We agree with the task force that the \ninvolvement of parents and the IEP team will serve as an important \nsafeguard to ensure that those special education students who can be \nassessed according to State-determined grade-level expectations will be \nencouraged to do so.\n  Our legislation is a comprehensive effort to provide greater \nflexibility and common-sense modifications to address the key NCLB \nimplementation challenges facing Maine, and other States. At the same \ntime, our legislation remains true to the important goals of NCLB, such \nas increasing accountability, closing the achievement gap, and \nimproving student performance. I look forward to working with my \ncolleagues to improve this landmark law during the reauthorization \nprocess.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GRASSLEY (for himself, Mr. Baucus, Mr. Lott, Ms. Landrieu, \n        Mr. Vitter, Mr. Cochran, and Mr. Shelby):\n  S. 1696. A bill to provide tax relief for the victims of Hurricane \nKatrina, to provide incentives for charitable giving, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. President, a little over 2 weeks ago, the Gulf Coast region \nendured a tragedy of historic proportions. I have heard personal \naccounts of how Americans across this country have come together in a \ncommunal effort to help those affected. Congress needs to come together \nto pass tax relief that will help those in need.\n  The total damage left in the wake of Hurricane Katrina is unknown. \nBut the latest numbers are overwhelming. 377,000 displaced persons are \nspread across 33 States and the District of Columbia. They have sought \nrefuge in shelters, hotels, homes, and with family all over the \ncountry. They are hungry. They are homeless. And they need our \nimmediate help.\n  Millions of Americans immediately swung into action to help by \ndonating goods, time, and money to their Gulf Coast neighbors. In my \nhome State of Montana, thousands have risen to the occasion to offer a \nhelping a hand to those who have been hit by the effects of Hurricane \nKatrina.\n  Four firefighters have been dispatched from Kalispell to New Orleans \nto act as community liaisons. Forty-four Montana Red Cross volunteers \nare already assisting Katrina victims.\n  Students at Rose Park Elementary School in Billings are making \nhandmade cards to raise money. Players and coaches of the Billings \nBulls hockey will hold an auction next week. Each will provide one \nday's worth of labor and the proceeds will go directly to the Red \nCross.\n  In Three Forks, volunteers with the Veterans for Foreign Wars and Boy \nScouts will be combing the streets with buckets asking for donations.\n  In Bozeman, the local National Guard members and Gallatin County \nemergency service workers collected\n\n[[Page S9989]]\n\ncash donations from spectators at the first Montana State University \nhome football game last Saturday. Immediately after the game, a free \nconcert took place and the Red Cross was present to accept \ncontributions.\n  The Gallatin County Sheriff's Office sent 120 dolls and blankets to \nchildren caught in the disaster.\n  The Greater Gallatin United Way has decided to ``adopt'' Alexandria, \nLouisiana, a town that has taken in more than 6,500 evacuees, in an \neffort to focus its giving on one geographic area. Mount Ellis Academy \nstudents raised nearly $10,000 for the United Way last Sunday \nafternoon.\n  And businesses are also rising to the cause. Ag Express, a Billings-\nbased trucking company, is collecting donations of clothing, blankets, \ndiapers, water and other supplies. The company is working with FEMA and \nplans to leave Thursday to deliver the load to Baton Rouge, LA.\n  Wheat Montana Bakery, Carpet One and Corcoran Trucking worked \ntogether to send 4,600 loaves of bread and 41,000 hamburger buns to the \nAstrodome in Houston, TX.\n  In Three Forks, Hegar's Septic Service is giving $5 to the Red Cross \nfor every septic tank it pumps.\n  First Security Bank in Bozeman, MT is sending a freight truck with \nbottled water and medical supplies. They are also donating eight ATM \nmachines to the Louisiana Banker Association. They will be hooked up to \ntemporary banking stations in areas that already have electricity.\n  Mr. President, I am proud of the spirit and generosity of the \ncitizens and businesses of Montana and across this country. It is with \nthis spirit in mind that I offer a tax relief package for the victims \nof this tragedy. My good friend Senator Grassley and I worked closely \nwith our Senate Colleagues in this effort. All six Senators from the \naffected States are cosponsors.\n  The relief package is aimed at four needs of the victims of the \nhurricane. One, they need cash and they need it fast. Two, they need \njobs. Three, they need decent housing. And four, charities need help \nfrom Congress so they can help the victims of the hurricane.\n  First, displaced persons need money. Some of these displaced persons \nleft everything behind. They need cash to buy basic essentials such as \nfood and water.\n  Our bill allows victims of Hurricane Katrina to access retirement \naccounts for immediate cash assistance. Under current law, there is a \n10 percent penalty for early distributions of money in these accounts. \nWe waive that penalty and allow displaced persons to re-contribute to \nthe retirement account over a 3-year period.\n  Second, many of these displaced persons want to get back into the \nworkforce. We provide businesses with the tools they need to hire \ndisplaced workers. The Work Opportunity Tax Credit allows employers to \nclaim a credit against wages paid to new workers that face barriers to \nemployment. It applies to low-income families, veterans and other \ntargeted groups. We expand the Work Opportunity Tax Credit to cover all \nsurvivors of Hurricane Katrina who lived in the disaster zone and \nbecame unemployed as a result of the hurricane.\n  We also allow employers located in the disaster zone to take a 40 \npercent tax credit on wages paid to employees on the first $6,000 of \npay.\n  Third, the people affected by this tragedy need shelter. They need a \nwarm, safe place to rest. Many folks across the country have opened up \ntheir hearts and opened up their homes. But it is not easy. It means \nextra living expenses--the water bill will be higher, the electric bill \nwill be higher, and the grocery bill will be higher. This is a \nconsiderable burden that folks are doing voluntarily, out of the \ngoodness of their hearts. We need to help.\n  That's why we allow individuals to claim an additional personal \nexemption of $500 for each displaced person they shelter for a minimum \nof 60 days. This money will help offset the costs incurred by these \ngenerous individuals.\n  Finally, the victims need the generosity of individuals and \nbusinesses across this country. There has been a surge in giving to \ncharitable organizations and we should encourage this activity. Our \nbill provides incentives for corporations to increase gifts of cash, \nfood, books and other items sorely needed in the affected areas and \ncommunities.\n  We also allow taxpayers to transfer money in retirement accounts to a \ncharitable organizations tax free.\n  The Nation is depending on Congress to act, and to act quickly. I \nthink we have responded with a good bill that provides swift relief for \nthe millions affected by this catastrophe.\n  Hurricane Katrina will exacerbate the existing problems of poverty \nand the working poor. The images we have seen of Katrina's poverty-\nstricken victims over the last few weeks should serve as a wake-up call \nto policymakers--we must do more to help them help themselves.\n  I am currently drafting changes to the tax code which will enhance \ncurrent incentives for the working poor and especially those with \nchildren. I look forward to working with my Colleagues in this effort \nas we continue to help those affected by Hurricane Katrina get back on \ntheir feet.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/13/senate-section/article/S9989-1", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9989-S9990]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 236--RECOGNIZING THE NEED TO PURSUE RESEARCH INTO THE \n  CAUSES, A TREATMENT, AND AN EVENTUAL CURE FOR IDIOPATHIC PULMONARY \n   FIBROSIS, SUPPORTING THE GOALS AND IDEALS OF NATIONAL IDIOPATHIC \n       PULMONARY FIBROSIS AWARENESS WEEK, AND FOR OTHER PURPOSES\n\n  Mr. COLEMAN (for himself, Mr. Lugar, and Mr. Bingaman) submitted the \nfollowing resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions:\n\n                              S. Res. 236\n\n       Whereas idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is a serious lung \n     disorder causing progressive, incurable lung scarring;\n       Whereas idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is one of about 200 \n     disorders called interstitial lung diseases;\n       Whereas idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is the most common \n     form of interstitial lung disease;\n       Whereas idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is a debilitating and \n     generally fatal disease marked by progressive scarring of the \n     lungs, causing an irreversible loss of the lung tissue's \n     ability to transport oxygen;\n       Whereas idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis progresses quickly, \n     often causing disability or death within a few short years;\n       Whereas there is no proven cause of idiopathic pulmonary \n     fibrosis;\n       Whereas approximately 83,000 United States citizens have \n     idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, and 31,000 new cases are \n     diagnosed each year;\n       Whereas idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is often misdiagnosed \n     or under diagnosed;\n       Whereas the median survival rate for idiopathic pulmonary \n     fibrosis patients is 2 to 3 years, and about two thirds of \n     idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis patients die within 5 years; \n     and\n       Whereas a need has been identified to increase awareness \n     and detection of this misdiagnosed and under diagnosed \n     disorder: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That Congress--\n       (1) recognizes the need to pursue research into the causes, \n     a treatment, and an eventual cure for idiopathic pulmonary \n     fibrosis;\n       (2) supports the work of the Coalition for Pulmonary \n     Fibrosis and its partner organizations for their great \n     efforts to educate, support, and provide hope for individuals \n     who suffer from idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, including the \n     work of the Coalition to organize a national ``Idiopathic \n     Pulmonary Fibrosis Awareness Week'';\n       (3) supports the designation of an appropriate week as \n     ``Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis Awareness Week'';\n       (4) congratulates the Coalition for Pulmonary Fibrosis for \n     its efforts to educate the public about idiopathic pulmonary \n     fibrosis, while funding research to help find a cure for this \n     disorder; and\n       (5) supports the goals and ideals of a national \n     ``Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis Awareness Week''.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my friends Senators \nLugar and Bingaman, today in submitting the National Idiopathic \nPulmonary Fibrosis Awareness Week Resolution.\n  Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF) is a devastating lung disease \naffecting\n\n[[Page S9990]]\n\nover 80,000 Americans with 31,000 more Americans diagnosed each year. \nIPF scars the lining of the lungs and makes it hard for oxygen to be \ntransported to the rest of the body. It negatively affects the ability \nof major organs to function normally and impairs breathing.\n  The National Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis Resolution seeks to \nincrease awareness, encourage further research, and support the goals \nof National Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis Awareness Week.\n  Until the day when every American can live a life free of lung \ndisease, we must continue to promote awareness, and strengthen our \ninvestment in research, diagnosis and treatment.\n  I urge my fellow colleagues to join me and Senators Lugar and \nBingaman in raising awareness of Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis by \nsupporting the National Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis Awareness Week \nResolution.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/13/senate-section/article/S9990-1", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9990]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 1695.

(a) Congress finds that--\n       (1) Hurricane Katrina made landfall on August 29, 2005, \n     causing a catastrophic degree of human suffering and damage \n     to infrastructure in the Gulf Coast;\n       (2) the Gulf of Mexico is responsible for more than 25 \n     percent of United States oil production, and in the immediate \n     aftermath of Hurricane Katrina this production capacity was \n     rendered 90 percent inactive;\n       (3) due to the impacts of Hurricane Katrina, the Louisiana \n     Offshore Oil Port, the largest oil importing port in the \n     United States, was forced to close until September 1, 2005, \n     limiting import capacity and tightening oil supplies;\n       (4) Hurricane Katrina forced the closure of 9 major \n     refineries, temporarily eliminated more than 12 percent of \n     national refining capacity, and has resulted in the loss of \n     1,300,000,000,000 barrels of refining capacity;\n       (5) in the wake of Hurricane Katrina's devastating impact \n     on the Gulf Coast, the price of crude oil on the New York \n     Mercantile Exchange reached a record high of $70.85 per \n     barrel, and the national average retail gasoline price \n     reached a record level of almost $3.06 per gallon;\n       (6) although the price of crude oil has fallen to levels \n     experienced prior to Hurricane Katrina, the national average \n     retail cost of gasoline has declined much more slowly and \n     remains at near-record levels;\n       (7) following Hurricane Katrina, retail gasoline prices at \n     some locations increased by as much as $0.50 per gallon \n     overnight, and, at many stations, several price increases \n     occurred during the same day;\n       (8) the rapid, irregular increase in retail gasoline prices \n     and the failure of retail gasoline prices to significantly \n     decline in correspondence with the price of crude oil have \n     raised concerns regarding the possible existence of \n     anticompetitive practices and price gouging in the oil \n     industry;\n       (9) over the course of the past decade, the Federal Trade \n     Commission has approved a series of mergers, acquisitions, \n     and consolidating actions that have dramatically changed the \n     face, and significantly increased the concentration, of the \n     oil industry;\n       (10) in 1998 British Petroleum and Amoco were allowed to \n     consolidate, in 1999 Exxon was able to acquire Mobil Oil, in \n     2000 BP-Amoco was allowed to acquire Atlantic Richfield, \n     Chevron and Texaco were allowed to combine in 2001, and in \n     2005 ChevronTexaco was permitted to acquire Unocal and Valero \n     was allowed to create the largest refining company in the \n     United States when Valero was granted permission to buy \n     Premcor;\n       (11) following these mergers, the 5 largest oil companies \n     in the United States control almost as much crude oil \n     production as the Middle Eastern members of the Organization \n     of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, over \\1/2\\ of domestic \n     refiner capacity, and over 60 percent of the retail gasoline \n     market; and\n       (12) during the second quarter of 2005, the earnings of \n     Exxon Mobil increased by 35 percent over 2004 earnings, and \n     BP, Royal Dutch Shell, and ConocoPhillips enjoyed increases \n     of 29 percent, 34 percent, and 51 percent, respectively, as a \n     result of sustained and severe increases in oil prices.\n       (b) In order to ensure that the level of concentration in \n     the oil industry is not allowing market participants to \n     engage in anticompetitive practices or price gouging, the \n     Attorney General of the United States shall conduct a review \n     of the consolidations of British Petroleum and Amoco, Exxon \n     and Mobil Oil, BP-Amoco and Atlantic Richfield, Chevron and \n     Texaco, ChevronTexaco and Unocal, Valero and Premcor, and any \n     other mergers the Attorney General determines to be \n     appropriate to ensure that the conditions created by the \n     mergers are not facilitating anticompetitive practices, \n     retail gasoline price gouging, or any other conditions that \n     are unduly detrimental to consumers, as determined by the \n     Attorney General.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 1700.

As the report \nexplains, the Protocol will not require implementing legislation.\n  The Protocol amends the Convention Relating to Extradition (the \n``1962 Convention''), signed at Washington on December 10, 1962. The \nProtocol updates the 1962 Convention in a manner consistent with our \nmodern extradition treaties. The Protocol will, upon entry into force, \nenhance cooperation between the law enforcement communities of both \nnations and make a significant contribution to international law \nenforcement efforts.\n  I recommend that the Senate give early and favorable consideration to \nthe Protocol and give its advice and consent to ratification.\n                                                      George W.

Others will need to \nbe voted on, but we hope to set those votes at an early time tomorrow \nso that we can finish this bill as soon as possible.\n  There are a lot of amendments remaining on the list, but I would hope \nSenators do not feel at all compelled to offer those amendments. We \nhave been on this bill since last Thursday.
