Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cornyn). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I rise this morning to continue the \ndebate with regard to the confirmation or advice and consent on the \napproval or denial of judges nominated by the President of the United \nStates. I have listened to most of the debate and have participated in \nsome of it. I have found something to be very interesting. We have not \ntalked much about whether these seven, upon which a filibuster has been \nthreatened, are qualified. We, instead, have argued as to whether \nsomething that was never used for 214 years is or is not a tradition.\n  So I thought this morning I would talk about one of these seven. We \nobviously are debating Priscilla Owen, from the Presiding Officer's \nhome State of Texas. But I want to direct my remarks to Janice Rogers \nBrown, of California, who also has been threatened to be filibustered \nand not allowed to get a vote, up or down.\n  I thought, in preparing my remarks, I would research those who do not \nthink she should get a vote and what they are saying about her record \nso I could at least come to the floor and debate what we really should \nbe debating, and that is the qualifications of that judge. I went to a \nnumber of Web sites, and I found something very common that you usually \nfind in this type of an issue. I found a couple of quotes, repeated \nover and over again, as exemplary of why Janice Rogers Brown is not in \nthe mainstream.\n  So what I thought I would do today in my time is take those quotes \nand the sense from those two speeches she gave and ask the question, Is \nshe out of the mainstream? For, you see, the two quotes that are used \nso much on the Web sites to disparage Justice Brown are two quotes from \ntwo speeches, both of which I have read, which I find to be quite \nremarkable. Both were made in the year 2000, and both are fundamentally \nabout the beliefs of Janice Rogers Brown.\n  So I would like to analyze those two quotes for a second and ask us \nto ask the question, Is Janice Rogers Brown in the mainstream or is she \nnot?\n  The first quote is from August 12, 2000, in a speech she made, \nentitled ``Fifty Ways To Lose Your Freedom.'' I apologize to the Chair. \nI am going to read precisely so I do not miss a word. This is a quote \nused to say she is not in the mainstream--one of them. She said:\n\n       Some things are apparent. Where government moves in, \n     community retreats, civil society disintegrates and our \n     ability to control our own destiny atrophies. The result is: \n     families under siege; war in the streets; unapologetic \n     expropriation of property; the precipitous decline of the \n     rule of law; the rapid rise of corruption; the loss of \n     civility and the triumph of deceit. The result is a debased, \n     debauched culture which finds moral depravity entertaining \n     and virtue contemptible.\n\n  That is a strong statement, but it sits there on its own without any \nthought or context to the speech that was made because the speech by \nMrs. Brown was her belief in the innate goodness of people. What she \nrefers to in her speech as to natural law is that we are born knowing \nright from wrong and good from evil. Her point is that when Government \nbecomes so big, so intrusive, and so pervasive, it can do all of the \nthings that she listed. And as to those things she listed, some people \nsay that is not a mainstream statement. So I ask myself, let's look at \nthose things she said could happen as we lose our freedom.\n  She said families are ``under siege.'' I think that is a fair \nstatement in contemporary 21st century. Divorce continues to be up. \nChild abuse grows. Obviously, that has been a problem.\n  She talks about ``war in the streets.'' We do not have war in the \nstreets, but we have gangs in the streets. We have crime in our \nstreets.\n  ``Expropriation of property.'' I look at the assault on private \nproperty rights, something we debate in this Senate; on ``the rule of \nlaw,'' where today it seems, in many cases, the whole goal is to avoid \nthe rule rather than follow it.\n  ``The triumph of deceit.'' Even in corporate America, look at \nWorldCom, a statement of deceit to represent a value that did not \nexist.\n  A ``debased culture.'' Well, I am a product of the 1950s and 1940s \nand 1960s, when I grew up, similar to Mrs. Brown. I do not know if this \nis a good example or not, but in the 1950s, when I was growing up, \n``Father Knows Best'' was the No. 1 show. Today, it is ``Desperate \nHousewives.'' I think that tells us something about the direction we \nmay have gone in terms of the value of entertainment.\n  And then let's talk about ``virtue'' for a second and finding it \n``contemptible.'' We are in a time where Justices have ruled that \n``under God'' does not belong in the Pledge of Allegiance and \n``obscenity'' is in the eye of the beholder. Somewhere along the way, \nJanice Brown makes a very good point. When Government grows so large \nthat it permeates every facet of society, and there are not restraints \nupon it, then the natural law of what we know as good and evil or right \nand wrong really loses its momentum.\n  Janice Brown made another comment in that speech which I found \nremarkable because it fundamentally talks about what she believes in \nterms of democracy and freedom. I want to quote that. She wrote:\n\n       Freedom and democracy are not synonymous. Indeed, one of \n     the grave errors of American foreign policy is the assumption \n     that merely installing the forms of a regime like ours--\n     without its foundation--will automatically lead to freedom, \n     stability, and prosperity.\n\n  Is that out of the mainstream? I don't think so. Janice Rogers Brown \nwas saying: You just can't say you are something unless you have \nfundamental foundations and values to underpin that. That is what has \nmade this democracy of ours so great. That is why our freedom has \nendured, because we are built on fundamental foundations of right and \nwrong.\n  I, for one, as I consider whether I would give advice and consent on \na justice to one of the highest courts in our Nation, like somebody who \nhas that fundamental belief in natural law, that fundamental belief in \nright and wrong, and that fundamental belief that by human nature we \nare good people, and that freedom of good people, governed by natural \nlaw, is the greatest freedom of all.\n  There is a second quote that has been used over and over on Web \nsites. I want to share that quote, if I may. It is from another speech \nshe made, although it is in the speech I mentioned on ``Fifty Ways to \nLose Your Freedom.'' It is also given and quoted from a speech made in \nthe year 2000 in April to the Federalist Society called ``A Whiter \nShade of Pale.''\n\n       My grandparents' generation thought being on the government \n     dole was disgraceful, a blight on honor. Today's senior \n     citizens blithely cannibalize their grandchildren because \n     they have a right to so much ``free'' stuff as a political \n     system will permit them to extract . . . Big government is . \n     . . [t]he choice of multinational corporations and single \n     moms, for regulated industries and rugged [midwesterners], \n     and militant senior citizens.\n\n  That quote is cited to say that she is not in the mainstream, without \nexplanation and out of context. I wanted to analyze it for a second. I \nam a little older than Janice Rogers Brown, but we are of the same \ngeneration. We are contemporaries. I was born in the early 1940s, she \nin the late 1940s. My grandparents found the Government dole \ncontemptible as well, just as hers. My grandparents were sharecroppers, \njust as hers. In fact, my grandfather, for whom I am named, was a \npretty successful tobacco warehouse man in Coffee County, GA, who lost \nit all in the Depression and sharecropped. During the summers in the \n1950s, my mom would send me down there to work on the farm with him. I \nheard him say many times he never wanted to have to be on the \nGovernment dole.\n  That was not out of the mainstream then, and it is not out of the \nmainstream now. All of us want to find the prosperity of individual \ninitiative and live and work in a country whose system of justice \nhonors the greatest success that any of us can achieve.\n  But she made another good point when she talked about big government \nis, in many cases, the choice of multinational corporations and single \nmoms. Taken out of context, somebody might say: Is that in the \nmainstream? Well, she is pointing out what you and I see\n\n[[Page S5553]]\n\nevery day, and that is both single moms and multinational corporations \nhave their own lobbies here to lobby us. In terms of corporations, that \nmay be for tax treatment or regulation. In terms of single moms, it may \nbe for benefits. But the bigger government grows, the more pervasive it \ngets, the more those lobbies may grow.\n  And she says for regulated industries and rugged midwesterners. \nYesterday I had a meeting with an energy company that is regulated, and \nrugged midwesterners--including Senators in this body--are out for \nethanol benefits all the time. And she was pointing out that how big \ngovernment can get and how pervasive it may be can make all of us \npossibly too dependent on that big government.\n  As far as the statement about senior citizens cannibalizing their \nchildren's future, I understand why somebody might say that is a strong \nstatement. But the debate of the day, outside of this issue of the \nfilibuster, is about Social Security, and the debate to follow that \nwill be about Medicare, and the fact that the two combined, of which I, \na senior citizen, will very shortly benefit from, will, if not \nreformed, cannibalize my grandchildren's future.\n  Janice Rogers Brown is not only not out of the mainstream, somebody \nmight have even called her a prophet in the year 2000 when she made \nboth of these speeches. The analogy she drew and the conclusions she \nmade are now the contemporary issues of the day.\n  I did a radio interview this morning in my State of Georgia to one of \nthe most listened to stations in the city of Atlanta. I was asked by \nthe host: Mr. Isakson, you were in the minority in the Georgia \nLegislature for years and were the leader for 8. Do you understand Mr. \nReid and the minority's point on the filibuster?\n  My answer was: Yes, I understand it. When I was in the minority in \nthat role in the legislature, I tried to take every advantage of every \nrule. But there is a point in time at which you do what is right. You \ndo what the master rule tells you to do.\n  For us, the master rule is the Constitution. And in article II of \nthat Constitution, it delegates to the President the authority to \nappoint Justices to the Supreme Court and several courts created \nthereunder, and it gives the Senate the responsibility to advise and \nconsent, advice and consent that is not delineated in any way in that \nsentence or in that document to require anything other than a simple \nmajority.\n\n  In fact, there are seven places in the Constitution where it says we \nhave to have a supermajority: Impeachment is one, ratifying the \nConstitution. Sometimes it is two-thirds; sometimes it is three-fourths \nin terms of the States ratifying the Constitution. The Constitution is \nspecific. It is specific on judges that the Senate advises and \nconsents, without designation of a supermajority.\n  For the public who listens to the debate about filibusters and \ntradition, that really is the issue. The rule of the Senate invoking \ncloture that requires 60 votes to bring up a simple majority vote is \nthe application of a rule to supersede the constitutional dictate that \nthis Senate vote up or down on Janice Rogers Brown and Priscilla Owen. \nThat is ultimately the issue. To me, it is that simple.\n  Another reason I chose to talk about Janice Rogers Brown is because \nshe is a daughter of the South. Because of the admiration I have for \nher--she and I grew up in the same South. We grew up in the most \nsignificant change that part of the country ever went through, when \ncivil rights changed, beginning with Brown v. Board of Education in \n1954, and I, as a student in school, went through that transition where \nthe schools were integrated. And in college, while I studied political \nscience, the debate in this body and the most famous filibuster of all \nwas about the civil rights laws that were passed in the 1960s.\n  Janice Rogers Brown was born at a time and in a year where her \nascension to the bench on the Supreme Court of California or the \nFederal courts would not have seemed possible because of the rules of \nthe day in the South. But she and I grew through a time where this \nCongress--in fact, this Senate--saw fit to memorialize the civil rights \nlaws and equalize the treatment of every American.\n  That is why I believe Janice Rogers Brown deserves a vote up or down. \nI care and I respect how any Member of this body will vote. But voting \nnot to vote, to deny someone the opportunity to which they have been \nnominated by the President, elected by a majority of the electors in \nthe last election, is not right. It is not, as Janice Rogers Brown \nreferred to it, the natural law. We all know basically the difference \nin right and wrong. Denying that vote is wrong.\n  My remarks this morning are to say simply to those who would say that \nJanice Rogers Brown is not in the mainstream: I ask you to do what I \nhave done. Read her speeches that are quoted. Read them all. When you \nread the speech ``Fifty Ways to Lose Your Freedom,'' don't read the 1 \nparagraph out of context; read all 18 pages and read it a second time. \nUnderstand that this is a woman who wants everybody to understand that \nshe believes in right and wrong. She believes in the appropriate role \nof Government. She believes in empowerment of the individual. Every \nthought of all these quotes ends up being based in that very fact, the \nnatural law of the belief of human beings in right and wrong and the \nempowerment of the individual. I hope Janice Brown is in the mainstream \nbecause I believe that is what the mainstream believes. And those who \nthink it is not have to believe the opposite, which is less power of \nthe individual and shades of gray when it comes to right and wrong. We \nneed on the bench those who see things clearly and speak their mind.\n  In my meeting with Janice Rogers Brown, I told her I was going to \nspeak about her because I had been so impressed with her record and \nbecause I had gone back and read those speeches. She told me this at \nthe end of our meeting: I respect anyone voting either way on me. In \nfact, in a way, I am glad my speeches are now being read. They should \nknow what I think, and they should know what I believe. I should know \nhow they feel.\n  I hope sometime after next Tuesday, after we finally come, hopefully, \nto a vote on Priscilla Owen, we will come to a vote on Janice Rogers \nBrown, and we will find confirmed to another court another justice who \nbelieves in the power of the individual and the difference in right and \nwrong.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, it is with no small measure of reluctance \nthat I rise on the floor of the Senate to speak on the matter of \nextended debate, the filibuster rule. I certainly wish--and I believe \nmany of my colleagues on both sides of the proverbial aisle wish--we \nwere engaging in some other matter. Certainly, there are other matters \nthat are far more pressing in the eyes of the American public than the \ndiscussion we have been having over these last several days and will \nhave over this weekend and early into next week.\n  As is the tradition of this institution, the majority has the right \nto set the agenda, and they are doing so, obviously, with their \ninsistence upon this particular debate and preoccupation with changing \nthe Senate rules with a simple majority. Eliminating the extended \ndebate rule of this institution when it comes to judicial nominations \nis a matter of grave importance. I can think of no other issue that I \nhave been engaged in over the years that has as many profound \nimplications for how this institution will function in the years to \ncome if the majority prevails in its desire to change these rules.\n  Like many others, I wish we were debating the issues here and trying \nto do something more about gasoline prices, education, and health care. \nIn a sense, we are engaging in a filibuster, I suppose, in terms of our \nability and willingness to engage in debate on the matters that are \nmost pressing to the American public.\n  We are a unique institution. There have been 1,884 of us who have \nserved here in 217 or 218 years. It is a rather small group when you \nthink of it--a Nation of more than two centuries in age and yet not \neven 2,000 people have been so fortunate as to have been chosen by \ntheir respective States to sit\n\n[[Page S5554]]\n\nand represent their interests in this unique institution we call the \nSenate.\n  So I begin this discussion by admitting to my colleagues that this is \nno passing matter of interest to any of us here. It is one of the most \nimportant debates we are ever apt to have. In fact, it may be the most \nimportant. Even for those who just arrived here 1 or 2 years ago, or 4 \nor 5 years ago, the outcome of this debate will have profound and long-\nterm implications for the ability of this institution to continue to \nplay the important role it has in the history of our Nation.\n  We have all been honored by our constituents with the privilege of \nserving here, and we have all come to learn that the Senate is not \nsimply a place where we come to work every day; it is a supreme \nmonument, in my view, to human civilization. It is one of mankind's \nmost noble achievements, the establishment of the Senate. It is unique \nin all the world in many ways as a place founded on timeless and time-\ntested principles: respect for human freedom, respect for minority \nrights, and checks on the tendency of any leader or party to accumulate \nand abuse power.\n  The majority leader of the Senate, like the rest of us, is one of its \ntemporary stewards. He is, like the rest of us, a transient member of \nthis enduring institution. He proposes to change the Senate rules to \neliminate the right of extended debate with respect to judicial \nnominations. He is considering doing so by a procedure that, in my \nview, is outside of the rules of the Senate. I take the floor to \ndiscuss and debate this proposal. In doing so, I engage with our \ncolleagues in a practice that is as old as the Senate itself.\n  I know other colleagues have come to the floor in recent days and \nhours to debate this proposal. Some have spoken in support and others \nin opposition. Our debate is in keeping with the deliberative rules and \npractices that have been a hallmark of this institution since it was \nconceived during that steamy Philadelphia summer 218 years ago.\n  This is not just a matter of professional interest for me either; it \nis intensely personal as well. I vividly recall as a young boy sitting \nin the Senate gallery watching my father, a Member of this institution, \nand his colleagues debate the great issues of their time. They were \npassionate debates, and the use of the filibuster was very much in \nplay. Civil rights, war, poverty, and other issues were demanding the \nattention of this institution.\n  I remember, as well, as a teenager sitting on the floor of the \nSenate, where these young men and women sit today, as a Senate page \nduring some of the civil rights debates of the early 1960s. We watched \nSenators such as Lyndon Johnson, Everett Dirksen, Paul Douglas, and \nJacob Javits. We watched them debate sometimes with great passion and \nvehemence. We watched them negotiate, as well. They were well schooled \nin the art of advocacy and equally well schooled in the art of \ncompromise. They understood the obligation of party, but they were no \nless committed to fulfilling their obligations to this great Senate and \nthe country in which they lived.\n  I particularly recall watching the Senator for whom our first office \nbuilding, the Russell Building, is named. The Presiding Officer, of \ncourse, knows of this individual as well as any member here. Senator \nRussell led a very determined minority, insisting on the right to be \nheard on the issue of civil rights. Theirs was not a popular position. \nMy father and others vehemently opposed the position of Senator Richard \nRussell--despite their great friendship, I might add. My father and \nothers were frustrated at the possible ability of Senator Russell and a \nminority of Senators to defeat civil rights legislation. Senators who \nsupported civil rights--my father included--did indeed protest the use \nof extended debate by their adversaries. They even attempted to lower \nthe threshold of Senators required to end such debate. One could hardly \nblame them, I suppose. Tens of millions of Americans were being \nsystematically and often brutally denied their basic rights.\n  Using Senate rules and practices to block civil rights legislation \nwas understandably seen by many Senators--most, in fact--as an affront \nto American values. Nevertheless, efforts to eliminate the rights of \nthe minority to engage in extended debate with respect to civil rights \nlegislation ultimately failed. The noble cause of racial equality \nultimately prevailed in the Senate, and so did the practice that for so \nlong thwarted its triumph.\n  Therein resides the central paradox and the towering majesty, I might \nadd, of this great institution, the Senate. What makes this place so \nrevered and unique is what can simultaneously gall us about it the \nmost--the practice of extended debate. From 1789 until 1917, 128 years, \nthis practice of extended debate, if you will, was absolute in its \nscope. All Senators had to consent--all of them--to close debate on any \nmatter at all. For a subsequent period of 58 years, two-thirds of the \nSenate was required to end debate--though only on a ``pending \nmeasure,'' meaning a legislative matter.\n  It would not be until 1949 that something less than unanimous consent \nwould be required to close debate on nominations--1949, a little more \nthan 50 years ago. Currently, three-fifths of the Senators, of course, \nchosen and sworn are required to close debate on any matter. A motion \nto proceed to the consideration of a change in Senate rules requires an \neven higher threshold--two-thirds of Senators--to close debate.\n\n  As far as I know, the proposal of the present majority leader to \nrequire a simple majority to close debate is without precedent. There \nis not a single rule allowing a bare majority to force a vote on a \njudicial nomination. Certainly, his proposal would, if successful, \nfundamentally alter the nature of the Senate and the balance of power \nas created by the Framers of the Constitution.\n  Part of the difficulty here is the fact that over 50 percent of this \nbody has primarily served under one set of circumstances. Thirty-six \nmembers of the 55 in the majority have primarily served in the \nmajority. Close to half of the Democrats in this body have primarily \nserved in the minority. I have served in this institution for a quarter \ncentury, since 1981. I have served in this body under every imaginable \nconfiguration in its relationship to the House of Representatives and \nthe Presidency. I have served in both Houses. I have served when this \ninstitution was held by the Democrats and the House by Republicans, and \nthe reverse, when the House was held by Democrats and this institution \nby Republicans. I have served under both Democratic and Republican \nadministrations.\n  You need to serve here under different circumstances, I say with all \ndue respect to my colleagues who have been here a limited amount of \ntime, to appreciate how this institution functions. You need to sit \nthere and be a minority member to understand the importance of minority \nrights. You need to be there as a majority member to understand the \nimportance of setting the agenda. But it is almost impossible, I say \nwith all due respect, to understand the delicacies and the rhythms of \nthis institution if you have just been here a limited amount of time, \nserving under one set of circumstances. That, in a sense, is one of the \nproblems.\n  It is also a problem that too many of our Members have come from the \nother body, the House of Representatives. I am included. The other body \nhas become highly divisive. It is highly partisan, with reasons and \nfaults on both sides. But Members who have come from that institution \nto this institution too often bring some of that luggage, in effect, \nsome of that passion that existed in the House, and have allowed it to \ncontaminate this institution. We need to stop it.\n  Too often, over the last number of days, I have heard Members cite \nspeeches given by other Members here. In my earlier days here, that \nwould have never happened. You might debate with one other Member and \nremind them of something they said earlier, but a sort of free-flowing \nattack on other Members of the Senate does this institution ill \nservice, in my view. We ought to have more respect for this place, for \nthe role it has played historically, and the role it will play, and get \nback to the business of doing what the Senate does best.\n  One of the reasons the extended debate rule is so important is \nbecause it forces us to sit down and negotiate with one another, not \nbecause we want to but because we have to. I have\n\n[[Page S5555]]\n\nhelped pass many pieces of legislation in my 24 years here, both as a \nmajority and minority Member of this institution. I have never helped \npass a single bill worth talking about that didn't have a Republican as \na lead cosponsor. I don't know of a single piece of legislation here \nthat didn't have a Republican and a Democrat in the lead. We need to \nsit down and work with each other. The rules of this institution have \nrequired that. That is why we exist. Why have a bicameral legislative \nbody, two Chambers? What were the Framers thinking about 218 years ago? \nThey understood the possibility of a tyranny of the majority. And yet, \nthey fully endorsed the idea that in a democratic process, there ought \nto be a legislative body where the majority would rule.\n  So the House of Representatives was created to guarantee the rights \nof the majority would prevail. But they also understood there were \ndangers inherent in that, and that there ought to be as part of that \nlegislative process another institution that would serve as a cooling \nenvironment for the passions of the day. So the Framers--at the \nsuggestion of two Senators from Connecticut, I might add, the State I \nam privileged to represent, Roger Sherman and Will Oliver Ellsworth; \nhence the compromise is called the Connecticut Compromise--sat down and \nsaid: There is a danger if we don't adopt a separate institution as \npart of the legislative branch where the rights of the minority will \nalso prevail, where you must listen to the other side in a democracy, \npay attention to the other side.\n  In fact, minority interests, we have learned, historically have been \non the right side of the issue on many occasions in our history. Had \nthere not been a place called the Senate, we might never have enjoyed \nthe privilege of seeing our country recognize the value of those \npositions over time.\n  This institution and its rules have given this country remarkable \nleadership over these 218 years, and central to that rule has been the \nextended debate clause, which forces Senators to sit down and work with \none another. That is why we have a 6-year term. That is why only one-\nthird of us are up every 2 years. That is why we have a term longer \nthan the President or the House Members. That is what the Framers had \nin mind. They were worried about too much control residing in one \nbranch or the other. So they created this remarkable institution.\n  I say this again with all due respect. I listened to our colleague \nfrom Hawaii, Senator Inouye, who gave his maiden speech on the floor of \nthe Senate supporting the filibuster rule during the civil rights \ndebates. The first thing he said in that debate was: I am most \nreluctant to get up because I understand the tradition of this \ninstitution of taking a little time before you get up as a new Member \nand talk about what needs to be done.\n  I am not suggesting people ought to go back to the 19th century, or \nearly 20th century, and sit back and wait and bide their time. But it \nis important to learn how this place functions. There are rules here, \nclearly. But there is something beyond rules; there are traditions that \nare not written down in any book anyplace but which make the place \nfunction. When you read Robert Caro's book ``Master of the Senate,'' \nabout Lyndon Johnson and the golden age of the Senate, the days of \nCalhoun and Clay and Webster, the days in the early 1950s, when giants \nserved here and engaged in the great debates of their times, it was not \nnecessarily the rules of the Senate that created those great moments in \nhistory; it was the quality of the individuals here who respected the \nrules and worked within them, because they understood the value of this \ninstitution.\n  That is what worries me so much about this debate. We are not paying \nattention to each other here. We have come to believe, I suppose, that \nthe sum of the special interests in this country equals the national \ninterests. They never have and they never will, in a sense. We need to \nfocus on the history of this place, the role we can play, and the \nimportance this institution can play in the years ahead. As I said at \nthe outset, we are only stewards here.\n  I have been here a quarter of a century. It is a fraction in time. \nAnd what do we do with our time? When our tenure is over and our legacy \nis written, the history of our service, the question will be asked--\nwhat did we do with our time? We do not get a chance every day to make \na huge difference. There are only going to come a handful of \nopportunities that will be of great value when you look back on your \nservice and think of the best moments you had.\n  Some of the best moments, I promise, for those recently arriving in \nthe Senate, will be the moments when you stood up and defied, in a \nsense, the passions of the day, the trend of the day, and said: I am \ngoing to do something different. I am going to step out of the \npredictable role and try and do something people may not expect.\n  Over my service here, those Members who have done that are the ones \nwho have enjoyed their service and look back on their service with the \ngreatest sense of pride.\n  This institution deserves some leaders today who are willing to stand \nup and protect it and defend it. I know passions are running high. I \nknow the temperature is getting hotter and hotter by the day. But this \nissue we are debating will probably fade in memory. It will be hard to \nrecall a few years from now what it was we were debating when the \nfilibuster rule was involved. I do not minimize this issue of judicial \nnominations. I respect my colleagues who feel passionately about this \nissue. But I promise them, within a matter of months or years, you will \nbe hard pressed to recall the names of the people involved or exactly \nwhere they were going to serve, on what bench.\n  Yet the rules we change will profoundly affect how we are going to \nengage effectively in the other matters that come before us. If the \nmajority decide they simply do not like the rules in any one Congress \nand change it with a simple majority, then the rules will mean almost \nnothing if they can change them with 51 votes.\n  The reason our Founders set such a high standard over the years is \nbecause they wanted some perpetuity to those rules. And if, after all \nof this, we are able to say with regard to extended debate that you are \ngoing to eliminate that as well, then obviously there is a fear this \nsame procedure, this elimination of extended debate, will also be used \nto limit debate on other matters beyond judicial nominations. Once you \nset the precedent, it is not that long a leap to go from judicial \nnominations to substantive matters.\n  Throughout our history, the right of extended debate has never been \nseriously questioned, in my view, as other than a vital foundation of \nour Republic. It has been the catalyst for achieving the most \nremarkable feature of our civilization: the degree to which we have \nbeen able to provide our citizens with great freedom and great \nstability.\n  The Senate was created, in the words of James Madison, ``first to \nprotect the people against their rulers; secondly to protect the people \nagainst the transient impressions into which they might be led. . . .''\n  He went on to say:\n\n       The use of the Senate is to consist in its proceeding with \n     more coolness, with more system, with more wisdom, than the \n     popular branch.\n\n  The word ``Senate'' comes from the Latin word ``senatus,'' wise men, \nwise people. We always associate wisdom with tenure, with service, with \nexperience, and the people who have had life experiences and bring them \nto this institution. That is the word ``Senate,'' that is what it \nmeans.\n  In order to carry out this mission, of course, the Framers endowed \nthis institution with a few extremely important qualities and powers. \nFirst, as I mentioned, the Framers gave Senators terms of office, as I \nmentioned, three times longer than House Members and one-third longer \nthan the President's.\n  Second, as I mentioned as well, the Framers ensured that only one-\nthird of the Senate stands for election every 2 years, thereby making \nit a continuing body.\n  Next, the Framers created a body dramatically different from the \nHouse. Each State would be represented by two Senators no matter how \nsmall or large, ensuring that the interests of smaller States would not \nbe trampled upon by the more popular jurisdictions.\n  And, finally, the Founders insulated the Senate from sanction for \ndebate by explicitly granting it the power to ``determine the rules of \nits own proceedings.''\n  These constitutionally mandated attributes have proven \nextraordinarily\n\n[[Page S5556]]\n\nsuccessful in ensuring the Senate is a bulwark against popular passions \nthat move in time from the left to the right, back and forth. None of \nus can predict within a matter of days, hours, weeks, months, how the \ncountry's popular opinion moves and changes. And yet having a place \nwhere those passions are not going to dictate the outcome every day is \nessential to the stability of this great Republic, in my view.\n  With these great rights come responsibilities, of course. The Senate \nwas given special powers to try impeachments, ratify treaties, and, \nmost critically for our purposes today, to confirm nominees. Perhaps \nnowhere other than in the advice and consent responsibility of the \nSenate, laid out in article II, section 2 of the Constitution, do we \nsee the Framers' keen preoccupation not only to respect the principle \nof majority rule but, as important, to limit the possibility of an \noverreaching Executive and the tyranny of the majority.\n  The President nominates, but the President's power is balanced and \nchecked by the power of the Senate to provide advice and consent. \nRemember, Mr. President, what were the personal experiences of the \nFramers? They came off an experience where one individual, a king, had \nmade exclusive decisions that affected the lives of millions of people, \nand they were suspicious of an awful lot of power being accumulated in \ntoo small a place or too few hands.\n  With respect to the judiciary, the third and separate equal branch of \nGovernment, the powers of the President and the Senate are deliberately \nand carefully counterimposed. Robert Caro, the author whom I cited \nearlier, has observed that very point. Caro says in his book:\n\n        . . . [I]n creating the new nation, its Founding Fathers, \n     the Framers of its Constitution, gave its legislature . . . \n     not only its own powers, specified and sweeping . . . but \n     also powers designed to make the Congress independent of the \n     President and to restrain and act as a check on his \n     authority, [including] power to approve appointments, even \n     the appointments made within his own Administration. . . . \n     And the most potent of these restraining powers the Framers \n     gave to the Senate. . . . The power to approve Presidential \n     appointments was given to the Senate alone; a President could \n     nominate and appoint ambassadors, Supreme Court Justices, and \n     other officers of the United States, but only ``with the \n     Advice and Consent of the Senate.''\n\n  The proposal contemplated by the majority leader would, with all due \nrespect to the leader, in my view, undermine the Senate's role in our \nconstitutional democracy. I know that has been said by many others. It \nwould surrender enormous power to the Executive and upset, in our view, \nthe system of checks and balances created by the Framers.\n  It would have us move to a majority cloture rule on that portion of \nour business that girds the independence of the judicial bench.\n  There is an irony to this proposal that cannot go unstated, and \nshould not go unexamined. It proposes to limit the Senate's exercise of \nits power in the matter of nominations rather than legislation. Yet one \ncan argue convincingly that it is precisely in the area of \nnominations--particularly judicial nominations--that the Framers \nintended that power to be most utilized.\n  We must remember that during the Constitutional Convention, only \nafter lengthy debate was the power to appoint judges committed to the \nPresident as well as to the Senate.\n  In the closing days of that Convention, the draft provision in the \nConstitution still read as follows:\n\n       The Senate of the United States shall have the power to . . \n     . appoint . . . Judges of the Supreme Court.\n\n  On four separate occasions, proposals were made to include the \nPresident in the process for selecting judges. And on four occasions in \nthose closing days, those proposals were rejected. Why? John Rutledge \nof South Carolina said it best: ``The people will think we are leaning \ntoo much toward monarchy'' if the President is given free rein to \nappoint judges.\n  The final compromise was characterized by Gouverneur Morris of \nPennsylvania as giving the Senate the power ``to appoint Judges \nnominated to them by the President.'' In Federalist Paper No. 76, \nHamilton explained the Senate's review would prevent the President from \nappointing judges to be ``the obsequious instruments of his pleasure.'' \nAs Federalist No. 78 confirms, the Founders were determined to protect \nthe independence and the integrity of the courts, and they believed the \nchief threat to the independence and integrity of our courts was a \nPresident who had nearly unchecked authority to appoint judges.\n  Against this backdrop, it is, indeed, ironic and troubling to this \nSenator that the majority leader now suggests that we restrict \ndeliberation, debate, and the rights of the minority with respect to \nthe nominations process, and thereby enhance the ability of the \nmajority to turn this Senate into a rubberstamp for Presidential \nnominees, Democratic or Republican.\n  The majority leader and his supporters refer to this effort as the \nconstitutional option. Yet in the name of the Constitution, they are \nadvocating a change that defies the history of the very document they \nclaim to honor. They eagerly lecture this body about preserving \nfidelity to the original intent of the Framers. Yet they now act with \nreckless disregard, in my view, for that intent.\n  At its most fundamental, this Senate is a testament to the rights of \nthe minority. Small States, such as mine--I suggest even the Presiding \nOfficer's State falls into this category--we have an equal say to \nCalifornia, Texas, Illinois, and New York, and the Senate's tradition \nand its rules protect debate and guarantee that we cannot be trampled \nupon, overrun by larger jurisdictions. That is part of our unique \ncharacter.\n  This tradition of extended debate to preserve minority rights as \nsmaller States offends no constitutional edict at all. In fact, it \nendorses it. In the words of former Chief Justice Burger, ``there is \nnothing in the language of the Constitution, or history, or cases that \nrequires that a majority always prevail on every issue.''\n  Nor is there any place in the Constitution entitling anyone--judicial \nnominees included--to a so-called up-or-down vote on the floor of this \ninstitution.\n  It has been noted by the Democrats in this debate that there were \nsome 69 nominations sent by President Clinton to the Judiciary \nCommittee, appellate and district court judges, for which none of them \nwere given a hearing. Some said that is a form of filibuster. I agree, \nit is.\n  There is nothing, I argue to my Democratic friends, that said \nPresident Clinton had an absolute right for those nominees to have a \nhearing in the Judiciary Committee. He had an obligation to send us \nnominees. We had no obligation to guarantee them a hearing in the \nSenate of the United States, any more than President Bush's nominees \nnecessarily have an absolutely right to a simple up-or-down vote in \nthis Chamber. Neither side is right in that regard.\n  The Senate, under Republican control during President Clinton's \ntenure, was exercising its rights. I did not like the outcome. I did \nnot like the result. But the Senate Judiciary Committee had a right not \nto give them a hearing.\n  Democrats today argue--I think with equal cause--that these nominees \nhave no right to an up-or-down vote any more than President Clinton's \nnominees had a right to a hearing. That is exactly what the Framers \nwere saying. That is exactly what the people wanted when they wrote the \nprovisions of our Constitution creating the Senate.\n\n  In addition, nowhere does the Constitution or record of the \nConstitutional Convention say or even suggest that the advice and \nconsent function of the Senate should be less with respect to judicial \nnominees than other nominees.\n  The reason there is no such distinction is simple: it is illogical on \nits face. How can anyone argue that we should have the right to \nextended debate with respect to some obscure agency nominee who can \nserve for a couple of years, but that we should not have that right \nwith regard to lifetime appointments to the Federal bench? Such an \noutcome not only defies the history of the Convention, it defies logic. \nAnd this is called the ``constitutional option''? To call it by this \nname, in my view, dishonors the genius of those men who conceived the \nConstitution.\n  The majority leader's proposal will, without question, diminish the \nSenate's power in relation to the Executive, and in so doing will \ndiminish the power of each and every Senator, regardless of party, to \nstand up for his or her State.\n\n[[Page S5557]]\n\n  Let me say to those who have been here only serving in the majority, \nonly serving under a Republican President--my wish as a Democrat is \nthat this would happen more quickly--I do not know when it will happen, \nbut it will happen, I promise you. If you are here long enough, you \nwill serve in the minority. You will serve with a Democratic President. \nAnd for those of you who want to absolutely guarantee that Presidents \ncan guarantee a right on their nominees coming up here, you will rue \nthe day when it comes. You will rue the day, and you will look back on \nthis debate and wonder why there were not more people standing up \nreminding each other of the importance of this institution and what the \nFramers had in mind in trying to protect us against absolute guarantees \nfor nominees to lifetime appointments which no other appointees in our \nentire Federal system enjoy.\n  If my colleagues do not know this from their own experiences, I \nsuggest they consider the experience of one of our colleagues, a \nRepublican, who a few weeks ago ran into the problem. He announced at \nthe beginning of the week his intention to place a hold on nominees to \na certain commission. By the end of the week, the President had recess-\nappointed each and every one of those nominees. The considered views of \nour Republican colleague were of no consequence. They were disregarded \nout of hand.\n  Do any of us think this or any other President will be more or even \njust as likely to consider our views on judicial nominations if we \nsurrender power to this President or any future President? I for one do \nnot. Colleagues, if that happens, if we cede power to the Executive, \nyou may never get it back.\n\n  Of all the issues that we will face in this and future Congresses, \nfrom war and economic growth, to health and education, none is more \nimportant than this debate because how we resolve this issue will in \nmany respects determine how, indeed, we resolve all the others.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator's time has expired\n  Mr. DODD. I ask for 1 additional minute, if I may.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DODD. I thank the Chair.\n  As I said a few minutes ago, those of us fortunate to serve in this \nbody are but its temporary custodians. We are stewards of an \ninstitution governed by rules that have withstood the test of more than \ntwo centuries in time. Now is not the moment to scrap such rules simply \nto achieve objectives that are, in essence, transient and partisan in \nnature, even though they are deeply felt by their proponents.\n  I know of no other branch of government, in this or any other nation \nfor that matter, that would willingly surrender power to another \nbranch. This is a moment for Senators, as Senators, to stand up for the \nSenate.\n  The disagreements we have today will likely be forgotten. They will \nfade like so many grainy snapshots into the dim recesses of our \ncollective national memory. But to change the rules of the Senate, to \ndo so by evading rather than abiding by the rules of this Chamber, \nwould do lasting damage not only to this institution but to the \nRepublic it has served so long and so well.\n  Future generations will not remember why those rules have been \nchanged, but they will live each and every day with the consequences of \nthis decision. I urge my colleagues to reject this proposal and let us \nget back to the business of functioning as the Senate should.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, people who are following the debate on the Senate \nfloor about this nominee, Priscilla Owen, might be forgiven if they \nthink the sky is falling or perhaps the end is coming for the Senate as \na unique institution in American Government, or somehow that the \nnuclear option is going to simply blow the place up and all of us with \nit.\n  I think you can read an awful lot into the rhetoric that is being \nused and the tone that is being used during this debate to see what it \nis all about. I worry, as well, that when we talk about statistics, \nwhen we talk about what percentage of President Bush's nominees were \nconfirmed, which ones were not, how President Clinton's nominees were \ntreated, what percentages were confirmed, what percentages were not, \nthat we fall into the deplorable habit of treating people like mere \nstatistics. But I would only add that one violation of the Constitution \nis one too many. And when it comes to giving an up-or-down vote to a \nPresident's judicial nominee, which has happened for 214 years up until \n4 years ago this last May 9, we are simply talking about treating \npeople as they deserve to be treated--with respect. We are talking \nabout treating Presidents who have won national elections with the \nrespect they deserve, not as a rubberstamp but to provide the advice \nand consent that the Constitution contemplates when it comes to \njudicial nominees.\n  You would think the end is near for this institution listening to \nsome of the rhetoric, when all we are talking about is trying to \nrestore this 214 years of unbroken tradition of providing an up-or-down \nvote for any nominee who enjoys bipartisan majority support in this \nChamber as this nominee, Priscilla Owen, does.\n  If you want to talk about statistics--and our friends on the other \nside of the aisle have--they have time and time again essentially \nargued this is payback for how they perceive Republicans treated \nnominees of President Clinton. And one of the names they mention is \nRichard Paez, who was nominated by President Clinton, who was \nultimately confirmed by less than 60 votes of the Senate. All we are \nasking is that Priscilla Owen be treated with the same courtesy and \naccording to the same standard that Richard Paez was treated when he \nwas given an up-or-down vote and was confirmed by less than 60 votes.\n  A number of my colleagues on this side of the aisle have done an \nexcellent job of presenting, in a comprehensive fashion, the legal and \nconstitutional framework that exists for the Senate's authority to \ndetermine its own rules, and that is really all we are talking about--\nthe Senate determining its own rules. I believe the case that has been \nmade for the Senate continuing to do that is a strong one. In fact, \nthat is why Senators on the other side of the aisle, including the \nformer Democrat majority leader, the senior Senator from West Virginia, \nthe senior Senator from Massachusetts, and the senior Senator from New \nYork, have all stated in the past as recently as 2 years ago that, of \ncourse, a majority of Senators has the power to set rules, precedents, \nand procedures. Indeed, that is why the power of the Senate majority to \nset rules, precedents, and procedures has sometimes been referred to as \nthe Byrd option, or otherwise, the constitutional option.\n  But let me begin my remarks by making a simple point I made last \nnight, and let me reiterate it. I much prefer the bipartisan option to \nthe Byrd option. America works better, the Senate works better, and our \nconstituents are better served when we act in a bipartisan and \ncooperative manner. I would much prefer to wake up each day not \nanticipating the battles in this Chamber but, rather, to anticipating \nthe opportunity to do what I came here to do, and that is to serve the \ninterests of my constituents and the Nation by trying to get things \ndone, trying to solve problems. That is why I believe we were sent \nhere. I have done my best to take advantage of every opportunity I have \nseen in order to work in a bipartisan manner. I would simply choose \ncollaboration over contention any day of the week.\n\n  But we know that bipartisanship is a two-way street, that you cannot \nclaim to be bipartisan when a partisan minority seeks to obstruct, and \nhas successfully obstructed for the last 4 years, a bipartisan majority \nfrom getting a simple up-or-down vote for nominees such as Priscilla \nOwen. In order to have true bipartisanship, both sides must agree to \ntreat each other fairly and apply the same rules and standards \nregardless of who happens to be President, whether it is a Republican \nor Democrat, and regardless of who is in the majority, whether it is a \nRepublican or Democrat majority. But bipartisanship, we know, is \ndifficult when long held understandings and the willingness to abide by \nbasic agreements and principles have unraveled so badly as it has these \nlast 4 years.\n\n[[Page S5558]]\n\n  What are we to do when these basic principles and commitments and \nunderstandings have simply unraveled so badly? What are we to do when \nSenate and constitutional traditions are abandoned for the first time \nin more than 2 centuries; when both sides once agreed that nominees \nwould never be blocked by the filibuster, and then one side says, well, \nthat agreement never existed; when our colleagues on the other side of \nthe aisle boast in fundraising letters to their donors of their \n``unprecedented'' obstruction and then come to the Senate floor and \nclaim that precedent is on their side and that somehow this side, the \nbipartisan majority, is somehow blowing up the Senate by exercising a \n``nuclear option''? What are we to do when the former Democrat majority \nleader claims on one day that the filibuster is somehow sacrosanct and \nsacred to the Founders and then demonstrates by his own words that he \nhas successfully killed filibusters in the past on the Senate floor?\n  In 1995 he stated:\n\n       I have seen filibusters. I have helped to break them. The \n     filibuster was broken, back, neck, legs and arms.\n\n  Finally, what are we to do, Mr. President, when they claim on one day \nthat all they seek is more time to debate a nomination, and then claim \non another day there are not enough hours in the universe to debate the \nnomination? Indeed, as we stand here 4 years after this fine nominee \nwas proposed, we know there has been more than adequate time for \ndebate. There has been a lot of debate. But this is not about debate. \nThis is not about the Senate's traditions. This is about raw political \npower of a partisan minority to obstruct a bipartisan majority from \nexercising the power conferred upon that bipartisan majority by the \nConstitution.\n  It is clear that a partisan minority is now seeking to impose a new \nrequirement during these last 4 years, that nominees will not be \nconfirmed without the support of at least 60 Senators. This, by their \nown admission--at least at one point by their own admission--is wholly \nunprecedented in Senate history. But thinking about it, Mr. President, \nthe reason they have now sought to adopt this double standard and this \nincreased threshold before a nominee can even get a vote, the reason \nfor it is simple, and that is because the case for opposing this fine \nnominee, Priscilla Owen and her fellow nominees, is so weak that the \nonly way they can hope to defeat their nominations is by applying a \ndouble standard and changing the rules. That is the only way they can \nhope to win--this partisan minority. We have heard a lot of talk about \nsome of the decisions this judge has made when she served on the Texas \nSupreme Court, as she still does. I think the distinguished Senator \nfrom Georgia, who is currently occupying the Chair, spoke eloquently \nabout another nominee, Janice Rogers Brown, who is also accused of \n``being out of the mainstream'' and shown how thin and baseless that \nallegation is--and by the way, Janice Rogers Brown is accused of being \nout of the mainstream for exercising her first amendment right as an \nAmerican citizen in a speech, two speeches, not in the course of her \njudicial decisionmaking. Does that mean that citizens should somehow be \nconstrained in what they can talk about lest they be deemed \ndisqualified to serve as a Federal judge later on because some Senator \nor some group of Senators think that they are ``outside of the \nmainstream''? I hope not.\n  A number of Senators have mentioned the case called Montgomery \nIndependent School District v. Davis. This is one of the cases they \ncite as an example for Justice Owen ``being out of the mainstream.'' \nBut, of course, I doubt they have read the opinion. This is about a \nschoolteacher a local school board dismissed because of her poor \nperformance and because of her abusive language toward her students. \nThis teacher admitted that she had referred to her students as little \nblank blank blanks--a four-letter expletive that I will not repeat on \nthe floor of this body. When confronted with this statement, she \njustified the use of this expletive to schoolchildren, mind you, on the \nbizarre ground that she uses that same language when talking to her own \nchildren--clearly unacceptable conduct.\n  The senior Senator from New York has said that this teacher was \nwrongly dismissed. Other Senators criticized Justice Owen about this \ncase as well. I have children. Many Senators have children. Certainly \nthe people across America who have children understand. Are Justice \nOwen's opponents really arguing that this teacher's opponents acted \ninappropriately, that she was wrongly dismissed for using that language \nand mistreating her students in such a way?\n  If you read the opinion, as I doubt the critics have, preferring, \nrather, to speak off of talking points written by political consultants \nwho engage in character assassination for their profession, Justice \nOwen simply said that the local school board was justified in \ndismissing the teacher--hardly a decision which is out of the \nmainstream.\n  As it turned out, the majority of the court disagreed and held that \nthe school board could not dismiss the teacher, on legal grounds. But \nJustice Owen's dissenting opinion simply concluded that the majority:\n\n        . . . allows a State hearing examiner to make policy \n     decisions that the Legislature intended that local school \n     boards make.\n\n  She also argued that the majority ``misinterpreted the Education \nCode.''\n  This partisan minority in the Senate has accused Justice Priscilla \nOwen of judicial activism. But the people of America understand what \njudicial activism is and, conversely, what it is not. The American \npeople understand a controversial judicial activist decision when they \nsee one, whether it is the radical redefinition of some of our \nsociety's most basic institutions, such as marriage; whether it is \nexpelling the Pledge of Allegiance from classrooms of schoolchildren \nbecause the phrase ``one nation under God'' is invoked; or whether it \nis the elimination of the ``three strikes and you are out'' law and \nother penalties against hardcore convicted criminals; or the forced \nremoval of military recruiters from college campuses. Justice Owen's \nrulings fall nowhere close to these sort of activist decisions, this \ncategory of cases that to me defines the phrase ``judicial activism.''\n  There is a world of difference between struggling to try to do the \njob judges are duty-bound to perform--that is, to interpret ambiguous \nexpressions of a statute--there is a world of difference between that \nand refusing to obey a legislature's objectives altogether and instead \nsubstituting that judge's own opinion or own social or political agenda \nfor what the legislature, the elected representatives of the people, \nhad said the law should be.\n  If the Senate were to follow more than 200 years of consistent \ntradition, dating back to our Founding Fathers, there would be no \nquestion but that this judge, and this fine and decent human being, \nwould be given the up-or-down vote and confirmed for the Fifth Circuit \nCourt of Appeals. President after President after President have gotten \ntheir judicial nominees confirmed by a majority vote, not a \nsupermajority vote of 60 votes or more. By their own admission, a \npartisan minority in this body is using unprecedented tactics to block \nher nomination. Here again, the reason is simple. As any careful \nexamination of the decisions made by this good judge reveal, the case \nfor the opposition is so weak that the only way they can defeat her \nnomination is by applying a double standard and changing the rules.\n  It is not just me who says that a supermajority requirement is \nunconstitutional and violates the Senate traditions for over 200 years. \nLegal scholars across the political spectrum have long concluded what \nwe know in this body instinctively--that to change the rules of \nconfirmation, as this partisan minority has done starting 4 years ago, \nbadly politicizes the judiciary and hands over control of the judiciary \nto special interest groups--something we all ought to want to avoid.\n  The record is clear: Senate tradition has always been majority vote, \nand the desire by some to alter those Senate rules has been roundly \ncondemned by legal experts across the political spectrum.\n  In fact, Lloyd Cutler, who recently passed away, who was really the \ndean of lawyers, who advised Presidents, both Republican and Democrat, \nduring the course of his professional lifetime, wrote ``The Way to Kill \nSenate Rule XXII,'' which was published in the Washington Post in 2003. \nHe said:\n\n\n[[Page S5559]]\n\n\n       A strong argument can be made that the requirements of . . \n     . a two-thirds vote to amend the rules are . . . \n     unconstitutional.\n\n  Liberal USC law professor Erwin Chemerinsky wrote in 1997, ``Rule \nXXII''--that is the rule that requires 60 votes in order to get a vote \nthat is being invoked now for the first time in more than 200 years \nagainst nominees. We are not talking about legislation, as I know the \nChair understands and which has been clear but sometimes gets muddled. \nProfessor Chemerinsky writes:\n\n       Rule XXII is unconstitutional in its requirement that \n     change be approved by two-thirds vote to change the Rule. The \n     effect of declaring this unconstitutional is that the current \n     Senate could change rule XXII by majority vote. In other \n     words, a majority of this Senate could eliminate the \n     filibuster if a majority wished to do so.\n\n  I believe a majority does wish to do so when it comes to breaking the \nlogjam over nominees, not with regard to legislation. There is a \ngeneral consensus, bipartisan consensus in the Senate, that, for our \nown reasons, it is important to preserve the filibuster for \nlegislation. But, of course, that only affects how we conduct our \nbusiness, not how we interact with a coordinate department of \nGovernment or branch of Government known as the executive branch in \nexercising advice and consent when it comes to the nominees by a \nPresident elected by the American people.\n\n  To employ the Byrd option is not a radical move. It would merely be \nan act of restoration. I say it again. There is nothing radical about \nthe Byrd option, yet our colleagues on the other side of the aisle have \ncalled it, not the Byrd option or the constitutional option, but the \nnuclear option, to suggest that somehow there is something radical \nabout it.\n  But all we need to do is to look at the senior Senator from West \nVirginia, who was then majority leader, who used the constitutional \noption--and this is the reason it is sometimes called the Byrd option--\non four occasions--in 1977, in 1979, in 1980, and again in 1987--to \nestablish precedents that changed Senate procedure during a session of \nCongress. Other leading Senators from the other side of the aisle have, \nat some times in the past--perhaps not today but in the past--\nrecognized the legitimacy of that procedure, of the Byrd option, \nincluding the senior Senator from Massachusetts and the senior Senator \nfrom New York, as recently as 2 years ago.\n  The establishment of Senate rules and procedures by majority vote is \ncommonplace. As a matter of fact, on most days, as the occupant of the \nchair knows, we operate by unanimous consent; that is, everybody \nagreeing--or at least no one objecting. The constitutional power of a \nmajority of the Senators to strengthen, improve, and reform Senate \nrules and procedures is expressly stated in the Constitution. It was \nunanimously endorsed by the U.S. Supreme Court, and it has been \nsupported and exercised by the Senate on numerous occasions.\n  For those who may be students of the Constitution, all you have to do \nis look at article I, section 5, which clearly states that, ``[e]ach \nHouse may determine the Rules of its Proceedings.''\n  The Supreme Court has unanimously held in United States v. Ballin \nthat, unless the Constitution expressly provides for a supermajority \nvote, the constitutional rule is majority vote. Again, as the Senator \nfrom Georgia pointed out earlier this morning, when it comes to \namending the Constitution, when it comes to ratifying treaties, it is \nclear that an explicit supermajority requirement is there. But failing \nthat, where the Constitution is silent about a supermajority \nrequirement, the U.S. Supreme Court said majority rule is the standard.\n  I point out again, perhaps the most eloquent and learned Member of \nthis body, when it comes to Senate rules and procedures, is the \ndistinguished senior Senator from West Virginia. I know as a new \nSenator I have watched and listened and tried to learn from him about \nthose Senate rules. He is truly a master of that subject. Yet Senate \nDemocrats have spent considerable time dismissing how the Founders \nwould somehow be offended if a majority of Senators acted to prevent a \npartisan minority of the Senate from using filibusters against \nnominees. One of their own, one of the Senate's great historians, this \nsame distinguished senior Senator from West Virginia, stipulated on the \nSenate floor that our Founders did not tolerate filibusters.\n  He said:\n\n       The rules adopted by the U.S. Senate in April, 1789, \n     included a motion for the previous question. The previous \n     question allowed the Senate to terminate debate. ``Mr. \n     President, I move the previous question'' or in the House \n     ``Mr. Speaker, I move the previous question,'' and if that \n     gains a majority, no further debate, the previous question \n     will be voted on.\n\n  As the senior Senator from West Virginia has previously written in \nhis four-volume history of the U.S. Senate:\n\n       It is apparent that the Senate in the first Congress \n     disapproved of unlimited debate. In fact, for the first \n     several Congresses, from 1789 to 1806, a majority of Senators \n     always had the power to bring debate to a close through \n     majority vote through the motion for the previous question \n     under Senate Rule IX.\n\n  I realize we are getting down into the weeds quite a bit when it \ncomes to parsing Senate rules and the history of the Senate for the \nAmerican people who might be listening to this debate, but in the end, \nI believe what we are talking about is the ability in this body to \nwrite its own rules and establish its own procedures, which is clearly \nprovided for in the Constitution, and to use procedures that have been \nused on the other side of the aisle when they were deemed appropriate \nand when a majority of Senators supported that change.\n  We are also talking about restoring fundamental fairness to the \njudicial selection and nomination process. Is there anybody in America \ntoday who believes that the way we are handling the confirmation of \njudges is a good and positive thing? Or do the vast majority of \nAmericans believe, as I do, that it has become unnecessarily \ncontentious and fractious and divisive, and that we need a fresh start \nwhen it comes to this process?\n  I believe a good place to start would be to restore this 200-year \ntradition, which provides for a majority vote, something that was \naccepted without any real debate until 4 short years ago when the \nstandard was somehow increased to 60 votes for confirmation rather than \nthe 51 votes which had applied for the entire history of the Senate--4 \nshort years ago.\n  Finally, it is worthy of note that in addition to the constitutional \nsupport I have mentioned, and that of legal scholars and established \nSenate precedent and tradition, many of the editorial writers in the \nmainstream media also acknowledge that the Byrd option is not a radical \noption, that the Senate making its own rules and procedures is not \nradical, it is what we do.\n  The New York Times even, by its own admission, in 1995, endorsed a \nproposal by Senators Harkin and Lieberman that\n\n       . . . would have gone even further than the nuclear option \n     in eliminating the [power of the] filibuster . . .\n\n  entirely, including for legislative matters.\n  We do not propose that. We just propose giving these nominees an up-\nor-down vote when it comes to the Executive Calendar.\n  The Austin American-Statesman, in Texas, has recently editorialized \nthat:\n\n       a simple majority could change the rule on cloture from a \n     supermajority to 51 votes . . . [and] it has always been a \n     viable political tool.\n\n  All we are suggesting.\n  The Philadelphia Inquirer said:\n\n       There is nothing especially sacred about the filibuster.\n\n  The Los Angeles Times states:\n\n       We urge Republican leaders to press ahead.\n\n  They wrote that in an editorial entitled ``Nuke the Filibuster.''\n  Let me conclude by reiterating what I said at the beginning of my \nremarks. I would prefer the bipartisan option to the Byrd option any \nday. America works better, the Senate works better when we do things \ntogether in a bipartisan and collaborative way. It is time for us to \nfix the broken judicial confirmation process. It is time for us to end \nthe blame game, fix the problem, and to move on. It is time to end the \nwasteful and unnecessary delay in the process of selecting judges that \nhurts our justice system and harms all Americans.\n  It is simply intolerable that a partisan minority will not allow a \nbipartisan majority to conduct the Nation's business. It is intolerable \nthat the standards now change depending on\n\n[[Page S5560]]\n\nwho is in the White House and which party is the majority party in the \nSenate. It is intolerable this nominee, this fine and decent human \nbeing and this outstanding judge, has waited 4 years for a simple up-\nor-down vote.\n\n  We need a fair process for selecting fair judges after full \ninvestigation, full questioning, full debate, and then a vote.\n  Throughout our Nation's more than 200-year history, the \nconstitutional role and the Senate tradition for confirming judges has \nbeen majority vote. That tradition must be restored.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the Senate holds a revered place in the \nhistory of the world and in the imagination of people throughout the \nworld. We proudly serve in the world's greatest deliberative body. We \nsay that so often that those words can lose their impact, but we must \nnever lose sight of our profound responsibility to this institution as \nkeepers of its legacy.\n  The enduring strength and beauty of the U.S. Senate is that we not \nonly operate by rules, but that those rules provide protections for the \nminority. More than 200 years of Senate rulings have affirmed that this \nbody stands against the ``tyranny of the majority'' that our Founding \nFathers cautioned us about.\n  Today, for temporary political advantage, some would destroy part of \nwhat makes the Senate unique. The so-called ``nuclear option'', if \nimplemented, will deface this Senate monument by allowing a majority, \nfor the first time in our history, to operate by fiat instead of by \nrule.\n  The issue we are grappling with is a transcendent one, above and \nbeyond the qualifications of a particular judge. We will answer the \nquestion: will the rule governing our deliberations be changed by fiat, \nby an arbitrary ruling which runs head on against Senate Rule XXII. \nThat rule guarantees Senators' right to speak until 60 Senators vote to \nend debate and is also at the core of our being a deliberative body.\n  The leadership of the majority party in the Senate has threatened to \nuse an extraordinary and radical parliamentary procedure, the so-called \n``nuclear option'', to end filibusters in the Senate. Interpreting a \nrule which is ambiguous or silent on a matter is one thing. The \n``nuclear option'' requires a presiding officer to rule in a way which \ngoes directly against the unambiguous language of Rule XXII.\n  Whether or not to change the rules is a matter for debate and \ndeliberation, but there should be no question of how to change the \nrules. That should occur through the procedures laid out in the Senate \nrules themselves.\n  Robert Caro, the distinguished historian and author of the landmark \nwork, Master of the Senate, recently wrote a letter to the Chairman and \nranking member of the Senate Rules Committee in which he pointed out \nthat:\n\n       The Founders, in their wisdom . . . gave the Senate the \n     power to establish for itself the rules governing exercise of \n     its powers. Unlike the unwieldy House, which had to adopt \n     rules that inhibited debate, the Senate became the true \n     deliberative body that the Framers had envisioned by \n     maintaining the ability of its members to debate as long as \n     necessary to reach a just result.\n\n  Caro continued:\n\n       For more than a century, the Senate required unanimous \n     consent to close off debate. The adoption of Rule XXII in \n     1917 allowed a two-thirds cloture vote on ``measures'', but \n     nominations were not brought under the rule until 1949. In \n     short, two centuries of history rebut any suggestion that \n     either the language or the intent of the Constitution \n     prohibits or counsels against the use of extended debate to \n     resist presidential authority. To the contrary, the nation's \n     Founders depended on the Senate's members to stand up to a \n     popular and powerful president.\n\n  The right of extended debate in the Senate is an integral part of our \nsystem of checks and balances and an important historic protection of \nthe rights of the minority in our country. But it is not only the \nfilibuster rule and the valuable protections it provides which the \n``nuclear option'' is threatening. It is the Senate's rulemaking \nprocess and it's the very character of the Senate.\n  Whether to change Rule XXII has been debated throughout our history \nand that debate will continue. But, how to change our rules is a \ntotally different matter. The ground rules for doing so, the process \nfor changing the rules, should be defended by us all because that \nprocess is laid out in the Senate rules.\n  Under the so-called ``nuclear option,'' the Presiding Officer of the \nSenate would arbitrarily end debate. The ruling would be challenged and \na simple majority would then be urged to uphold the ruling of the \nchair. In ruling by fiat, instead of by applying Senate Rule XXII for \nending debate, the Presiding Officer would have to ignore the advice of \nthe non-partisan Senate parliamentarian and the Senate's 200 years of \nprecedent.\n  If Senators want to propose a change in the rules of the Senate, the \nright way to do so is to follow the procedures in the Senate's rules \nfor changing the Senate's rules, not ripping up the rule book for a \nmomentary advantage.\n  In previous attempts to change the filibuster rule by breaking the \nrules, the Senate has refused to do so. The Senate has consistently \nmaintained that changes to Rule XXII governing the right to extended \ndebate must be made in accordance with the Senate rules and cannot be \ndone by decree, by a ruling of the Presiding Officer which needs only \nto be sustained by a simple majority.\n  In 1949, Vice President Alben Barkley, contrary to Senate precedent \nand against the advice of the Senate Parliamentarian, ruled that \ndespite the fact that Rule XXII as it then existed provided only that \nthe ``pending matter'' was subject to cloture, that it also applied to \na motion to proceed to the consideration of the bill.\n  The Senate rejected Vice President Barkley's ruling by a 46-41 vote. \nSignificantly, 23 Democratic Senators, nearly half of the Democrats \nvoting, opposed the ruling by the Vice President of their own party. \nLater, the Senate, using the process provided by the Senate rules, by a \nvote of 63-23, adopted a change in Rule XXII to include a motion to \nproceed.\n  Vote after vote, decade after decade, the Senate has maintained that \nchanges to the cloture rule must be done in accordance with the \nexisting Senate rules and cannot be done by fiat of the Presiding \nOfficer which needs but a simple majority to be sustained. The history \nis dry and difficult, but is essential for our understanding of the \ntenacious way this body has rejected attempts to change the filibuster \nrule by circumventing the rules. I am setting that history forth in an \naddendum to these remarks.\n  The majority leader says that he won't use the ``nuclear option'' \nexcept on filibusters of judicial nominations. But, why wouldn't a \nfuture majority leader, in pursuit presumably of some lofty purpose, \nnot use a similar arbitrary procedure, the fiat of the Presiding \nOfficer, sustained by a simple majority, to further limit and perhaps \neliminate the filibuster or alter other Senate rules for that matter. \nAs a Detroit Free Press editorial asked, `` . . . [W]here does such \nsituational rule changing stop?''\n  Any future majority could use the ``nuclear option'' to change any of \nthe Senate's rules, if the ``nuclear option'' we are debating is \npursued and succeeds. The Senate, almost inevitably, would slide toward \nbecoming a second House of Representatives. That body is tightly \ncontrolled by its majority through its Rules Committee which severely \nlimits debate and dictates what amendments can and cannot be offered. \nThe character of the Senate would be destroyed as a uniquely \ndeliberative body as would its role as the defender of rights of the \nminority and its essential role in the system of checks and balances. \nExpediency can destroy the uniqueness of this body.\n  The majority leader has said, ``At the end of the day, one will be \nleft standing: either the Constitution . . . or the filibuster.'' \nHopefully, both will be left standing. The only way for that to happen \nis if the ``nuclear option'' is rejected and we say ``no'' to changing \nthe rules of this body by fiat. Again, the majority leader maintains \nthat he has no intention of eliminating filibusters except on judicial \nnominations. But, if one accepts the position that the filibuster is \nunconstitutional for a judicial nomination, why is it not equally \nunconstitutional for all nominations? And, if the advise and consent \nclause is read to mandate an up-or-down vote, a future majority leader \ncould by decree decide that the enumerated legislative\n\n[[Page S5561]]\n\npowers in Article I also mandate majority up-or-down votes and, for \ninstance, rule out of order supermajority, 60-vote budget points of \norder.\n  But, with all due respect to the leader, no rule of the Senate should \nbe dependent for its enforcement on the whims and promises of a \nmajority leader, any majority leader. To leave the fundamental rules of \nthe Senate vulnerable to a change of mind by this majority leader or \nthe whim of a future majority leader undermines the principles of \nnormal procedure and fairness on which we all rely. A rule must bind \nthe Majority Leader and the majority itself. That principle is the \nbedrock on which the rule of law rests. Playing by the rules is \nsomething we all learned as kids in the schools and on the playgrounds \nof America. Rule XXII is a rule we must live by unless and until it is \namended by the procedures in our rules. The ``nuclear option'' would \nchange Rule XXII by decree of the Presiding Officer. An exception to \nRule XXII's requirement for sixty votes to end debate on a matter would \nbe created by arbitrary ruling--by decree.\n  Arthur Vandenberg, one of my predecessors from Michigan is one of the \ngiants of Senate history. His portrait was recently added to the Senate \nReception Room outside of this chamber where he joined six other greats \nof the Senate. Senator Vandenberg, a Republican leader in the Senate, \naddressed the Senate in 1949 prior to the Senate's rejection of Vice \nPresident Barkley's effort to change the cloture rule. His comments \nspeak directly to the situation we find ourselves in and I want to \nshare some of his remarks today.\n  Senator Vandenberg said,\n\n        . . . I continue to believe that the rules of the Senate \n     are as important to equity and order in the Senate as is the \n     Constitution to the life of the Republic, and that those \n     rules should never be changed except by the Senate itself, in \n     the direct fashion prescribed by the rules themselves. One of \n     the immutable truths in Washington's Farewell Address, which \n     cannot be altered even by changing events in a changing \n     world, is the following sentence: `The Constitution which at \n     any time exists, until changed by an explicit and authentic \n     act of the whole people, is sacredly obligatory upon all'. I \n     respectfully submit,'' Senator Vandenberg said, ``as a basic \n     explanation of my attitude, that I accept this admonition \n     without reservation, and I think it is equally applicable to \n     the situation which Senators here confront, though obviously \n     the comparison cannot be literal. . . . [T]he Father of his \n     Country said to us, by analogy, `The rules of the Senate \n     which at any time exist, until changed by an explicit and \n     authentic act of the whole Senate, are sacredly obligatory \n     upon all.'\n\n                     Senator Vandenberg continued:\n\n       I have heard it erroneously argued in the cloakrooms that \n     since the Senate rules themselves authorize a change in the \n     rules through due legislative process by a majority vote, it \n     is within the spirit of the rules when we reach the same net \n     result by a majority vote of the Senate upholding a \n     parliamentary ruling of the Vice President which, in effect, \n     changes the rules. This would appear to be some sort of \n     doctrine of amendment by proxy. It is argued that the Senate \n     itself makes the change in both instances by majority vote; \n     and it is asked, What is the difference? Of course, this is \n     really an argument that the end justifies the means.\n\n  Senator Vandenberg continued:\n\n       I think there is a great and fundamental difference, Mr. \n     President. When a substantive change is made in the rules by \n     sustaining a ruling of the Presiding Officer of the Senate--\n     and that is what I contend is being undertaken here--it does \n     not mean that the rules are permanently changed. It simply \n     means that regardless of precedent or traditional practice, \n     the rules, hereafter, mean whatever the Presiding Officer of \n     the Senate, plus a simple majority of Senators voting at the \n     time, want the rules to mean. We fit the rules to the \n     occasion, instead of fitting the occasion to the rules. \n     Therefore, in the final analysis, under such circumstances, \n     there are no rules except the transient, unregulated wishes \n     of a majority of whatever quorum is temporarily in control of \n     the Senate. That, Mr. President, is not my idea of the \n     greatest deliberative body in the world. . . . No matter how \n     important [the pending issue's] immediate incidence may seem \n     to many today, the integrity of the Senate's rules is our \n     paramount concern, today, tomorrow, and so long as this great \n     institution lives.\n\n  Senator Vandenberg continued:\n\n        . . . [I] want to be sure that none of my colleagues shall \n     feel under the slightest compunction to vote on a friendship \n     or loyalty basis so far as I am concerned. This is a solemn \n     decision--reaching far beyond the immediate consequence--and \n     it involves just one consideration.\n\n  He concluded, with that ``one consideration'':\n\n       What do the present Senate rules mean; and for the sake of \n     law and order, shall they be protected in that meaning until \n     changed by the Senate itself in the fashion required by the \n     rules?\n\n  In summarizing, he got to what is the root of the nuclear option. He \ndid it almost 60 years ago on a similar occasion, but how prescient are \nhis comments relative to the situation in which we find ourselves \ntoday. Senator Vandenberg:\n\n        . . . [T]he rules of the Senate as they exist at any given \n     time and as they are clinched by precedents should not be \n     changed substantively by the interpretive action of the \n     Senate's Presiding Officer, even with the transient sanction \n     of an equally transient Senate majority. The rules can be \n     safely changed only by the direct and conscious action of the \n     Senate itself, acting in the fashion prescribed by the rules. \n     Otherwise, no rule in the Senate is worth the paper it is \n     written on, and this so-called ``greatest deliberative body \n     in the world'' is at the mercy of every change in \n     parliamentary authority.\n\n  How I wish every Senator would read Senator Vandenberg's speech \nbefore we vote on the nuclear option.\n  In a recent address on this subject, former Senator and Vice \nPresident Al Gore recalled the words of Sir Thomas More, the famous \nBritish jurist and author:\n\n       When More's zealous son-in-law proposed that he would cut \n     down any law in England that served as an obstacle to his hot \n     pursuit of the devil, More replied: ``And when the last law \n     was cut down and the devil turned round on you, where would \n     you hide . . . the laws all being flat? This country is \n     planted thick with laws, from coast to coast . . . and if you \n     cut them down, and you're just the man to do it, do you \n     really think you could stand upright in the winds that would \n     blow then?''\n\n  Vice President Gore observed:\n\n       The Senate leaders remind me of More's son-in-law. They are \n     now proposing to cut down a rule that has stood for more than \n     two centuries as a protection for unlimited debate. It has \n     been used for devilish purposes on occasion in American \n     history, but far more frequently, it has been used to protect \n     the right of a minority to make its case.\n\n  Our former colleagues Senators Malcolm Wallop of Wyoming and Jim \nMcClure of Idaho, both conservative Republicans, recently wrote in the \nWall Street Journal:\n\n     . . . [I]t is naive to think that what is done to the \n     judicial filibuster will not later be done to its legislative \n     counterpart . . . [E]ven if a Senator were that naive, he or \n     she should take a broader look at Senate procedure. The very \n     reasons being given for allowing a 51-vote majority to shut \n     off debate on judges apply equally well--in fact, they apply \n     more aptly--to the rest of the executive calendar, of which \n     judicial nominations are only one part. That includes all \n     executive branch nominations, even military promotions. \n     Treaties, too, go on the executive calendar, and the \n     arguments in favor of a 51-vote cloture on judicial \n     nominations apply to those diplomatic agreements as well. It \n     is little comfort that treaty ratification requires a two-\n     thirds vote. Without the possibility of a filibuster, a \n     future majority leader could bring up objectionable \n     international commitments with only an hour or two for \n     debate, hardly enough time for opponents to inform the public \n     and rally the citizenry against ratification.\n  Former Majority Leader George Mitchell, writing in the New York \nTimes, has recalled the words of Senator Margaret Chase Smith, another \nof the great Senators sent to us from the State of Maine, in her famous \n``Declaration of Conscience'' on June 1, 1950, speaking out against the \nexcesses of Senator Joe McCarthy, a Member of her own party:\n\n       I don't believe the American people will uphold any \n     political party that puts political exploitation above \n     national interest. Surely we Republicans aren't that \n     desperate for victory . . . While it might be a fleeting \n     victory for the Republican Party, it would be a more lasting \n     defeat for the American people. Surely it would ultimately be \n     suicide for the Republican Party and the two-party system \n     that has protected our American liberties from the \n     dictatorship of a one-party system.\n\n  As Senator Mitchell writes:\n\n       The circumstances are obviously different; there is no \n     McCarthyism in the current dispute. But the principles of \n     exercising independent judgment and preserving our system of \n     checks and balances are at the heart of the Senate rules \n     debate. Senator Smith embodied independence and understood \n     the Senate's singular place in our system of checks and \n     balances. Our founders created that system to prevent abuse \n     of power and to protect our rights and freedoms. The \n     president's veto power is a check on Congress. The Senate's \n     power to confirm or reject judicial nominees balances the \n     president's authority to nominate them. The proposal by some \n     Republican senators to change rules that have governed the \n     Senate for two centuries now puts that system in danger.\n\n  Mr. President, the nuclear option--this extra-legal changing of the \nSenate\n\n[[Page S5562]]\n\nrules--will cause a permanent tear in the Senate fabric because it \nviolates a deeply held American value: playing by the rules. Our rules \nthemselves provide the process for changing the rules. Using it in an \narbitrary way--the Presiding Officer ruling by fiat--will produce a \ndeeply embittered and divided Senate because it tears at the heart of \nthe way we operate as a Senate. The Presiding Officer is supposed to be \nan impartial umpire, not a dictator. He is supposed to apply the rules, \nnot rewrite them.\n  This Senate is an enduring monument of political history. Its \nuniqueness is perhaps most embodied in rule XXII, which is at the heart \nof our being a deliberative body and the source of protection of the \nminority. I plead with our colleagues: Do not deface this Senate \nmonument by eliminating by fiat that right of the minority. Do not \ntrample on rights so essential to the institution's deliberative \nnature. Do not deface this Senate monument by amending the rules by \nfiat. Instead, seek to change our rules, if you deem it wise, according \nto the procedures set out in our rules. But do not take this fateful, \nunprecedented, and misguided step that is being proposed.\n  Few are privileged to serve in this special place. Let those who \nfollow us here look back at what we will do in the fateful days which \nlie ahead and say that the institution they aspired to was preserved \nand protected by its present custodians.\n  The Constitution, in article I, section 5, states that ``Each House \nmay determine the rules of its proceedings . . .'' The rules of the \nU.S. Senate have protected minority rights and the system of checks and \nbalances through the right of senators to extended debate. Senate rule \nXXII provides that 60 votes are required to end debate in the Senate \nand to bring a matter to a vote. It makes no distinction as to whether \nthat matter is legislative, the ratification of a treaty or the \nconfirmation of a nomination. Throughout the Senate's history, our \nrules, including rule XXII, have served not only to protect the \nminority, but also to encourage the majority and the minority to work \nout their differences. That is because to do anything of great \nsignificance in the Senate, it is necessary to put together 60 votes \nforces the majority to deal with at least a part of the minority. As \nmuch as any other factor, this has been a bulwark against the most \ncorrosive forms of partisanship.\n  With respect to nominations, the need to gain the support of at least \n60 Senators has historically encouraged presidents of both parties to \nseek the advice of Senators from both parties, and to select judicial \nnominees who are in the mainstream and who can attract the support of \nMembers of both parties. That is particularly important because Federal \njudges have a profound impact on the functioning of our Nation, not \nonly because they have lifetime appointments, but--because they are the \nfinal arbiters of the constitutionality of our laws.\n  During the administration of President Bush, the Senate has, as in \nthe past, been carrying out its constitutional responsibility. Since \nthe start of the current administration, the Senate has confirmed more \nthan 200 of President Bush's judicial nominees. Only 10 of the \nPresident's nominees have not been confirmed. That is an approval rate \nof more than 95 percent. This is a better confirmation rate than was \nachieved during the Clinton, the senior Bush, and the Reagan \nadministrations. This also stands in stark contrast to what happened \nduring the Clinton administration when more than 60 of President \nClinton's judicial nominees were blocked by the Republican majority in \nthe Judiciary Committee from even getting a hearing, much less a \nconfirmation vote.\n  Some of our Republican colleagues like to assert that filibusters \naimed at nominations are unprecedented. They are clearly wrong. Their \nassertions usually contain carefully crafted hedge words. For example, \nthey refer to ``nominations reaching the Senate floor'' being entitled \nto an up or down vote. Some of our Republican colleagues refer to ``the \nSenate tradition of giving nominees an up-or-down vote''. Well, what \nabout those more than 60 Clinton judicial nominations, who were bottled \nup for years in the Republican controlled Judiciary Committee without \nbeing given even a hearing? Blocking nominees in the committee by \nrefusing to give them a hearing is, in effect, filibustering the \nnomination. When former Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Jesse \nHelms was opposed to the former President George H.W. Bush's nominee to \nbe U.S. Ambassador to Mexico, William Weld, a former Republican \nGovernor, was an up-or-down vote permitted? No, Senator Helms refused \nto hold a vote in the Foreign Relations Committee and in that way \neventually defeated the nomination. There are many such examples.\n  And what about the so-called holds that Senators use to delay and as \na result deny nominees an up-or-down vote? Just recently, one of our \nMembers placed a hold--an implied threat to filibuster a nomination--\nblocking an up-or-down vote on President Bush's nominee to head the \nBase Closing Commission. The President had to get around that hold by \ngiving his nominee a recess appointment, which doesn't require Senate \naction.\n  One of the statements that is used to support the nuclear option is \nthat there has never been a successful filibuster of a judicial \nnominee. That statement flies in the face of the history of the \nfilibuster of the nomination of Abe Fortas to be Chief Justice of the \nSupreme Court in June of 1968. Republican opponents of the filibuster \nat that time argued that the Senate has the obligation to be more than \na mere rubberstamp for the President. Further, they argued that because \nFederal judges are lifetime positions, it is even more important to \nprotect the guarantee of the minority's right to speak at length in the \nSenate on judicial nominations than on legislative matters.\n  Another Michigan Republican, Senator Robert Griffin, who was the \nRepublican whip, was a leader of the Fortas filibuster. He said at the \ntime:\n\n       Whatever one's view may be concerning the practical effect \n     of Senate rules with respect to the enactment of legislation, \n     there are strong reasons for commending them in the case of a \n     nomination to the Supreme Court.\n\n  Senator Griffin argued that:\n\n       If ever there is a time when all Senators should be \n     extremely reluctant to shut off debate, it is when the Senate \n     debates a Supreme Court nomination. If Congress makes a \n     mistake in the enactment of legislation, it can always return \n     to the subject matter and correct the error at a later date. \n     But when a lifetime appointment to the Supreme Court is \n     confirmed by the Senate, the nominee is not answerable \n     thereafter to the Senate or to the people, and an error \n     cannot be easily remedied . . .\n  After 5 days of extended debate on the Fortas nomination, there was a \nvote on a cloture motion to end the debate. While a majority did \nsupport Fortas, by a vote of 45 to 43, there was not the supermajority \nneeded to end debate. An up-or-down vote was prevented by the \nsuccessful filibuster, and the nomination was subsequently withdrawn.\n  So the statement that there has never been ``a successful'' \nfilibuster of a judicial nominee is wrong. But, it is also too clever \nby half for another reason. There have been many times that Senators \nhave tried to defeat presidential judicial nominees by filibuster, but \nfailed. The fact that they weren't successful in stopping the \nconfirmation isn't relevant. They succeeded in requiring 60 votes to \nend debate. Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer was filibustered when \nhe was nominated for a vacancy on the circuit court by President Carter \nin 1980. Cloture was invoked by a 68 to 20 vote. Twenty-four Republican \nSenators voted against cloture, in other words, to continue a \nfilibuster, including some of our present colleagues.\n  In 2000, the opponents of the nominations of both Marsha Berzon and \nRichard Paez, nominated to the circuit court by President Clinton, \nrequired cloture votes requiring 60 votes to end debate. Cloture was \ninvoked on the Berzon nomination, 86 to 13, and on the Paez nomination, \n85 to 14. A number of current Members of the Senate majority voted \nagainst cloture and voted to deny them an up-or-down vote.\n  Even the current majority leader, who proposes the nuclear option to \neliminate filibusters on judicial nominations now that a GOP President \nis in the White House, voted against cloture; he voted to require 60 \nvotes for the Clinton nominee Richard Paez. Many Senators who tried to \ndefeat nominees\n\n[[Page S5563]]\n\nby forcing supermajority votes with Clinton judicial nominees, now want \nto take away by fiat the right of other Senators, under our rules, to \nexercise that same advise and consent power.\n  Mr. President, we must be ever mindful of our responsibility to \nprotect the unique role of this institution. I urge my colleagues to \nreject the reckless course of the nuclear option. I hope that every one \nof my colleagues will take the time to read the speech of Senator \nVandenberg on the floor of this Senate, facing a very similar situation \nto the one we face, where there was intended to be, and in that case \nwas, a ruling--a ruling--a fiat of the Presiding Officer which would \nhave changed the rules of the Senate.\n  It is even more clear here than it was then that it is a change in \nthe rules which is involved. Back then, one could have argued that it \nwas only an interpretation of the then-existing rule XXII which was at \nissue. The majority of the Senate rejected that because, to the \nmajority, it was quite clearly a change in the rules.\n  Senator Vandenberg and others carried the day with their eloquence \nabout the meaning of this body and its need to live by the rules and to \nchange the rules according to the procedures set forth in the rules. \nThat wisdom is surely as relevant today as it was back then.\n  I hope all of us will consider the consequences of changing the rules \nby fiat, by a ruling of the Chair, not guided by the Parliamentarian, \nwho is an objective umpire, not following the precedent of this body, \nwhich has faced similar efforts before to change the rules by decree of \na Presiding Officer, and which has rejected that course over and over \nagain. If we will take our own history and the meaning of this body \ninto consideration, and to take it to heart, I believe we will do as \nprevious Senates have done, which is to reject an arbitrary approach to \nadoption or modification of the rules that guide us.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that an addendum to my \nstatement be printed in the Record.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                Addendum\n\n       In 1953, Senator Clinton Anderson raised a point of order \n     that, under the Constitution, the Senate should be free to \n     adopt its rules at the beginning of a Congress and, until \n     that happened, the Senate would be governed by general \n     parliamentary rules which would allow a simple majority to \n     end debate and adopt new rules. The Senate rejected this \n     effort by a vote of 71-21 at the urging of Majority Leader \n     Robert Taft and Minority Leader Lyndon Johnson. Taft argued \n     that the Senate is a continuing body and that the rules \n     carried over from one Congress to the next. The Senate's \n     rules could be amended at anytime during the Congress but had \n     to be done in accordance with existing Senate Rules which \n     require a supermajority vote to end debate on the rule \n     change.\n       In 1957, led by then-Majority Leader Lyndon Johnson and \n     Minority Leader Robert Taft, the Senate, by a 55-38 vote, \n     again rejected a similar attempt by Senator Clinton Anderson.\n       In 1963, Senator Anderson made an attempt to circumvent \n     Rule XXII by a simple majority. He moved to proceed to a \n     resolution, at the beginning of the Congress, to lower the \n     number required for cloture and sought a ruling from Vice \n     President Lyndon Johnson that, under the Constitution, only a \n     simple majority would be needed to end debate at the \n     beginning of a Congress. The Vice President submitted the \n     constitutional question to the Senate, ``Does the majority of \n     the Senate have a right under the Constitution to terminate \n     debate at the beginning of a session and proceed to an \n     immediate vote on a rule change notwithstanding the \n     provisions of the existing Senate rules?'' The Senate \n     tabled the constitutional point of order by a vote of 53-\n     42, again affirming the Senate position that changes to \n     the rules must be considered under the procedures set out \n     by the existing Senate rules.\n       In 1967, Senator George McGovern moved to proceed to a \n     resolution to amend the cloture rule. Senator McGovern used a \n     compound, self-executing motion which, if adopted, would have \n     automatically cut off debate and required the chair to put \n     the question on the motion to proceed to a majority vote. The \n     motion was out of order on its face and was akin to an \n     unanimous consent agreement in the Senate which would \n     prescribe consideration of a measure, but instead of \n     requiring the consent of all Senators, only a simple majority \n     vote was required. Senator Everett Dirksen made a point of \n     order against the motion and Vice President Hubert Humphrey \n     submitted the constitutional question to the Senate which \n     sustained the Dirksen point of order, thus rejecting the \n     McGovern motion by a vote of 59-37.\n       In 1969, Senator Frank Church moved to proceed to a similar \n     proposal to reduce the number required to invoke cloture and \n     filed cloture on the motion to proceed. Senator Church then \n     inquired of the Chair, ``If a majority of the Senators \n     present and voting, but less than two-thirds, vote in favor \n     of this motion for cloture, will the motion have been agreed \n     to?'' Vice President Hubert Humphrey responded in the \n     affirmative. The vote for cloture was 51-47, far short of the \n     two-thirds then required under the rules. The Chair announced \n     that the Senate would now proceed under cloture based on a \n     simple majority vote. The decision was immediately \n     appealed and the Senate overturned the decision of the \n     Chair by voting against a motion to sustain the ruling of \n     the chair, 45-53. Among the 53 Senators rejecting the Vice \n     President's ruling were 23 Democrats, members of his own \n     party.\n       Floyd Riddick, the Parliamentarian Emeritus, who served as \n     the Senate's Parliamentarian from 1964 through 1974, \n     describes the events of that day: ``Vice President Humphrey . \n     . . announced the vote and arbitrarily announced that the \n     motion to invoke cloture was agreed to, just as he had \n     advised he would do in response to a parliamentary inquiry. \n     Senator [Spessard] Holland took an appeal from the ruling of \n     the Chair and the decision of the Chair was reversed. I might \n     say I had advised the vice president that he would never get \n     away with such an announcement . . . I think he felt \n     politically obligated to do that at this stage of the game. \n     The Chair was just not sustained.''\n       Mr. Riddick, a most authoritative source on the Senate \n     Rules and author of ``Riddick's Procedure'', the volume all \n     Senators consult frequently on the Senate's precedents and \n     practices, added: ``I certainly would not ever question the \n     motives of a vice president. . . . When he raised the \n     question with me if there would be a chance of ruling that a \n     majority vote was sufficient, I said: ``Absolutely no, Mr. \n     President, Rule 22 says it takes two-thirds, and until the \n     rule is amended to allow it I don't see how you could rule \n     that way.''\n       In 1975, Senators Walter Mondale and James Pearson \n     introduced a resolution to allow cloture with a three-fifths \n     vote of those present and voting. Senator Mondale made \n     several motions over the next several days to proceed to the \n     consideration of the resolution. Similar to 1967, a compound \n     and self-executing motion that would automatically cut off \n     debate on the motion to proceed and require the Chair to \n     put the question if adopted by a simple majority was used. \n     Majority Leader Mike Mansfield raised a point of order \n     against the motion and Vice President Nelson Rockefeller \n     submitted the point of order to the Senate for debate as a \n     constitutional question. While on three separate votes the \n     point of order against the motion to proceed to the \n     resolution was tabled, the Senate never ultimately adopted \n     the motion or ended debate by simple majority vote. The \n     Senate reversed this precedent almost immediately and \n     voted to reconsider the last vote on the motion to table \n     the point of order by a vote of 53-38. When the question \n     recurred on the motion to table the point of order, the \n     Senate voted 40-51 and the motion to table failed--\n     constituting an affirmation by the Senate of the point of \n     order that the Mondale motion violated the Senate's rules.\n       Later, to eliminate any doubt, the Senate sustained the \n     Mansfield point of order by a vote of 53-43 and went on to \n     consider and ultimately invoke cloture by a vote of 73-21. \n     The Senate then amended Rule XXII under the existing Senate \n     rules.\n       Some claim that precedents for the ``nuclear option'' were \n     established during Senator Byrd's tenure as Majority Leader. \n     Our distinguished colleague from West Virginia is this body's \n     foremost expert on the Senate's rules. He has, himself, \n     addressed the inaccuracy of that assertions: ``Simply put, no \n     action of mine ever denied a minority of the Senate a right \n     to full debate on the final disposition of a measure or \n     matter pending before the Senate. Not in 1977, not in 1979, \n     not in 1980, or in 1987--the dates cited by critics as \n     grounds for the nuclear option.\n       The Congressional Research Service confirms that only six \n     amendments have been adopted since the cloture rule was \n     enacted in 1917, and `each of these changes was made within \n     the framework of the existing or entrenched rules of the \n     Senate, including Rule XXII.' ''\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank the Chair.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, today the Senate Chamber has the feel of \na Hollywood stage set. The Senate clock, centered above the Vice \nPresident's chair, is in a countdown second by second to the appointed \nhour and minute when a nuclear explosion may render the Senate \ninoperative, or at least do substantial damage to this institution. We \ncannot expect Jimmy Stewart to stride across the center floor to save \nthe day, as he did in ``Mr. Smith Goes to Washington.'' It is up to us, \nthe Members of this body, to save the day. It is up to us to save the \nSenate. It is up to us to do the job America sent us here to do.\n\n[[Page S5564]]\n\n  If 100 Members of the Senate, with the same values and common \nbackgrounds, experienced in elected politics, cannot cross the aisle to \ncompromise, what hope is there for the deep-seated disagreements and \nhatreds in Iraq, Darfur, Laos, the Congo, Ivory Coast, and all around \nthe world?\n  Today I am renewing my suggestion that the leaders, Senator Frist and \nSenator Reid, liberate their caucuses to vote without party \nstraitjackets. From extensive discussions I have had with Members on \nboth sides of the aisle, I remain convinced that most Democrats would \nreject the obstructive tactics of the unprecedented pattern of \nfilibusters, and most Republicans would reject the constitutional or \nnuclear option to change the Senate rules.\n  This controversy did not arise because Democrats concluded that \nMiguel Estrada and nine other of President Bush's circuit court \nnominees were so unqualified that they should be filibustered. Rather, \nthese systematic filibusters were initiated as payback for Republican \ntreatment of President Clinton's nominees. These filibusters are a \nculmination of a power struggle between Republicans and Democrats as to \nwhich party could control the judicial selection process through \npartisan maneuvering.\n  To reach a compromise, the first step is for both parties to concede \npublicly that both parties are at fault. As debate has raged on the \nSenate floor for days and really weeks, there has been very little \nwillingness on the part of Senators to acknowledge that the actions of \ntheir own party are at fault. I believe that is indispensable if we are \nto reach a compromise, to start off with the proposition that the \ndivision of fault is 50/50.\n  The pattern of delay arose during the last 2 years of President \nReagan's tenure, after the Democrats had gained control of the Senate \nand the Judiciary Committee in the 1986 election. President Reagan's \ncircuit court nominees were delayed and denied, with some seven denied \nhearings, and two additional nominees were denied floor votes. The \npattern of delay and denial continued through 4 years of President \nGeorge H.W. Bush's administration. President Bush's lower court \nnominees waited an average of 100 days to be confirmed, which was about \ntwice as long as had historically been the case.\n  The Democrats also denied hearings for more nominees. For President \nReagan, the number was 30; for Bush senior, the number jumped to 258. \nWhen we Republicans won the 1994 election and gained the Senate \nmajority, we exacerbated the pattern of delays and blocking nominees. \nOver the course of President Clinton's Presidency, the average number \nof days for the Senate to confirm judicial nominees increased even \nfurther to 192 days for district courts and 262 days for circuit \ncourts. Through blue slips and holds, 60 of President Clinton's \nnominees were blocked, and blocked in key circuits. So it was no \nsurprise when the Democrats were searching for a way to return the \nfavor and to keep vacancies in the same circuit courts because of what \nthey concluded was inappropriate treatment.\n  When the Democrats initiated the unprecedented move of a pattern of \nfilibusters--and it is true, there had been filibusters in the past, \nbut never a pattern, never a systematic effort, as has been evidenced \nrecently--President Bush responded similarly in an unprecedented move \nby interim appointments. It had never happened in the history of the \nRepublic that the Senate, even by filibuster, would be greeted by an \ninterim appointment by the President. That impasse was broken when \nPresident Bush agreed to refrain from further recess appointments.\n  Against this background of bitter and angry recriminations, with each \nparty serially trumping the other party to get even or, really, to \ndominate, it is obvious that the issue does not involve the \nqualifications of the nominees. In the exchange of offers and \ncounteroffers between Senator Frist and Senator Reid, Democrats have \nmade an offer to avoid a vote on the constitutional or nuclear option \nby confirming one or perhaps two of the filibustered judges, Priscilla \nOwen, Janice Rogers Brown, William Pryor, and William Myers, with the \nchoice to be selected by Republicans. An offer to confirm any one of \nthese four nominees is an explicit concession that each is qualified \nfor the court and that they are being held hostage as pawns in a \nconvoluted chess game which has spiraled out of control. If the \nDemocrats believe that each is unqualified, a deal for confirmation of \nany one of them is repugnant to the basic democratic principle of \nindividual, fair, and equitable treatment. And more importantly, it \nviolates Senators' oaths on the constitutional confirmation process. If \nthese nominees, any one of them or two of them, are unqualified, what \nis the justification for Senators to confirm them under a deal? Such \ndealmaking confirms public cynicism about what goes on behind \nWashington's closed doors.\n  Instead, my suggestion is that the Senate consider each of the four \nwithout the constraints of voting. Let the leaders release their \ncaucuses from the straitjacket of voting and even encourage Members to \nvote their consciences on issues of great national importance. It \nshould not be a matter of heresy for someone in this Chamber to suggest \nthat Senators exercise their own individual judgment and follow their \nconsciences as opposed to voting. But the regrettable fact of life is \nthe dominant force and the dominant power in this Chamber is voting. \nWhen you come to a matter of a change of the Senate rules materially \naffecting the rights of the minority, there should be no question that \nthe party line ought not to be the determinant.\n\n  In a press conference on March 10, 2005, Senator Reid referred to the \nnuclear option and said:\n\n       If it does come to a vote, I ask Senator Frist to allow his \n     Republican colleagues to follow their conscience. Senator \n     Specter recently said that senators should be bound by Senate \n     loyalty rather than party loyalty on a question of this \n     magnitude.\n\n  Senator Reid concluded that he agreed. Well, that is some progress. \nBut Senator Reid did not make any reference to my urging him to have \nthe Democrats reject the party-line straitjacket voting on \nfilibustering.\n  The fact is that the harm to the Republic by confirming all of the \npending circuit court nominees is, at worst, infinitesimal compared to \nthe harm to the Senate that would occur whichever way the vote would \nturn out on the constitutional or nuclear option. None of these circuit \njudges could make new law, because all are bound, and each one has \nagreed on the record, to follow U.S. Supreme Court decisions.\n  While it is frequently argued that circuit court opinions are in many \ncases final because the Supreme Court grants certiorari in so few \ncases, circuit courts, as we all know, sit in panels of three. Since at \nleast one other circuit judge on the panel must concur, no one of the \nnominees can unilaterally render an egregious decision. If a situation \ndoes arise where a panel of three circuit judges makes an egregious \ndecision, it is subject to correction by the court en banc of the \ncircuit. And then there is also the opportunity for review by the \nSupreme Court if it is really outlandish or egregious.\n  What is the overhang of this Chamber is the imminence of a Supreme \nCourt nominee. I have heard one of the distinguished senior Senators \nfrom the other side of the aisle say: Confirm them all. Eliminate the \nfilibuster on all of them, because the real issue is what is going to \nhappen with the confirmation of a Supreme Court nominee. And if the \nfilibuster were to continue on a Supreme Court nominee, given the many \n5-4 Court decisions, we know we would then have 4-4 decisions so that \nthe circuit opinion would stand; there would be no determination on \nvery many tremendously important questions; and the Supreme Court of \nthe United States would be rendered dysfunctional.\n  As we are debating this issue, there has been a move among a number \nof Senators to find six Democrats who would forsake the filibuster, \nexcept in what has been categorized as ``extraordinary circumstances,'' \nif six Republicans would vow to vote against the constitutional or \nnuclear option.\n  I have attended some of those meetings. The attendance has shifted \nwith many Senators, more than 12, participating. I do not know how \nmany. It is not exactly the old style floating crap game, but it is a \nmoving dialog. There are moving discussions. There are moving targets, \nand there are moving Senators.\n\n[[Page S5565]]\n\n  On Tuesday afternoon, when a group of us met downstairs in the first \nfloor off the Senate Chamber, one of the Democrats said: Suppose we \ntake the floor and add Judge Saad of Michigan, and suppose you take two \nand give us three, or suppose we take three and give you two. It seemed \nto me that the latter suggestion of taking three to confirm, rejecting \ntwo, would be a sound proposition. I cannot subscribe to the idea that \na group of 12, however they may ultimately be constituted, ought to \nmake the decision on who is to be confirmed and who ought not to be \nconfirmed. It is my view that ultimately that is a decision for this \nbody.\n  To achieve that end in a principled way, I have urged the majority \nleader, Senator Frist, to do a whip count among Republicans. If anybody \nis watching on C-SPAN 2, by way of brief explanation, a whip count is \nwhen there is a tabulation by talking to each of the Republican \nSenators, and the same process may occur on the Democratic side to \ndiscern how those Senators are going to vote.\n  It is a common practice. If the whip count were to be conducted, we \nmight know in advance what the result would be, and if the result would \nbe that two or more of the filibustered judges would be rejected, then \nthe Democrats would have won their point.\n  So much of what we are engaged in today is a matter of saving face. \nThis whole controversy has been escalated so far that neither side is \nprepared to back down. Neither side is willing to back down. In the \nwings, we have all of these press conferences on the Senate steps. We \nhave various groups meeting. We have the commercials on the air--\nperhaps started with Gregory Peck in 1987 on the Judge Bork nomination, \ncontinuing until the past weekend, and continuing to this day. It is \nhard to turn on the television set without finding a commercial. Last \nweek, my State of Pennsylvania was inundated with commercials demanding \nthat Senator Arlen Specter vote to ``save the Republic.'' Nobody is \nquite sure what it means to ``save the Republic,'' the way the debate \nis going on.\n  These commercials are, in my opinion, counterproductive, certainly \nnot effective, and realistically viewed, insulting. If we take the play \nfrom the groups, the play from the press conferences, the play from all \nof the opinion makers out there--the newspaper writers and \neditorialists, and the so-called groups--one group is shouting to the \nDemocrats: Filibuster forever, filibuster forever. The other side is \nshouting to the Republicans: Pull the trigger, pull the trigger. So \nwhat if it is a nuclear detonation, as long as our side wins.\n  What I think needs to be done is the issue ought to be returned to \nthe Senate. It ought to be returned to the 100 Members of this body. \nAnd if the leaders do not liberate their Members to pass their \nindividual consciences on these issues in the context of a whip check \nto get an idea of what will happen, then a small group of Senators will \ntake control of the Senate; a small group of Senators will have struck \na deal; a small group of Senators will pledge, with sufficient numbers, \nnot to carry on the filibuster; and a sufficient group of Senators on \nthe other side will have a sufficient number of votes not to implement \nthe constitutional or nuclear option.\n  What we need to do is return this decision-making power to this body. \nOne idea I advanced many years ago with S. Res. 146, joined by Senator \nByrd, was a resolution to establish an advisory role for the Senate in \nthe selection of Supreme Court justices. The thrust of this resolution \nwas that it would be useful to create a pool of recognized candidates \nof superior quality for consideration by the President. The pool would \nbe considered by consulting with the chief judges of the various State \nsupreme courts, bar associations, professors, circuit courts of appeal, \nand chief judges from across the country. This sort of body would be \navailable to the President.\n  It is my judgment not to reintroduce that Senate resolution at this \ntime because, in the current context--the current incendiary context--\nof the prospect of the nomination or nominations which may be upon us \nany day now, it is my conclusion that this would not be an appropriate \ntime to promote the idea, but that it ought to wait until the time when \nheads are cooler and the country is not so badly divided on this issue, \nand when the Senate is not so badly divided on this issue.\n  It is my personal view that the option of a filibuster for \nextraordinary, egregious circumstances ought to be retained, but not in \nthe context of the way it has been used in the immediate past, as a \npattern of delay that is directed at getting even or getting back.\n  When it comes to this issue of extraordinary circumstances, it seems \nto me each Senator individually would have to make a determination as \nto what he or she thought constitutes extraordinary circumstances. I \nhave engaged in legal research on the subject. There is no way, in my \nopinion, to delineate it, to write it down so there will not be some \narea of disagreement. But just as Senators must make an individual \ndetermination of what constitutes extraordinary circumstances to resort \nto the filibuster--hopefully, in very rare cases--so must those who \nmake a pledge not to invoke the constitutional or nuclear option have \nthe understanding that an individual's determination as to whether the \nextraordinary circumstance exception applies is being exercised in good \nfaith.\n  Good faith is something we ought to talk about a little more in this \nChamber. It is the brother to following our individual consciences. If \nwe do that, we have the sensibility and the background and the \nintelligence and the experience to make the appropriate decisions. I \nhave spoken twice before on this subject, as the Congressional Record \nshows--once on April 21, and again on May 9--in a real effort to try to \npromote some ideas that will lead to a resolution and a compromise. As \nwe approach--it is 4 days away--a Tuesday cloture vote on Priscilla \nOwen, the countdown is narrow. The Presiding Officer sits in the Vice \nPresident's chair by designation, and the clock above him ticks. It has \nthe feel of a Hollywood stage. We are set for a countdown, where second \nby second, the hours and minutes go by as we come to the critical \nvotes, the first of which will be the cloture vote on Texas Supreme \nCourt Justice Priscilla Owen. And what may follow, when the count \nreaches zero, when the roll is called--if it is to be called--is a vote \non the constitutional or nuclear option. It is still my hope we will \navoid that vote.\n  Either way the vote comes out, it will be harmful to the Senate. If \nthe option is rejected, it will embolden the Democrats, as well as \nwhichever may be the minority party at any time in the future. It will \nembolden the minority party to recklessly use the filibuster, as I \nthink it has been used in the 108th Congress. It may embolden the \nminority party further to filibuster nominees like John Bolton, whose \nnomination for U.N. ambassador is very much in doubt. If the option is \npassed, it will embolden the appointers into having greater latitude on \nthe nominees who may be submitted.\n\n  When you deal with the doctrine of separation of powers, there is a \nwell-established principle that to have a little play in the joints is \na good thing, where it is uncertain as to how a vote will turn out. And \nI think at this reading, it remains uncertain how a vote on the \nconstitutional or nuclear option will turn out. There is a greater \nchance for compromise.\n  In an earlier floor statement, I analogized our controversy here to \nthe controversy between the United States and the Union of Soviet \nSocialist Republics in the Cold War. I have seen some of my colleagues \npick up on that analogy. If there is any certainty in our troubled \nworld--if the United States and the Soviet Union could avoid a nuclear \nconfrontation on mutually assured destruction--so should the Senate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Vermont is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I would like to take a few minutes today \nto caution the majority from pursuing what is referred to as the \n``nuclear option'' in an effort to change Senate rules and forbid \nunlimited debate on judicial nominations.\n  Some of my colleagues say they are seeking this change because they \nwant judicial nominees to get a vote. This view is a shift for those \nwho denied more than 60 of President Clinton's judicial nominees a vote \neither in committee or in the full Senate.\n\n[[Page S5566]]\n\n  Unlike those nominees, President Bush's nominees have received votes \nby the full Senate. Those votes determined that these nominations \nshould not move forward.\n  Some in the majority did not like the outcome of those votes, and \nthat is why we are here today in what has been described as ``a \nhistoric moment'' in Senate history. But I fear that we are making \nhistory for all the wrong reasons.\n  I do not find it the least bit alarming that we are challenging a \nhandful of judicial nominees while at the same time we have approved \nmore than 200 of the President's choices.\n  These judges will be appointed for life, and it is our job--no, our \nresponsibility--to ensure that these judges are worthy of the role. \nDespite what some would have the public believe, the system is working \njust as it is supposed to work.\n  Perhaps if this administration had consulted the Senate on these \nnominees, rather than show such determination to test our will, we \nwould not be in the unfortunate position we are in.\n  But instead of heeding the warning signs, this administration plowed \nrecklessly ahead.\n  A success rate of over 95 percent apparently wasn't good enough, so \nthe administration resubmitted the names of its most controversial \npicks.\n  I believe that a 95 percent success rate is a record this Senate \nshould be proud of. Unfortunately, some in the majority don't share my \nview.\n  The right in the Senate to unlimited debate is an important part of \nour system of checks and balances. It ensures that a bipartisan \nconsensus is reached by more than a bare minimum majority of Senators \nwhen we are faced with critical issues.\n  There are those in the majority who believe, contrary to the U.S. \nConstitution, Senate rules, and Senate precedent, that all judicial \nnominees must have an up-or-down vote on the floor of the Senate.\n  Nothing in the Constitution, nothing in the Senate rules, and nothing \nin the way the Senate has functioned in the past supports that belief.\n  In fact, my colleagues in the majority have themselves required 60 \nvotes in order to pass judicial nominees.\n  Back in 2000, during consideration of the nominations of Richard Paez \nand Marsha Berzon to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, 60 votes were \nrequired in order to reach a final vote on these two Clinton nominees.\n  During the debate on these nominations, then-Senator Bob Smith of New \nHampshire made a very important point concerning the need for unlimited \ndebate on judicial nominations.\n  He said:\n\n       I think it is fair that judges who are appointed forever, \n     who will be making decisions long after we are out of here, \n     probably when our children are coming into voting age, or our \n     grandchildren, whatever the case may be . . . we have a \n     responsibility to look very carefully at them.\n\n  As I prepare to become a grandfather for the first time any day now, \nI am struck by these remarks.\n  Some of the judicial nominees we approve today may be interpreting \nlaws and deciding constitutional questions when my grandson graduates \nfrom high school, when he votes for the first time, and perhaps even \nwhen he starts his own family.\n  It seems logical, given this scenario, that we require some lifetime \nappointments to receive more than the support of a bare majority of \nSenators.\n  I am also concerned that if the nuclear option is invoked and \nunlimited debate on judicial nominations is forbidden, this precedent \nwill eventually be extended to other nominations and legislation.\n  I fear the ultimate goal of some of those pursuing this nuclear \noption will be to extend the filibuster prohibition beyond judicial \nnominees. We will then have two bodies that are purely run by a \nmajority and not protective of the rights of the minority.\n  It is nice to hear the majority leader say that he has no intention \nof extending this precedent.\n  However, it rings a little hollow to me when we all know that come \nJanuary 2007, there will be a new majority leader in the Senate. This \nindividual, Republican or Democrat, will not be bound by the promises \nmade by the current majority leader.\n  This week, the editorial pages of a local Vermont newspaper noted the \nirony of the timing of this debate. That editorial, printed in the \nTimes Argus of Barre, VT, said:\n\n       The majority in the United States Senate wants to remove \n     one of the important and traditional political tools--the \n     filibuster--that protects the rights of the minority party, \n     even as Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice goes to Baghdad \n     to urge the majority there to put aside its long-standing \n     grudges and guarantee minority rights.\n\n  So why is it that we are urging the fledging democracy in Iraq and in \nother nations around the world to respect minority rights, while some \nin the Senate want to trample those same rights and threaten the \nbalance of power that we hold so dear right here in our own democracy?\n  I am afraid I do not have the answer, but it concerns me beyond \nwords.\n  In my more than 30 years in Washington, I have always tried to decide \neach issue on its merits, rather than to provide a rubberstamp to \ncomply with the wishes of leadership.\n  I fear that we are here today because some in the majority would \nprefer that the Senate just act as a rubber stamp for the President's \ndesires.\n  I refuse to spend the last 19 months of my term in the Senate being a \nrubberstamp.\n  I will oppose changing the Senate rules for this purpose, and I hope \nmy colleagues will join me in protecting the rights of the minority by \nprotecting the right of unlimited debate in the Senate.\n  In concluding, I suggest that my colleagues listen to the words of \nCharles Mathias, a former Republican Senator from Maryland, who \nrecently wrote:\n\n       Make no mistake about it: If the Senate ever creates the \n     precedent that, at any time, its rules are what 51 senators \n     say they are--without debate--then the value of a senator's \n     voice, vote and views, and the clout of his state, will be \n     diminished.\n\n  I do not know of a single Senator who would desire this outcome, but \nI fear it could happen if this body agrees to change the Senate rules \nthat have served this chamber so well for so long.\n  This is truly a historic moment in Senate history.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me to maintain our system of checks \nand balances, keep the Senate the Senate, and protect each individual \nSenator's right to unlimited debate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, I commend the distinguished Senator from \nVermont whose independence and wisdom has been demonstrated in this \nbody in the time I have been here. Some of what I am about to say will \necho what he more eloquently said.\n  I spoke earlier this week about why the elimination of the filibuster \non judicial nominations would be ill advised as a matter of policy and \nwhy violating the existing Senate rule which governs how we can \nproperly change the Senate's rules of procedures should be unthinkable \nand would be unconscionable. It would set a terribly damaging precedent \nfor this great institution, damage that would be permanent and \nirreparable, a precedent that the existing rules and procedures of the \nSenate can at any time and for any reason or for no reason be \ndisregarded or changed or a new rule added by a majority vote of the \nSenators present at that time. Just make a motion to the Presiding \nOfficer, who could ignore the advice of the Senate's professional \nParliamentarian, make his or her own ruling, and a majority vote would \neither uphold or overturn that decision.\n  That essentially means the majority of this body at any time can do \nwhatever they want to do, however they want to do it, as long as they \nratify it by their own majority vote. None of the rules of procedure \nwould have any permanent standing or reliability, no matter how long \nthey have been in existence.\n  If the majority of Senators decides it does not like those rules of \nprocedure, or if they cannot get the results they want by following \nthem and they can just disregard them or change them any time and then \nvote themselves right by doing so, we have lost the integrity of this \ninstitution. What kind of society would we have if that precedent, \nreestablished here, became standard operating procedure by our fellow \ncitizens all over this land?\n  Another point I would like to raise, after listening for the last \ncouple days\n\n[[Page S5567]]\n\nto the stated reasons by the proponents of this so-called nuclear \noption, is that many of them say the U.S. Constitution's advice and \nconsent clause requires an up-or-down vote by the full Senate. I raise \nthis point respectfully and seriously because each of us, the day we \ntake office as a Senator, takes a sworn oath right here in the Senate \nChamber, right in front of our family, our friends, and the American \npeople, administered by the Vice President of the United States, with \nour hand on the Bible. And that oath says in part:\n\n       I will support and defend the Constitution of the United \n     States. . . .\n\n  It goes on to say:\n\n     . . . I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same.\n\n  And it ends with our saying:\n\n     . . . so help me God.\n\n  I know for myself that was the most serious and important oath I have \never taken, and I believe that every other Member of this Senate is as \nfully committed to upholding that oath as I am and is acting now and \nwants to continue to act in all good faith to uphold it at all times.\n  We sometimes have honest differences in our views of what particular \nwords in the Constitution mean and what they instruct us to do. Those \nhonest differences have arisen since this body commenced its work on \nMarch 4, 1789, sometimes between Members of the two parties, sometimes \nbetween Members of the same party, sometimes between Members of \ndifferent parts of the country, or those representing large States and \nsmall States, and for many other legitimate reasons.\n  In most of our actions and decisions in the Senate, our \ninterpretations of the words of the Constitution and our application of \nthose words individually and as a collective body will be reviewed and \ncan be tempered or even rejected by other public officials and \ninstitutions.\n  All the legislation we pass must be agreed to by the House, must be \nagreed to by the President or vetoed by him, and overridden with a two-\nthirds vote here and in the House. Then, if properly challenged by \nsomeone with legal standing, it can be further reviewed as to \nconstitutionality by Federal courts and, as the ultimate arbiter of \nconstitutionality, the U.S. Supreme Court.\n  So with all the legislation we act upon and most other matters that \ncome before us, our constitutional understandings, interpretations, and \napplications are subjected to a rigorous process of checks and \nbalances.\n  Those checks and balances, however, do not exist for Senate approval \nor disapproval of Presidential nominees because the Constitution \nclearly and explicitly authorizes the Senate and the House, each of \nthose bodies, to determine the rules of their proceedings. Previous \nFederal courts have ruled those words mean exactly what they clearly \nsay.\n  The Constitution then defines this proceeding we are engaged in now \nas ``the advice and consent of the Senate.'' That wording, its meaning, \nand its intent are unfortunately much less clear. The section of the \nConstitution says in its entirety the President ``shall nominate, and \nby and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate, shall appoint \nAmbassadors, other public Ministers and Consuls, Judges of the Supreme \nCourt, and all other Officers of the United States, whose Appointments \nare not herein otherwise provided for, and which shall be established \nby law; but the Congress may by Law vest the Appointment of such \ninferior Officers, as they think proper, in the President alone, in the \nCourts of Law, or in the Heads of Departments.''\n  That means almost everyone in the Federal Government is subject to \nthe advice and consent of the Senate unless Congress, by law, chooses \nto waive that requirement for specified ``inferior''--that is the \nConstitution's word, not mine--officers. That is why as members of the \nArmed Services Committee we regularly report to the full Senate rosters \nof ``appointments,'' most of which are promotions, of 2,000, 3,000, \nover 4,000 officers in the U.S. Armed Forces. They must then be \napproved, and they usually are approved en bloc by the full Senate.\n  Proponents of the nuclear option are saying this clause of the \nConstitution, particularly the words ``advice and consent,'' requires \nthat every Presidential judicial nominee gets an up-or-down vote by the \nfull Senate. If that is the view of the majority of the Senate, how can \nit not also apply equally to every other nomination described in that \nsection of the Constitution?\n  The Constitution, the section I just read, makes no distinction in \ndefining our role and responsibility to advice and consent between \nPresidential nominees for executive branch or judicial offices. It \nmakes no distinction between term limited or lifetime appointments, and \nit gives us no authority to make those distinctions either, except that \nby law we cannot require the Senate to approve certain lower level \npositions.\n  As I understand the majority leader's intention for next week, just \nfrom published reports I have read, he will ask the Presiding Officer \nof the Senate to rule that the Constitution's words ``advice and \nconsent'' require an up-or-down vote by the full Senate--on all \nPresidential nominations covered by those words in the Constitution? \nNo, I think that is not the case. Only for judicial nominations. Would \nthat ruling, that constitutional requirement of an up-or-down vote by \nthe full Senate, apply then to all judicial nominations that come to \nthe Senate? No, not as I understand it; not to those that are blocked \nby the Judiciary Committee, not to those that are blocked by the \ncustom--it is not even a written rule or procedure in the Senate--that \ntwo Senators, sometimes only one Senator, in the majority, can prevent \nany vote by anyone, a committee or the full Senate, on a Presidential \nnominee.\n  Where, I ask my colleagues in favor of the nuclear option, who \ncontend the Constitution requires this up-or-down vote by the full \nSenate, where does the Constitution permit the Senate leadership or a \nSenate committee or one Senator to make those distinctions between one \njudicial nominee or another or between judicial nominees and other \nPresidential nominees in that same section of the Constitution?\n  I believe the ambiguity in the meaning of the term ``advice and \nconsent'' certainly provides us with reasonable latitude in defining \nwhat that term requires the Senate to do. It does not, however, permit \nus to apply one definition to one group of nominees and apply a \ndifferent definition, and therefore different Senate rules and \nprocedures, to the other nominees to which those same words equally \napply.\n  Every Senator here is entitled to his or her own views about \nfilibusters. Whether they are good or bad instruments of public policy, \nthey are properly debatable. They are entitled to their own views. We \nare each entitled, within far greater constraints, to our own best \nconscientious interpretation of the Constitution, especially words or \nclauses where well-informed and well-intentioned people can reasonably \ndiffer. We are not entitled, however--in fact we are forbidden--to \nrewrite, reinterpret, selectively apply, or ignore those words just \nbecause we do not like them or agree with them. We have sworn an oath \nto uphold, to support, and defend them, every one of them. If we \ndisagree with them, if we believe they are not right for our \nconstituents and our country, we have the right to change them. But, \naccording to the rules and the procedures in the Constitution, we do \nnot have the right to change them otherwise; just as we have the right \nto change Senate rules and procedures, but only by following the rules \nin the Senate to do so.\n  Following the rules, obeying the laws, upholding the Constitution--\nthose are the foundation of our country. At a time when we are \ndemonstrating to other parts of the world, other countries and \ncitizens, how to set up democracies and make them successful and make \nthem survive and thrive, we will make a tragic, terrible error if we \nviolate those founding, fundamental principles ourselves. The country \nand the world will be watching next week to see what we do.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cornyn). The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I do not come to the floor often to \nspeak, but today I do come out of a sense of duty and a real spirit of \npurpose, to express my strong opposition to changing the rules of \ndebate here in the Senate. As a pragmatic Democrat who has raised more \nthan a few eyebrows in my own party over the years for putting\n\n[[Page S5568]]\n\nprogress on critical issues ahead of loyalty to any political party or \nideology, I am alarmed frankly that we have reached a point in the \nSenate when confrontation is the choice over consensus, considering the \nhistory of the debate on this issue, and the consequences of what is \nbeing contemplated.\n  To understand the consequences of the debate in which we find \nourselves engaged today, I think it is so helpful to briefly review the \nbasic facts regarding the confirmation of judicial nominees in the \nSenate in recent years. Since President Bush took office in January of \n2001, the Senate has confirmed 208 of the lifetime judicial nominees he \nhas appointed, and the Senate has withheld consent from 10 of those \nnominees. In other words, the Senate has confirmed more than 95 percent \nof the judicial nominees put forward by President Bush since he took \noffice more than 4 years ago. As a result, there are only 45 judicial \nvacancies today, which represents the lowest judicial vacancy rate \nsince President Reagan was in office.\n  When you compare that to more than 60 judicial nominees who were \nblocked in the Judiciary Committee under the Republican control during \nPresident Clinton's term in office, I quite frankly think it is a \npretty good record of which the President should be proud and with \nwhich the Republican leadership should be pleased.\n\n  Put another way, when my 8-year-old twin boys come home from school \nwith a 95 percent on their report card or on their test, I don't stomp \nmy feet and send them to their room. I do not get angry with them and \ntell them to go back to school tomorrow and break those rules next time \nso you can get 100 percent on that test.\n  No, that is not what we do. That is not the example we set. That is \nnot what we ask of a body or individuals who are guided by rules. That \nwould be outrageous.\n  I would say to my children: Good job, keep up the good work. Work a \nlittle bit harder.\n  Am I suggesting Democrats of the Senate deserve a medal for \nfulfilling their constitutional role in considering and confirming \njudicial nominees through advice and consent? Of course I am not. But I \nalso do not think the record before us even comes close to justifying \nan attempt to undermine one of the fundamental principles of this \ninstitution--freedom of speech and of debate; making sure everyone's \nopinion does count--which protects the rights of every citizen in my \nState and in this entire Nation.\n  In my view, the proposal put forward by the Senate majority leader to \nlimit the ability of Senators to debate judicial nominees represents \nwhat will become a first step, if successful, in weakening the role of \nthe Senate and the role the Senate plays in our system of Government in \nproviding the kind of checks and balances against an overreach by the \nexecutive branch or the political parties or any other branch of \nGovernment which happens to be in the majority at any given time. And \nit can be either one of us.\n  I believe the protections and safeguards that are part of the fabric \nof our system of Government have served our Nation well and they are \ncritical, regardless of which political party controls the White House \nand the Congress.\n  Most importantly, I sincerely believe what is being proposed by the \nmajority could seriously threaten my ability as a Senator from the \ngreat State of Arkansas to effectively represent the needs of my \nconstituents. As I have listened to many of my colleagues debate this \nissue over the past several weeks, I have reflected on the role of the \nSenate as an institution and how and why it came into being. Coming \nfrom a small State such as Arkansas, which has only 6 voting delegates \nin Congress out of the entire 535, I do not take lightly the fact that \nthe compromise which gave birth to the Senate was based on the \nprinciple that all States, regardless of their size, and all Senators \nprivileged to serve in this body, are on equal footing. The Senate was \ndeliberately designed to protect the interests of small States such as \nmine and to provide a restraint on the ability of a temporary majority \non any issue before this body to prevail unchecked.\n  Recently, in order to get the attention of this administration, I had \nto use tools. I had to use some of those tools I have as a Senator, to \nsimply get an answer, a letter answered on international child \nabduction, on the way Southern producers in agriculture were being \ntreated in this budget. It was not an issue of me getting all of what I \nwanted. It was simply an issue of me getting an answer--me, a small \nState, someone representing a small State, being able to get an answer \non principle and on idea and purpose, from the administration. That is \nwhat we are talking about, everyone being represented.\n  The debate we are having and the issues at stake are much more \nimportant to me than my political party. With all due respect, they are \nalso more important than any individual nominee or judgeship. If we \nstart down this road, I fear where it will lead us. This week we are \ndebating the role of the Senate as an institution in the consideration \nand confirmation of judicial nominees. Next week or next year, will we \nbe debating a change of the rule or the Senate precedent during a \nconsideration of the President's plan to privatize Social Security or \nhis proposal to shortchange Southern farmers in a farm bill? Where will \nwe have that ability to speak out and make sure we are clearly heard?\n  I hope not, which is why I am standing up here today to defend the \npowers vested in me as a Senator from Arkansas, to represent my \nconstituency.\n  But if getting 100 percent--if that is why we are here, if that is \nwhat this debate is about and that is what the majority leader is \nlooking for--if getting 100 percent of what you want all the time is \nthe purpose here, when will we ever be content? When will the majority \never be content? And how can we say these things will not happen?\n  The majority leader stated that he believes filibusters against any \njudicial nominee are unwise and unreasonable. While I disagree with \nhim, I still respect his opinion and his right to debate that issue in \nthe Senate, or anywhere else, for that matter, at great length. What \ntroubles me, though, is his willingness to discard an institutional \npower regarding consideration of judicial nominees, even when, \naccording to reports, the Senate Parliamentarian believes the so-called \nnuclear option does not conform to the rules of the Senate. Let us all \ntake time and think about what nuclear fallout is like. Look at the \nphotographs of nuclear fallout. Look at what happens when nuclear \nreaction occurs. There is great devastation.\n\n  What happens if the rules of debate in the Senate in the future will \nbe viewed by the majority party that happens to be in charge at any \ngiven time as unwise or outdated and dispensable? I do not want to find \nout. This body is too precious. It does too much. It is too important \nto the balance that makes this Nation great.\n  It is my sincere hope and prayer that the Senate as an institution \ncan survive the current impasse intact, and I think we can. I am aware \nMembers on both sides of the aisle are considering a short-term \ncompromise which would, in a limited fashion, preserve the current \nrules of debate regarding judicial nominees for the remainder of this \nCongress.\n  I am hopeful a constructive solution which preserves the integrity of \nour system of checks and balances can be achieved. But I regret that \nthe current political environment has put the Senate in this position \nand has left us with so few options that we come today in sadness that \nwe have even come this far.\n  After having served now in the Senate for over 6 years and prior to \nthat in the House of Representatives for 4, I have enormous respect for \nthe role each Chamber plays in our system of Government. Based on that \nexperience, I am convinced that for the sake of the Senate as an \ninstitution and the vital role it plays now and will play into the \nfuture, long after everyone in this body is gone, I believe the way out \nof this standoff is for Members of both parties to work together to \ndefend the Senate, to defend our rules, to defend this great \ndeliberative body as an institution while also working to prevent \nshowdowns with the White House over judicial nominees from occurring in \nthe first place.\n  I met with Miss Owen. She is a nice woman. This is not to say that \nshe is\n\n[[Page S5569]]\n\nnot a nice person. We are here to say, when the opportunity comes, we \nneed a clear and substantial amount of this body to say this is the \nperson for this job. Her peers from her own party have labeled her a \njudicial activist. We are not here to say she is not a nice lady. We \nare here to say she is not the right person for the job. That should be \nthe opportunity we have in the Senate.\n  To come to those conclusions will require communicating and \ncooperating in good faith. It will also require trust, and most of all \nrespect--respect across the aisle and across Pennsylvania Avenue.\n  I am not probably one of the most typical of politicians or Members. \nI don't come from a big legal background or even a big political \nbackground. I am a farmer's daughter from east Arkansas. Right now, one \nof my biggest responsibilities along with serving in this great Senate \nis to be a good parent and to show my children what it means to be \ntruthful and respectful.\n  Last night, I was fortunate enough to sit on the sidelines and watch \na Little League game, a precious Little League game of players, who \nwere not the best but weren't the worst, playing their heart out. But \nthey still lost. And to see a coach who has made so much difference in \ntheir life and in their performance, to sit them down as he always does \nafter the game, making sure he points out all the positive things that \neach one of them has done, points out some of the things they could do \nbetter, but at the end he says to them: Let me tell you, in this game \nwe respect the rules, we respect the umpire, and we respect the other \nteam. And because we do, we are all the better for it.\n  Those of us in this body need to dig down deep in each of our souls \nand look for the respect, the respect for the other team, the respect \nfor the rules, for the game, the institution, and for the umpire.\n  We have an opportunity now to set an example for our children. There \nis a saying on my wall in the kitchen at my home. It says: When I'm \ndead and gone it's not going to matter what kind of car I drove. It's \nnot going to matter how big my house was. All of those things are \nprobably not going to matter, but the fact that I may have in some way \nmade an impact on the life of a child, my life will have mattered.\n  This body, this institution has an opportunity to set an example, not \njust to each of us together as Senators to show one another the trust \nand the respect this body engages us to do, but also the opportunity to \nshow this Nation and the world, and more importantly our children, that \nrules do matter and that you cannot just change the rules in the middle \nof the game because it does not suit you, and if you don't get 100 \npercent of what you want, that rules and the decision of the umpire \nmatters. Most importantly, respecting the other side and the other team \nin this game is ultimately what makes it worth playing.\n  I call on my colleagues today to step back and reflect on how the \nbalance of power in our government will change and how the Senate will \nbe weakened, perhaps for all time, if the proposal of the majority \nleader is adopted. I do think it is the wrong path and something \nMembers in both parties will come to regret in the years to come. \nAgain, my hope and my prayer is that we do not forget all of those that \nare watching, that we do not forget the rules of the game and how \nimportant they are, and most importantly I hope we do not forget what a \ncritical role respect plays in all of the games of life that we play.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, the issue before us is pretty simple. \nIt is this, shall we continue the two-century tradition of voting up or \ndown each President's judicial nominations? That is it. That is all we \nare talking about.\n  Making your way through all the histrionics--and there have been a \nlot of them on both sides--that is absolutely all we are talking about. \nShall we continue the two-century tradition of voting up or down, \neventually, on this President's or any President's judicial nominees?\n  The Democrats have decided they will use the Senate rules to prevent \nan up-and-down vote on some of President Bush's judicial nominees by \nusing this as a consistent tactic for the last 2 years to block a vote \non nominees a majority of us want to confirm. They are using the Senate \nrules in a way they have never before been used. They know that. \nEveryone knows that. There is no disputing that. They had a meeting. \nThey decided to do it. And they are doing it.\n  Now, they may have past grievances such as the practice used by both \nparties to allow a single Senator to block a nominee in a committee. I \nknow all about that grievance. In 1991, the first President Bush \nnominated me to be the U.S. Education Secretary. I was enthusiastic \nabout it. I had been the Governor of my State. I was President of the \nUniversity of Tennessee. I came up and sold my house, moved my family \nup, put my kids into school, and then one Senator from Ohio put a hold \non my nomination. So I sat there in the committee for about 3 months, \nnot even knowing who it was, or knowing what the problem was.\n  After a while, that Senator, who happened to be a Democrat--they were \nin the majority then--said in a public hearing with me: Governor \nAlexander, we have heard some disturbing things about you, but I don't \nwant to bring them up now, here, with the lights all around, and all \nthe people and your family here.\n  I said: Please, Senator, bring them all up. I would rather have them \nout here.\n  That went on for 3 months. I didn't know what to do, so I went to see \nSenator Warren Rudman who most people would say is one of the most \nrespected Members of this body over the last 30 years. I said: Senator \nRudman, what can I do? A Democrat Senator has, by himself, blocked my \npossibility to be the Education Secretary. I moved my family up here, I \nsold my house, my kids are in school, what do I do? He said: Keep your \nmouth shut.\n  I said: What do you mean, keep my mouth shut? This is unjust.\n  He said: Let me tell you a story. In 1976, President Ford nominated \nme to be on the Federal Communications Commission, and the Democrat \nSenator from New Hampshire put a hold on my nomination.\n  I said: What happened?\n  He said: Well, I just swung there. Nobody knew what was going on. \nPretty soon back in New Hampshire they were saying: What is wrong with \nWarren? Has he done something wrong? Did he beat his wife? Did he steal \nsomething? Why won't the Senate consider him and confirm him? After 4 \nor 5 months I was so embarrassed I just asked the President to withdraw \nmy nomination.\n  I said: Is that the end of it?\n  He said: No, then I ran against the so and so who put a block on me, \nand I was elected to the Senate in his place.\n  So that is how Warren Rudman got over being blocked.\n  Jeff Sessions, our distinguished colleague from Alabama, ran into a \nnearly similar situation. He was rejected by the committee. He was the \nU.S. attorney from Mobile, Alabama and the committee would not send his \nnomination to the floor. They held him up in the committee.\n  Senator Sessions got over that. He even got himself elected to the \nSenate. So Senator Rudman got over it, I got over it, Senator Sessions \ngot over it. I didn't like it, and I still don't like it. But I got \nover it.\n  There are various ways to get over whatever grievous injustices were \ndone to the Democrats before the distinguished Senator from Texas, who \nis presiding, and I were elected to the Senate in 2002.\n  Senator Frist, the majority leader, has repeatedly offered to fix the \nproblem I just described. He has said let all the nominees from a \nDemocrat President or Republican President, let them eventually all \ncome out of committee. He has said if there is not enough debate--and I \nrespect the idea of extended debate in the Senate--let there be 100 \nhours of debate on every single nominee. Then Senator Frist has said, \nlet there eventually be a vote, an up-or-down vote, as there has always \nbeen.\n  Now, it is not believable for my friends on the other side to \nsuggest, as they are, that they are doing nothing new. They know they \nare. I will give one example.\n  Everyone remembers the Senate debate about Clarence Thomas. Among \nother things, it made Dave Barry's career when he wrote columns about \nthe\n\n[[Page S5570]]\n\nSenate hearings. Everyone remembers those hearings. Everyone remembers \nhow passionate they were and how much information came out. There was a \nnew saga every day. No television drama approached it. There was never \nmore passion in recent times in a Supreme Court nomination than when \nthe first President Bush nominated Justice Clarence Thomas.\n  He was nominated in July of 1991 by President Bush. This Senate \ncompleted those hearings that were on television, that we all remember, \nand there was a vote in October of 1991, up or down. In that case, it \nwas up, he was confirmed 52 to 48.\n  I have yet to find one single person who even remembers anyone \nsuggesting 14 years ago that the Senate should not vote on Clarence \nThomas. Everyone knew that after all the histrionics, all the debates, \nthat the greatest deliberative body in the world would eventually vote.\n  So we are standing on the Senate floor conjuring up our own versions \nof history, inventing nuclear analogies, shouting at each other while \ngas prices go up and illegal immigrants run across our border. The \nDemocrats are using the rules to block the President's nomination in a \nway they have never used before in 200 years. So we Republicans are now \nthreatening to change the rules to prevent the Democrats from \nmanipulating the rules in a way that has never occurred before.\n  That is what this is all about.\n  I have a simple solution for the unnecessary pickle in which we find \nourselves in this body. I offered it 2 years ago. I have offered it \nseveral times this year. This is it. I have pledged and I still pledge \nto give up my right to filibuster any President's nominee for the \nappellate courts, including the Supreme Court of the United States. If \nfive more Republicans and six Democrats did that, there could be no \nfilibuster and there would be no need for a rules change.\n  For the past 2 weeks, perhaps two dozen different Senators have \nflirted with variations of this formula. But they have not been \nsuccessful because they have insisted on including exceptions. I hope \nthese Senators who are still having this discussion succeed. I expect \n80 percent of the Senate hopes they succeed. This oncoming train wreck \nis bad for the Senate, it is bad for the country, it is bad for the \nDemocrats, and it is bad for the Republicans.\n  We look pretty silly lecturing Iraq on how to set up a government \nwhen we cannot agree on having an up-or-down vote on President Bush's \njudicial nominees. My suggestion is forget the exceptions. Twelve of us \nshould just give up our right to filibuster, period. Let's do it. Let's \nget on with it. That ends the train wreck.\n  We have a war in Iraq. We have natural gas prices at $7--these are \nrecord levels. We have highways to build. We have deficits to get under \ncontrol. We have a health care system that needs transformation. We \nhave judicial vacancies to fill.\n\n  I have said I will never filibuster a President's judicial nominees. \nI said it 2 years ago when John Kerry might have been President. For \nme, that meant then--and it means today, and tomorrow--that if a \nPresident Kerry or a President Clinton nominates some liberal I do not \nlike, I may talk for a long time about it, I may vote against the \nperson, but I will insist that we eventually vote up or down, as the \nSenate has for two centuries.\n  If 11 colleagues would join me in this simple solution, then we could \nget down to business, then we might look once again like the world's \ngreatest deliberative body.\n  I say to the Presiding Officer, when you and I came to the Senate a \nlittle over 2 years ago, we talked about what our maiden addresses \nwould be. We still call our first major speech our ``maiden address.'' \nI say to the Presiding Officer, remember, we were sitting next to each \nother in the front row, anxiously looking forward to hearing ourselves \ngive our maiden addresses. I wanted to make mine about putting the \nteaching of American history and civics back in its rightful place in \nour schools so our children could grow up knowing what it means to be \nan American.\n  But as I sat here listening to the debate on Miguel Estrada, I was so \nsurprised and so disappointed in what I heard that I found myself \ngetting up one night and making a speech on Miguel Estrada, which I had \nno intention of doing.\n  During the debate, I was listening to this story of the American \ndream: This young man from Honduras coming here, speaking no English, \ngoing to Columbia, Harvard Law School, being in the Solicitor General's \nOffice. He is the kind of person who when the Presiding Officer and I \nwere in law school, and we would hear about people like that, we would \nsay there are just a handful of people that talented, that able. We \nwere envious, at least I was. He is exactly the kind of person who \nshould have been nominated. Yet we could not even get a vote.\n  I thought about my time as Governor, for 8 years, of Tennessee. I \nappointed about 50 judges, and I remember what I looked for when I made \nthose appointments. I looked for good character. I looked for good \nintelligence. I looked for good temperament. I looked for a good \nunderstanding of the law and for the duties of judges. And I especially \nlooked to see if this nominee had an aspect of courtesy toward those \nwho might come before him or her on the bench. I appointed some \nDemocrats. I appointed the first women appeals judges and the first \nAfrican-American judges in Tennessee. I thought it was unethical and \nunnecessary for me to ask questions of those judges about how they \nmight decide cases that might come before them.\n  I still feel the same way about the Federal judges we nominate. I am \ndistressed that we have turned this process into an election instead of \na confirmation. It has become an election about the political issues \ninstead of a confirmation about the character and intelligence and \ntemperament of fair-minded men and women who might be placed on the \nbench.\n  I remember when I came to this body for the first time, not as a \nSenator, but as a staff member to Howard Baker, later the majority \nleader. It was 1967. The ones worrying about protecting the minority's \nrights at that time were the Republicans. There were only 36 \nRepublicans. I came back in 1977 to help Senator Baker set up his \noffice when he was elected Republican leader, and there were only 38 \nRepublicans. So most of us in this body understand that we may be in \nthe minority one day. But that does not mean there should be an abuse \nof minority rights.\n  The best way I can think of to stay in the minority for any party, \nwhether the Democratic Party or Republican Party, is to say what the \nSenator from New York said in December, in the Washington Post. He said \nthat if the Republicans decide to change the rules to make sure the \nSenate continues the 200-year tradition of voting on the nominees the \nPresident sends to us, that it ``would make the Senate look like a \nbanana republic . . . and cause us to shut it down in every way.''\n  Mr. President, shut down the Senate in every way? During a war? \nDuring illegal immigration? During a time of deficit spending, with a \nhighway bill pending, with gas prices at record levels, with natural \ngas at $7? Shut the Senate down in every way?\n  I can promise you I know what the American people would think of \nthat. Any group they can fix the responsibility on for shutting this \nbody down and not doing its business will be in the minority or stay in \nthe minority. Even now, they are beginning to shut us down. We are not \nallowed to hold hearings in the afternoon because of objections by the \nother side. The American people need to know that. It is the wrong \nthing to do.\n  I had the privilege of hearing, yesterday, when I was presiding, a \nvery helpful speech by our leading historian in the Senate, Senator \nByrd. He talked about how extended debate has always been a part of the \nSenate's tradition. I know that is true. I value that. I respect that. \nAnd I do not want the Senate to become like the House. I know that \nGeorge Washington said, or is alleged to have said, that the Senate \nserves like the saucer for a cup of tea or a cup of coffee. The House \nheats it up, and you pour it in a saucer to cool it in the Senate. But \nI do not ever remember George Washington saying it ought to stay in the \nsaucer long enough to evaporate. I think he said just to cool it.\n  The Constitution and our Founding Fathers have made it very clear \nthat they always intended for Presidents' judicial nominees to be given \nan up-or-\n\n[[Page S5571]]\n\ndown vote. I have studied very carefully, and I will submit, in my full \nremarks to the Record, my understanding of those founding documents. \nThe language of article II, section 2, in the clause immediately before \nthe nominations clause, for example, specifically calls for two-thirds \nof the Senate to concur, but in the nominations clause there is no such \nprovision. I do not believe that is an inadvertent omission.\n  During the drafting of the Constitution, Roger Sherman of Connecticut \nargued at great length for the insertion of a comma instead of a \nsemicolon at one point to make a section on congressional powers \ncrystal clear.\n  Shortly after the Constitutional Convention, Justice Joseph Story, \nappointed to the Supreme Court by President James Madison, wrote his \nCommentaries on the Constitution, and he stated explicitly:\n\n       The president is to nominate, and thereby has the sole \n     power to select for office; but his nomination cannot confer \n     office, unless approved by a majority of the Senate.\n\n  This was Justice Joseph Story.\n  In some ways, what Members of the other side are doing would \ngradually erode the President's power to, in the words of our Founders, \nsend to us ``the object of his preference'' for us then to consider. I \ntrust the President, elected by a vote of the entire nation, to find \nthe right men and women to send up here to be considered for judge or \njustice and sent back to him then to be appointed. Our advice and \nconsent is in the middle of that process.\n  I suppose the Founders could have allowed the Congress to appoint the \njustices or the judges, but they did not. Gradually, however, the \nSenate has inserted itself more and more prominently in that process. I \nam not sure that the instances I know about suggest that if we were \ndoing it all over again, we would trust the Senate to do a better job \nthan our Presidents, Democratic or Republican, in picking the men and \nwomen to serve on our courts.\n  Here is an example from my own experience. Back in the 1960s, I was a \nlaw clerk to the Honorable John Minor Wisdom of the Fifth Circuit Court \nof Appeals in New Orleans. Actually, I wasn't a law clerk; I was a \nmessenger. He had already hired a Harvard law clerk, and he told me he \ncould only pay me as a messenger, but if I would come, he would treat \nme as a law clerk. So I did. The reason I did it was because even at \nthat time, 1965, Judge Wisdom was considered by my law professors at \nNew York University Law School to be the leading civil rights judge in \nAmerica and one of the finest appellate judges in America.\n  This is what I found when I got there. We were in the midst of school \ndesegregation across the South. It was a time of great turmoil. Judge \nWisdom, for example, ordered Mississippi to admit James Meredith to the \nUniversity of Mississippi. And what was going on during that time was \nthat the district judges across the South were basically upholding \nsegregation and the Fifth Circuit appellate judges were overruling them \nand desegregating the South.\n  At that time, the Senate was not as intrusive in the appointment of \njudges as it is today because the President, President Eisenhower, only \nhad to confer by custom with Senators of his own party in the \nappointment of circuit judges. Well, he didn't have any Republicans to \nconfer with in the 1960s. All of the Senators were Democrats. They \napproved district judges who, in case after case after case, upheld \nsegregation. But President Eisenhower nominated for the appellate bench \nRepublican judges, John Minor Wisdom, Elbert Tuttle for whom Senator \nBond of Missouri was law clerk, and John R. Brown of Texas. Those three \njudges, who would have been blocked, if the present policies of the \nSenate were in place, by Senators from their home States, were able to \npreside over the peaceful desegregation of the South.\n  I have seen no evidence in history that the Senate's increased \ninvolvement in the coappointment of appellate judges or justices \nimproves the selection of those judges.\n  These are qualified men and women the President has sent here who \ndeserve an up-or-down vote. I have mentioned Miguel Estrada. I have \nspoken about Charles Pickering, former judge, now retired, a graceful \nman who hasn't had a word of recrimination to say about what was done \nto him. He was battered for his record on civil rights when, in fact, \nhe should have been given a medal for his record on civil rights: For \ntestifying against the founder of the White Knights of the Ku Klux \nKlan, who had been called America's most violent living racist in the \nmiddle of the 1960s; for putting his children in public schools at a \ntime when many families in Mississippi were putting their children in \nsegregated schools. He was a leader in civil rights, as well as a good \njudge.\n  And Bill Pryor's credentials on civil rights have been questioned. He \nwas a law clerk, not a messenger, a law clerk to Judge John Minor \nWisdom, who had enormous pride in Bill Pryor, who was elected attorney \ngeneral of the State of Alabama and repeatedly has shown that he \nseparated his conservative personal views from interpreting the law. He \nwas going right down the line in following the Supreme Court in school \nprayer cases, abortion cases, and reapportionment cases.\n  And Priscilla Owen, about whom we have been talking, graduated cum \nlaude from Baylor Law School, justice of the Supreme Court of Texas, \nreelected to the Texas Supreme Court with 84 percent of the vote, has \nbipartisan support from other Texas Supreme Court justices. And Janice \nRogers Brown, 9 years on the California Supreme Court, appointed in \n1996, the first African-American woman to sit on the court, approved by \n76 percent of the voters.\n  Let me end my remarks where I began. Make your way through all the \ndiscussion, all of the analogies to nuclear war, and the issue before \nus is pretty simple--shall we continue the two-century tradition of \nvoting up or down on the President's judicial nominees? I believe we \nshould. I have suggested a way we can remove ourselves from this pickle \nin which we find ourselves.\n  I have said, as I did 2 years ago, regardless of who is President, I \nwill never vote to filibuster that President's judicial nominees. If \nfive other Republicans and six other Democrats would say the same \nthing, we could then get on about our business of confirming or \nrejecting the President's nominees, of tackling the big deficits, \npassing the highway bill, trying to lower gas prices, spreading freedom \naround the world, supporting our troops in Iraq and Afghanistan and \naround the world, and in reestablishing ourselves, in the eyes of \nAmerica and the rest of the world, as truly the world's greatest \ndeliberative body.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, are we now switching to this side of the \naisle for an hour?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are still 4 minutes remaining on the \nmajority side.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I would not take that from my friend from Tennessee. He \nhas that available to him.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I am glad to yield that 4 minutes to my \nfriend from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, so we will be back to the hour to hour--why \ndon't we go back into the hour-to-hour system.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today, we are continuing to debate the \nRepublican leader's bid for what I believe is one-party rule through \nhis insistence to trigger the nuclear option. It is kind of a ``king of \nthe hill'' situation. While playing king of the hill, you say ``might \nmakes right,'' but it doesn't; it makes wrong in this case. Through the \nmisguided efforts to undercut the checks and balances that the Senate \nprovides in our system of government, it is the need to protect the \nrights of the American people, the independence and fairness of the \nFederal courts and, of course, minority rights in the Senate.\n  Our time would be much better used if we were doing something about \nthe dramatic rise in the price of gasoline over the past 5 years, or \nthe enormous and unprecedented increase in the national debt during the \npast 5 years; or what has happened when we have seen the huge budget \nsurplus that former President Clinton left his successor, which has now \nturned into the largest\n\n[[Page S5572]]\n\nbudget deficit in the lifetime of anybody in this Chamber. These are \nthings that could help the American people.\n  Yesterday I urged that we get on with the business of the American \npeople. I spoke about a number of specific items of legislation, \nincluding the bipartisan NOPEC bill, S. 555, that sit idle. That bill \nwould provide the Justice Department with clearer tools to challenge \nthe cartel price-setting activity of OPEC and help to lower gas prices \nfor working Americans. I mentioned defense and law enforcement \nmeasures, as well. The Democratic leader, Senator Corzine and others \nmade similar points about important legislative priorities. Senator \nCarper and I talked about the effect this extended debate is having on \nthe bipartisan asbestos compensation bill. On Wednesday the Chairman \ncancelled a markup of the bill and on Thursday our markup was limited \nto two hours and many Senators were unavailable due to this floor \ndebate.\n  But instead of bringing us together to make progress, our friends on \nthe other side of the aisle insisted the Senate debate at length a \nnomination that has been debated over the last 3 years, after being \nvoted down by the Judiciary Committee 3 years ago. In fact, a couple of \nyears ago, the Republican majority staged a 40-hour talk-a-thon on \njudicial nominees. It was at the conclusion of that political exercise, \nthat 40-hour talk-a-thon, that we discovered the Republican staff had \nbeen stealing files from the Judiciary computer service for at least 3 \nyears.\n  That extended debate, staged by the majority, amounted to significant \nlost opportunities for progress on matters at that time including, \nironically, asbestos reform, which is something before us today. At \nthat time, we had approved a lot of judges. Through Senate Democratic \ncooperation we had approved 168 and turned down 4. In fact, during the \n17 months when I chaired the Judiciary Committee, we approved 100 of \nPresident Bush's nominees. That is actually a speed record. By the end \nof last year, at the end of President Bush's first term, we had already \nconfirmed 204 judges. We reduced judicial vacancies to the lowest level \nsince President Reagan. We are now at 208 confirmations. So we have \nconfirmed 208 and, depending upon whose count you go by, we have \nblocked 5 to 10. We have confirmed well over 95 percent, as a practical \nmatter.\n  I thank the Senators who joined in the debate yesterday for their \ncontributions: Senator Byrd, Senator Kennedy, Senator Kerry, Senator \nBaucus, Senator Bingaman, Senator Lautenberg, Senator Mikulski, Senator \nHarkin, Senator Carper, and Senator Nelson of Florida. They know, and \neverybody in this place knows that if you had a secret ballot on the \nnuclear option, it would fail miserably. The press knows it and \nSenators know it. We have all talked with Members on the Republican \nside who say: I don't want to vote for this thing. I know it is wrong. \nI started asking, What if there was a secret ballot? Well, of course, \nthat would go down. That is because Senators know it is wrong--wrong in \nterms of protecting the rights of the American people, wrong in terms \nof undercutting our Federal system of checks and balances, and it is \nwrong in protecting the minority rights in the Senate, saying we will \nhave a one-party rule system.\n  Well, one-party rule may work in some countries. It has never, ever \nworked in the United States of America. We can be thankful for that. We \nare the strongest democracy in the world because we have never let this \ncountry come to one-party rule. Democratic Senators will not be able to \nrescue the Senate and our system of checks and balances from the \nbreaking of the Senate rules that the Republican leader is planning to \ndemand. Democratic Senators cannot protect the rights by ourselves; we \ncannot protect the checks and balances by ourselves. If the rights of \nthe minority have to be preserved, if the checks and balances are to be \npreserved, if the Senate's unique role in our system of Government is \nto be preserved, it is going to take at least six republicans standing \nup for fairness and for checks and balances.\n  I know a number of Republican Senators realize this nuclear option is \nthe wrong way to go. I have to believe enough Republican Senators will \nput the Senate first, put the Constitution first and, most importantly, \nput the American people first and withstand momentary political \npressures when they cast their votes.\n  I have spoken to Senator Isakson about his comment earlier this year \nabout the effort to bring democracy to Iraq. I know he spoke about it \nyesterday. The Senator observed that a Kurdish leader in the middle of \nIraq said he had a ``secret weapon'' to instill democracy. When they \nasked what the ``secret weapon'' was, he said it was one word--\nfilibuster.\n  The Senator went on to observe:\n\n       If there were ever a reason for optimism about what this \n     supplemental provides the people of Iraq and their stability \n     and security, it is one of their minority leaders proudly \n     stating one of the pillars and principles of our Government \n     as the way they would ensure that the majority never overran \n     the minority.\n\n  He was right. We have that same pillar here. We have had a lot of \ndiscussion on the floor of the Senate. A couple weeks ago, we voted for \nbillions of dollars to improve law enforcement in Iraq; at the same \ntime, we voted for a budget to cut law enforcement in the United \nStates. We voted billions of dollars to improve infrastructure in Iraq; \nwe voted for a budget that cuts it in America. We voted for item after \nitem for Iraq, at the same time voting to cut similar items in America.\n  This is not a debate on the Iraq war, but if we are going to praise \nthe Iraqis--and I hope and pray that they will have a democracy someday \nin that country--and say the reason they can have democracy is that \nthey will have the filibuster and they can protect minority rights, \nmaybe it is time we say let's do as much for the United States as we do \nfor Iraq.\n  The Iraqi National Assembly was elected in January. In April, it \nacted, pursuant to its governing law, to select a presidency council by \nthe required two-thirds vote in the assembly, a supermajority.\n  More recently, Cabinet members for a number of political parties, and \nreligious and ethnic groups were announced, many in the minority \nparties. Use of the nuclear option in the Senate is akin to Iraqis in \nthe majority political party in the assembly saying they have decided \nto disregard the governing laws and pick only members of their own \nparty for the government and do so by a simple majority. They might \nfeel justified in acting contrary to law because the Kurds and Sunnis \nwere driving a hard bargain.\n  One thing we have learned through history is that if you govern \nthrough consensus, it is not as easy as ruling unilaterally. That is \nwhy dictators can rule unilaterally. But we have never been a \ndictatorship, thank God, in this country, and I believe we never will \nbe. That is why our system of government is the world's example because \nwe have always protected the views of all Americans, majority and \nminority, and we have done it in a way through a check and balance so \nboth sides can be heard. That way it requires consensus. More \ndifficult, yes, but then the democracy lasts, and that is the reward.\n  If Iraqi Shiite, Sunni, and Kurds can cooperate in their new \ngovernment to make democratic decisions, why can't Republicans and \nDemocrats in the Senate? After all, there are only 100 of us, and we \nare not shooting at each other--not literally, anyway. If the Iraqi law \nand assembly can protect minority rights and participation, so can our \nrules and the Senate. That has been the defining characteristic of the \nSenate and one of the principal ways in which it was designed from the \nbeginning of this country to be distinct from the other body.\n  Recently, the Senate passed, as I said, an emergency supplemental \nappropriations bill to fund the war efforts in Iraq and Afghanistan. \nThe justification for spending billions of dollars of American \ntaxpayers' money in Iraq is we are trying to establish democracies. How \nironic that at the same time we are undertaking these efforts--not just \nof money but of the lives of our wonderful men and women, a great cost \nto so many American families--the Republican majority in the Senate is \nseeking to undermine the protection of minority rights and checks and \nbalances. Our men and women are dying, and while our Treasury is \nspending the money to bring checks and balances in Iraq, we are getting \nrid of it here.\n\n[[Page S5573]]\n\n  Let me mention some of the recent statements of the President as he \ndiscussed democracy in other countries. When he came back, I praised \nhim. Earlier this month, he met with President Putin of Russia. At his \npress conference from Latvia, President Bush noted:\n\n       The promise of democracy is fulfilled by minority rights, \n     and equal justice under the rule of law, and an inclusive \n     society in which every person belongs.\n\n  President Bush was right when he said the promise of democracy \nrequires the protection of minority rights. It requires that in Latvia; \nall the more important, it requires it in the world's oldest existing \ndemocracy.\n  On that same recent, foreign trip the President correctly observed: \n``A true democracy is one that says minorities are important and that \nthe will of the majority can't trample the minority.'' That which is \nnecessary to constitute a true democracy in Eastern Europe is needed, \nas well, here in the cradle of democracy.\n  Again, earlier this year in another press conference with his good \nfriend, President Putin, the President correctly observed--and I \npraised him for this:\n\n       Democracies always reflect a country's customs and culture, \n     and I know that. But democracies have certain things in \n     common: They have a rule of law and protection of minorities, \n     a free press and a viable political opposition.\n\n  The President was right when he spoke in Eastern Europe, but that \nwhich is necessary to constitute a true democracy in Eastern Europe is \nneeded as well here in the cradle of democracy.\n  I agree with all of these observations. I commend the President, as I \nhave already. I hope all Senators will read them and agree we have to \nuphold the rule of law and the rules of the Senate that are designed to \nprotect the minorities as a viable political opposition. This country \nis never under one-party rule. This country always has checks and \nbalances of both parties.\n  Others besides the President have spoken. Let me tell you what \nSecretary Rice said recently while overseas. She said this in Georgia:\n\n       It is not easy to build a democracy . . . It means having a \n     strong legislative branch. It means having a strong \n     independent judiciary . . . along with freedom of speech, \n     freedom of worship and protection of minority rights, that's \n     how you build a democracy.\n\n  I told Secretary Rice that I agree with her, those are the components \nof a democracy. But we have the same components in the United States. \nWe need to maintain the Senate as a strong legislative branch to serve \nas a check on the Executive, no matter what party, Democratic or \nRepublican, controls the Executive. We need a strong independent \njudiciary--not a Republican judiciary, not a Democratic judiciary, an \nindependent judiciary--to serve as a check on the political branches. \nWe need to protect free speech and freedom of religion, and to maintain \nour democracy in the United States, we have to protect minority rights.\n  On her way to Moscow recently, the Secretary of State stated:\n\n       [T]he centralization of State power in the presidency at \n     the expense of countervailing institutions like the Duma or \n     an independent judiciary is clearly very wrong.\n\n  She was speaking about how developments undercut democracy in Russia. \nBut so, too, here in our great and wonderful country of America, \ndemocracy is undercut by the concentration of power in the Executive, \nremoving checks and balances and undermining the independence of our \njudiciary. It is ironic that President Bush and Secretary of State Rice \nspeak so eloquently--and I agree with what they have said--about the \nfundamental requirements of a democratic society when they meet with \nworld leaders outside the United States, but, unfortunately, the Bush \nadministration and the Senate Republicans are intent on employing this \nnuclear option to consolidate power in this Presidency in this country.\n  Senators ought to have enough faith in their own ability, Senators \nought to have enough understanding of their independence--and the fact \nthat each one of the 100 of us is elected independently--to be willing \nto stand up. We do not work for the President. We do not work for the \nVice President. We represent our country and our States, and we should \nbe independent.\n  They know, as all Americans know, democracy relies in the sharing of \npower, on checks and balances, and on an independent court system, one \nthat protects minority rights, and on safeguarding human rights and \nhuman dignity. This nuclear option is in direct contradiction to \nmaintain those values, those components of our democracy.\n  Just as Abu Ghraib and other abuses make it more difficult for our \ncountry to condemn torture and abuse when we speak to the rest of the \nworld, this nuclear option uses a partisan effort to consolidate power \nin a single political power and institution and will make all the \nlectures we give to leaders of other countries ring hollow.\n  I remember when the Soviet Union broke up and it became a democratic \ncountry. A group of Russian parliamentarians came to the United States \nand visited the House of Representatives and the Senate. Several came \nto see me, and they wanted to talk about our independent judiciary. \nFinally one of them said: I have this question. It has really been \nbothering me. I have heard that in the United States people sometimes \ngo into Federal court and sue the Government.\n  I said, Yes, it happens all the time.\n  He said, But we have also heard that sometimes the Government loses.\n  I said, That is right.\n  They said, Well, don't you fire the judge if he lets the Government \nlose?\n  I said, No, it is an independent Federal judiciary. They are \nindependent of the executive branch. They are independent of the \nSenate. They are independent of the House of Representatives. They make \nthose decisions.\n  This was such an eye opener to them. The rest of that afternoon, that \nis what we talked about.\n  They said, It really works, then?\n  I said, Yes, and if you have it work that way in Russia, you will be \na much safer country.\n  They still haven't gotten that far. Let's hope someday they do.\n  Chief Justice Rehnquist is right to refer to our independent \njudiciary as the crown jewel of our democracy. It is a dazzling, \nbrilliant, shining crown jewel. Judicial fairness and independence are \nalso essential if we want to maintain our freedom. We have to stop the \ndangerous and irresponsible rhetoric slamming the Federal judiciary. We \ndo not have to agree with every one of their opinions. I cannot believe \nthat any one of 100 Senators who has followed every single Federal \nopinion would agree with every single one of them. I might agree with \none, the distinguished Presiding Officer may disagree with the same \none, or vice versa. We do not have to agree with every opinion. But let \nus respect their independence. Let no one say things that might bring \nabout further threats against our judges as they endeavor to do their \njobs serving justice. Let us not stand up on the floor of our Congress \nand speak of impeaching judges if we disagree with them. Justice Sandra \nDay O'Connor was right to condemn such virulent talk.\n  Judge Joan Lefkow of Illinois testified before the Senate Judiciary \ncommittee this week. This is a woman whose husband and mother were \nmurdered by somebody who disagreed with her decisions. She sacrificed \ntoo much for us not to heed her words when she asked us to lower the \nrhetoric, lower the attacks on Federal judges. We 100, and the 435 in \nthe other body, of all people ought to know better. We ought to be \nprotecting them physically and institutionally. We should not take the \neasy rhetorical potshots that put judges in real danger when they \nattack the very independence of our Federal judiciary.\n  When the U.S. Supreme Court decided the Federal election in 2000, as \na lawyer, as a Senator, I thought the 5-to-4 majority engaged in an \nincredibly overreaching act of judicial activism to effectively decide \na Presidential election. But I went on the floor of the Senate and I \nwent before the press and I called for Americans to respect the opinion \nof the Court because it was the final word. I thought the word was \nwrong, but I believed as Americans we must respect it.\n  I attended the argument, during the arguments of Bush v. Gore, with \nmy Republican counterpart in the Senate Judiciary Committee in order to \nshow the country that we had to get along and work together. You didn't \nhear\n\n[[Page S5574]]\n\nDemocrats saying let's impeach Justice Scalia when we wholeheartedly \ndisagreed with his action.\n  Part of upholding the Constitution is upholding the independence of \nthe third branch of Government. One political party or the other is \ngoing to control the Presidency. One party or the other will control \nthe House of Representatives. One party or the other will control the \nSenate. But no political party--neither Democratic nor Republican--\nshould control the judiciary. It has to be independent of all political \nparties. That was the genius of the Founders of this country. It is the \ngenius that has protected our liberties and our rights for well over \n200 years. It is the genius of this country that will continue to \nprotect us unless we allow something to destroy it just for short-term \npolitical gain.\n  It would be a terrible diminution of our rights to remove the \nindependence of the Federal judiciary. It is a diminution of our rights \nno matter what party we belong to, no matter what part of the country \nwe are from. It would be a diminution of our rights that none of the \narmies that have marched against our country has ever been able to do. \nIf you take away the independence of our Federal judiciary, then our \nwhole constitutional fabric unravels.\n  That is what we Democrats are trying to protect. That is what we are \ndefending. The nuclear option is a threat to the protection of the \nminority, the independence of our judiciary, the protection of \nAmericans rights and our democracy. It removes checks and balances.\n  How can the most powerful Nation, the wealthiest Nation history has \never known, be able to maintain itself without the protection of checks \nand balances? How can we? And how can we represent to the rest of the \nworld we are the example they should follow? How can we tell other \ncountries, as they become democratic, this is what they should follow?\n  I know I will be speaking further. I see the distinguished Senator \nfrom North Dakota. I know he is seeking to speak. I will yield the \nfloor.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I think we are waiting for Senator \nLieberman who is to appear on the floor momentarily. I was going to \nseek to say a few words following Senator Lieberman, but I understand \nhe is on his way to the floor right now and I would prefer not to \nproceed without him, so I think we will put ourselves in a quorum for a \nmoment.\n  I make a point of order a quorum is not present.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise to speak on the so-called \nnuclear option which cloud hangs over the head of this Senate on this \nFriday afternoon.\n  The media, and sometimes Senators, speak of this debate, this \npossibility that the 60-vote majority requirement for confirmation of \njudicial nominations will be scrapped, as an internal struggle within \nthe Senate. It is that, of course. But it is not only that. In my \nopinion, certainly when one judges its effect, it is not primarily \nthat. This is about the judiciary, the judicial branch of our \nGovernment.\n  If you go back to the beginning of our Government, every student who \ntakes a civics course knows there are three branches of the Government: \nexecutive, legislative, and judicial. The judicial branch, as I was \ntaught--I presume people are still taught it this way--is the most \nindependent because it is protected at the Federal level from politics, \nfrom the passions of the moment. It is there to arbitrate disputes, to \nuphold our most fundamental liberties, to take the principles in the \nConstitution in the laws we adopt and relate them to the lives of the \nAmerican people in every generation.\n  It is, I want to repeat, charged with a significant responsibility \nand that is to be the one of the three branches of Government that is \nabove political passions, that is there to protect--I would call them \nthe eternal principles on which the Declaration, the Constitution, the \nBill of Rights were fashioned. That is what is on the line. It is a \ndirect question. It is a simple question, but it challenges a lot of \nour values.\n\n  The question really is, Will we require nominees to lifetime \nappointments on the Federal bench, the district court, circuit courts \nand, of course, the Supreme Court, will we require nominees for \nlifetime appointments to the Federal bench to receive the votes of at \nleast 60 Members of the Senate? Will we require judges who will have a \nlot to say about the nature of law, values, freedom, and rights in our \ncountry--not just for the term of this President but for as long as \nthey live--to receive the votes of at least 60 Members of the Senate?\n  In a time in the history of the Senate which is, unfortunately, \nincreasingly partisan and polarized and too often unproductive, I speak \nreally about the partisanship and polarization. Will we require, in \nhaving that standard of 60 votes thereby, that any nominee to the \nlifetime appointment to the Federal bench receive the support of the \nMembers of more than one of our political parties?\n  Remember, I talked about the judiciary having that unique role in our \nconstitutional system and our governmental system to be independent of \npolitical passions and polling and what is popular at the moment, to \nprotect our freedom to arbitrate disputes, to uphold our best values. \nDon't we want to require that 60 votes be obtained for this lifetime \nappointment, which in the current practical, real political context--\nwith 55 Members of one party, 45 in the other, it could soon switch. \nSome hope sooner than others hope, but it could switch. Do we want just \nthose 55 Members of one political party today, and it could be another \npolitical party tomorrow, to determine confirmation of appointees for \nlifetime service on the Federal bench?\n  We are in much better shape as a country if we can look forward with \nmuch more of a sense of confidence and with a sense of pride that we \nhave fulfilled the values and the purpose that the Founders of this \ncountry put in the judiciary if we require 60 votes. That is what is on \nthe line. The nuclear option would blow that up and say it would \nrequire 51.\n  Others have spoken and can speak about the impact this might have on \nour working relationships in the Senate, on our ability to deal with \nother problems. But for me, the fundamental question is, Will we \ncontinue to require those 60 votes.\n  I speak for myself, but I believe I speak for most other Members of \nthe Senate, it is never the first choice to filibuster anything. Not \nfor me. And certainly not on a judicial nomination. I have voted in my \n16\\1/2\\ years--I have not counted them up--I assume, on hundreds of \njudicial nominations. As we know from the most famous chart in America \ntoday, the President has had confirmed 208 of 218 of his nominees. I \nhave been here since the first President Bush was in office, so I have \nvoted on several hundred judicial nominees, and I believe I have \nfilibustered maybe 10.\n  I, as one Senator, want to preserve my right if I believe this \nPresident or the next President nominates someone I just do not believe \nby their record, by their experience, by their testimony before \nhearings, is qualified or fit to serve on the Federal bench for the \nrest of their lifetime. I want the right to demand that nominee prove \nthat he or she can obtain the support of at least 60 Senators.\n  That is what is on the line. It is on the line for the judiciary, but \nit suggests what is on the line for the Senate overall. Over the years, \nand I must say my attitude has changed on this as I have watched the \nSenate become more partisan and polarized, it seems to me, and now I am \nspeaking more broadly than the judicial nominations which will be the \nfocus of the nuclear option if the button is pushed, that in a Senate \nthat is increasingly partisan and polarized--and therefore, \nunproductive--that the institutional requirement for 60 votes is one of \nthe last best hopes of bipartisanship in moderation because to not only \nconfirm a judicial nominee but to pass legislation, if you have the \nright to demand 60 votes, and the President proposes legislation, \nindividual Members of the Senate do so, you have to go beyond the \nMembers of your own party. I suppose if one party gets 60 votes, that \nargument is all over but not totally because even within\n\n[[Page S5575]]\n\nthat 60 they may have to work to get it.\n  In the current context, that is what we are talking about. It could \nflip again to another party, my party being in the majority. It \nrequires on every measure that to pass something you have to get more \nthan the Members of your own party. You have to get more than people of \none philosophical or ideological point of view. You have to get to 60. \nIt is often not very hard to do that. That is why I say, the 60-vote \nsupermajority requirement is today, in a partisan Senate, one of the \nlast best hopes, pressures, for bipartisanship in the most literal \nsense. You cannot get to 60 votes with Members of one party, and for \nmoderation, which is where America has always done best, and where I am \nconvinced the majority of the American people still rest.\n\n  There were polls that came out this week. The polls are snapshots, \nand we should never be governed by them, but the one from the Wall \nStreet Journal and NBC should be taken as a warning. People talk about \nthe popularity of the President, up or down, whether people support a \nSocial Security program or don't. But the polling data on Congress, in \nterms of the popularity of Congress, with trust or whatever the word \nwas, is at an all-time low since this particular poll began to be taken \nin 1994. I think the public is fed up with the partisanship. I think \nthey want us to get something done.\n  The tragedy of it is that all 100 of us ran for the Senate, not to \ncome and have fights with one another, sound and fury that produce \nnothing. We came here to get something done. But we are in this cycle \nwhere the campaigns never seem to stop.\n  The Presiding Officer knows from the founding of our country, thank \nGod, there was very spirited politics and campaigns. In some of the \nearly campaigns, centuries before television, people said pretty tough \nstuff about one another, but I think through most of our history, when \nthe campaigns ended, those elected focused on governance, on leading \nthe country, on doing something for the people who sent us.\n  It seems to me too often that the campaigns never stop. As a result, \nwe do not get as much accomplished as we should get accomplished, and \nthe needs remain great to keep our country safe, improve the quality of \nour education, health care, to protect the environment, to continue to \nwork together with business to stimulate the economy.\n  These are the consequences of the perpetual campaigning and increased \npartisanship. It is not the place to talk of the causes of it, but I \nwant to describe it as I have experienced it and to say that if we end \nthe 60-vote requirement, I fear it will get worse, that it will get \nmore partisan, less productive, and we will do less for the people's \nbusiness.\n  This is why I have been participating over the last week, and a \nlittle bit more in the extraordinary, in some sense unprecedented, \ndiscussions, negotiations between a group of Senators of both political \nparties who share many of the views that I have just expressed and want \nto avoid the nuclear option and to bring us back from the precipice.\n\n  I hope these negotiations end successfully. It would not only be in \nthe Senate's interest, it would not only be in the interest of our \nindependent judiciary, it would be in the interest of the American \npeople who want us to get some things done to improve their lives and \nmake them safer.\n  If those negotiations do not conclude successfully, I hope Members of \nthe Senate individually will, in good conscience, reach a judgment that \npushing the button on the nuclear option is a response, in its way, to \na passion of the moment, a concern that filibusters have been used \nagainst judicial nominees.\n  Colleagues of mine on this side have said, over and over again, made \nthe point--it is, in my opinion, the fact--208 out of 218 of President \nBush's nominees have been confirmed, a much higher percentage than \nPresident Clinton had. But there are people, obviously, in this Chamber \nangry about the small number who have not been approved. It is a anger \nof the moment.\n  I appeal to all my colleagues not to yield to the anger of the moment \nand do serious damage not just to this institution but to the values \nupon which our Constitution and our country rest. That is what is on \nthe line. It is a big moment for the Senate. I hope and pray and, \nultimately, believe we will rise to the challenge and do what is right.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, my understanding is that I believe, by \nprevious order, there are 5 minutes remaining on this side.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. There is 3\\1/2\\ minutes remaining.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I spoke to the previous Presiding Officer and indicated I \nhad wished to speak for 15 minutes. I ask unanimous consent to do that, \nprovided that the other side has equal opportunity to extend their time \nas well.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered. The time is extended.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I have said on a previous occasion how \nproud I am to be here in the Senate. For these years I have served, it \nhas been an enormous privilege. I come from a small town in ranching \ncountry and wheat country in southwestern North Dakota. I never thought \nI would meet a Senator or a President, but yet, because of the great \nquilt-work of this democracy, I have been elected to the Senate now on \nthree occasions and am enormously proud to serve.\n  I do not come here to be a partisan. I am proud of my political \nparty, however. I think we have two grand political parties in this \ncountry. Both, from time to time, have made great accomplishments and \nhave made great mistakes. I fear we are on the precipice of one of \nthose great mistakes. That is why I came to speak again on this \nsubject.\n  There is plenty of blame, I suppose, to go around to both parties on \na range of issues. I think sometimes about the poem written by Ogden \nNash, about a man who drinks too much and a woman who scolds him about \nit. Ogden Nash wrote this:\n\n     He drinks because she scolds, he thinks;\n     She thinks she scolds because he drinks;\n     And neither will admit what's true,\n     That he's a drunk and she's a shrew.\n\n  So Ogden Nash described circumstances of blame, circumstances of how \ntwo different people see the same situation differently.\n  We come now to a big decision on the floor of the Senate. David \nBroder, who I think is one of the excellent writers here in Washington, \nDC, with the Washington Post, has written a piece about what we are \ndoing. He says:\n\n       But dwarfing all these individual dramas [in the debate] is \n     the question of what the vote means [the nuclear option vote \n     means] for the Senate as an institution. Two of the main \n     props of the Senate's identity are at stake. The tradition of \n     unlimited debate, going back to the Senate's earliest years. \n     . . . [and] the continuity of the Senate rules. . . .\n\n  What does this mean about ``unlimited debate'' and ``the continuity \nof the Senate rules''? I have the rule book for the Senate. These are \nthe Senate rules. The Senate rules provide that to change the rules of \nthe Senate requires 67 Senators, 67 votes.\n  The majority now wishes to change the rules, but they do not have 67 \nvotes. They are displeased about that. So they want to ignore the \nParliamentarian--that would be their strategy--ignore the \nParliamentarian, who would rule that what they are attempting to do is \nnot within the rules, and then they would change the rules with 51 \nvotes.\n  They call this the nuclear option, self-described as a nuclear option \nby a member of their caucus. I suppose they use that term because they \nknow that for a majority party to violate the rules in order to change \nthe rules would have an enormously destructive impact on this body.\n  Some years ago, I went to the 200th birthday of the writing of the \nConstitution. It was held in the assembly room of Constitution Hall in \nPhiladelphia. Again, I have told my colleagues in the Senate, I \ngraduated from a small high school class of nine students. I found \nmyself 1 of 55 people designated to go into that room where, 200 years \nearlier, 55 people had written the Constitution, this little book that, \non page 17, says, ``We the People of the United States.'' They wrote \nthat 229 years ago.\n  On its 200th birthday, 55 of us went into that room. The chair where \nGeorge Washington sat as he presided\n\n[[Page S5576]]\n\nis still there. Ben Franklin sat over here, Mason over there, Madison \nover here. They wrote: ``We the People,'' and they described a system \nof self-government that represents the power of one. All of the power \nin this country is vested in the power of one person casting one vote \nat a time on a prescribed date in this country--every even-numbered \nyear. The late Claude Pepper used to call it the ``miracle of \ndemocracy.'' Where every even-numbered year, the American people get to \ngrab the steering wheel and decide which way to nudge this great \ncountry of ours, which direction it wants this country to move.\n  This Constitution set up something very important because they \nunderstood that for self-government to work, there needed to be checks \nand balances. They had a belly-full of King George. They just had a \nbelly-full. They did not want that kind of oppressive government. They \nwanted self-government with checks and balances. So they established a \ngovernment with separation of powers, a government in which the \nconcentration of power would be prohibited by a series of checks and \nbalances.\n  It has not been a perfect government, but it is the best I know of on \nthe face of this small planet Earth. That separation of powers and \nthose checks and balances are essential, they are critical, to the \nworking of our Government.\n  Now, the question of how judges are appointed, was part of the debate \nof the Constitution. In fact, some wanted the Congress to appoint \njudges. But the compromise was that we would have a two-part process. \nThe President would propose, or nominate, people for a lifetime \nappointment on the Federal bench. Incidentally, these are the only \npeople who are given lifetime appointments, the judges who sit on the \nFederal bench, so that they would be impervious to the passions of the \nmoment, impervious to changes in passions, and have fealty toward this \ndocument, the Constitution.\n  So they decided the President shall nominate and the Congress shall \nadvise and consent. The President can say: Here is who I want. The \nCongress can say: Yes or no.\n  We have had a lot of problems with judicial nominations over the \nyears. In the 1990s, I recall at least 60 names were sent up here, and \nthey did not get a vote. Many on the other side now stand up on the \nfloor of the Senate and say: We want the right to vote. Let's vote on \nall these nominees; forgetting that 60 of them--60 of them sent here by \nPresident Clinton--did not get a vote. In fact, many of them did not \nhave the courtesy of one day of hearing. But 60 of them did not get a \nvote. I did not hear one person stand up on the other side and say: We \ndemand to bring these to a vote. No. They were busy blocking--\nblocking--those judges.\n  Now, there is a kind of a born-again quality about this issue, and \nthey say: We want everyone to have a vote. Well, they have all had a \nvote. It is just that 10 of them only got a cloture vote and did not \nget the 60 votes required. And because they did not get 60 votes, out \nof 218 judicial nominees, 208 were approved and 10 were not. So we have \npeople around here whose nose is completely bent out of shape because \n10 out of 218 did not get approved. And, incidentally, the 208 out of \nthe 218 who have been approved for this President represents a much \nhigher percentage than the previous President or the President before \nthat. And, we also have the lowest vacancy rate on the Federal bench \nsince many years ago.\n  But having said all that, we now have a proposal by the majority \nparty to exercise the so-called nuclear option.\n  Why do we have that proposal? I guess they have decided they are \ngoing to do it because they can. They can decide to ignore, as David \nBroder, the dean of the Washington press corps describes, the two main \nprops of Senate identity--unlimited debate and the continuity of the \nSenate rules.\n  There are reasons to have, perhaps, some sort of a self-described \nnuclear approach on the Senate floor. Perhaps we should have a nuclear \napproach to deal with the loss of jobs. Maybe that would be helpful. \nMaybe we ought to have this energy, this passion, this demand to \nexplode something here to be in support of American jobs, to stop the \nhemorrhaging of jobs overseas. Read the paper this morning. Two more \ncompanies shut their plants, fired their workers. They are going to \nMexico. It happens every single day. Mexico, China, Indonesia, Sri \nLanka, you name it; we don't have the energy on the floor to deal with \nthat. The majority party only wants to talk about the few judges that \nwere not approved by the Senate. Why? Because I believe they have \nforgotten about the important elements of this Constitution dealing \nwith checks and balances, and the separation of power.\n  As I said, there are many things we ought to be discussing on the \nfloor of the Senate with great passion. How about health care? The cost \nof health care, the cost of prescription drugs, the dramatic increase \nin these costs that are devastating families, devastating to \nbusinesses, and devastating to the Federal budget. Anything going on, \non the floor of the Senate about that? Not at all.\n  We have two things happening here. One, Air Force One is traveling \naround the country because they say there is a crisis in Social \nSecurity. There is not. Social Security will remain fully solvent until \nGeorge W. Bush is 106 years old. That is hardly a crisis. No. 2, we \nhave on the floor of the Senate this extreme tension because the \nmajority party has decided it wants to violate the rules of the Senate \nto change the rules. Why? Because it can.\n  There are so many other things we ought to be working on, so many \nother things we ought to be doing to put this country back on track, \nsuch as dealing with the trade deficit, and the hemorrhaging of \nAmerican jobs. I mentioned General Electric announced a plant closing; \n470 people are going to lose their jobs. That was yesterday in the \nnewspapers. They made refrigerators. They were proud to do it. Those \nrefrigerators will now be made in Mexico, and those 470 people will be \nout of work. I would love to come to the floor to talk about that. I \nhave offered amendments. I can't get to first base. That is not part of \nwhat happens around here.\n  The majority party is upset because they didn't get every judge, so \nthey want to do what is called a nuclear option. As I said, I am \nenormously proud to serve here. Most of the things that we face should \nrequire us to work together. We all have the same ends. We want the \nbest for the United States of America. We want our country to do well, \nto expand, to provide opportunity. We want to help with the things that \nfamilies talk about at night when they sit around the supper table: Do \nI have a good job; does my job pay well; do I have job security; are we \nsending our kids to schools we are proud of; do our grandparents have \naccess to decent health care; do we live in a safe neighborhood? All of \nthese issues are central to what all of us ought to be thinking about \nand working on as hard as we can.\n  It is not about a Republican answer or a Democratic answer. It is \nabout our responsibility, as 100 Senators, men and women of good will, \nwith presumably the skills to get here and the need to come together to \nwork on these issues.\n  This nuclear option is so destructive. It was said once that \npreceding every great mistake, there is a split second when those who \nare about to make that mistake have the opportunity to turn back and \nfind a more productive course. We are at that split second. This will, \nindeed, be a great mistake if those who attempt this do not turn back. \nAbraham Lincoln once said: Die when I may, let it be said of me by \nthose who know me best that I always plucked a thistle where I thought \na flower would grow and planted a flower.\n  The party of Abraham Lincoln is, at this point, not planting flowers, \nrather, they are plucking thistles and planting thistles in the middle \nof this Chamber. I hope those who think this is a clever move, those \nwho think this is a new strategy that they can win, will understand \nthey ultimately will lose by failing to respect the traditions of the \nSenate, the rules of the Senate, and the concept of unlimited debate \nthat makes this institution different than any other in the country.\n  We all come from different corners of America, different size cities, \ndifferent backgrounds, different education. But I believe we are all \npeople of good will. We all came here with the same hope in our heart, \nhope for a better America.\n\n[[Page S5577]]\n\nMy hope would be that in the coming 2 or 3 or 4 days, those who have \nled us to this moment and this position preceding a great mistake, will \nrethink that position and see if we can't get back to the main agenda \nfacing this country and its citizens.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Texas is recognized for \n15 minutes.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I appreciate the eloquent comments of our \ncolleague from North Dakota. I, too, wish we could get on with the \nNation's business dealing with the high price of gasoline, which is \nhurting our economy and hurting consumers and people who need to \ncommute to and from work to do their job.\n  I wish we could get on addressing the issues of the uninsured and \nlack of access to good quality health care by too many Americans. I \nwish we could talk about securing our borders and how we deal with our \ninability to control our borders and the threat that that presents to \nour national security. If we could simply get the up-or-down vote that \nwas recognized as the Senate tradition for 214 years before the last \nCongress, we would be addressing those other issues.\n  But here we are, having debated for 19 days on the floor of the \nSenate about this nominee, Justice Priscilla Owen. Interestingly, that \nis 2 more days than the nominations of all nine sitting members of the \nU.S. Supreme Court took.\n  So while our colleagues on the other side of the aisle talk about \npreservation of the tradition of unlimited debate, this is not about \ndebate. We have heard the distinguished Democratic leader say there is \nnot enough time in the universe to debate these nominees. It is not \nabout debate. Some have complained that on this side we are impeding \nthe free speech rights of Senators.\n  Anybody who has been listening to the debate knows that there has \nbeen no impeding of free speech on the floor of the Senate. Some have \nsaid this is about minority rights. This is not about minority rights. \nWe respect minority rights in the Senate. We always have, and we always \nwill. But the fact is the American people sent a majority to the Senate \nthat stands ready to confirm these nominees. It is not just people on \nour side of the aisle. If we were permitted to cast a vote, a \nbipartisan majority would confirm these nominees today. This amounts to \na veto, in effect. A partisan minority has attempted to cast a veto of \nbipartisan majority rights.\n  I heard the distinguished Senator from Connecticut, whom I respect \nenormously, but I disagree with his comments today that somehow he now \nunderstands the wisdom of requiring 60 votes before we can confirm a \nnominee to a Federal court, when the fact is, from time immemorial, \nsince the beginning of this institution, only 51 votes were required to \nconfirm a nominee. And now all of a sudden, President Bush is elected \nand reelected, and we are going to raise the level to 60 votes. That is \nchanging the rules in the middle of the game. That is not fair. What we \nneed is a resolution of this issue based on principle.\n  That principle has to be one of fundamental fairness. That is, the \nsame rules apply whether it is a Republican President or a Democratic \nPresident, whether there is a Republican majority or a Democratic \nmajority. That, to me, is the principle on which this matter can be \nresolved--not based on some bogus suggestion or some deal cut by a \nhandful of Senators that would throw some nominees overboard, confirm \nothers, and not leave the issue of a potential U.S. Supreme Court \nvacancy resolved.\n  We need this matter resolved after 4 years. After 4 years, patience \nceases to be a virtue. We need to get on to the issues the Senator from \nNorth Dakota and others talked about. And we will. But now is the time \nto resolve this issue once and for all.\n  I point out the speciousness of this 60-vote requirement and how it \ndoes represent a departure from past practice. We can see going back to \n1979, through 2000, where judges nominated by President Carter, judges \nnominated by President Reagan, judges nominated by the first President \nBush, and judges nominated by President Clinton were confirmed and are \nsitting on the Federal bench today with less than 60 votes. So any \nsuggestion that we on this side are somehow trying to change the rules \njust does not withstand scrutiny. It is not true. All we are asking for \nis a restoration of that majority tradition.\n  Let me say that for the last 3 days--actually, for the last 4 years--\nwe have debated three key questions on the floor of the Senate. Really, \nI do think it boils down to these three key issues:\n  First of all, do nominees such as Priscilla Owen, whose picture is to \nmy right--somebody who I know personally and worked with for 3 years on \nthe Texas Supreme Court, who I know to be a fine, decent human being \nand outstanding judge--deserve confirmation to the Federal bench or, at \na minimum, do they deserve an up-or-down vote? No one is suggesting \nthat any Senator violate their conscience. Indeed, if any Senator \nbelieves they cannot in good conscience vote for this or any other \nnominee, of course, we would expect them to cast a ``no'' vote on the \nconfirmation. But we would expect at least for them to allow there to \nbe a vote.\n  The second question is: Is this new idea of a supermajority \nrequirement for the confirmation of judges both unprecedented and \nwrong?\n  Third, is the use of the Byrd option--the constitutional point of \norder we have heard much discussed, which has been exercised in the \npast--appropriate in order to restore Senate tradition to the \nconfirmation of judges and to ensure that the rules remain the same, \nregardless of which party controls the White House and which party has \na majority in the Senate?\n  I firmly believe the case has been made, and that the answer to each \nof these questions is ``yes.''\n  Let me reiterate. First, do nominees such as Justice Priscilla Owen \ndeserve confirmation to the Federal bench or, at minimum, an up-or-down \nvote?\n  Of course, they do. This is a distinguished jurist and public \nservant, who enjoys bipartisan support in the State of Texas of \nstatewide elected officials who are Democrats, 15 members of the State \nbar association, the premier association for the legal community in our \nState, which supports this judge because she is a good judge. There are \nthose who oppose Justice Owen's nomination and, of course, that is \ntheir right. Some Senators have even criticized her rulings. Others, \nincluding myself, have defended those rulings. The debate has been \nextensive and Justice Owen's record, I believe, has prevailed.\n  Indeed, I submit it is precisely because Justice Owen's record is so \nstrong that a partisan minority of Senators now insist that she may not \nbe confirmed without the support of at least 60 Senators, a demand that \nis, by their own admission--at least at one time--unprecedented in \nSenate history. Why? Because the case for opposing her is so weak that \nthe only way it can be defeated is by changing the rules to defeat her \nnomination. They know it. Before her nomination became caught up in the \npartisan special interest politics that seem to dominate the opposition \nto her nomination, the top Democrat on the Judiciary Committee \npredicted Owen would be swiftly confirmed.\n  On the day of the announcement of the first group of nominees--that \nis, by my recollection, on May 9, 2001--more than 4 years ago, the \nranking member of the Judiciary Committee said he was encouraged and \nthat I know them well enough that I would assume they will all go right \nthrough.\n  Just a few short weeks ago, the minority leader announced that Senate \nDemocrats would give Justice Owen an up-or-down vote, albeit only if \nRepublicans agreed to deny the same courtesy to other nominees. Now, \nthat, as much as anything--and the distinguished senior Senator from \nPennsylvania made this point--really, by the sort of bargain that has \nbeen offered, the political deal that has been offered to allow an up-\nor-down vote on some nominees and throw others overboard, it is clear \ntheir complaint is not with Justice Owen. If, in fact, the minority \nleader announced he would give her an up-or-down vote if we simply toss \nsome of the others overboard, to me that demonstrates the lack of merit \nof their complaints and accusations when it comes to this judge and her \nrecord.\n  In the end, these concessions are understandable because the case \nagainst Justice Owen is simply not convincing. The American people know \na controversial ruling from the bench when\n\n[[Page S5578]]\n\nthey see one, whether it is the radical redefinition of our society's \nmost basic institution, marriage, or the expulsion of the Pledge of \nAllegiance and other expressions of faith from our public square, or \nthe elimination of the ``three strikes and you're out'' law and other \npenalties against multiple-time convicted criminals, or the forced \nremoval of military recruiters from college campuses. Justice Owen's \ndecisions as a judge fall nowhere near this class or category of cases. \nThere is a world of difference between struggling--as any good judge \nwill do--to try to determine what legislative intent is by parsing the \nwords of a statute, trying to figure out what did the legislature \nmean--there is a huge difference between that and refusing to obey a \nlegislature's directives altogether and substituting one's own views \nfor that of the elected representatives of the people.\n  The second question to reiterate is: Is this new idea of a \nsupermajority requirement for confirmation of judges unprecedented and \nwrong? The answer is yes and yes. Indeed, our colleagues across the \naisle have said so in the past time and time again. Unprecedented? \nWell, of course, it is. President after President after President have \ngotten their judicial nominees confirmed by a majority vote, as we just \nshowed a moment ago, not by a supermajority vote of 60.\n  Indeed, by their own admission, Justice Owen's opponents in this body \nare using unprecedented tactics to block her nomination. A leading \nDemocratic Senator has boosted of their unprecedented tactics in his \nfundraising e-mail to Democratic donors.\n  Is it wrong? Well, of course it is. Senators on both sides of the \naisle have firmly stated in the past that judicial nominees should \nnever be defeated by a filibuster, and legal scholars across the \npolitical spectrum have long concluded what we in this body know \ninstinctively: that to change the rules of confirmation, as a partisan \nminority has done, badly politicizes the judiciary and hands over \ncontrol of this confirmation process to a handful of special interest \ngroups.\n  Finally, the third and last question: Is the use of the Byrd option \nappropriate in order to restore Senate tradition to the confirmation of \njudges to ensure the rules remain the same regardless of which party \ncontrols the White House or which party controls a majority in the \nSenate?\n  Again, of course it is. It is, as we have demonstrated in the past, \nperhaps most appropriately called the Byrd option. Others have called \nit the constitutional option, or merely just a point of order. But it \nis called the Byrd option precisely because the former Democratic \nmajority leader has exercised this authority on behalf of numerous \nSenators on numerous occasions in our history.\n  It is precisely why the former majority leader boasted just 10 years \nago on the floor of the Senate of how ``I have seen filibusters, I have \nhelped to break them, and the filibuster was broken--back, neck, legs, \nand arms. It went away in 12 hours. So I know something about \nfilibusters. I helped set a great many of the precedents that are on \nthe books today.''\n  The senior Senator from Massachusetts and the senior Senator from New \nYork have similarly recognized the authority of the majority of \nSenators to establish precedents by way of a point of order or the Byrd \noption or the constitutional option.\n  Over the last 3 days a number of Senators on both sides of the aisle \nhave taken to the floor of this body to offer their answers to these \nthree central questions. There have been disagreements, but I hope they \nhave been respectful disagreements.\n  It has been suggested by some that we are facing a constitutional \ncrisis. I beg to differ. America is strong. Our constitutional system \nworks. And it is perfectly normal and traditional for Senators to \ndebate, to disagree, and vote. Indeed, it has been on the floor of the \nSenate over our Nation's history that we have debated the great \nconstitutional and public policy issues of our day, and this is one of \nthem. But it is not a crisis.\n  It is perfectly normal and traditional for a majority of Senators to \nvote on the rules and parliamentary precedents of this body. Senators \nhave been doing that from the beginning of this great institution. \nThere is nothing radical about Senators debating the need to confirm \nwell-qualified judicial nominees. There is nothing radical about a \nmajority of Senators voting to confirm judicial nominees, and there is \nnothing radical about a majority of Senators voting to establish Senate \nprecedents and rules.\n  In short, what we have on the floor of the Senate right now is a \ncontroversy, a disagreement, not a crisis. This controversy can be \nresolved, and undoubtedly will be resolved, as it has always been \nresolved, by an up-or-down vote of the Senate. This controversy can be \nresolved, as it has always been resolved, by simply determining which \nside of the question enjoys the support of a greater number of \nSenators. And once the controversy is resolved, we can and we should \nget back to work on the rest of the people's business.\n  This is a controversy, a disagreement, not a crisis. And I hope that \nin the coming days, we will complete our debate and resolve this \ncontroversy in a respectful way, consistent with the greatest \ntraditions of the Senate.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, we have completed our third day of \nconsideration of the nomination of Priscilla Owen and, therefore, I ask \nunanimous consent that there be an additional 10 hours of debate \nequally divided on the nomination, and that following that time, the \nSenate proceed to a vote on the confirmation of the nomination, with no \nintervening action or debate.\n  Mr. REID. I object.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that there be an \nadditional 15 hours of debate equally divided on the nomination, and \nthat following that time, the Senate proceed to a vote on the \nconfirmation of the nomination, with no intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, Mr. President. The mere fact \nthat I can object shows this is a debatable motion. I do object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I will refrain from making other offers of \nunanimous consent for additional debate time at this time.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  With that objection, on behalf of the majority leader, I send a \ncloture motion to the desk.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The cloture motion having been presented \nunder rule XXII, the Chair directs the clerk to read the motion.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     do hereby move to bring to a close debate on Executive \n     Calendar No. 71, the nomination of Priscilla Richman Owen, of \n     Texas, to be United States Circuit Judge for the Fifth \n     Circuit.\n         Bill Frist, Arlen Specter, Trent Lott, Lamar Alexander, \n           Jon Kyl, Jim Talent, Wayne Allard, Richard G.

Mr. President, as we commemorate National Police Week, I \nwould like to recognize the courageous\n\n[[Page S5579]]\n\nmen and women who serve our families and communities as law enforcement \nofficers. I would also like to honor the memory of those who gave their \nlives in the line of duty. These officers, and their families, have \npaid the ultimate sacrifice for the safety of others.\n  The first National Police Week was celebrated in 1962 when President \nJohn F. Kennedy signed an Executive Order designating May 15th as Peace \nOfficers Memorial Day and the week in which that date falls as ``Police \nWeek.'' The weeklong tribute to our Nation's local, State and Federal \npolice officers honors those who died in the line of duty and those who \ncontinue to serve and protect us every day at great personal risk.\n  According to the National Law Enforcement Memorial Fund, 1,649 law \nenforcement officers have been killed in the line of duty in the last \n10 years. In 2004 alone, 153 officers lost their lives, including 7 \nfrom Michigan. As in past years, the names of these officers have been \npermanently engraved on the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial \nalong side more than 17,000 others.\n  We can further honor the sacrifices of these brave men and women by \npassing important legislation to support our law enforcement officers. \nThat is why I have joined Senator Biden as a cosponsor of his COPS \nReauthorization Act. The COPS program was created in 1994 and is \ndesigned to assist State and local law enforcement agencies in hiring \nadditional police officers to reduce crime through the use of community \npolicing. Nationwide, the COPS program has awarded more than $11 \nbillion in grants, resulting in the hiring of 118,000 additional police \nofficers. Unfortunately, authorization for the COPS program was \npermitted to expire at the end of fiscal year 2000. Although the \nprogram has survived through continued annual appropriations, its \nfunding has been significantly cut. The COPS Reauthorization Act would \ncontinue the COPS program for another 6 years at a funding level of \n$1.15 billion per year, nearly double the amount appropriated for \nfiscal year 2005. Among other things, this funding would allow State \nand local governments to hire an additional 50,000 police officers and \nimprove their ability to analyze crime data and DNA evidence. At a time \nwhen we are asking more of our police departments than ever before, I \nbelieve we should be devoting more resources to the COPS program, not \nless.\n  Supporting our law enforcement officers also requires that we take up \nand pass common sense legislation to help keep them safe while they \ncarry out their duties. Shootings have been the leading cause of death \nfor law enforcement officers over the last ten years and more can be \ndone to keep powerful weapons out of the hands of violent criminals. We \nshould listen to law enforcement groups like the International \nAssociation of Chiefs of Police, the International Brotherhood of \nPolice Officers, and the National Fraternal Order of Police which have \ncalled for reauthorization of the 1994 assault weapons ban. In addition \nwe should be working to pass legislation to close loopholes that allow \npotential criminals to buy dangerous weapons like the Five-Seven armor-\npiercing handgun. Our law enforcement community deserves no less.\n  In honor of their memories, the names of law enforcement officers \nfrom Michigan who died in the line of duty during 2004 are:\n  Officer Matthew E. Bowens of Detroit, died February 16, 2004;\n  Officer Gary Cooper Davis of Bloomfield Township, died May 13, 2004;\n  Officer Jennifer T. Fettig of Detroit, died February 16, 2004;\n  Deputy Sheriff Perry Austin Fillmore of Clinton County, died March \n27, 2004;\n  Deputy Sheriff John Kevin Gunsell of Otsego County, died September \n12, 2004;\n  Officer Mark Anthony Sawyers of Sterling Heights, died June 5, 2004; \nand\n  Detective John Raymond Weir of Sault Ste. Marie, died November 7, \n2004.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/05/20/senate-section/article/S5579-1", "month": "05", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5579]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nTRIBUTE TO ALABAMA'S WINNERS OF THE WE THE PEOPLE: THE CITIZEN AND THE \n                        CONSTITUTION COMPETITION\n\n Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I would like to take this \nopportunity to recognize a group of students in my home State of \nAlabama. On April 30, 2005, students from Vestavia Hills High School in \nBirmingham, AL, traveled to Washington, D.C. to take part in the \nnational finals of We the People: The Citizen and the Constitution \nnational competition. This competition is an extensive educational \nprogram developed specifically to educate young people about the United \nStates Constitution and Bill of Rights.\n  More than 1,200 students from across the country participated in a 3-\nday academic competition. They participated in a simulated \ncongressional hearing in which they ``testified'' before a panel. \nStudents got to demonstrate their knowledge and understanding of \nconstitutional principles. Additionally, they had the opportunity to \nevaluate, take, and defend positions on relevant historical and present \nday issues.\n  Prior to their trip to Washington, these outstanding students from \nVestavia Hills High School proved their knowledge of the United States \nConstitution, by winning their statewide competition, thus earning them \nthe chance to come to our Nation's capital to compete at the national \nlevel. I am proud these students represented the State of Alabama on a \nnational level in this year's We the People competition.\n  I would like to pay special tribute to the teacher of the class, Amy \nMaddox. The students of Vestavia Hills High School participating in the \nWe the People: The Citizens and the Constitution competition are the \nfollowing: Matthew Barley, Katie Barzler, Maria Begamaz, Michelle \nBlackburn, Brandon Demyan, Lorey Feagin, Anne Hackney, Ashley Holmes, \nAbby Jones, Staci Karpova, Thomas Lide, Kristin McDonald, Freman Meri-\nGlenn, Tucker Reeves, Luke Romano, Erin Snow, and Christopher \nWilloughby. I would like to applaud their efforts.\n  Mr. President, the achievements of these students are continued proof \nthat the civic education initiative we approved in this chamber is \npaying dividends. We the People, which is part of the civic education \ninitiative of the No Child Left Behind legislation, is giving students \nthe lifelong skills they need to be effective, engaged, and informed \ncitizens. I commend the Center for Civic Education and the National \nConference of State Legislatures for their leadership in sponsoring \nthis excellent service learning-type program. I also would like to \ncommend Janice Cowin, the state coordinator from the Alabama Center for \nLaw & Civic Education for her work in administering the program in my \nState.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/05/20/senate-section/article/S5579-2", "month": "05", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5579]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 2:22 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has passed the \nfollowing bill, in which it requests the concurrence of the Senate:\n\n       H.R. 2361.

A bill to amend chapter 113 of title 18, United States Code, \nto clarify the prohibition on the trafficking in goods or services, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, today I am pleased to join Senator Leahy \nto offer important legislation in our continued bipartisan effort to \ncombat the trafficking of illegitimate goods throughout the world.\n  Recently, we have worked together on a matter near and dear to my \nheart--good government legislation related to the Freedom of \nInformation Act, and it is indeed a pleasure to work with the Ranking \nMember of the Judiciary Committee again.\n  The rampant distribution of illegitimate goods--be it counterfeited \nproducts, illegal copies of copyrighted works or any other form of \npiracy--undermines property rights, threatens American jobs, decreases \nconsumer safety and, often times, supports organized crime and \nterrorist activity.\n  Amazingly, it is estimated that between 5 percent and 7 percent \nworldwide trade is conducted with counterfeit goods and services. \nAccording to FBI estimates, counterfeiting costs U.S. businesses as \nmuch as $200-$250 billion annually--and that costs Americans their \njobs--more than 750,000 jobs according to U.S. Customs.\n  In recent years, this plague on global trade has grown significantly. \nAccording to the World Customs Organization and Interpol, the global \ntrade in illegitimate goods has increased from $5.5 billion in 1992 to \nmore than $600 billion per year today. That is--$600 billion per year \nillegally extracted from the global economy.\n  But perhaps most troubling, the counterfeit trade threatens our \nsafety and our security. Counterfeit goods undermine our confidence in \nthe reliability of our goods and service. For example, the Federal \nAviation Administration estimates that 2 percent the 26 million airline \nparts installed each year are counterfeit. And the Federal Drug \nAdministration estimates that as much as 10 percent pharmaceuticals are \ncounterfeit. Worse yet--evidence indicates that the counterfeit trade \nsupports terrorist activities. Indeed, Al Qaeda training manuals \nrecommended the sale of fake goods to raise revenue.\n  And the reach of counterfeiting runs deep in my own home State of \nTexas. Data is difficult to collect, but a 1997 piece detailing \nMicrosoft's efforts to combat counterfeiting and piracy--while dated--\npointed out that this type of activity costs Texas over 10,000 jobs and \nalmost $1 billion. Today, we know those numbers are much higher.\n  We must act to stop this illegal activity.\n  The legislation we offer today, the Protecting American Goods and \nServices Act, is not complicated, it is not long--but its global impact \nwill be significant. The legislation is designed to provide law \nenforcement with additional tools to curb the flow of these \nillegitimate goods.\n  First, the bill would make it specifically illegal to import or \nexport unauthorized copies of copyrighted works or counterfeit goods. \nSecond, it would make it illegal to possess counterfeit goods with the \nintention of selling them. Finally, the bill would more clearly specify \nthat it is illegal to give away counterfeit goods in exchange for some \nfuture benefit--in effect, the ``bartering'' of counterfeit goods in \nsuch a way that avoids criminality.\n  Each of these items was highlighted by the Department of Justice in \nits October, 2004 report on its Task Force on Intellectual Property. In \nit, the Department describes the significant limitation law enforcement \noften times faces in pursuing counterfeiters and offers, among others, \nthe principles embraced in the Protecting American Goods and Services \nAct, as possible solutions to these obstacles.\n  This legislation, and other reforms, will help turn the tide of the \ngrowing counterfeit trade. The legislation is critically important to \nlaw enforcement--but it is even more critical for businesses, large and \nsmall, throughout America--including in my home State of Texas--as well \nas for ensuring the safety of consumers around the globe. Those who \ntraffic in counterfeit goods put Americans in danger, support terrorism \nand undermine the health of our Nation's economy.

Today, I am partnering with Senator Cornyn in another of \nour bipartisan efforts to improve the lives of Americans through \neffective and efficient government. The bill we are introducing, the \n``Protecting American Goods and Services Act of 2005,'' will strengthen \nour ability to combat the escalating problem of counterfeiting \nworldwide. In order to effectively fight intellectual property theft, \nwe need stiff penalties for counterfeiters and those who are caught \nwith counterfeit goods with the intent to traffic their false wares. \nOurs is a short bill--indeed, it is only four pages long--but it will \nhave global implications in the fight against piracy.\n  Counterfeiting is a growing problem that costs our economy hundreds \nof billions of dollars every year and has been linked to organized \ncrime, including terrorist organizations. According to the \nInternational Anti-Counterfeiting Coalition, counterfeit parts have \nbeen discovered in helicopters sold to NATO, in jet engines, bridge \njoints, brake pads, and fasteners in equipment designed to prevent \nnuclear reactor meltdowns. The World Health Organization estimates that \nthe market for counterfeit drugs is about $32 billion each year.\n  Several years ago, Senator Hatch joined me in sponsoring the ``Anti-\ncounterfeiting Consumer Protection Act of 1996,'' which addressed \ncounterfeiting by amending several sections of our criminal and tariff \ncodes. That law made important changes, particularly by expanding RICO, \nthe federal anti-racketeering law, to cover crimes involving \ncounterfeiting and copyright and trademark infringement. Then, as now, \ntrafficking in counterfeit goods hurts purchasers, state and federal \ngovernments, and economies at every level.\n  Perhaps most disturbingly, the U.S. Customs Service reports that \nterrorists have used transnational counterfeiting operations to fund \ntheir activities: The sale of counterfeit and pirated music, movies, \nsoftware, T-shirts, clothing, and fake drugs ``accounts for much of the \nmoney the international terrorist network depends on to feed its \noperations.''\n  Last year, as in years past, I worked with Senator Allen on an \namendment to the Foreign Operations bill that provides the State \nDepartment with vital resources to combat piracy of U.S. goods abroad. \nThe bill we ultimately passed included $3 million for this important \npurpose. Yet more work both at home and abroad remains. When you \nconsider that the economic impact of tangible piracy in counterfeit \ngoods is estimated to be roughly $350 billion a year and to constitute \nbetween 5 percent and 7 percent of worldwide trade, a few million \ndollars is a worthwhile investment.\n  We have certainly seen how this form of theft touches the lives of \nhard-working Vermonters. Burton Snowboards is a small company, whose \ninnovation has made it an industry leader in snowboarding equipment and \napparel. Unfortunately, knock-off products carrying Burton's name have \nbeen found across the globe. Vanessa Price, a representative of Burton, \ntestified about counterfeiting at the Judiciary Committee's March 23, \n2004, hearing on this topic. In addition to learning about the economic \ncosts of counterfeiting, I asked her after the hearing about the risks \nposed to consumers by these goods. Her answer was chilling: ``In the \nweeks since my Senate testimony, I discovered a shipment of counterfeit \nBurton boots for sale through a discount sports outfit . . . After \nexamining the poor quality of the counterfeit boots, we determined that \nanyone using the boots for snowboarding risks injury due to a lack of \nreinforcement and support in the product's construction.''\n\n  Customers and businesses lose out to counterfeiters in other ways, \ntoo. SB Electronics in Barre, Vt. has seen its capacitors reverse \nengineered and its customers lost to inferior copycat models. Vermont \nTubbs, a furniture manufacturer in Rutland, has seen its designs \ncopied, produced offshore with inferior craftsmanship and materials, \nand then reimported, so that the company is competing against cheaper \nversions of its own products. And Hubbardton Forge in Castleton, Vt. \nhas seen its beautiful and original lamps counterfeited and then sold \nwithin the United States at prices--and quality--far below their own. \nThis is wrong. It is unfair to consumers who deserve the high quality \ngoods they think they are paying for, and it is unfair to innovators \nwho play by the rules and deserve to profit from their labor.\n  The bill that I am introducing today with Senator Cornyn will help to \ncombat this growing scourge.\n  The bill will criminalize the possession of counterfeit goods with \nthe intent to sell or traffic in those goods, and it expands the \ndefinition of ``traffic'' to include any distribution of counterfeits \nwith the expectation of gaining something of value--criminals should \nnot be able to skirt the law simply because they barter illegal goods \nand services in exchange for their illicit wares. Finally, the bill \nwill criminalize the importation and exportation of counterfeit goods, \nas well as of bootleg copies of copyrighted works into and out of the \nUnited States.\n  By tying off these loopholes and improving U.S. laws on \ncounterfeiting, we will be sending a powerful message to the criminals \nwho belong in jail, and to our innovators.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/05/20/senate-section/article/S5582-1", "month": "05", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5582-S5714]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             TRANSPORTATION EQUITY ACT: A LEGACY FOR USERS\n\n  On Tuesday, May 17, 2005, the Senate passed H.R. 3, as follows:\n\n                                 H.R. 3\n\n       Resolved, That the bill from the House of Representatives \n     (H.R. 3) entitled ``An Act to authorize funds for Federal-aid \n     highways, highway safety programs, and transit programs, and \n     for other purposes.'', do pass with the following amendment:\n       Strike out all after the enacting clause and insert:\n\n     SECTION 1.

operate in Mexico or Canada may operate a \n     commercial motor vehicle transporting a hazardous material in \n     commerce in the United States until the operator has \n     undergone a background records check similar to the \n     background records check required for commercial motor \n     vehicle operators licensed in the United States to transport \n     hazardous materials in commerce.\n       (2) Definitions.--In this subsection:\n       (A) Hazardous materials.--The term ``hazardous material'' \n     has the meaning given that term in section 5102(2) of title \n     49, United

shall develop and \n     implement a process for the notification of a hazmat employer \n     (as defined in section 5102(4) of title 49, United States \n     Code), if appropriate considering the potential security \n     implications, designated by an applicant seeking a threat \n     assessment under part 1572 of title 49, Code of Federal \n     Regulations, if the Transportation Security Administration, \n     in an initial notification of threat assessment or a final \n     notification of threat assessment, served on the applicant \n     determines that the applicant does not meet the standards set \n     forth in section 1572.5(d) of title 49, Code of Federal \n     Regulations.\n       (2) Relationship to other background records checks.--\n       (A) Elimination of redundant checks.--An individual with \n     respect to whom the Transportation Security Administration--\n       (i) has performed a security threat assessment under part \n     1572 of title 49, Code of Federal Regulations, and\n       (ii) has issued a notification of no security threat under \n     section 1572.5(g) of that title,\n\n     is deemed to have met the requirements of any other \n     background check that is equivalent to, or\n\n[[Page S5702]]\n\n     less stringent than, the background check performed under \n     section 5103a of title 49, United States Code, that is \n     required for purposes of any Federal law applicable to \n     transportation workers.\n       (B) Determination by assistant secretary.--Within 30 days \n     after the date of enactment of this Act, the Assistant \n     Secretary of Homeland Security (Transportation Security \n     Administration) shall initiate a rulemaking proceeding, \n     including notice and opportunity for comment, that sets forth \n     the background checks and other similar security or threat \n     assessment requirements applicable to transportation workers \n     under Federal law to which subparagraph (A) applies.\n       (C) Future rulemakings.--The Assistant Secretary shall make \n     a determination under the criteria established under \n     subparagraph (B) with respect to any rulemaking proceeding to \n     establish or modify required background checks for \n     transportation workers initiated after the date of enactment \n     of this Act.\n       (c) Appeals Process for More Stringent State Procedures.--\n     If a State establishes standards for applicants for a \n     hazardous materials endorsement to a commercial driver's \n     license that, as determined by the Secretary of Homeland \n     Security, are more stringent than the standards set forth in \n     section 1572.5(d) of title 49, Code of Federal Regulations, \n     then the State shall also provide an appeals process similar \n     to the process provided under section 1572.141 of title 49, \n     Code of Federal Regulations, by which an applicant denied a \n     hazardous materials endorsement to a commercial driver's \n     license by that State may appeal that denial in a manner \n     substantially similar to, and to the same extent as, an \n     individual who received an initial notification of threat \n     assessment under part 1572 of that title.\n       (d) Clarification of Term Defined in Regulations.--The term \n     ``severe transportation security incident'', as defined in \n     section 1572.3 of title 49, Code of Federal Regulations, does \n     not include a work stoppage or other nonviolent employee-\n     related action resulting from an employer-employee dispute. \n     Within 30 days after the date of enactment of this Act, the \n     Secretary of Homeland Security shall modify the definition of \n     that term to reflect the preceding sentence.\n       (e) Background Check Capacity.--The Assistant Secretary of \n     Homeland Security (Transportation Security Administration) \n     shall transmit a report by October 1, 2005, to the Senate \n     Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation and the \n     House of Representatives Committee on Homeland Security on \n     the implementation of fingerprint-based security threat \n     assessments and the adequacy of fingerprinting locations, \n     personnel, and resources to accomplish the timely processing \n     of fingerprint-based security threat assessments for \n     individuals holding commercial driver's licenses who are \n     applying to renew hazardous materials endorsements.\n\n     SEC. 7326.
