Mr. President, today I rise to speak about our operation \nat Guantanamo Bay, in Cuba. There is so much information out there that \nis untrue, it must be corrected. Yesterday, I went to Guantanamo Bay \nwith my colleagues, Senator Crapo and Senator Isakson. We went to see \nfor ourselves what all the so-called fuss is about down there, and we \nwant to help set the record straight.\n  While we were there we also saw Senator Wyden and Senator Ben Nelson. \nI am sure they will tell you what they saw when they come to speak on \nthe Senate floor.\n  Our soldiers assigned in Cuba are on an island within an island. The \nbase is isolated from the rest of Cuba, and it is isolated from the \nrest of our military. Our troops do not just drive off post to go watch \na movie or to go to the mall. All they have is on post, from shopping \nto entertainment to food.\n  Many serving at Guantanamo leave their families behind. Some are \nNational Guard troops, far away from home. It is a tough life, and they \nhave a job that is mentally and physically challenging.\n  As we toured the detention camps, our troops patrolled the buildings \nand open areas in full uniform. In the afternoon, the temperatures \nreached into the high 80s, and the humidity could not have gotten much \nworse. But those brave young men and women stood guard over the \ndetainees to keep them in line and protect them from other detainees.\n  Probably the weather and the Sun are the last things our troops are \nworried about. The people they are guarding are the terrorists. They \nare the worst of the worst. They are all dangerous. Many directly \nfought Americans on the battlefield, killing and wounding our soldiers, \nyet our young men and women watch over these terrorists and provide for \nthem. They do this despite the terrorists having taken\n\n[[Page S7398]]\n\nup arms against fellow American servicemembers. The danger the \nterrorists pose to our military in Guantanamo is real and enduring.\n  While we were inspecting one of the detention facilities, the halls \nwere filled with sounds of detainees beating on metal doors of their \ncells and yelling at anyone who could hear. Weapons have been found in \nthe detainees' cells and are often made from ordinary items they are \nprovided.\n  Our troops on the ground in Guantanamo are putting their lives on the \nline to protect and provide for terrorists. Yet some of my colleagues \nand others, commentators, suggest that these brave young men and women \nare the criminals, and when they make such outrageous statements, there \nare many in the media willing to repeat the accusation without \nbothering to check the facts for themselves.\n  For example, almost any picture seen of detainees at Guantanamo is \nfrom Camp X-Ray. Everyone is familiar with those pictures. They are the \nones with men in orange suits, living in open-air cells made of chain-\nlink fences.\n  I went to Camp X-Ray. Do you know what I saw? I saw weeds several \nfeet high and plants growing all over the fencing. Do you know what I \ndid not see? People. Camp X-Ray has been closed since 2002. It is no \nlonger used at all. But those images are the ones that continue to \nappear in print and on the news. It is no secret that Camp X-Ray is \nclosed, but pictures of the new and improved facilities are never \nshown.\n  I wish to talk about these new facilities. They have come a long way \nfrom concrete slabs surrounded by chain-link fencing. I cannot say I \nfelt bad for any terrorist who had to spend the night in Camp X-Ray, \nbut the new camps are significantly better. They offer the terrorists \nmore privacy, space, and protection from the weather. They offer the \nterrorists areas for recreation. Some even have air-conditioning and \nsemiprivate showers.\n  The newest facility is modeled after the state-of-the-art prisons in \nthe United States and is fully air-conditioned. New furniture is on the \nway, and an even newer facility is about to be built. But I have not \nseen any of those camps I just described on the news, and I am hopeful \nthat those in the media will help clear up this issue.\n  But the real issue that goes to the heart of this debate is, Are we \nserious about fighting terrorism or not? If we are, then these new \ndetention facilities at Guantanamo will remain open until no more \nterrorists are plotting to harm innocent Americans. What goes on there \nis critical to our fight against terrorism and the war on terrorism. \nFirst and simplest, if the terrorists are locked up in Cuba, then they \ncannot kill Americans in Iraq or New York, in Afghanistan or even in \nKentucky. Those being held at Guantanamo are the worst of the worst \nterrorists we have captured. The military has decided that they are so \ndangerous that they must be moved halfway around the world to keep them \naway from the battlefield. That is reason enough to keep Guantanamo \nopen.\n  There are bomb makers who are no longer making bombs because they are \nin Cuba. Terrorist training camp instructors are no longer teaching \nclasses because they are being held next to a Caribbean beach. Others \nat Guantanamo were caught with heavy weapons, explosives, or anti-\naircraft missiles, but they will not get to use those weapons to kill \nAmericans because we are holding them in the detention facilities. One \nperson being held there very well may be the intended 20th hijacker for \nSeptember 11, but because he is locked in a cell in Cuba, he will not \nbe able to fly a plane into a building anytime soon.\n  I could describe many individuals held at Guantanamo and give reasons \nthey need to remain in our custody, but I only will mention a few \nmore--12, to be exact. That is the number of those we know who have \nbeen released from Guantanamo and returned to fight against the \ncoalition troops. Some have been killed and some have been recaptured. \nBut we must not miss the lesson that we are dealing with dangerous \npeople who will stop at nothing to kill innocent Americans.\n\n  But there is more to Guantanamo than locking up terrorists. As \nimportant as keeping the terrorists from carrying out their evil plans, \nwe are gaining valuable information from the detainees. Those \nterrorists are one of our greatest sources of information into \nterrorist operations, financing, and personnel. Some of them were very \nclose to Osama bin Laden at one time. Others were active in planning \nterrorist attacks. Still others worked on finance and personnel \nrecruitment for terrorist groups. Think of the wealth of information \nthey have.\n  The detainees can identify people involved in terrorist groups. They \nhave helped us better understand the structure of terrorist \norganizations. They know locations and transportation routes. They can \nvalidate information gathered on the battlefield. To this day, they \ncontinue to provide us with critical information in our fight against \nterrorism.\n  We are not gathering information from them in any inhuman way. I saw \nseveral interrogations. None of the terrorists were being beaten. There \nwas no torture, and they were not being starved. Throughout the entire \ndetention camp, terrorists were given clothes and bedding. They are \ngiven Muslim prayer rugs and Korans. There are arrows everywhere \npointing to Mecca. We even witnessed a prayer call announcing to the \nterrorists that it was time for them to turn to Mecca and pray.\n  That, Mr. President, is a far cry from the repressive regimes to \nwhich critics of Guantanamo have compared our military. Did the Nazis \nrespect the Jewish faith? Did Stalin and Pol Pot practice religious \ntolerance? Absolutely not.\n  The detainees are being fed well. In fact, their meals often cost \nmore than the meals served to our troops because of their cultural \ndietary restrictions. When Hitler imprisoned Jews, he did not go to \nlengths to prepare them kosher meals that followed their faith.\n  The military has constructed a hospital for the detainees. While we \nwere there, we saw a detainee being transported to the hospital for an \nexamination. When needed, the terrorists have access to other doctors \nand medical facilities. If a specialist is needed, then one is brought \nin. In other words, we give the terrorists the same medical care our \ntroops get.\n  Many get dental care and glasses for the first time in their lives. \nOthers have been diagnosed with diseases and other medical issues and \nhave received treatment. We have even given amputees new medical limbs.\n  Again, I ask my colleagues, did Hitler and Pol Pot provide dental \ncare to their prisoners before they killed them?\n  And the terrorists are not being held without a review process. Each \nperson brought to Guantanamo is reviewed to make sure they really are \nan enemy combatant. They are also periodically reviewed to make sure \nthey still need to be held at Guantanamo or if they should be moved \nelsewhere or even released.\n  The detainees are given a chance to explain their side of the story. \nInternational law does not require these combatants be given a review \nboard. Our military is going out of its way to give these terrorists \nrights above and beyond the evil regimes the war's critics have cited. \nAfter all, there were not review boards in the gulags or the \nconcentration camps. The Nazis did not care if their prisoners had \ntaken up arms against Germany. They locked them up into slavery anyway.\n  Anyone who compares our operations at Guantanamo to those ruthless \nkillers is lying to the public and insulting our troops. No detainees \nat Guantanamo have died due to their treatment by our troops--none, \nzero.\n  Hitler murdered 6 million Jews and caused the death of tens of \nmillions more on the battlefield. Stalin had tens of millions killed. \nPol Pot was responsible for the death of about 1 million in his \n``killing fields.''\n  Of course, the detainees are not living in luxury. But these are \ndangerous killers we are talking about. They are terrorists. But we \ntreat them with respect, which is much more than they have ever treated \nus with.\n  Conditions improve every day at Guantanamo. But as long as they are \ndangerous to America, we must continue to hold them and gather \ninformation. We have a determined enemy that wants to do nothing but \nharm us. The only way to beat them is to stand strong, fight longer, \nand not back down.\n\n[[Page S7399]]\n\n  What we are doing at Guantanamo is a key part of our fight. These \nterrorists cannot hurt us as long as they are locked up. They will \ncontinue to provide us with valuable intelligence, and we continue to \ntreat them with the dignity they refuse to show us.\n  Finally, Mr. President, I want to say thank you to all the brave men \nand women working for our freedom at Guantanamo and throughout the \nworld. I am always impressed with the fine young Americans in our \nmilitary. And seeing them yesterday was no exception. I had the \nprivilege of meeting a few soldiers from Kentucky while at Guantanamo \nBay. I cannot say their names due to the security reasons we have and \nto ensure their future safety. They, and others, are serving our \ncountry with honor. I thank them and their families for their \nsacrifices.\n  Mr. President, it was an unbelievable experience yesterday in Cuba at \nGuantanamo Bay, one I will remember for the rest of my life.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Idaho is recognized.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Thank you very much, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, I stand and join my colleague, Senator Bunning from \nKentucky. I was one of those who was able to be on this trip to \nGuantanamo yesterday. Along with Senator Isakson from Georgia, we were \njoined there by two other Senators, Senator Wyden from Oregon and also \nSenator Nelson from Nebraska, who came in on a separate trip.\n  We had an opportunity to view exactly what is happening at \nGuantanamo. As I said, I am glad to be able to stand with my colleague, \nSenator Bunning, and set the record straight about what the United \nStates and the honorable men and women of our armed services are doing \nto serve the United States, the people of this country, and, frankly, \nthe people of the world as we fight to defeat terrorism.\n  I want to first thank my colleague, Senator Bunning, who has given a \nvery thorough and helpful review. I will try not to repeat too many of \nthe things he went through, but he has identified the core points that \nneed to be made as we discuss what is truly happening at Guantanamo.\n  I want to start out by going into a little bit of detail about who \nexactly is there. Secondly, I want to talk a little bit about the legal \nframework because, frankly, a lot of the debate we hear throughout the \ncountry and throughout the world today has to do with different points \nof view about the legal framework within which we are dealing with the \ncircumstances at Guantanamo.\n  Then I want to talk about the question of transparency; in other \nwords, do we really know what is happening there? I know there are a \nlot of people who will say: You went there and you visited, but did you \nreally see the truth? I want to talk about that. I also want to talk \nabout what we saw--how are the detainees being treated.\n  Finally, I want to talk about our own troops. What is their morale? \nAnd what is their conduct? And then, actually, the last thing I want to \ntalk about is: Of what benefit to the United States and the world is \nGuantanamo?\n  I am going to go back now and talk, first of all, about who is there. \nI think there has been a bit of a misconception about who it is we are \ndetaining at Guantanamo.\n  Since the effort began in defeating the Taliban in Afghanistan--and \nit has expanded to the war in Iraq--the United States has captured more \nthan 70,000 detainees--70,000--in the conduct of the war in Afghanistan \nand Iraq. Among that number, the vast majority have been handled in \nother ways. Either they have been released or they have been turned \nover to other authorities, other nations, or they are being held in \nfacilities in the area of the battle. But we are working with Iraq, \nAfghanistan, and other governments to make sure they take control of \ndetainees to the maximum extent possible.\n  But there are some detainees who are so dangerous that we have made \nthe decision we must maintain control over them. They are also \ncontrolled because they have information that is critical to us in the \nbattle against terrorism. And after a very thorough vetting process, \nout of 70,000 who have been captured in these battles and in other \nefforts to fight against terrorism, approximately 800 have been moved \nto Guantanamo.\n  My numbers are going to be kind of rounded here, but of that 800, \nabout 235 have already been released or moved into the custody of other \ncountries. My colleague, Senator Bunning, indicated that is not always \ngood news. At least 12 of those who have been released have been found \nagain in the battlefield--some of them killed in battle, others \ncaptured again, and at least one was found to have ordered some very \nsignificant terrorist activities after being released from Guantanamo.\n  But about 235 of the 800 who we determined were so dangerous they \nneeded to be moved to Guantanamo have been released or put into the \ncustody of other countries. Approximately 520 remain at Guantanamo. Who \nare these 520? These are terrorist trainers. These are bomb makers. \nThese are recruiters and facilitators for al-Qaida and other terrorist \ngroups. These are terrorist financiers. These are bodyguards of Osama \nbin Laden. And these are would-be suicide bombers--to name just a few \nof those who we have identified and the activities we are stopping by \nkeeping them detained.\n  I am going to come back a little bit later and talk about what we \nlearn from these detainees. But I would like to talk, next, a little \nbit about some of the details of individuals whom we have identified. \nAn elaborate process has been put into place, as I indicated, to \nidentify whom we will return and take to Guantanamo to assess the \nthreat they pose to the United States and the international community, \nand then to give regular review to this process to be sure they are \nstill the threat that they were and deserve to be kept at the \nGuantanamo base.\n  But as a result of this effort, we have collected the most dangerous, \nand the ones with the most information who can give us the most \nassistance, through the interrogation process, to help us pursue the \nwar against terrorism.\n  These detainees include terrorists who are linked to a major al-Qaida \nattack, including attacks in east Africa, the U.S. Embassy bombings, \nand the USS Cole attack; terrorists who taught or received training \nteams on arms, explosives, surveillance, and interrogation resistance \nat al-Qaida camps in Afghanistan and elsewhere; terrorists who continue \nto express their commitment to kill Americans, if released; terrorists \nwho have sworn personal allegiance to Osama bin Laden; terrorists who \nhave been linked to several al-Qaida operational plans, including \npossible targeting of facilities in the United States; members of al-\nQaida's international terrorism support network including the \nfinanciers, the couriers, the recruiters, and the operatives and those \nwho participated in attempted hijacking instances.\n\n  Let me give a couple specific examples. One al-Qaida explosives \ntrainer is there who has provided information to the United States on \nthe September 2001 assassination of Massoud and on the al-Qaida \norganization's use of mines; another individual who completed advanced \nterrorist training at camps in Afghanistan and participated in an \nattempted hijacking and escaped while in custody that resulted in the \ndeaths of Pakistani guards; another individual who was involved in \nterrorist financing who provided information on Osama bin Laden's front \ncompanies, accounts, and international money movements for financing \nterror. The list goes on and on. This is who is there at Guantanamo. \nThese are the people whom we seek to detain and about whom the debate \nin this country revolves. They are dangerous, and they must be kept \nunder control or they will kill more Americans and threaten people \nthroughout the world.\n  What is the legal framework within which they are being detained? \nThat is the crux, though it is not often stated that way, of the \ndebate. I will get into this in more detail, but Senator Bunning has \nalready indicated, the treatment that is being provided to the \ndetainees is probably the most humane, high quality treatment any \nnation that has ever captured detainees at war has ever provided to its \nprisoners. I suspect no other nation today or throughout history could \nclaim to be treating its detainees better. But still the question \narises, how and under what legal framework should they be handled? \nThere is an irony here. These\n\n[[Page S7400]]\n\ndetainees do not serve in a normal army. They do not wear uniforms. \nThey do not serve a nation that is a signer to the Geneva Conventions. \nThey do not honor Geneva Conventions, meaning they do not refrain from \nattacking civilians and conducting terrorist activities. And because \nthey do not qualify in these categories, they don't qualify under the \nGeneva Conventions as prisoners of war.\n  Here is the irony. If they were prisoners of war, they wouldn't be \nentitled to the legal benefits about which we are now wrangling. They \nwould be entitled to humane treatment, but they would not be entitled \nto get into the court system of the country that has captured them.\n  Many throughout this Nation and throughout the world are saying we \nshould provide all of the legal benefits in a criminal law system, such \nas the criminal justice system in the United States, to these \ndetainees. The United States has declined to do so, stating that these \nare enemy combatants under the Geneva Conventions. But they are not \nprisoners of war under the Geneva Conventions. And there is the irony. \nIf we could classify them as prisoners of war under the Geneva \nConventions, we could avoid the debate about what their rights are and \nhow they should be treated. Instead, since they are not a group \nentitled to participate in the United States criminal justice system \nand are not a group entitled to be considered prisoners of war under \nthe Geneva Conventions, but are instead enemy combatants under the \nGeneva Conventions in a category for which nations have not yet agreed \non how they should be treated, the United States is embroiled in a \ndebate as to how to treat them.\n  How have we resolved this decision? On January 19, 2002, the \nSecretary of Defense gave specific guidance that all detainees are to \nbe treated humanely. On January 21, the same year, the chairman of the \nJoint Chiefs of Staff issued executive orders to commanders that \ntransmitted the Secretary of Defense order that these detainees be \ntreated humanely. On February 7, 2002, President Bush determined that \nal-Qaida and Taliban detainees should be treated humanely, consistent \nwith the principles of the Geneva Conventions and consistent with \nmilitary necessity. The detention of enemy combatants in wartime is not \nan act of punishment. It is a matter of security and military \nnecessity. It prevents enemy combatants from continuing to fight \nagainst the United States or its partners in the war on terror. \nReleasing enemy combatants before the end of hostilities and allowing \nthem to rejoin the fight would only prolong the conflict and endanger \nour coalition and American forces.\n  Here is the point of the debate. The United States, though these \nenemy combatants are in an uncertain category, has provided to them all \nof the humane treatment required by the Geneva Convention and more \nlegal rights than they would have if they were prisoners of war. Yet \nthe United States continues to be criticized because there are those--\nand this is what everyone needs to understand--who will not be \nsatisfied until we choose not to treat these enemy combatants in the \ncontext of a war but instead choose to treat them as criminals in a \ncriminal justice system and thereby change the legal framework under \nwhich they are being handled. The United States correctly and \nproperly refuses to do so. If we were to do so, we would not be able to \ndefend the interests of the country against enemies who are conducting \nwar against us as effectively as we can if we are able to treat them \nunder the Geneva Conventions as enemy combatants. And when you hear the \ndebate about how they are being treated, listen carefully, because most \nof the debate is not about their physical condition or whether they are \nbeing treated humanely. It is about how they are being categorized with \nregard to these legal battles that those who are engaged in the issue \nwish to see ensue.\n\n  Let's talk about what we saw, and then I will describe how they are \nactually physically being treated and whether what we saw is true. I \nhave already had those who knew that I went there ask me whether the \nopportunity we had is one which truly showed us what was happening at \nGuantanamo. To me this is an issue of transparency. What is happening \nthere, and were we shown what was truly going on?\n  First, we visited every facility there. Five Senators, with many \nother individuals with us from other government agencies, went through \nand visited every facility. My colleague Senator Bunning indicated that \nwe even went to Camp X-Ray which has not been utilized for 2 or 3 years \nand which is literally overgrown. I walked into one of the containment \nfacilities there at Camp X-Ray. I had to brush away the weeds in order \nto move through the door and to go in and see what it looked like. We \nvisited Camps 1, 2, 3, and 4. And they are numbered in terms of the \norder in which they were built. These are the newer camps that were \nconstructed to provide better facilities for these detainees than were \noriginally there at Camp X-Ray when we first started using the base. We \nwere able to see the medical facilities. We were able to observe \nliterally everything at the base. And I can say that I don't think it \nwould have been possible for them to have hidden from us what was \nhappening.\n  We were able to observe the interrogations, to interview and discuss \nwith the personnel present what was happening, right down to the troops \nwho were conducting the specific guarding activities inside the cell \nblocks. If that is not sufficient, the International Committee of the \nRed Cross has had 24-hour-a-day, 7-day-a-week access to the facility at \nits discretion. They have had a permanent presence, recently changing \nthat only at their choosing. The media, both national and \ninternational, have had 400 visits to Guantanamo, representing over \n1,000 members of the media who have been there to also observe. Lawyers \nfor the detainees, who would not even be allowed if we categorized them \nas prisoners of war, have come and, in many of the habeas corpus cases, \nto observe and discuss with the detainees. And somewhere in the \nneighborhood of 15 to 20 Senators and 75 to 100 Representatives, in \naddition to over 100 congressional staff, have been there to observe.\n  My point is that in terms of transparency, is the United States \nletting its own people, its Congress, and the world know what is being \ndone there? I believe the answer is clearly yes.\n  My colleague Senator Bunning went through the numbers of deaths in \nthe Nazi concentration camps, in the gulags under Stalin, and the \nnumbers, you will recall, were in the millions. Not one detainee has \ndied at Guantanamo. On the contrary, they have the best medical care \nthat I believe any detainees in history have ever had. So as far as \nthe question goes with regard to whether we are providing a true and \naccurate picture to the public about what is happening there, the \nanswer is unequivocally yes.\n\n  What is happening there? I would like to talk a little bit about what \nwe saw. As I indicated, there are a number of facilities. They are \ncalled Camp 1, 2, 3, and 4. They are building Camp 5 and Camp 6. They \nare different in terms of the levels of security and in terms of the \noperations. Those who are detained there are able to be in one of the \ncamps versus the other camps depending on how they respond to their \ndetention. If they are the more violent kind who do not follow \ninstructions, then they are often in individual confinement. This \nindividual confinement does not mean solitary confinement. It means \nthey would be in a cell block with 40 or 50 others, and you can see \neach other through the cell. These are not enclosed. So they have the \nability to play chess between cells and so forth. They have running \nwater, sinks, and toilets in each cell.\n  They have religious paraphernalia so they can practice their \nreligion. They are facilitated in the practice of that religion by \nbeing provided with prayer calls and with directions. From wherever in \nthe camp you are, you can see an arrow that points toward Mecca so you \nknow the directions. They are provided recreational opportunities, \nshowers, and three, good, solid meals a day, as well as outstanding \nmedical care. Those are the ones who are in the most closely confined \ncircumstances. Those who are more willing to follow instructions and \nless willing to attack their guards are allowed to live in more \ncommunal circumstances where the rooms, instead of being individual \ncell units, are in units where ten or more can live together, and then \nthose groups can go out in recreational facilities and have\n\n[[Page S7401]]\n\na little bit expanded recreational opportunity and the like.\n  Then there is the maximum security facilities which would be \ncomparable to the kinds of similar facilities that are there that you \ncould find anywhere in the United States, in prison facilities that are \nsubject to extensive litigation and oversight by attorneys and our own \njudicial system. Throughout this entire process, whether one is in the \nmost extreme, highest maximum security circumstance or whether one is \nin some of those areas where the more responsible detainees are able to \nbe, they are always provided with the best possible treatment. I don't \nbelieve it would be possible for a valid argument of some type of \nphysical abuse to be made because there is such care there to be \ncertain that even when the detainees are being interrogated--and, by \nthe way, the interrogation is a very humane and, frankly, easygoing \nprocess which does not create physical threat to the detainees--there \nare always more than one or two or three people observing what is \nhappening so there cannot be a circumstance where something goes awry \nand someone abuses the relationship and the situation.\n  Let me talk a little bit about the medical care. I said they are \ngetting top-notch medical care. I asked many of those who we were there \nwith what the comparability would be between the medical care provided \nto these detainees and that provided to detainees by other nations in \nother wars or in other circumstances. Consistently no one could give me \nan example of better medical care ever being provided anywhere. I asked \nif it was equivalent to the kind of medical care that our own troops \nwere being provided. The answer was yes. It is probably better medical \ncare than these detainees have ever had in their lifetime. When they \nwere first brought there, many of them had traumatic injuries from the \nbattles in which they were captured. Those injuries were treated. Now \nthey have reached a point that they have been there several years, some \nof them, where they are being treated for the kinds of problems you and \nI and others would want to have medical care for. They are getting \nannual checkups. They are being treated for diabetes, if they have back \nailments or heart problems, whatever it may be, if they have dietary \nneeds, they are being treated for them.\n  A number of them have lost their limbs, not because they lost them in \nbattle but because they lost them while they were building bombs to \nblow up Americans. And we have provided treatment for their loss of \nlimbs and actually provided them with prosthetics and helped them with \nthe physical therapy so they can regain the use of their bodies to the \nmaximum extent we can help them. We have facilities there to do major \nsurgery. We have all kinds of other support. If they have medical needs \nthat go beyond what we have there available, they are taken elsewhere \nto get that medical treatment.\n  In fact, I would like to move now to the discussion of what the \nmorale of our troops is. I think as we met there with people at all \nlevels, from the guards to those who ran the hospitals to the managers \nto everyone else, I could honestly say the morale of our troops there \nis very high. But there is a concern that was consistently expressed to \nme by them. I had the opportunity to have lunch with some of those who \nwere literally on the front lines having to go into the cell blocks and \nto provide the guard service around the clock with these detainees.\n  And they are concerned about what the American people and the \ninternational public think about them and about what they are doing \nbecause they believe they are treating these detainees with the highest \nrespect and with the most humane treatment possible. They are \noverseeing it rigorously. If any of them steps out of line, they get \nhandled and they get in trouble. Yet they are subjected constantly to \nthreats and harassment and abuse from the detainees.\n  It is my perspective that if anyone is being abused at Guantanamo, it \nis not the detainees, it is the good young men and women guards who are \nthere on the front line, who are themselves physically threatened, \nverbally threatened, and in other ways abused. It has been reported \nwhat kinds of things are thrown at them through the cell blocks as they \nwalk through. When they happen to go through and a detainee throws \nurine or feces on them, they have to go out, be hosed off, and go back \ninto duty. If anyone is being abused at Guantanamo, it is the treatment \nthat is being afforded to our men and women of the military that is \ncausing the abuse to them, rather than the reverse.\n  For those here in this body or anywhere else to accuse our men and \nwomen of mistreating those at Guantanamo is a great irony because any \nabuse or mistreatment that is happening is the reverse.\n  I am proud of our men and women there. They are truly doing a great \nservice for this country and for this world. Let me conclude by talking \na little bit about what that is.\n  By the way, I forgot one piece of information. I have talked about \nthe medical facilities and other kinds of support that have been \nprovided to these detainees to make sure they are being properly cared \nfor. In the newest facilities, the prisoners even get air conditioning, \nwhich is not something most of the troops get, at least during their \nworking hours. But what does that cost us? What kind of investment has \nthe United States made? To this point, the United States has spent over \n$241 million in providing these medical facilities, these containment \nand detention facilities, and for the care and treatment and feeding of \nthese detainees. The annual cost will go on probably at $100 million a \nyear, until we are able to resolve this conflict. The United States has \nalso spent over $140 million in existing or new detention facilities in \nAfghanistan and Iraq. So we are putting a tremendous amount in here.\n  What benefit does it provide to us? As I indicated, the purpose of \nthis detention, to me, is twofold. First of all, it is to stop \ndangerous terrorists from being put back into the field so they can go \nback out and continue to kill Americans and others and train and \nfacilitate other terrorists in doing the same thing. The first thing is \nto stop them from committing terrorist activity. The second purpose is \nto be able to gain from them information that will help us better \npursue or fight against terrorists around the world. The question of \nGuantanamo detainees, which I will again state is not the kind of \ninterrogation that one thinks of when they think of a gulag, or what \nyou might see on TV as a threatening interrogation. This is entirely \nnonthreatening interrogation. It has improved the security of our \nNation and coalition partners by helping us to expand our understanding \nof the operations of the terrorists. It has given us an expanded \nunderstanding of the organizational structure of al-Qaida and other \nterrorist groups. It has given us more knowledge of the extent of the \nterrorist presence in Europe, the United States, and the Middle East. \nIt has given us knowledge of al-Qaida's pursuit of weapons of mass \ndestruction, of methods of recruitment and location of recruitment \ncenters, terrorist skill sets, general and specialized operative \ntraining, and of how legitimate financial activities are being used to \nhide terrorist operations.\n  The intelligence we are gaining by the interrogations of those who \nare kept at Guantanamo has prevented terrorist attacks and has saved \nAmerican lives. Not only has no one died at Guantanamo, not only has \nthe highest health care possible been provided to them, but lives have \nbeen saved as a result of our activities there. Detainees have revealed \nal-Qaida leadership structures and operating funding mechanisms, \ntraining and selection programs, travel patterns, support \ninfrastructure, and plans for attacking the United Sates and other \ncountries. Information has been used by our forces on the battlefield \nto identify significant military and tribal leaders who are engaged in \nor supporting attacks on coalition forces. Detainees have continuously \nprovided information that confirms other reporting regarding the roles \nand intentions of al-Qaida and other terrorist operatives.\n  I could get into details, but I will not do that publicly. The fact \nis, we are getting extensive, detailed information from the terrorists \nwho are kept at Guantanamo, which is saving American lives and helping \nus to protect our young men and women in the military and people in \nother nations.\n\n[[Page S7402]]\n\n  I want to conclude my remarks by coming back to the beginning. There \nhas been a lot of debate about what is going on at Guantanamo. What is \nthe United States doing? Why is it doing it? Is the United States \ncreating some type of a new detention circumstance in modern warfare, \nwhich parallels some of the most terrible examples that our critics \nhave been able to throw up at us? I went down there wanting to know and \nwanting to see and to be able to report back to the American people \nabout what truly is happening.\n\n  What I found was that the U.S. men and women of our Armed Forces are \ncommitted, honorable, loyal, duty-bound members of the American \nmilitary who are following the orders of their Commander in Chief to \nthe letter, following the Geneva Conventions, and providing beyond what \nthe Geneva Conventions even requires in terms of protection to these \ndetainees, in a service to America and to the world. I found a \ncircumstance where I don't believe a valid argument can be made that \nthere is any nonhumane treatment of these detainees. I found a \ncircumstance in which it appears to me that what is being portrayed by \nsome is simply manufactured out of whole cloth in order to perpetuate a \nbroader debate against the United States and our interests.\n  I also became convinced that, far beyond being simply a detention \nfacility, Guantanamo is one of the key strategic interrogation \nfacilities necessary for the United States in pursuit of the war \nagainst terror in this world. As we have said in both of our remarks, \nGuantanamo is where the worst of the worst are taken. They are taken \nthere to be protected so that we can be protected from them and so that \nwe can gain information from them that will help us better protect \nourselves as we continue to fight to defend against the likes of Osama \nbin Laden.\n  I also stand here to commend the young men and women of our fighting \nforces--not just those who at Guantanamo are suffering the abuse of the \ndetainees and the extremes of the weather and the living circumstances \nthere to defend us, but those who serve throughout this world, whether \nit be in Iraq or Afghanistan or any of the other points of conflict or \nin any other of the stations around this world, where we have men and \nwomen deployed to defend our interests.\n  The United States is at war against terrorists and we must \nacknowledge that. The efforts of the men and women in our military \nshould be commended, not discredited. I stand as one Senator to thank \nthe men and women of our Armed Forces for the tremendous job they do. \nThey put their lives on the line daily for us and they should be given \nour thanks, not our criticism.\n  With that, I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Kentucky is recognized.\n  Mr. BUNNING. I thank my colleague from Idaho for his great \nobservation of our trip yesterday. I also know that Senator Isakson was \nunable to be here, but he will make a statement later this evening. I \nhope Senator Ben Nelson and Senator Ron Wyden will also come forward \nand report what they saw at Guantanamo.\n  I am happy to also thank, as Senator Crapo has, all of our men and \nwomen in the military who serve our great country.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burr).

Mr. President, soon after President Bush won reelection \nlast November, he made it clear that the top priority of his second \nterm would be the privatization of Social Security. This is something \nthe President had thought of long before his second term. In fact, when \nhe ran for Congress in the late seventies from Texas, he talked then \nabout the Social Security plan going broke and that it should be \nprivatized. So this is something he has thought of a long time. But \nsince he was elected the second time, he and other members of his \nadministration have organized a massive campaign, given countless \nspeeches, and crisscrossed the country all in an effort to sell the \nAmerican people privatization.\n  It has been a tough sell, though. The polls show that people have \naccepted this whole Social Security agenda about 25 percent. When he \nstarted it was in the 70s. Now it is down to 25 percent. It has been a \ntough sell because the President's privatization proposal is flawed in \nmany ways. It would require deep benefit cuts, even for workers who \ndon't choose to privatize accounts. It would require massive borrowing \nfrom countries such as China, Saudi Arabia, where we borrow about 40 \npercent of the money we borrow for this year's deficit, which will be \nin the hundreds of billions of dollars, probably closer to half a \ntrillion than not. It would turn Social Security from a guarantee into \na gamble. And his privatized accounts would not strengthen Social \nSecurity's finances at all. In fact, it would make the long-term \nchallenge worse, not better. The President has said the privatization \nplan will not stabilize Social Security.\n  It is important to remember that even if we do nothing, which no one \nhere is advocating, Social Security will pay 100 percent of promised \nbenefits until about 2055 and about 80 percent thereafter. In fact, \nPresident Bush will be about 108 years old at the time Social Security \nwould start paying 80 percent of benefits.\n  While claims of a crisis are obviously false, it is also true that we \nface a long-term challenge, and we as Democrats need to address that, \nas we have said we would.\n  Unfortunately, the President has other ideas. His goal is not to \nbolster Social Security. To the contrary, he went all the way to West \nVirginia, arguing that the trust fund is nothing more than an \naccounting fiction. And you can't argue for strengthening something if \nyou don't believe it exists.\n  No, the President's goal isn't to strengthen Social Security. His \ngoal is to privatize it. Privatization, with its deep benefit cuts and \nmassive debt, would undermine Social Security, and as a matter of \nprinciple we Democrats will never go along.\n  Social Security is based on the best of American values. It promises \nAmericans if they work hard, contribute, and play by the rules, they \ncan retire and live in dignity, and their families will be protected if \nthey become disabled or pass away. A third of the benefits paid out by \nSocial Security are not, as my grandmother referred to it, old-age \npensions. They are for people who are disabled, widows, orphans. Social \nSecurity is not a handout. It promises benefits that people earn \nthrough their hard work. That is as it should be, and we need to do \neverything we can to make good on that promise.\n  Fortunately, the American people agree with us. Along with several of \nmy Democratic colleagues, I have traveled the country on behalf of \nSocial Security and against privatization. Everywhere we go, whether \nrural areas, suburban settings, or big cities, the response is the \nsame: Americans don't want Social Security privatized. Middle class \nworkers don't want their benefits cut. They don't want our Nation to \nget even further in debt to the Chinese and Japanese and Saudis. They \ndon't want to adopt a risky scheme that could undermine the retirement \nsecurity they have worked so hard to earn.\n  According to one poll, as I have mentioned, only 25 percent of \nAmericans support the President's handling of Social Security. The \nopposition to privatization is as broad as it is deep. From those \nnumbers, it is very obvious that it is not only Democrats throughout \nthe country who oppose this, Republicans oppose it, also. Most \nAmericans in rural areas who are especially reliant on Social Security \nvoted for President Bush last year, but they strongly oppose his \nprivatization plan. In fact, among those rural residents who know a \ngreat deal about the President's plan, opponents outnumber supporters \nby almost 40 percent.\n  That certainly seems to be the prevailing view among my neighbors at \nhome in Searchlight. Whenever I am home, folks tell me the same thing:\n\n[[Page S7403]]\n\nProtect Social Security and stop privatization. It is a message my \ncolleagues are hearing from their constituents in every part of the \ncountry.\n  Because of this widespread opposition, some here in Washington have \napparently concluded they could not pass this proposal on the Senate \nfloor in an open and public debate. Rather than give up on this \nunpopular proposal, they are, instead, adopting a stealth strategy. It \nhas been widely reported that many in the minority party are now \nseeking to move a bill through the Senate without the private accounts \nor painful benefit cuts included in the President's plan, not because \nthe President has abandoned privatization or benefit cuts but, instead, \nbecause they recognize this is the only means available to them to get \ntheir flawed plan adopted by Congress.\n  Under this bait-and-switch strategy, what the Senate says or does on \nprivate accounts or benefit cuts during its consideration of \nlegislation would be largely irrelevant. The Senate would pass a bill \nlacking private accounts or significant cuts and send it to conference \nwith the House, which would be controlled by a handful of privatization \nsupporters. These supporters would work behind closed doors to ensure \nthat private accounts emerge in the conference report.\n\n  We will not allow that to happen. In recent weeks, we have seen new \nevidence that this is, in fact, the administration's strategy. Last \nweek, for example, bills were introduced in the Senate and the House \nthat were advertised as establishing private accounts with no pain \nwhatsoever. But these proposals are nothing more than political \ngimmicks. In truth, they still would threaten benefits, they still \nwould require massive borrowing from foreign countries, and they would \nstill fail, at one day, Social Security's solvency. In fact, like the \nPresident's plan, the private accounts they propose would make matters \nworse.\n  No one is going to be fooled by this type of gimmickry, and Democrats \nare not naive or foolish enough to fall for a bait-and-switch strategy \nthat has been widely advertised in advance.\n  So I call on the President and his supporters to face reality and \ngive up on privatization. Rather than continuing to push for this \nradical and ideologically driven proposal, which is a buzzword for \ngetting rid of Social Security, I propose they listen to the words of \nanother Republican President from 50 years ago, Dwight D. Eisenhower. \nThis is what General Eisenhower said back then--This is not some \nDemocratic Senator, Democratic Governor, Democratic State legislator, \nor Democratic Member of the Senate. This is President Eisenhower:\n\n       Should any political party attempt to abolish Social \n     Security, unemployment insurance, and eliminate labor laws \n     and farm programs, you would not hear of that party again in \n     our political history. There is a tiny splinter group, of \n     course, that believes you can do all these things. Among them \n     are H.L. Hunt . . . and a few other Texas oil millionaires, \n     and an occasional politician or businessman from other areas. \n     Their number is negligible and they are stupid.\n\n  President Eisenhower.\n  As I have said, I want to make sure these words are not coming from \nme. These are President Eisenhower's words. But if President \nEisenhower's view is not persuasive to our current President, I would \npropose he listen to the words of another Republican President, his \ndad. In 1987, the first President Bush called privatization, ``nutty.'' \nAs he said at the time: ``It may be a new idea, but it's a dumb one.''\n  That is what two Republican Presidents said about privatization. They \nare right.\n  So I hope we can move beyond privatization, move beyond gimmicks, \nmove beyond the attempt to secure private accounts through a \ntransparent strategy of bait and switch. Instead, let's agree to \nstrengthen Social Security and to do it on a bipartisan basis. That \nwould be the right thing to do for America's workers and our country.\n  Is it my understanding the distinguished Senator from Texas wants to \nspeak in time that has been reserved to the minority?\n  Mr. CORNYN. That is correct. I will need about 15 minutes.\n  Mr. REID. I don't think we have anyone coming, so you are sure \nwelcome to use our time.\n  Mr. CORNYN. I thank the distinguished Democratic leader.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

None of the funds made available by this Act may \n     be used to plan, design, study, or construct new forest \n     development roads in the Tongass National Forest for the \n     purpose of harvesting timber by private entities or \n     individuals.\n\n  Mr. SUNUNU. Mr. President, I offer this amendment on my behalf, but \nalso on behalf of Senator Bingaman, and I ask unanimous consent that \nSenators McCain and Feingold be added as cosponsors.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SUNUNU. This amendment is pretty straightforward. It reads very\n\n[[Page S7405]]\n\nsimply: To place a restriction on the use of Federal taxpayer funds to \nbe used to build logging roads in the Tongass National Forest on behalf \nof private companies. This is a case where we need to be very careful \nabout providing Federal subsidies for private corporations.\n  This was a topic of discussion during some of the remarks I made on \nthe Energy bill and I have raised this issue many times in the past. We \nneed to be careful about using Federal resources to provide subsidies \nfor private companies because it distorts the marketplace, promotes \ninefficiencies, and isn't good stewardship of Federal resources.\n  In 2004, the Federal Government, through the Forest Service, spent \nbetween $45 and $50 million building logging roads in this segment of \nthe national forest. They took in roughly $1 million in revenues. I \nwould like to make sure we give the benefit of the doubt any time we \nare spending money. We understand it can have economic impacts, it can \ncreate jobs and the like, but to spend $45 or $50 million on programs \nthat provide $1 million in revenues when there is a timber sale seems \nlike an enormous inequity to me. If you compound these shortfalls over \n20 years, the losses amount to between $750 and $850 million. I don't \nthink this is an appropriate use of Federal resources.\n  I am pleased to offer this amendment with Senator Bingaman. I hope it \nwill restore a little bit of fiscal restraint and balance to this \nInterior appropriations bill. It is important to recognize what this \namendment does not do because, as the debate is carried forward, I want \nto make sure that concerns raised speak to the amendment and not to \nother issues.\n  What this amendment does not do is prohibit logging in the Tongass or \nany other segment of our national forest. It doesn't change policy \nregarding logging in any substantive way. It doesn't curtail uses in \nthe national forest, again, in the Tongass or anywhere else in the \ncountry. I come from a State, New Hampshire, that has a great tradition \nof multiple use in our national forest system--recreational use, \neconomic operations, timber program, hunting, fishing. It is a true \nmultiuse forest. I believe that general approach to our national forest \nmakes the most sense.\n  Finally, this amendment does not restrict the use of private funds to \nbuild logging roads. I don't think that is inappropriate in any way. If \nwe have a timber sale on any segment of the national forest, that \nshould be conducted in an open, transparent way, but the market should \ndictate the attractiveness of a particular cut, the sale of that \ntimber, the pricing, and the like.\n  People who speak to this amendment may well raise concerns about \nregulation, about legal barriers and legal obstacles, about subsidies \nthat other timber concerns in other countries may enjoy. Those are all \nvalid concerns. I have stepped forward to try to address those concerns \nto allow timber management, an important segment of our economy, to \noperate in a fair and reasonable way. But this amendment doesn't \naddress or solve or make worse any of those concerns. Those are issues \nthat we need to continue to address. We should have reasonable \nregulatory processes that are understandable, that allow appropriate \ntimber sales and logging operations to continue on national forest \nland. We should do everything in our power to minimize frivolous \nlawsuits throughout our economy but also those types of frivolous \nlawsuits that might necessarily hinder and raise the cost of the timber \nprogram. And, of course, there are subsidies being provided by other \ncountries. New Hampshire and Canada share a border, and the issue of \nsubsidies in the timber industry--placing operations in the United \nStates at a competitive disadvantage--is something that I have dealt \nwith time and time again.\n  But all this amendment does is say we will no longer use Federal \nfunds to support the building, construction, and planning and \ndevelopment of roads for private entities in the Tongass. When you have \na cost of $45 or $50 million for revenue of just $1 million, you don't \nhave to be an economist to understand why this amendment makes good, \ncommon sense for the taxpayer.\n  I encourage my colleagues to support this legislation. It has been \nendorsed by a number of groups who are looking at this matter from a \npurely fiscal perspective and doing what is right for taxpayers. It \nreflects much more commonsense use of Federal resources.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1029\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                              Carlos Lazo\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, on Friday I brought to the floor a picture \nof a wonderful young soldier. This soldier is a man who fled from Cuba \non a raft in 1992. His name is Carlos Lazo.\n\n[[Page S7406]]\n\n  Sergeant Lazo has not been able to bring his family to this country \nfrom Cuba. He kept in contact with them, visiting them a number of \ntimes under the rules that allow Cuban Americans to visit close \nrelatives in Cuba once a year.\n  In 1998, Carlos joined the National Guard. They were mobilized in \n2003, deployed to Iraq in March of 2004. In June of 2004, Sergeant Lazo \ncame back to the United States from Iraq on a 2-week R He hoped to \nuse that time to make his annual visit to Cuba to see his sons. But \njust before Sergeant Lazo came home on leave, the President announced \nnew regulations that would limit Cuban-American family visits to once \nevery 3 years. Even though Sergeant Lazo got to the Miami airport a day \nbefore the new regulation went into effect, our State Department \nprohibited him from boarding a charter flight to Cuba to visit his \nchildren.\n  Mr. Lazo, in the country of Iraq wearing America's uniform, won the \nBronze Star award. Let me show you the award, the Bronze Star medal \ngiven SPC Carlos Lazo, Charlie Company, 181st Support Battalion, for \nexceptionally meritorious service while serving as a combat medic with \nCharlie Company. It goes on to talk about his heroism and courage. Here \nis an American soldier who went to fight in Iraq because his country \nasked him to fight in Iraq. He was fighting for freedom. This American \nsoldier wins the Bronze Star fighting in Iraq. He comes home to this \ncountry and his young child in Cuba has a very high temperature and is \nin the hospital, quite ill. He wants to go to Cuba to visit his child. \nAfter fighting in Iraq, he is told he doesn't have the freedom to \ntravel to Cuba to see his sick child. He came to see me the other day \nand asked if I could help him because I have been involved in \nlegislation in the Senate dealing with travel to Cuba. I happen to \nbelieve that we ought to treat Cuba just as we do China and Vietnam, \nboth Communist countries. Our official policy is that we will advance \nthe interests of each through engagement. Travel and trade will be \nbeneficial to moving China and Vietnam towards greater human rights. \nBut we believe that is not the case with Cuba because we have clamped \ndown on trips to Cuba.\n  Now a fellow like Carlos, an American soldier who is willing to fight \nin Iraq and wins a Bronze Star, is told, You can't visit your children \nin Cuba except for once every 3 years. Even when your child is ill in a \nhospital, we won't allow you to visit him.\n  He asked the question last week: What about freedom? I was fighting \nfor freedom. I don't have the freedom to go travel 90 miles off the \nshores of Florida to the country of Cuba to see a sick child who is in \nthe hospital?\n  I called the Department of the Treasury, which runs the agency that \nwould provide the licenses, and asked to speak to the Treasury \nSecretary. He didn't return the call.\n  I called the State Department, asked for Condoleezza Rice. She didn't \nreturn my call. As an aside, I would observe that she was happy to \nreturn my call when she was up for confirmation on the floor of the \nSenate to be the Secretary of State. But she didn't return my call this \ntime. At any rate, her Deputy, Mr. Zoellick, returned the call. I have \ngreat admiration for him so I was pleased to talk to him.\n  I also called the White House and talked to Karl Rove on Friday \nafternoon. I just got a call back from the White House saying that Mr. \nRove will not be contacting me today. In fact, Mr. Zoellick will be \nhandling this. I have not yet heard from Mr. Zoellick, but he indicated \nhe would be getting back to me.\n  When I talked to the Treasury Department, they said: The regulations \nthat came into effect that President Bush has announced provide no \nhumanitarian relief at all.\n  It means that you can't travel to Cuba except once every 3 years to \nsee your family.\n  I said: Surely there must be some humanitarian exceptions to that. \nThis guy wins the Bronze Star fighting for this country, and he doesn't \nhave the freedom to go visit a sick kid?\n  They said: There are no exceptions. We have people calling us saying: \nMy mother is dying in Cuba. I need to go see her. We tell them no \nbecause there are no exceptions.\n  I said what on Earth are you thinking about? You created the \nregulation. Don't tell me the regulations prevent you from doing the \nright thing. You created them; change them. So here it is, on Monday \nafternoon, this Sergeant Lazo--Carlos Lazo--still asks the question: \nWhy, when I fought in Iraq, demonstrated courage under battlefield \nconditions, won a Bronze Star, do I come home and find I don't have the \nfreedom to visit my sick child 90 miles away from the shores of \nAmerica?\n  That is unbelievable. Not surprising to me, but unbelievable.\n  I will show you a picture of another young woman who visited my \noffice. This is Joan Scott. Joan went to Cuba, but she didn't get \npermission. She didn't know she had to get permission. She went to Cuba \nbecause she wanted to distribute free Bibles. She took a supply of \nBibles and went to Cuba to distribute them. Guess what this Government \ndid. They tracked her down and slapped a $10,000 fine on her. Why? She \ndidn't have a license to go to Cuba.\n  Fidel Castro has been sticking his finger in our eye for many years. \nBut if we think we are slapping him around by restricting the rights of \nthe American people to travel there, we are seriously mistaken.\n  The quickest way to get Castro out of office in Cuba--and he has \nlived through 10 Presidencies--is through trade and travel, just as we \ndo with China and South Vietnam, both of which are also Communist \ncountries. Trade and travel will rapidly advance the day in which Cuba \nwill have a new government. To penalize and punish American citizens--\nsomeone who wants to distribute free Bibles in Cuba, or someone who \nwants to take his father's ashes with his last request to distribute \nhis ashes on the grounds of a church he once ministered in in Cuba, to \npunish these people--and this Government is doing that--is \nunbelievable.\n  In this case, it is Sergeant Lazo who is penalized. So this Monday \nafternoon he waits and I wait. Will I get a call from the State \nDepartment saying, No, our rules in America are that you can fight for \nAmerica and for freedom, but you don't have the freedom to go see a \nsick kid? If that is the result, that is unbelievable.\n  Mr. President, we will see if I get a telephone call this afternoon. \nIf they don't find a humanitarian way to provide exceptions, not just \nfor Sergeant Lazo but for someone whose father or mother is dying and \nthey need to go to Cuba, then we are going to vote on that on this \nappropriations bill. Yes, it will take a suspension and it will take a \ntwo-thirds vote. But we will see who wants to stand up for the \ninterests of a young soldier who was willing to fight and die for this \ncountry but doesn't have the freedom to go see his sick son. We will \nsee who is willing to stand up for his interests and the interests of \nthe basic proposition that you ought to be free to travel. We will see \nat the end of today.\n  I say, again, I fully intend to offer an amendment to this bill, and \nit will require suspension of the rules, but I will offer that and ask \nmy colleagues to vote on it.\n  Mr. President, there is more to say, but I will reserve that until I \nget a call from the State Department today telling us what they have \ndecided to do.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1032\n\n  Mr. DORGAN.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                        Waste, Fraud, and Abuse\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I have spent the last nearly 2 hours prior \nto coming to the floor chairing a hearing of the Democratic Policy \nCommittee on waste, fraud, and abuse, dealing with the Halliburton \nCorporation with respect to contracting in Iraq. I don't--along with my \ncolleagues who joined me--take pleasure at holding hearings to expose \nwaste and abuse and, I think, fraud. We do it because the authorizing \ncommittees in this Congress have decided they are not interested in \nhaving these kinds of hearings.\n  Let me just give you some idea of what we have learned at the five \nhearings that I have held on this subject. Today, at the hearing, an \nemployee of Halliburton who was providing food service in a portion of \nIraq to our troops, said something to me that was almost unbelievable. \nHe said they were routinely serving food to American troops that had \noutdated stamps on it. When you go to the grocery store, you see that \nfood is going to be good through a certain date. They were getting that \nkind of food that was out of date and serving it to American soldiers.\n  I understand greed because we see enough of it in some of these \ncircumstances at these hearings. I don't understand the shameful \nbehavior of somebody who is charging this Government for feeding our \ntroops, and then would feed our troops food that is date stamped out of \ndate. The Halliburton Corporation, by the way, said that it was feeding \n42,000 troops a day in one contract, and it turns out that only 14,000 \nwere eating. They were charging for 28,000 meals they were not serving. \nNow we discover, more than that--more than charging for 42,000 meals \nwhen only serving 14,000 meals--they were serving food that was out of \ndate to American soldiers. That is unbelievable to me.\n  We send these soldiers to a war zone and we contracted that company \nto feed them, and they feed them food that is date stamped out of date. \nNobody wants to investigate these things. No hearings. It is eerily \nquiet here. Normally, when you see fraud, waste, and abuse, we have \npeople who are interested in investigating that and putting a stop to \nit right now. We have heard so many tales of waste, fraud, and abuse.\n  Halliburton orders 50,000 pounds of nails that are the wrong size, so \nthey are laying on the sand in Iraq. Just another bit of waste. It is \n$40 for a case of pop or soda and $7,000 a month to lease SUVs. There \nare $85,000 trucks that are abandoned on the roads and are torched \nbecause they had a flat tire or a plugged fuel pump. These are all \nstories we have heard at our hearings, which the authorizing committees \nwon't have. They have been asked to have them, but they will not. I \nhave chaired five hearings--because they won't--on these issues. It \ndoesn't serve American troops. It disserves American troops to allow \nthis sort of thing to happen.\n  When we get involved in circumstances where our country has an \nobligation to the troops we ask to go into harm's way, we have a \nresponsibility to make sure there is not corruption and looting and \nthieving going on.\n  We had a woman testify today, Bunnatine Greenhouse. She was the \nhighest civilian official in the Pentagon dealing with Corps of \nEngineer projects. She was called in at one point and told: Either you \ncan retire or you are going to be demoted. We are not putting up with \nyour objections anymore.\n  She was objecting to sole-source contracts being given to \nHalliburton--no bids. What is the result of that? Headline after \nheadline about waste and fraud. Here is what she said today:\n\n       I can unequivocally state that the abuse related to \n     contracts awarded to KBR [a subsidiary of Halliburton] \n     represents the most blatant and improper contract abuse I \n     have witnessed during the course of my professional career.\n\n  By the way, she had a meeting last week with the acting general \ncounsel, I believe, of the Corps of Engineers, and she was told that it \nwould not be in her best interest to speak publicly about these things. \nSurprise, surprise. Don't worry so much about the waste or the fraud or \nthe abuse; worry about the people who are going to speak up, who have \nthe courage to step out and say here is what is going on, and I am \nwilling to risk my career to talk about it.\n  Good for this woman. It took courage for her to come forward today. \nShe was one of the top senior officials in that whole pyramid. The old \nboys just worked around her and worked their will so they could give \ncontracts worth billions and billions of dollars to one company--\nHalliburton--and then later to some others, but basically Halliburton.\n  Then we hear from a witness named Rory, who worked in the food \nfacilities in Iraq, that Halliburton was routinely serving out-of-date \nfood to American troops. I thought there wasn't much more that could \nshock me after having my fifth hearing on this, but there is.\n  I just say this to the authorizing committees: The minute you decide \nto do the kinds of accountability and oversight hearings Congress is \nsupposed to do, I will not hold any more hearings. It was in 1941 when \na Senator on the floor of the Senate, named Harry Truman, with a \nDemocratic President in the White House, initiated a series of hearings \nthat ended up being hundreds of hearings. They documented massive \namounts of fraud in defense contracting during a war. It probably \nwasn't pleasant for a Democratic President to have a Democratic Senator \nchallenging them on what was going on with respect to waste, fraud, and \nabuse, but Harry Truman did it.\n\n  Now we have a Republican President, a Republican-controlled Congress, \nsubstantial waste, fraud, and abuse, and nobody wants to hold hearings \nbecause they are worried it will embarrass somebody. This isn't about \nembarrassing anybody; it is about standing up for the interests of the \nAmerican taxpayer, for the interests of the American troops, and \ndeciding that during war it is unconscionable for people to profiteer, \nand for companies to cheat and defraud the Federal Government.\n  Unfortunately, these days, when you read the headlines and the audit \nreports, you discover that what this is all about is a slap on the \nwrist, a pat on the back, and then a continuation of the buddy system.\n  A fellow who testified today with respect to the food service in Iraq \nsaid that when Government auditors came, they were told: You are not to \nbe available to speak to Government auditors. And they were told this: \nIf you are caught speaking to a Government auditor, one of two things \nwill happen. Either, A, you will be fired or, B, you will be sent to a \nbase where there is active fighting. It's your choice.\n  I could not believe that. He said it again. He said it a second time. \nWhen Government auditors came to audit the Halliburton food contracts, \nthey were ordered not to speak to the auditors, ordered not to respond \nto auditors' questions, ordered not to be available. And if they were \ncaught answering questions of auditors, they would either be sent to a \nbase where there was active fighting, or they would be fired. So that \nis some of what is going on.\n  The question is, Does anybody care? Will they, after 2 years of our \nholding five straight hearings now--when I say ``they,'' I mean the \nauthorizing committees--perhaps begin to hold hearings themselves? \nWould it be embarrassing to ask that committees to do what they are \nsupposed to do--provide oversight? When you have $10 billion or $12 \nbillion lining the pockets of big contractors whose documented abuse of \nthat money is legend--don't take it from me, take it from the facts \nthat are on the record--will the committees of the Congress do what \nthey have a responsibility to do? We will see.\n  I wanted to point out that this afternoon was spent by me--at least \nfrom 1:30 and for the first 2 hours--listening to things that I find \nshameful with respect to practices by some companies--notably \nHalliburton--in the country of Iraq, profiteering during a war.\n\n[[Page S7408]]\n\n  Mr. President, the last time we held a hearing dealing with Iraq, we \nhad one of the people there hold up a towel, and he said: My job was to \nbuy towels, among other things. I was a procurement agent. I was to buy \ntowels--the hand towels you would use in the bathroom in the morning.\n  He showed us the hand towel he was going to buy, and then he showed \nus the one he did buy. The one he did buy had a logo of the company on \nit--the contracting company. The contracting company wanted him to buy \na higher priced towel, a more expensive towel, so they could put their \nlogo on it. Waste of the money? I think so. It is unbelievable when you \nsee all that is going on and nobody is minding the store.\n\n  I hope perhaps one day this Congress, in a deep slumber about \naccountability and oversight responsibilities, will wake up and do what \nit is required to do. At that point, we will no longer have to do \nhearings in our policy committee. Until that point, however, we intend \nto continue such hearings.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak in \nmorning business for 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                  Corporation for Public Broadcasting\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, there has been quite a controversy \ndeveloping in recent weeks about the Corporation for Public \nBroadcasting. I have spoken on the Senate floor a couple of times about \nthe subject, and I wish to address it now, particularly because of \nactions that were taken last week.\n  The Corporation for Public Broadcasting has a Board of Directors that \nis headed by a Mr. Kenneth Tomlinson. Mr. Tomlinson decided to take it \nupon himself to describe public broadcasting as having a liberal bias. \nBecause it has a liberal bias, according to the Chairman of the Board \nof Directors, appointed by President Bush, he hired a consultant, a \nfellow who had worked for 20 years at a journalism center founded by \nthe American Conservative Union. He hired a consultant for just over \n$14,000 without the knowledge of the Board of Directors to evaluate \nparticularly programming by the Bill Moyers show called ``Now.'' The \nInspector General at the Corporation for Public Broadcasting is now \ninvestigating that expenditure of money.\n  It is curious to me that the American people, by a wide margin, \nbelieve that public television and public radio, National Public Radio, \nfor example, and PBS, is not biased, is good information, provides good \nprogramming, balanced programming, and yet the Chairman of the Board, \nwho is partisan, has made it his cause to tell the American people \nthere is a liberal bias in public broadcasting over television and \nradio on NPR and so on.\n  Most of us, of course, know public television by Big Bird, Ernie, the \nCookie Monster, the Count, Grover. I was thinking, when I have heard \nthe discussions about public broadcasting by the Chairman of the Board, \nMr. Tomlinson, I was thinking of Oscar the Grouch, who complains about \neverything. I would not take the analogy so far because Oscar the \nGrouch lives in a trash can, but every time he peeks his head out \nsomething is wrong. He complains about everything, Oscar the Grouch.\n  Well, maybe we have an Oscar the Grouch running the Corporation for \nPublic Broadcasting. After all, he is a partisan who has decided to \nallege that there is a partisan and liberal bias at the Corporation for \nPublic Broadcasting. Then he hires a conservative to do an evaluation \nof that.\n  When he did that with public funding, I asked Mr. Tomlinson, by \nletter, to provide me the information gleaned from this consultant. He \nthen sent me the raw data, which was many pages of raw information. I \nhave described that on the Senate floor. I will not do that again. He \ntold me that it was not a summary but he was completing a summary. I \nhave now been given the summary in the last couple of days--I believe \nlast Friday.\n  In the intervening period, Chairman Tomlinson also decided that his \ncandidate to become President of the Corporation for Public \nBroadcasting, a position that was open, should be assumed by a former \nCo-Chair of the Republican National Committee. Over the objections of \nsome members of the Board of Directors, he made that happen last week. \nSo the former Co-Chair of the Republican National Committee is now \ngoing to become the President of the Corporation for Public \nBroadcasting, an organization that the Chairman of the Board of the \nCorporation for Public Broadcasting alleges has a liberal bias. He \nbelieves that it is political or partisan; therefore, he brings in a \npartisan.\n  If a former co-chair of the Democratic National Committee had been \nhired, I assume there would be a howl that one could hear all the way \nto West Virginia coming from this Chamber and the Chamber across the \nhall because they would say: You are politicizing the Corporation for \nPublic Broadcasting. Regrettably, that is exactly what Mr. Tomlinson is \ndoing by hiring a former Co-Chair of the Republican National Committee.\n\n  Public broadcasting does a real service in this country. There are \nsome stories no other broadcasters will do. Do my colleagues think that \nABC, CBS, NBC, or FOX will ever do a no holds barred, in-depth story \nabout concentration in the media and about the rules that the Federal \nCommunications Commission tried to foist on this country that would \nallow further concentration until they were stopped by the Federal \ncourts? Do my colleagues think that would ever be dealt with by the \nmajor television networks? Not on your life because they are all making \nmoney consolidating.\n  The Federal Communications Commission came up with a goofy rule--one \nthat, in my judgment, subverts the interests of the American people--\nand said it will be all right if in one major American city one company \nowns eight radio stations, three television stations, the dominant \nnewspaper, and the cable company. That is just fine, according to the \nFederal Communications Commission. Well, it is not fine with me. That \nwas the quickest and biggest cave-in to the special interests I have \never seen in my life, and the Federal court has at this point stopped \nit.\n  Guess who did the in-depth reporting, the hard-hitting reporting on \nthe concentration of corporate interests in broadcasting. Was it CBS, \nNBC, ABC, FOX News? No, not on your life. They would not touch it \nbecause they make money continuing the concentration. It was public \nbroadcasting. It was Bill Moyers. For that, he pays a price. The price \nhe pays: Mr. Tomlinson and others accuse him of going astray, a liberal \nbias.\n  When I looked at the papers I was given that represent the raw data \nfrom the consultant, some of the listings evaluated programming on \npublic broadcasting as either anti-Bush or pro-Bush. Is that what we \nare going to do in this country--run our evaluation of whether \nsomething is fair through a prism of whether it supports our President, \nwhoever our President is? Is that the way one would have wanted to \nevaluate public broadcasting when President Clinton was in office--\nanti-Clinton, pro-Clinton? I do not think so. That is not the way we \nhave a responsibility to evaluate these things.\n  This country is still a democracy, a free country. It is not \nunpatriotic to be critical of our Government. In the case of the FCC \nrules, that would allow massive concentration of broadcasting \nproperties so that only four or five people will determine what the \nAmerican people by and large will see, hear, and read. When that \nhappens, when the FCC tries to do that, it is not unpatriotic to raise \nquestions and do in-depth reporting and do tough reporting on it. There \nis nothing unpatriotic about that.\n  So the selection of the former Co-Chair of the Republican National \nCommittee to be President of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting is \na step that will injure public broadcasting. The board members who \nobjected have told me that they felt the process for the selection of \nthe chairman was not fair, and I intend to ask the Inspector General to \ninclude that question in the\n\n[[Page S7409]]\n\ninvestigation that is now ongoing about the use of funds for the \nconsultant.\n  I believe most of us, Republicans, Democrats, and Independents, \nshould care about retaining a strengthened and important public \nbroadcasting system in this country. Big Bird is not a Republican or a \nDemocrat, nor is the Cookie Monster. This is just good programming. It \ndoes a disservice to the interests of public broadcasting in this \ncountry to begin to undermine it by demanding that there is a liberal \nbias, by hiring consultants who themselves come from a conservative \nbackground with which to make a judgment of whether things are anti- or \npro-Bush in public programming, and then to engineer the hiring of the \nformer Co-Chair of the Republican National Committee as President of \nthe Corporation for Public Broadcasting. All of that moves us in the \ndirection that injures something very important to this country. My \nhope is at some point we will be able to see progress in putting this \nback together. But there is no question that substantial damage has \nbeen done to public broadcasting in recent weeks and that damage is \nbecause of leadership insisting that public broadcasting itself is \nflawed and is at fault.\n\n  I disagree with that. I think the problem is not public broadcasting; \nI think the problem has been the leadership of the Corporation for \nPublic Broadcasting and the engineering of not only a known partisan to \nbecome president but also a partisan to do an evaluation that was \ndestined to show what the Chairman of CPB was alleging.\n  Again I take no pleasure in coming to the floor to be critical of Mr. \nTomlinson, but after what I have read from the consulting report that \nis now being investigated, frankly, I think there is a need to speak up \nand a need to decide that public broadcasting is important to this \ncountry and worth saving and won't be saved by those who want to drag \nit into the partisan waters.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor. I make a point of order that a \nquorum is not present.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1035\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. On behalf of my colleague Senator Wyden, I propose an \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

What is the number of Senator Sununu's amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Senator Sununu's amendment is 1026.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I have come to the floor to briefly discuss this \namendment that has been offered by the Senator from New Hampshire and \nothers and tell the Senate this is opening the door to a whole series \nof agreements that were made in previous Congresses and approved by the \nPresident, and it is a subject I intend to debate at length. I will \ntell the Senate a little bit of history tonight and take an opportunity \nto more subsequently discuss this issue.\n  This amendment that has been offered will prevent the use of Federal \nfunds to plan, design, study, or construct new forest development roads \nin the Tongass. The Tongass National Forest is our largest national \nforest. It has a southern division and a northern division. When I came \nto the Senate, the harvest level was about 1.5 billion board feet a \nyear from the total Tongass. In subsequent years it has been under \nattack severely, until today I think it is less than 17 percent of the \nTongass is available for harvesting timber.\n  This amendment discriminates against Alaska. There are national \nforests in many States and the Forest Service spends a lot of money on \nforest roads, but this would say that only in Alaska can the Forest \nService be prohibited from spending money for forest roads.\n  Let me go back a little bit in the history. I am gathering the \ninformation we need to address the matter in depth tomorrow and \nsubsequently. This area is not unique in the sense of timber harvest. \nThe Forest Service follows about the same regulations in Alaska they \nwould in any other national forest. The difference is that we had, in \n1980, the Alaskan National Interests Conservation Land Act which \nwithdrew a great portion of this forest from any future harvesting of \ntimber; then after that we had the Tongass Timber Reform Act which \nfurther limited the amount that could be harvested from the Tongass; \nand then we had the enormous dispute over roads in the Tongass. This is \nanother way to limit the development of Alaska's timber because of the \npolicies of our national Government with regard to harvesting the \nnational forests.\n  The debate over forest roads also has included the question of the \nprovisions\n\n[[Page S7410]]\n\nin the 1980 act which prohibited any further withdrawal of Alaska's \nlands without prior approval of the Congress. This is an amendment that \nlooks as if there is an economic concept involved, but really it is one \nof the goals of those who want to limit further use of the Tongass to \nproduce timber.\n  Regarding the roadless concept, they tried to apply it to our \nnational forests, the Tongass National Forest. Because of the \nprovisions in the 1980 act which prohibit further withdrawals of \nAlaska's land without prior approval of the Congress, that concept did \nnot get applied to the Tongass. The last President did issue an \nExecutive order which purported to change that, but that has been \nrescinded as that was an error on the part of the last administration. \nWe are operating under the basis that there could be roads built in the \nportions of the Tongass that have not been withdrawn.\n  The problem is this: The cost of developing roads in Alaska are \ndifferent from other States. In most States, there is a road \ninfrastructure in the area that surrounds the national forest. As a \nmatter of fact, most national forests have a Federal highway going \nright through them. Southeast Alaska has no roads. It is an island \ncommunity. There is no connection between those islands. There is no \nattempt to build a highway system in southeast Alaska. As a matter of \nfact, our capital city has no roads that can be used to enter Juneau \nfrom another area. I think it is the only capital you can reach only by \nboat or air. There is no way to drive to our capital because it is on \none of the islands I am talking about.\n  When we look at the situation of southeast Alaska, we have to realize \none of the costs of developing a timber industry in southeast Alaska is \nbuilding roads on islands on which there are no roads. They are \ntemporary roads built under specification of the Forest Service and \ndesigned to become wilderness, in effect, once the regrowth is \ncommenced.\n  What I am saying is, once the timber is harvested, the natural \nproduct of what we call the ``slash'' that comes from developing and \ncutting the timber is laid across the ground, and within a very few \nyears that area will be totally grown over again. In most instances, we \nwill not find the roads because they have been eliminated by regrowth. \nI invite everyone to take a look at Admiralty Island, across from \nJuneau. That at one time was cut for timber and now is regrown to such \nan extent that it has been named a wilderness area. It is the only area \nin the country that is a wilderness area despite the fact that its \ntimber was once cut.\n  As we get the information I am seeking from the Forest Service and \nfrom other agencies, I want to demonstrate to the Senate that the only \nway to be able to harvest the timber we are entitled to harvest is to \nfollow the process the Forest Service itself has selected; that is, \nthat it build the forest roads. As it selects an area for timber \nharvest, it will build the roads, and the purchaser of the timber will \nagree to pay the cost of those roads as part of the cost of the \ncontract to harvest the timber.\n  As time has passed and many of our areas have been selected for \nharvest in the area set aside for timber production now--I remind the \nSenate that well over three-fourths of the Tongass has been set aside \nas national parks, wild and scenic rivers, forest wilderness, and is \nnot available for any kind of timber harvest. In the areas where it was \nagreed timber harvests would be permitted, the Forest Service builds \nthese roads and uses the funds we appropriate for that purpose, and \nthose funds are repaid by the person who harvests the timber.\n  As time has passed, the challenges from the environmental \norganizations of the country, the environmental costs, the \nenvironmental impact statements, and often-repeated environmental \nimpact statements, have added up to the fact that some assert that this \nis not a profitable endeavor, for the Federal Government to allow \ntimber to be harvested in the Tongass. But they forget--and that is why \nI am here--they forget there was an understanding and a commitment that \na portion of this area would be available for timber harvest. That is \none of the local products that is a renewable resource. The cutting \ncycle in our timber area is over 100 years. It means an area harvested \nthis year will not be put up for sale for 100 years. Under the \ncircumstances, to have a provision that says the roads that are to be \nbuilt would be built by an individual in advance of getting a contract \nfor timber harvesting means that great speculation would enter into \nthis industry.\n  It would also mean that the decision would be made by nonresidents of \nthe area, speculators. Currently our logging industry is a local \nindustry. They are small logging companies. They log small areas on the \nislands at a competitive bid to obtain the right to harvest that \ntimber. This is not a case of wasting Federal money.\n  Those who are approaching it from the point of view, saying the \nFederal Government should not spend this money, do not realize the best \nway to develop this timber industry was to have roads built by a \nFederal agency, designed by a Federal agency, and constructed for the \nsafety not only of the people who are going to be working in the area \nbut also for the protection of other resources such as the fish and \nwildlife resources of the area.\n  The problem for a person who wants to harvest this area is \noverwhelming if they have to make the decision of where the road should \ngo because there is so much inter-Federal-agency consultation going \ninto the harvests, these roads for timber harvest, that it would be \nalmost impossible for a private sector person to be able to get to the \npoint where there would be approval for the location of the road. The \ndesign is determined by the Federal Government, the location is \ndetermined by the Federal Government, the safety features are \ndetermined by the Federal Government, and the purchaser of the timber \nhas agreed to pay the costs.\n\n  The way it is done right now is in the best way, in the interests of \nthe environment, and the interest of the people of the area. Once the \nroads are built, it is possible for the local people to be able to bid \nto harvest the timber and to make it available to the international \ncommunity. By Federal law, we do not export this timber. It must be \nsold in the United States. This is from Federal land, and therefore is \nsubject to the Federal law that prohibits the export of this timber.\n  It is a forest product that would be worth a great deal more if it \ncould be exported. But it is not. Some of the Native-owned timber is \nexported, but the timber from the Federal lands is not exported.\n  The main reason I am here is to ask the Senate to think about this. \nThis is a provision that applies only in the Tongass National Forest of \nAlaska. Why not the rest of the country? Why not the forests in New \nHampshire? There is a forest in New Hampshire. What about the forests \nof other areas of the country? I am considering offering a second-\ndegree amendment--I understand second-degree amendments will be in \norder and are in order--to apply it to the whole country.\n  Above all, what about the commitment made to Alaska when so much of \nAlaska was withdrawn? In 1980, the law that was passed we called the \nAlaska National Interests Land Conservation Act which withdrew over 100 \nmillion acres. That was a hard-fought battle that lasted 7 years in \nthis Senate. We finally reached a conclusion that many of my \nconstituents disagreed with, that in order to go forward with our \neconomy and in order to go forward with our relationship with the \nFederal Government, we agreed to that act. It became law despite the \nfact that so many people disagreed with it because it did have some \ncommitments to Alaska. This is one of the commitments, that the areas \nthat were not set aside would be subject to harvest by the timber \nindustry under the concepts that existed at the time.\n  Now if we come along and change those concepts and say you cannot use \nFederal funds in the beginning, it means we will have to go back and \nfashion a basic Federal law that deals with the investment of private \nfunds in those roads before the decision has been made--it is almost \nimpossible for anyone to conceive building roads in an area before the \nfinal decision has been made that the timber can be harvested. The \ndecision used to be made just by the Forest Service, but it is made by \nthe courts now. Every single sale has gone to court repeatedly.\n  Two years ago, I had an amendment to limit the amount of time that \ncould\n\n[[Page S7411]]\n\nbe taken in those appeals. That is an issue that needs to be examined. \nBut very clearly, the concept of using this approach that none of the \nfunds available in this act may be used for the development of the \nthese roads is another way to make the area wilderness. This is a \nwilderness bill. This is not an economic amendment. This is an \namendment to assure that the commitment was made to us that a portion \nof the timber in the Tongass could be harvested. This will be reneging \non that commitment.\n  There is no way now for us to proceed with this type of road \nconstruction until we identify the purchaser of the timber, and there \nis no way really to get to the point of purchasing the timber until the \nroads are created. There are no roads available in the area except the \nones to be constructed by the logging company that will cut the timber.\n  I am sure the sponsors of this amendment do not realize what they are \nsetting in motion. They are setting in motion a total block to \ndevelopment of the Tongass and a total reneging on the commitment that \nwas made to our State that timber in this area would be subject to \nharvest.\n  I hope to have an amendment that will make this apply to the whole \ncountry.\n  I also have an amendment that I would want the Senate to consider, \nand that is that there should be a study made of the developing of \nthese roads in the forest system, and that there be a report on a new \nprocess to develop roads in the units of the National Forest System if \nwe are not to use Federal funds to build the roads.\n  Again I say, from the point of view of safety, from the point of view \nof consistency as far as environmental protection, having the Forest \nService build the roads in the areas that they agree to be available \nfor timber harvesting is the best way we have devised so far. This \nconcept, if it is to be studied, it ought to be studied throughout the \nwhole National Forest Service System, not just my State, not just our \nState.\n  I do think there is a great deal more to this debate that needs to be \nbrought up to the Senate. But above all, people have asked: Why don't \nwe just have a vote? The main reason is I think there are Senators here \nwho really do not know the history of the development of this \nrelationship between Alaska and the Federal Government with regard to \nthe resources of our State.\n  If you look at the 1980 act that withdrew over 100 million acres, you \nwill find that because of those withdrawals you cannot build a north-\nsouth road in Alaska. You cannot build an east-west road in Alaska. \nThere is no way to get through the various passes and across the rivers \nwhere you should be able to do it because withdrawals were made for \nnational parks, wild and scenic rivers. There are a whole category of \nwithdrawals to prevent that kind of development.\n  There actually was a Senator on the floor of the Senate at one time \nwho said our whole State should be made a national park and we should \nnot be allowed to develop any portion of it. Our State is one-fifth the \nsize of the United States. It is as big as at least 20 of the 48 States \nof what we call the South 48.\n  We are entitled to a lifestyle. We are entitled to be treated as a \nState. We fought long and hard to become a State. What we are seeing \nhere is this inching away from being treated as a State. This amendment \nonly applies to Alaska. Of all the units of the forest system in the \nUnited States, it would only apply to Alaska. I think that type of \ndiscrimination should be reason enough for any Senator to vote against \nthis amendment.\n  But above all, I do hope the Senate will take time with us. My \ncolleague, Senator Murkowski, will be with me tomorrow, and we will \ndiscuss this amendment at length.\n  Right now, I just have to express my deep disappointment in an \namendment of this type. I cannot conceive of offering an amendment to \ndiscriminate against another State. We sought to become a member of \nthis Union because we thought we would be equal to other States. We \nhave witnessed, time and time again, this attitude of people from other \nparts of the country that we are not entitled to the same rights as \nother Americans in terms of our relationship to the Federal Government.\n  I think this is an area that needs examination. And it needs \nunderstanding. I cannot recall since I have been here holding up an \nappropriations bill. This one I do think is going to be held up. I want \nthe Senate to know that I have a whole series of amendments that will \nbe offered to this amendment. I do not take lightly the attack on our \nState, a discriminatory attack on Alaska.\n  There are few Senators who have been privileged to be part of a \nbattle for statehood for their State who end up on the floor of the \nSenate. I think one of my duties as a Senator for Alaska is to see to \nit that we are not discriminated against. And this is a discriminatory \namendment, one that really disturbs me, as I have indicated, greatly. I \ndo hope those who come from States that have national forests will \nexamine the practices in their States.\n  One of the strange things about this is we have inquired from the \nForest Service about the money they are spending for roads in each of \nthe forests. The way they handle the money, it is not too easy to find \nout how much money is being spent in each of the forests.\n  But clearly we know there are forest roads being built in the \nnational forests in other States. I believe the Senate should \nunderstand the gravity of this kind of discrimination against my State.\n  I am not offering these amendments yet because I want to confer with \nmy colleague who went home this past weekend since there are no votes \ntoday. I will be here tomorrow to try to explain further our \namendments. But I do want to explain to my friends who are the managers \nof this bill, I hope they will not become overly disturbed with us. But \nwe want to find some way to convince the Senate not to discriminate \nagainst our State. If there is some change that should be made to \nforest roads, it should apply to all forests. And if there is some \nconcept of making a decision with regard to the economics of this \naspect of this, let's decide what to do with the Forest Service \naltogether, not just the Forest Service that applies to Alaska.\n  I close with what I started. Last year, I think we harvested less \nthan 200 million board feet of timber, less than one-seventh of what \nwas harvested the year I came to the Senate. Successive Congresses have \nfound ways to whittle away, whittle away, whittle away at our ability \nto use the resources of our State. I think this is a time to ask the \nSenate to pause and consider that.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. SALAZAR.

Mr. President, I want to just spend a few quick minutes \nspeaking about both of these amendments. The first amendment is an \namendment relating to the payment in lieu of taxes.\n  For those of us who come from the West, where so much of our land is \nowned by the Federal Government, payment in lieu of taxes is essential \nfor our local governments to be able to function. In my great State of \nColorado, most of the western half of the State is owned by the Federal \nGovernment. There are many counties in my State that rely on payment in \nlieu of taxes for up to 90, 95 percent of their budgets.\n  The amendment I have sent forward that deals with payment in lieu of \ntaxes is an amendment that would add an additional $7 million into the \npayment in lieu of taxes fund. That would bring the amount up to a \nlevel of consistency with what has come out of the House of \nRepresentatives.\n  I urge my colleagues in the Senate to support the amendment.\n  Mr. President, the second amendment deals with the Land and Water \nConservation Fund. My proposal, in this amendment, is that the user \nfees that are collected in, for example, ski areas in places such as \nMontana or Wyoming or Colorado--that those amounts of money be returned \nback to the Land and Water Conservation Fund in those States in \naddition to the amount of money they already receive under the Land and \nWater Conservation Fund.\n  It seems to me it would be an appropriate investment of these dollars \nto be invested through the programs of the Land and Water Conservation \nFund.\n  Again, we may be talking more about this in the days ahead, but the \nLand and Water Conservation Fund has had an exemplary record in the \ncontributions it has made to preserve our water and our air and our \nland. I think this amendment will be helpful for us as we work on that \nagenda at a national level.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                               Education\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, in the book of Isaiah, the prophet wrote,\n\n[[Page S7415]]\n\n``[M]y people have gone into captivity, because they have no \nknowledge.''\n  Francis Bacon wrote, ``Knowledge itself is power.''\n  And when H.G. Wells summed up his history of the world, he concluded: \n``Human history becomes more and more a race between education and \ncatastrophe.''\n  In the next two decades, America's history will become more and more \na race for economic leadership. For more than a century, America's \neconomy has set the pace. We have led all competitors. Year after year, \nwe have become used to winning the race.\n  But now, over our shoulder, we can hear the footsteps of another \nrunner. That competitor is China. And it is gaining fast.\n  If we wish not to go into economic subservience, if we wish to \nmaintain our economic power, if we wish to avert economic misfortune, \nthe answer is education.\n  America's economic leadership has been a remarkable achievement. We \nAmericans are just 4.6 percent of the world's people. More than a fifth \nof the world's people live in China. There are nearly 4\\1/2\\ times as \nmany Chinese as there are Americans.\n  Yet America produces 60 percent more goods and services than China.\n  That is how Americans can enjoy one of the world's foremost standards \nof living. The average American's share of our economic output is \n$37,610 a year. The average Chinese's share of theirs is $1,100 a year.\n  But from a slow start, China has picked up the pace. Starting with \nDeng Xiaoping in the late 1970s, China began to reform its economy. \nDeng was eminently practical, when it came to economic philosophy. He \nsaid: ``It doesn't matter whether the cat is black or white, as long as \nit catches mice.'' Today, you can find those capitalist cats everywhere \nin China.\n  Over the last two decades, China's economy has been growing at an \naverage of 9.5 percent, nearly three times as fast as America's. And \nsome project that within 20 years, China's could become the world's \nlargest economy, ending more than a century of American leadership.\n  You can see how they do it at an American or Japanese factory in \nShanghai. You see rows and rows of hardworking workers, in colorful \nuniforms, at well-lit work stations. The company pays them about $2,000 \na year, plus food and housing benefits. But that is good money in a \ncountry with an average income of $1,100 a year. The workers there want \nto keep their jobs. And 200 million other workers stand ready to take \ntheir jobs if they do not.\n  The challenge for America in the decades to come will be: How can \nAmerica compete with that factory in Shanghai? How can we get paid \n$37,000 a year or more to make goods and perform services, when there \nare Chinese workers willing to work hard for $2,000 a year?\n  The answer is not protectionism. We cannot build a wall around \nAmerica. We cannot lift the drawbridge and flood a moat around our \nCountry.\n  If American companies do not employ those willing workers at the \nShanghai factory, companies from Japan and Italy and China itself will. \nThen Japanese and Italian and Chinese companies will sell products more \ncheaply into America. And American consumers will gladly buy those \nproducts at lower prices. American consumers will insist on buying \nthose products at lower prices.\n  If America raises tariffs on goods made in China, then American \nconsumers will pay more for their cost of living than will people in \nother countries. Americans will have less money to spend on other \nthings that they want, less money to spend on other things in America. \nThe American economy will be smaller, if America raises tariffs.\n\n  If America raises tariffs, then American businesses will pay more for \ntheir industrial inputs than will businesses in other countries. \nAmerican businesses will become less competitive, lose sales, and lose \njobs. Once again, the American economy will be smaller, if America \nraises tariffs.\n  No, the answer to how America can compete with that factory in \nShanghai is not protectionism.\n  The way that we can get paid $37,000 for our work--when Chinese \nworkers are willing to work for $2,000--is for Americans to add more \nvalue. Americans earn more because we produce better. Americans produce \nsmarter.\n  And that means that for us to remain economic leaders of the world, \nAmericans need to stay smarter. We need to educate our children and our \nworkers so that American workers can add more value in an hour of work \nthan workers in any other place in the world.\n  Knowledge will be economic power.\n  Ensuring that we continue to have more knowledge than the Chinese \nwill not be easy. China has worked on its education system. Nine out of \nten Chinese can read.\n  It is very Chinese to take the long view. More than 2,600 years ago, \nthe master Kuan Chung said:\n\n       If you plan for a year, plant a seed. If for 10 years, \n     plant a tree. If for a hundred years, teach the people. When \n     you sow a seed once, you will reap a single harvest. When you \n     teach the people, you will reap a hundred harvests.\n\n  We need to plant those seeds of education and tend those young \nsaplings, in our public schools. In 1835, the Supreme Court Justice \nJoseph Story wrote:\n\n       Every successive generation becomes a living memorial of \n     our public schools, and a living example of their excellence.\n\n  Ensuring that our schools are a living example of excellence will \ntake more than just money. But ensuring that our schools are a living \nexample of excellence will take money, as well.\n  We need to ensure that children can come to school ready to learn. We \nneed to ensure that children have modern and well-equipped schools. We \nneed to ensure that children have small classes. And most importantly, \nwe need to ensure that children have good teachers.\n  In the next decade, America will need to hire 2 million new teachers. \nOne in five new teachers leave teaching within three years. In urban \nschools, half of teachers leave the profession within 5 years.\n  Nearly two out of five low-income children are taught by teachers \nwithout a college degree in their primary instructional field. Low-\nincome students are taught by more teacher's aides than credentialed \nclassroom teachers. Four out of five aides do not have a 4-year college \ndegree.\n  Columnist Tom Friedman wrote recently:\n\n       We are heading into an age in which jobs are likely to be \n     invented and made obsolete faster and faster. The chances of \n     today's college kids working in the same jobs for the same \n     companies for their whole careers are about zero. In such an \n     age, the greatest survival skill you can have is the ability \n     to learn how to learn. The best way to learn how to learn is \n     to love to learn, and the best way to love to learn is to \n     have great teachers who inspire. And the best way to ensure \n     that we have teachers who inspire their students is if we \n     recognize and reward those who clearly have done so.\n\n  We need to give good teachers the recognition that they deserve. \nFriedman told how every year, Williams College honors four high school \nteachers who made a difference. Every year, members of its senior class \nnominate their best high school teachers. A committee at Williams then \ngoes through the nominations, does its own research, and chooses the \nfour most inspiring teachers.\n  Williams gives each of the teachers $2,000, plus a $1,000 donation to \nthe teacher's high school. And Williams flies the winners and their \nfamilies to the college to honor them at graduation.\n  Williams's president, Morton Schapiro, told Friedman: ``We take these \nteachers, who are not well compensated and often underappreciated, and \ngive them a great weekend.''\n  Said Shapiro: ``Every time we do this, one of the teachers says to \nme, `This is one of the great weekends of my life.' ''\n  It's a great idea.\n  Each of us can do our part. I have started a program that will \nrecognize Montana teachers acknowledged for excellence. This is \nsomething that all Senators can do in their home States. A little \nrecognition can go a long way.\n  But if knowledge is power, then we must also devote the resources \nnecessary to maintain that power.\n  Columnist Matt Miller argues: ``The answer is to think bigger.'' He \nsuggests that we make the best teachers millionaires by the time that \nthey retire.\n  Miller proposes a ``grand bargain'' where we raise salaries for \nteachers in\n\n[[Page S7416]]\n\npoor schools by 50 percent. And in return, teachers would agree to \nchange their pay scale so that we could raise the top performers and \nthose in math and science another 50 percent.\n  Miller, who used to work at the Office of Management and Budget, \ncalculates that his plan would cost about $30 billion a year. That \nwould provide a 7 percent increase in the nation's K-through-12 \nspending.\n  I ask my colleagues: Why don't we invest $30 billion for top \nteachers, and pay for it by closing abusive tax shelters?\n  And we need to help students to learn math and science. Companies are \nmoving jobs offshore to China, India, and Eastern Europe not only \nbecause workers there work for less, but also because they are well \neducated in math and science.\n  Sadly, American high school students now perform below most of the \nworld on international math and science tests. Most have little \ninterest in pursuing scientific fields. Only 5.5 percent of the high \nschool seniors who took the college entrance exam in 2002 planned to \npursue an engineering degree. We have to do more to encourage students \nto love to learn math and science.\n  And we need to help students to learn geography and languages. Visit \na primary school in a middle-sized Chinese city. Bright, enthusiastic \nchildren will greet you in English. Chinese schools are preparing \nstudents to compete in a multinational, multilingual world economy. The \ncoming generation of Chinese businesspeople will do business around the \nworld. Americans need to broaden our linguistic and geographic \nabilities, or Chinese businesspeople will cut the deals before us. As \nour former Colleague Bill Bradley said in 1988, ``If we are going to \nlead the world, we have to know where it is.''\n  And after school, almost 6 million latch-key children go without \naccess to after-school learning opportunities. More than seven in ten \nmothers of children under 18 are in the workforce. America can no \nlonger afford a school day based on 1950s family structures. Quality \nafter-school programs can both keep children safe and improve academic \nachievement. We need to ensure that children have quality after-school \nprograms.\n  Similarly, we continue to have a school year that reflects the \nharvest schedule of an agrarian economy that America long ago left \nbehind. Long summer vacations mean reading levels drop and other \nlearning is lost.\n  Schools like Des Moines's Downtown School point to another way. They \nhave a six-week summer break. And that means less time to forget. \nBesides six weeks in the summer, students also have week-long breaks in \nOctober, February, and May.\n  Jan Drees, the principal of the Downtown School, says: ``The research \nis becoming more and more clear that students retain more learning and \nneed less review with shorter summer breaks.''\n  The Downtown school is popular, too. More than 800 children are on a \nwaiting list to get into the school.\n  Iowa law requires schools to provide a minimum of 180 instructional \ndays a year. But the Downtown School teaches students for 192 days a \nyear. They are getting more learning in, every year. For Americans to \nstay smarter, students should spend more of the school year in school.\n  China's increasing competitive strength is also fueled by its growing \npopulation of college graduates. Last year, nearly 3 million Chinese \nentered the workforce from 3- and 4-year colleges and graduate \nprograms. This is one-third more than the year before, and double the \nyear before that.\n  America's college system is the finest in the world. And the work of \nthe 21st century increasing demands good college education. But rising \ncollege costs increasingly bar Americans from getting the college \neducation for which they are qualified.\n  We must make college affordable for all. We need to ensure that young \nAmericans are not discouraged from obtaining post-secondary education \nbecause of costs. Tuition costs have risen considerably in recent \nyears. And federal assistance programs have not kept pace.\n  Pell Grants help to make college education affordable for 5 million \nstudents, a third of American undergraduates. But students receive \ngrants averaging just $2,500 a year, while the average annual cost of \ntuition at a public college in-state averages more than $9,000 a year, \nand private college averages more than $23,000 a year. The most that a \nstudent can get in Pell Grants is $4,050 a year. Expanding Pell Grants \nwould increase the ability of low-income young Americans to prepare for \nthe 21st century.\n  As well, we should improve, consolidate, and expand the government's \neducation tax incentives to make them more effective. We could expand \nand extend the deduction for tuition expenses. We could expand the Hope \nand Lifetime Learning credits. We could craft targeted incentives for \nstudents pursuing science and engineering careers. We could do more to \nmake it possible for non-traditional students to obtain an education. \nThere are many good options.\n  As with elementary school students, we need to help encourage college \nstudents to learn the subjects needed in the 21st century.\n  In 1975, America ranked third in the world in the share of 24-year-\nolds who held a science or engineering degree. By 2000, we had slipped \nto 15th. By 2004, we were 17th. And in the future, the Department of \nLabor projects that new jobs requiring science, engineering, and \ntechnical training will increase four times faster than the average \nnational job growth rate.\n  Last year, China produced 220,000 new engineers, while America \neducated just 60,000. And America trains only half as many engineers as \nJapan and Europe.\n  In a recent report, McKinsey Global Institute found that there are \nalready twice as many young university-trained professionals in low-\nwage countries as in high-wage countries. China has twice as many young \nengineers as America.\n  Engineers play a critical role in the development of new jobs and new \nindustries. We should increase scholarships and loan forgiveness for \nengineering students to entice more people to love to learn \nengineering.\n  At that Shanghai factory, American and Japanese research and \ndevelopment stand behind many of the products being built. But ask the \nAmerican or Japanese company their plans, and they will tell you that \nthey plan to move R work closer to the plant, there in China. And \nShanghai's government hopes to lure more R to town. Chinese business \nunderstands that innovation is the source of American value-added. And \nthey want part of that action, too.\n  Clive Cookson reported in the Financial Times about a bioscience park \noutside Beijing. A firm there called CapitalBio is emerging as a world \nleader in the new technology of biochips. Biochips are cutting-edge \ndevices that combine biotechnology and electronics for biological \ntesting and medical diagnostics. The 4-year-old company is already \nselling instruments to American drug companies.\n  Last month, CapitalBio entered into a partnership with Affymetrix in \nCalifornia, the world's largest biochip producer. CapitalBio's chief \nexecutive said: ``Affymetrix had never imagined that there was such a \nbig research effort in biochips in China, working to such a high \nstandard.''\n  Dozens of similar examples exist. Already, several Asian countries \nboast of such science and technology centers. They are following in \nJapan's wake as world-class centers for research and development.\n  Asia's R investment and scientific output have both surged rapidly. \nBetween 1998 and 2003, China's research and development spending \nroughly tripled.\n  You can judge a scientific paper's effect by how often other \nresearchers cite it. The number of frequently-cited Chinese research \npapers has risen from just 21 in 1994 to 223 in 2003. And China's \ncontribution to the world's scientific journals has increased from less \nthan half a percent in 1981 to more than 5 percent in 2003.\n  And Chinese researchers will do research for less cost. Newly-\ngraduated researchers in China generally earn about a quarter of what \nAmericans do. For more senior staff, salaries are usually at least half \nAmerican salaries. And in exceptional cases, they can sometimes exceed \nours.\n  Chinese scientists who have returned after studying and working in \nthe west are playing an important role. In Beijing, CapitalBio's CEO \nsaid that he\n\n[[Page S7417]]\n\n``made a special effort at the beginning to attract [Chinese \nexpatriates] from abroad, with salary and stock options. We offered at \nleast to match the salaries that senior scientists were receiving; the \nhighest we offered was $120,000 a year,'' he said.\n  So far, Asia has been able to make a global mark only in a few new \nareas of the life sciences where western expertise is not entrenched. \nStem cell technology is an example. South Korea, China, Singapore, and \nIndia are racing ahead on stem cell research. Those countries accept \nhuman embryo research in a way that the American government has not.\n  But America still has an advantage in innovation. And America also \nbenefits from a risk-taking entrepreneurial culture. You can see it in \nthe venture capital that funds companies spun out of American research \nlaboratories or universities. America's capital markets remain the envy \nof the world.\n  We can help to maintain that edge in innovation by supporting \nresearch. American universities and research institutes do much of the \nmost innovative research in the world.\n  But over the last 20 years, Federal research funding in the physical \nsciences and engineering has declined by nearly a third as a share of \nthe economy.\n  We should reverse this trend and increase Federal spending on basic \nresearch. The money we spend will come back to us many times over in \nthe creation of new jobs in new industries making products yet to be \ninvented.\n  We should support the National Science Foundation. The NSF funds \nresearch and education in science and engineering through a variety of \nsuccessful programs. It accounts for a fifth of all Federal support to \nacademic institutions for basic research, a crucial engine of \ninnovation.\n  NSF funds have helped discover new technologies that have led to \nmulti-billion dollar industries and millions of new jobs. NSF-funded \nwork in the basic sciences and engineering made possible fiber optics, \nradar, wireless communication, nanotechnology, plant genomics, magnetic \nresonance imaging, ultrasound, and the Internet.\n  Each year, the NSF helps fund over 200,000 students, teachers, and \nresearchers. Many of them take their NSF-supported work into industry. \nThey found start-up companies selling new products and new \ntechnologies.\n  In addition, we should make it easier--consistent with the \nrequirements of national security--for foreign students to study in \nAmerica. America has traditionally poached many of the best and \nbrightest students from around the globe. Well over a third of American \nscience and engineering doctorate holders were born abroad.\n  Since 9/11, however, many students are having a difficult time \ngetting visas to study in America. In 2004, foreign applications to \nAmerican graduate schools declined by 28 percent. Enrollments of \nforeign students at all levels of college declined for the first time \nin 30 years.\n  Foreign students are increasingly studying in Europe and elsewhere. \nThat is a terrible loss. It will affect our economic health in the \nlong-term. We need to do a better job balancing security and economic \nhealth.\n  America must not compromise on its security needs in hosting foreign \nbusinesspeople or foreign students. But there must be ways to \nstreamline visa procedures and otherwise lighten the burden. We need to \nmake it easier for foreigners to study and conduct business in America.\n  We should support community colleges, and strengthen the link between \nthem and the workforce. That will allow schools to develop training \nprograms relevant to jobs in the real world. That is a primary goal of \nthe Enzi-Baucus Higher Education Access, Affordability and Opportunity \nAct.\n  And when American jobs are lost to trade, we need to retrain people \nand help them to get back into the workforce. The philosopher and \neducator John Dewey said, ``Education is not preparation for life; \neducation is life itself.'' We can no longer afford to think of \neducation as something just for the young.\n  We need to help displaced workers to receive the retraining that they \nneed to succeed in a changing economy. Jobs will change. We should help \nworkers to get the educational tools to change with those jobs.\n  That is why I joined with Senators Wyden and Coleman to introduce \nlegislation to expand Trade Adjustment Assistance to service workers \nwho lose their jobs because of trade. TAA is a vital means of helping \ndisplaced workers get the education to change careers and stay \nproductive.\n  When Plato envisioned the ideal society in his work The Laws, he \nwrote of the importance of education, through the course of life. He \nwrote:\n\n       [N]owhere should education be dishonored, as it is first \n     among the noblest things for the best men. If it ever goes \n     astray, and if it is possible to set it right, everyone ought \n     always to do so as much as he can, throughout the whole of \n     life.\n\n  And so, through advancing education, America can compete with that \nfactory in Shanghai. Through advancing education, America can respond \nto competition, without erecting harmful barriers to trade. And through \nadvancing education, America can respond to a growing China, without \nforcing confrontation with China.\n  University of California economist Brad DeLong wrote of the choice \nthat we face in how we address the challenge of China. He wrote:\n\n       A world 60 years from now in which Chinese schoolchildren \n     are taught that the U.S. did what it could to speed their \n     economic growth is a much safer world for my great-\n     grandchildren than a world in which Chinese schoolchildren \n     are taught that the U.S. did all it could to keep China poor.\n\n  Through advancing education, America can seek that safer world.\n  But perhaps most importantly, America should seek to advance \neducation not just to preserve our economy, but also to preserve our \nfreedom.\n  As Senator Daniel Webster said in a speech in 1837, ``On the \ndiffusion of education among the people rest the preservation and \nperpetuation of our free institutions.''\n  As Thomas Jefferson wrote in 1816, ``If a nation expects to be \nignorant and free, in a state of civilization, it expects what never \nwas and never will be.''\n  And as the Phrygian philosopher Epictetus said, ``Only the educated \nare free.''\n  And so, let us advance education to preserve our economic power.\n  Let us advance education to win the race for economic leadership.\n  And most importantly, let us advance education to help preserve our \nAmerican democracy.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I rise today to thank the chairman, Senator \nConrad Burns, and the ranking member, Senator Byron Dorgan, of the \nAppropriations Subcommittee on the Interior for their support of a \nproject that is most important to me: the National Park Service's \nLittle Rock Central High School Museum and Visitors Center.\n  Due to Senator Burns' and Senator Dorgan's ongoing efforts, the new \nLittle Rock Central High Museum and Visitors Center is back on track to \nbe built for the 50th anniversary of the 1957-1958 Little Rock \ndesegregation crisis. I thank the subcommittee staff, Bruce Evans and \nPeter Kiefhaber, for their help as well in making this project a \nreality.\n  This is important because in September of 2007, it is anticipated \nthat we will have a very large 50th anniversary commemoration and \ncelebration of the Little Rock Central High School desegregation \ncrisis. Hopefully, one of the things that we will have there to \nshowcase is a brand new visitors center that will allow people to learn \nabout not only Little Rock Central High and the role it played in \nintegration, but also learn about the civil rights movement in general.\n  I remind my colleagues and others listening about the events that \ntook place at Little Rock Central High almost 50 years ago.\n  Little Rock Central High School was a place in 1957 where nine Black \nteenagers integrated the all-White Central High in Little Rock, testing \nthe Brown v. Board of Education Supreme Court decision that ultimately \nended legal segregation in our schools in this Nation.\n  To its credit, the Little Rock School Board took Brown v. Board of \nEducation seriously. When the Supreme Court said ``all deliberate \nspeed,'' they took that literally. They looked at their calendars and \nthought: That decision came out in 1954. They probably thought they \ncould not get it done in 1955, probably not in 1956, but in the fall of \n1957, they made the determination that they could have the high school \nin Little Rock ready to integrate.\n  As these nine teenagers attempted to enter the doors of Central High \nSchool, they were confronted with an angry, rampaging mob. President \nEisenhower was forced to order Federal troops to Little Rock to end the \nbrutal intimidation campaign mounted against the Black children and to \nuphold the Brown decision.\n  The Little Rock Nine--Ernest Green, Elizabeth Eckford, Gloria Ray \nKarlmark, Carlotta Walls LaNier, Minnijean Brown Trickey, Terrence \nRoberts, Jefferson Thomas, Thelma Mothershed Wair, and Melba Pattillo \nBeals--changed the course of American history by claiming the right to \nreceive an equal education.\n  I must not let the moment pass without mentioning the amazing courage \nexhibited by Daisy Bates of Little Rock who was a civil rights leader \nand, by all accounts, was a key person in making equal education a \nreality in Arkansas and also in the Nation.\n  Little Rock Central High School Museum and Visitors Center will \nprovide America with an understanding of the events of 1957 and 1958, \nthe broader civil rights movement, and how the bravery of the Little \nRock Nine still influences life in the 21st century. It will teach our \nyouth that nine young high school students proved that all men are \ncreated equal and that the rule of law is paramount in the democracy of \nthe United States. It will remind the world that children all over \nAmerica have the right to learn because of the courage and the \nsacrifice of the Little Rock Nine.\n\n  We have been racing against time to secure the funds to build the \ncenter in time for the 50th anniversary of the crisis. On June 9 of \nthis year, I had the privilege of having a conference call with eight \nof the nine. By the way, all\n\n[[Page S7419]]\n\nnine are still living. I had the privilege of having a conference call \nwith eight of the nine and reporting news that Senator Burns and \nSenator Dorgan had provided the crucial $5.1 million for the Central \nHigh center in this year's bill.\n  The joy expressed by the Little Rock Nine made me once again reflect \non their acts of courage and heroism. Their gratitude made me reflect \non their continuing self-sacrifice and the importance of our--the \nSenate's--support to share their story with our current generation and \ngenerations to follow.\n  In the words of Minnijean Brown Trickey, the funds in this bill are \n``an affirmation of a very beautiful and tragic story.''\n  Carlotta Walls LaNier said:\n\n       With this museum, visitors will remember the events of \n     1957, but more importantly understand the difference \n     individuals can make in promoting equal rights and tolerance.\n\n  On behalf of Little Rock Nine, the Arkansas delegation, and the \nNation, I express my deepest gratitude for the support of Little Rock \nCentral High School Museum and Visitors Center. I thank my colleagues \nfor ensuring that these extraordinary achievements are recorded and \nshared for a better America.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, while the Senator from Arkansas is on the \nfloor, I want to mention to him how pleased I was to play a very small \nrole in getting funding for this and give him a little background of \nwhy I have had a special interest in this.\n  One of the more inspirational things I ever attended was in the East \nRoom at the White House, perhaps some 5 years ago, an event at which \nPresident Clinton had invited the Little Rock Nine. There they sat, \nthese nine people, on a riser in the East Room of the White House as \npart of a celebration of the 45th anniversary of when those then-nine \nyoung children marched into the Little Rock school and integrated the \nLittle Rock school.\n  That integration was ordered by Judge Ronald Davies of North Dakota. \nHe was a Federal judge who was from the Fargo Federal district in North \nDakota who traveled to Little Rock, AR, and issued the landmark ruling \nthat resulted in the integration of that school.\n  I was privileged to name a courthouse, in legislation, after Judge \nRonald Davies about 5 years ago because I wanted North Dakotans to long \nremember this man. He was a short fellow, 5 foot 2, perhaps. He \nstrutted around with great flair, but was a remarkable Federal judge by \nall accounts and issued a courageous decision. He was, in fact, \nrequired to have security because of threats on his life when he issued \nthe landmark civil rights decision that required the integration of \nthat school.\n  With respect to the story, I want to read a couple paragraphs from \nPrairie Public Television in North Dakota. They did an interview with \nthe judge's family. It talked about when Judge Davis and Governor \nFaubus were deadlocked and the nine students were still not in school. \nThere was an injunction that had been ordered.\n\n       On September 20th, Davies ruled that Faubus used the \n     National Guard to prevent integration, not to prevent \n     violence, and the governor was forced to withdraw the troops. \n     The situation was now in the hands of the Little Rock Police \n     Department.\n       There was a mob of a thousand people outside Central High \n     School when those young students were ushered in. Everyone \n     will recall the Norman Rockwell portrait of a young Black \n     schoolgirl in pigtails and knee socks holding the hand of a \n     U.S. Marshal walking into the Little Rock public school.\n\n  The crowd learned the students were inside, and out of fear for their \nsafety, the police then evacuated them. President Eisenhower issued a \nspecial proclamation that evening, calling for opponents of integration \nto ``cease and desist.''\n\n     . . . The next morning, Little Rock's mayor sent the \n     president a telegram asking him to send troops to maintain \n     order.\n\n  President Eisenhower sent 10,000 Arkansas National Guard and 1,000 \nmembers of the 101st Airborne. Those young students the next day, under \nheavy guard with substantial military around the city, entered Little \nRock Central High School.\n  I tell my colleague that only to say that Judge Ronald Davies, this \nFederal judge from North Dakota, played a very pivotal role in making \nthat day happen with his ruling and paid quite a price for it at the \ntime, with threats on his life and anger about what he had done.\n  But 45 years after that Little Rock day, sitting in that room with \nnow middle-aged African Americans, to understand the courage it must \nhave taken not just for them, especially them, but their parents, that \nthey forced this issue, not just on behalf of these students but on \nbehalf of all in this country who were similarly situated and similarly \nmistreated. I could not feel more strongly and feel more inspired about \nwhat this center will mean to those nine, to both Senators from \nArkansas, but also to the relatives of Judge Davies and so many others \nwho had a role in making this event happen that has literally changed \nthe lives of a good many Americans.\n  I heard the Senator speak and wanted to acknowledge his appreciation \nand say that we are the ones really who appreciate the opportunity to \ndo this.\n  Mr. PRYOR. I thank the Senator. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1052\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, our country is now involved in two wars--not \none, two wars; one in Afghanistan and the other in Iraq. Each day we \nread in the newspapers about the human toll this nation is paying. As \nof today, 1,730 troops, men and women, have been killed in Iraq; 194 \nhave been killed in Afghanistan and elsewhere. The toll of these wars \nis also borne by those men and women who carry the scars of battle.\n  In Iraq, more than 13,000 troops have been wounded. In Afghanistan, \n476 troops have shed their blood in service to our country. The \nAmerican people thank these servicemembers for their sacrifice. \nHowever, late last week, Congress learned that the Department of \nVeterans Affairs has been shortchanged in its mission to provide \nmedical care to these warriors and all of the other men and women who \nhave served in time of war before them.\n  Now, this is a shame. This is a sham. If our Nation owes just one \nthing to all of those men and women who have risked their lives in \nanswer to our country's call, it surely must be, in the words of \nAbraham Lincoln, ``to care for him who shall have borne the battle.''\n  It is a shock that the administration has only now revealed it has \nnot budgeted the funds to fulfill this mission. I offer an amendment \nthis afternoon on behalf of Senator Patty Murray, myself, and Senator \nFeinstein to provide $1.42 billion in emergency funds to address the \nshortfall in health care funds for the Department of Veterans Affairs. \nOf this figure, $600 million would be used to reimburse VA construction \naccounts that have been raided to pay for health care costs. Another \n$400 million would be used to reimburse other accounts that have been \nraided for the same purpose.\n  Finally, an additional $420 million is included to compensate each \nVeterans and Integrated Service Network, or VISN, for the additional \nexpenses incurred because of the high caseload of wounded veterans. \nThis $1.42 billion is urgently needed and the Senate must not delay in \nproviding the funds that are required to allow our veterans to see \ntheir physicians at the Department of Veterans Affairs.\n  Earlier this year, the Senate rejected on a nearly party-line vote an \namendment to the Iraq supplemental appropriations bill to add funding \nto VA health care. The administration told Congress additional funds \nwere not needed to care for our Nation's veterans. We now know this \nclaim was wrong. According to the estimate provided to Congress by the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs, VA funding is short $1 billion this \nyear. Congress must act to care for our veterans. When it comes to our \nveterans health care, half a loaf is not good enough.\n  Some may argue against this amendment by urging the Senate to wait \nfor the administration's plan. However, according to VA testimony \nbefore the House of Representatives last week, the administration \nintends to respond to the shortfall on the cheap by robbing Peter to \npay Paul. We have already waited too long for the administration to \nrecognize the needs of our\n\n[[Page S7420]]\n\nveterans. The Murray-Byrd-Feinstein amendment is the Senate's \nopportunity to end this year's shortchanging of veterans.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the pending amendment be set aside so \nthat I may send to the desk this amendment offered by me on behalf of \nMrs. Murray, for herself, myself, and Mrs. Feinstein.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is set aside.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from West Virginia [Mr. Byrd] for Mrs. Murray, \n     for herself, Mr. Byrd, and Mrs. Feinstein, proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1052.\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: Making emergency supplemental appropriations for the fiscal \nyear ending September 30, 2005, for the Veterans Health Administration)\n\n       On page 254, after line 25, add the following:\n       Sec. 429.(a) From any money in the Treasury not otherwise \n     obligated or appropriated, there are appropriated to the \n     Department of Veterans Affairs $1,420,000,000 for the fiscal \n     year ending September 30, 2005, for medical services provided \n     by the Veterans Health Administration, of which $420,000,000 \n     shall be divided evenly between the Veterans Integrated \n     Service Networks.\n       (b) The amount appropriated under subsection (a)--\n       (1) is designated as an emergency requirement pursuant to \n     section 402 of H. Con. Res. 95 (109th Congress); and\n       (2) shall remain available until expended.\n       (c) This section shall take effect on the date of enactment \n     of this Act.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 1053\n\n(Purpose: To provide funds for the memorial to Martin Luther King, Jr.)\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the greatness of women and men is often best \njudged from an historical perspective. History gives us the detached \nperspective that allows us to better understand and appreciate the \nperson, the cause, and the legacy.\n  This happens because great individuals often have been leaders who \nchallenged the status quo as they pushed the country into areas where \nit had feared to go. As a result, such leaders often arouse criticism \nand opposition.\n  The Revered Dr. Martin Luther King certainly was a controversial \nfigure in his own time.\n  Black power advocates attacked him for moving too slowly, while more \nthan one presidential administration attacked him for moving too \nswiftly.\n  The NAACP criticized his take-to-the-streets tactics.\n  Civil rights leaders broke with Dr. King because of his opposition to \nthe Vietnam War.\n  I certainly had my share of differences with Reverend King--a lot of \nthem. We were both products of our times, and both of us were doing \nwhat we believed was right.\n  But time and the march of history afford a better understanding of \nDr. King and his contributions toward making the United States a \nbetter, stronger, and greater Nation.\n  It is for this reason, I am proposing that $10 million in funding be \nmade available for the memorial to Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. This $10 \nmillion, which is available within the subcommittee's allocation, would \nsupplement the approximately $42 million that has already been raised \nand stands as a solid foundation to help make this memorial a reality.\n  I have come to appreciate how Martin Luther King, Jr., sought to help \nour Nation overcome racial barriers, bigotry, hatred, and injustice, \nand how he helped to inspire and guide a most important, most powerful, \nand most transforming social movement.\n  Despite the hatred and the bigotry he encountered in his efforts, Dr. \nKing never allowed his movement to be reduced to a simple racial \nconflict. He stressed on more than one occasion, that the struggle was \nnot one between people of different colors. Rather, Dr. King believed \nthat his fight was a fight ``between justice and injustice, between the \nforces of light and the forces of darkness.''\n  His vision and his movement included all Americans. I remind my \ncolleagues, and all Americans, that when Martin Luther King stood on \nthe steps of the Lincoln Memorial and proclaimed that he had ``a \ndream,'' he pointed out that he also looked forward to the time ``when \nall of God's children, black men and white men, Jews and Gentiles, \nProtestants and Catholics, will be able to join hands.''\n  I remind my colleagues that Dr. King's efforts also focused on the \neconomic rights of economically deprived people of all races and \ncreeds, as well as on the civil rights of African Americans. In this \nquest, he proposed a Bill of Rights for the Disadvantaged. He advocated \na guaranteed national income. At the time of his death, Dr. King was \norganizing a ``Poor Peoples March'' on Washington, an effort meant to \nfocus national attention on poverty among not only African-Americans, \nbut among the poor whites of Appalachia, as well.\n  Dr. King's vision was not only about what America could be, but what \nAmerica should be.\n  With the passage of time, we have come to learn that his dream was \nthe American dream, and few ever expressed it more eloquently.\n  Dr. King touched the conscience of a Nation, and forced us, as a \ncountry, to confront our contradictions. How could the United States \npresent itself as the leader of the free world, he asked, while denying \nequality and equal opportunity to a large segment of our own people? In \nhis book, ``Where Do We Go from Here,'' Dr. King asked why 40 million \nAmericans were living in poverty in ``a nation overflowing with \nunbelievable affluence.'' Writing of the destructive effects of \nmilitarism, he asked: ``Why [has] our nation placed itself in the \nposition of being God's military agent on earth?'' ``Why have we \nsubstituted the arrogant undertaking of policing the whole world for \nthe high task of putting our own ``house in order?''\n  With his works as well as his words, Dr. King left us a legacy that \ninspires and guides millions of Americans today. It is a legacy that \ndemonstrates that human problems, no matter how big or complex, can be \naddressed--a legacy that proves that one determined person can help \nmake a difference.\n  Amid all his successes and triumphs, and all of his personal \naccomplishments, including receiving the Noble Peace Prize, Dr. King \nalways kept his perspective. The night before he was assassinated, he \nexplained: ``I just want to do God's will.'' What a powerful statement \nthis was: ``I just wanted to do God's will.'' What an inspiration it \nshould be to all of us: ``To do God's will.''\n  Criticized, denounced, and opposed in his own time, Martin Luther \nKing has become not only an American icon, but also an international \nsymbol of social justice, and one of recent history's most beloved \nchampions of freedom.\n  Mr. President, we have named a National Holiday in his honor. It is \njust and proper that we now place a memorial on The Mall of the \nNation's Capital as a visible and tangible symbol of the thanks of a \ngrateful nation. Martin Luther King taught us tolerance. How we need \nsuch teachings today. May his life, his legacy, and someday soon, his \nmemorial ever remind us of his vision.\n  I am about to offer an amendment, and Senator Cochran, the \nillustrious chairman of the Appropriations Committee in the Senate, is \nthe principal cosponsor of the amendment that I will offer, so it is \nbipartisan. I thank Senator Cochran, and I hope that many other \nSenators will join us in this effort to honor Dr. King.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending amendment or \namendments be set aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. That I may offer this amendment on behalf of myself and \nSenator Cochran. I send the amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from West Virginia [Mr. Byrd], for himself and \n     Mr. Cochran, proposes an amendment numbered 1053:\n       On page 189, after line 20, add the following:\n       Sec. 128.

Of these \ntotals, $54 million in budget authority and $60 million in outlays are \nfor mandatory programs in fiscal year 2006.\n  The bill provides total discretionary budget authority in fiscal year \n2006 of $26.207 billion. This amount is $532 million more than the \nPresident's request, equal to the 302(b) allocations adopted by the \nSenate, $100 million more than the House-passed bill, and $553 million \nless than fiscal year 2005 enacted levels.\n  Mr. President, I commend the distinguished chairman of the \nAppropriations Committee for bringing this legislation before the \nSenate, and I ask unanimous consent that a table displaying the Budget \nCommittee scoring of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n                 HR 2361, 2006 INTERIOR APPROPRIATIONS\n\n               SPENDING COMPARISONS--SENATE-REPORTED BILL\n                     [Fiscal Year 2006, $ millions]\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                     General\n                                     Purpose     Mandatory      Total\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSenate-reported bill:............\n    Budget authority.............       26,207           54       26,261\n    Outlays......................       27,361           60       27,421\nSenate 302(b) allocation:........\n    Budget authority.............       26,207        [54]*       26,261\n    Outlays......................       27,373        [60]*       27,433\n2005 Enacted:....................\n    Budget authority.............       26,760           54       26,814\n    Outlays......................       26,788           55       26,843\nPresident's request:.............\n    Budget authority.............       26,675           54       25,729\n    Outlays......................       27,414           60       27,474\nHouse-passed bill:...............\n    Budget authority.............       26,107           54       26,161\n    Outlays......................       27,489           60       27,549\nSenate-Reported Bill Compared to:\nSenate 302(b) allocation:........\n    Budget authority.............            0            0            0\n    Outlays......................          -12            0          -12\n2005 Enacted:....................\n    Budget authority.............         -553            0         -553\n    Outlays......................          573            5          578\nPresident's request:.............\n    Budget authority.............          532            0          532\n    Outlays......................          -53            0          -53\nHouse-passed bill:...............\n    Budget authority.............          100            0          100\n    Outlays......................         -128            0         -128\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n* Initial 302(b) allocation report for 2006 omitted subcommittee\n  allocations for mandatory spending.

Mr. President. I rise today to honor the memory of U.S. \nArmy SSG Harold ``George'' Bennett. In the jungles of Vietnam, this \nyoung Arkansan displayed courage and honor while serving his Nation in \nuniform. Tragically, almost 40 years to the day, on or about June 26, \n1965, he became the first American prisoner of war executed by the Viet \nCong.\n  George Bennett was born on October 16, 1940, in Perryville, AR, a \nsmall town that rests just northwest of Little Rock in the foothills of \nthe Ozarks. His father, Gordon, was a veteran of World War I, and he \ninstilled in his sons the values and rewards of service to country. All \n4 would follow his footsteps into the U.S. Army.\n  SGT George Bennett was trained in the Army as an airborne infantryman \nand served with the famed 82nd and 101st Airborne Divisions, made up of \nsome of the finest soldiers in the world. He earned his Master \nParachute Wings and Expert Infantry Badge before volunteering in 1964 \nfor service in what was a relatively unknown area of southeast Asia \ncalled Vietnam. While deployed, Sergeant Bennett served as an infantry \nadvisor to the 33rd Ranger Battalion, one of South Vietnam's best \ntrained and toughest units. On December 29, 1964, they were airlifted \nto the village of Binh Gia after it had been overrun by a division of \nViet Cong. Immediately upon landing, Sergeant Bennett's unit was \nconfronted by a well-dug-in regiment of enemy forces and despite \nfighting furiously and courageously throughout the afternoon, their \nunit was decimated and overrun. Sergeant Bennett and his radio \noperator, PFC Charles Crafts, fell into the hands of the Viet Cong.\n  Before being captured, Sergeant Bennett twice called off American \nhelicopter pilots who were attempting to navigate through the combat \nzone to rescue him and his radioman. Displaying a remarkably calm \ndemeanor, his focus seemed to be on their safety and not his own. His \nlast words to his would-be rescuers were, ``Well, they are here now. My \nlittle people,'' his term for the South Vietnamese soldiers under his \ncommand, ``are laying down their weapons and they want me to turn off \nmy radio. Thanks a lot for your help and God Bless you.''\n  As a prisoner of war, the only thing more remarkable than the \ncourageous resistance he displayed throughout his captivity was his \nsteadfast devotion to duty, honor, and country. His faith in God and \nthe trust of his fellow prisoners was unshakable. Sadly, the only way \nhis captors could break his spirit of resistance was to execute him and \ntoday Sergeant Bennett lies in an unmarked grave known only to God, \nsomewhere in the jungles of Vietnam.\n  Recent efforts by a group of Vietnam veterans will ensure that \nSergeant Bennett's valiant service will not be forgotten. Over the \nyears, they have worked tirelessly on behalf of the Bennett family to \nsecure the valor awards that should have been presented to Sergeant \nBennett's mother, Pauline, in 1965. I am proud of all they have \naccomplished and have pledged my support to this effort. Most recently, \ntheir work helped lead to Sergeant Bennett's posthumous induction into \nthe U.S. Army Ranger Hall of Fame at Fort Benning, GA, on July 8, 2004. \nSergeant Bennett's brother Dicky, and his sisters, Eloise Wallace, \nLaura Sue Vaught, and Peggy Williams were in attendance. I hope this \nlong overdue moment of recognition provided some sense of solace for \nhis family. Although he may no longer be with us, the example and \nselflessness of this brave young Arkansan will forever live on in our \nhearts.\n  The 40th anniversary of Sergeant Bennett's execution offers us an \nopportunity, not to remember the events of his death, but to reflect \nupon the life he led and the kind of person he was. He was a selfless \nyoung man who answered his Nation's call to service and placed duty and \nhonor above all else. While a grateful nation could never adequately \nexpress their debt to men such as George Bennett, it should take every \nopportunity to honor them and their families for the sacrifice they \nhave paid on our behalf.\n  I would also like to ask for unanimous consent to include in the \nrecord the citation from Sergeant Bennett's posthumous induction into \nthe Ranger Hall of Fame and an article titled ``Bad Day at Binh Gia,'' \nby retired Army COL Douglas E. Moore, that provides us additional \ninsight into the heroic service of SGT George Bennett.\n\n                          Bad Day at Binh Gia\n\n                       (By Col. Douglas E. Moore)\n\n       When friends or family visit for the first time, we usually \n     take them to Washington to see the Vietnam Veterans Memorial. \n     Although I have been there many times, I am still impressed \n     with the large crowds. Most are tourists with cameras at the \n     ready; others appear to be more somber, perhaps because they \n     served in Vietnam themselves or lost friends or family in the \n     war. It troubles me to see fellow veterans there wearing all \n     sorts of military attire from that era. Many of them have \n     pain written across their faces, which makes me wonder what \n     terrible burdens they carry after all these years.\n       For me, Vietnam is now a collection of mostly good \n     memories. As a young medevac helicopter pilot, I had the \n     opportunity to sharpen my flying skills to a level that was \n     never matched again. I was blessed to be able to work with \n     some of the finest people I have ever known, and my job was \n     satisfying. During my tours in Vietnam and Japan, I evacuated \n     more than 11,000 casualties in one of the best flying \n     machines ever built, the Huey helicopter. It is gratifying to \n     know that some patients lived because we were able to help.\n       The bad memories have mostly faded with time. In fact, \n     there is only one event that I still think about, and it \n     occurred more than 34 years ago. In late December 1964, we \n     were rushing to join the crews of two helicopter gunships in \n     an attempt to save an American advisor. Unfortunately, we \n     failed.\n       Vietnam in 1964 was as different as night and day from the \n     later years. Back then, it was still a Vietnamese war, and \n     there were only about 20,000 Americans assigned to the \n     various headquarters, advisory teams and a handful of \n     aviation units scattered around the countryside.\n       Ours was strictly an advisory and support role and not one \n     of direct combat. In fact, some of the senior officers still \n     had their families in Saigon, and many Americans lived in \n     hotels and other civilian buildings. The old-timers may \n     recall a memo published by one headquarters stating its \n     concern that some living areas were taking on the appearance \n     of armed camps.\n       We operated on a shoestring. We did not have U.S. Air Force \n     aircraft or U.S. Army artillery to prestrike the landing \n     zones in support of our operations. The only firepower \n     available was a few lightly armed helicopter gunships flown \n     by a group of extraordinarily brave pilots. Needless to say, \n     we left several of the landing zones littered with downed \n     helicopters.\n       The communication systems were terrible. Since most medevac \n     requests came by telephone and passed through several \n     Vietnamese headquarters before reaching us, delays were \n     common. On occasion, we would rush to a tiny village located \n     a hundred miles away only to discover the casualties had been \n     picked up a day or so earlier by a resupply aircraft making \n     its weekly rounds.\n       All new pilots found it disconcerting that they could \n     easily lose radio contact with other Americans during the \n     longer flights. Weather permitting, the only alternative was \n     to gain enough altitude to talk to our old standbys, Paris \n     Control and Paddy Control, operated by the Air Force out of \n     Saigon and Can Tho, respectively. Otherwise, we were \n     completely on our own at times.\n       The character of the war was different, too. While there \n     were a few major battles between the Viet Cong and South \n     Vietnamese, most of the contact was on a small scale and \n     ended quickly. It does not seem possible now, but the number \n     of Americans killed in the war had not reached 200 until July \n     1964.\n       In late October, I was flying past Bien Hoa Air Base when \n     several B-57 Canberra bombers suddenly broke through the \n     clouds ahead of me. Several days later, I learned they had \n     come from Clark Air Force Base in the Philippines to attack \n     Viet Cong strongholds in the jungles north of Saigon.\n\n[[Page S7424]]\n\n       The crews of the newly arrived Canberras had barely settled \n     in when the Viet Cong struck. I was dozing in our alert shack \n     at Tan Son Nhut Air Base when the radio operator began \n     yelling, ``Bien Hoa's been hit!'' As we ran to our helicopter \n     for the short flight to Bien Hoa, we could see flashes of \n     rockets and mortars on the horizon.\n       Burning aircraft and ammunition were exploding everywhere \n     as we landed to evacuate the wounded. To our horror, we \n     watched a Vietnamese A-IE Skyraider crash as the pilot tried \n     to take off during the melee. The plane's huge engine and \n     other burning parts rolled to a stop a few yards behind us. \n     Four Americans were killed, several others were wounded, and \n     13 U.S. aircraft were destroyed that night in one of the \n     first major attacks that seemed to be specifically targeted \n     against the Americans.\n       Not long afterwards Bob Hope arrived for his first \n     Christmas tour. While his group was traveling from the \n     airport to downtown Saigon, two Viet Cong saboteurs drove an \n     explosive-laden truck into the parking lot of the Brinks \n     Hotel. Two Americans died in the blast and more than 50 were \n     wounded. I missed Bob's show the next day because I was \n     flying, but I understand that he quipped, ``A funny thing \n     happened on the way in last night--a hotel passed us!''\n       As 1964 was ending, the North Vietnamese apparently \n     concluded that they could not win the war with the hit-and-\n     run tactics they had been using. Instead, a major shift in \n     their strategy occurred when they sent two veteran Viet Cong \n     regiments to an assembly area about 50 miles southeast of \n     Saigon. Coastal freighters brought new rifles, mortars and \n     rocket-propelled grenade launchers. In the jungles of Phuoc \n     Tuy province, the dreaded 9th Viet Cong Division was born, \n     and Binh Gia was chosen to be its first test by fire.\n       Binh Gia was a peaceful village surrounded by jungle and \n     populated mostly by Catholics who had fled to the South \n     following an earlier partition of their country. In late \n     December, one regiment of the 9th Division attacked the \n     village and quickly overran its lightly armed defenders. \n     Another regiment slipped into ambush positions around a \n     nearby clearing. They knew the American helicopters would be \n     coming soon, loaded with Vietnamese soldiers and their \n     American advisors.\n       The casualty toll mounted quickly. About midafternoon, I \n     took a load of wounded Vietnamese to Cong Hoa \n     General Military Hospital in Saigon and was diverted from \n     there to pick up an American who had been hit in an ambush \n     about 40 miles to the west, near the Cambodian border. \n     Because there was no tactical operations center or any of \n     the ubiquitous command and control helicopters hovering \n     over the battlefield, as was the case in later years, we \n     had to refuel at Saigon and return to Binh Gia to see if \n     we were still needed.\n       About 25 miles away from Binh Gia I began trying to contact \n     other aircraft in the area. I switched through several \n     frequencies that we had used earlier in the day before \n     hearing a gunship pilot talking with an American advisor on \n     the ground. It quickly became evident that the advisor was in \n     trouble because the gunship pilot kept telling him he could \n     not identify the disposition of his troops and was concerned \n     about firing on ``friendlies.''\n       The advisor said he was sorry but that he had used up all \n     of his smoke grenades and had nothing to mark his positions. \n     At that point, the advisor began identifying objects on the \n     ground in an attempt to guide the gunships. Finally, I heard \n     him say something to the effect of, ``Listen, I'm standing on \n     a small mound near a large clump of bushes and waving a white \n     handkerchief. You have clearance to fire anywhere more than a \n     hundred meters from my position.''\n       Shortly thereafter, the gunship pilot reported that he and \n     his wingman had fired all of their rockets and had little \n     machine-gun ammunition remaining. At this point, the gunship \n     pilot told the advisor to begin moving toward the Southwest \n     because he planned to land and pick him up. The advisor's \n     response was quick. ``Don't try it! They're all around me \n     down here, and all you'll do is get shot down.''\n       The gunship pilot encouraged him to move, but the advisor \n     was adamant that it was too dangerous for any rescue attempt. \n     After hearing this, I called the gunship pilot and told him \n     we were about 10 or 12 miles out and would pick up the \n     advisor if he could guide us into the area. The advisor \n     answered first: ``Negative; Dustoff. You can't make it, so \n     don't even try it!''\n       I thought we had a chance because I remain convinced to \n     this day that some of the earlier Viet Cong commanders would \n     not have allowed their troops to fire at our medevac \n     helicopters--whether out of respect for the red crosses or \n     because they knew we went to the aid of anyone who needed \n     help, I do not know. Many of the civilian casualties and \n     pregnant women whom we had evacuated from the villages had \n     husbands or relatives serving in the Viet Cong. As a result, \n     I honestly believe they took it easy on us during the early \n     part of the war. When U.S. combat units were introduced the \n     following spring, we became fair game like everyone else.\n       In any case, my crew and I planned to approach at treetop \n     level and touch down just long enough to haul the advisor \n     aboard. We had already begun descending when we heard him \n     say, ``Well, they are here now. My little people [slang for \n     South Vietnamese soldiers] are laying their weapons down, and \n     they want me to turn off my radio. Thanks a lot for your \n     help, and God bless you.''\n       With those words, he was gone. The gunship pilot reported \n     movement around the advisor's position, so we pulled up and \n     began orbiting the area. The gunship pilot then told me that \n     he and his wingman had to depart to refuel and rearm. I \n     called an approaching Army L-19 spotter plane to ask if more \n     gunships were on the way. The Bird Dog pilot said no.\n       The late afternoon sun began casting long shadows across \n     the jungle clearing below us, and it looked so peaceful from \n     our vantage point. At the same time, it was heartbreaking to \n     know that an American soldier had been captured and we were \n     helpless to do anything except orbit outside of small-arms \n     range.\n       Several minutes passed before our radio crackled to life \n     again, ``Have no fear, blue-eyed VNAF is here!'' The call \n     came from a flight of Vietnamese air force AI-E Skyraiders, \n     piloted by U.S. Air Force advisors. They were rushing to help \n     but were simply too late.\n       I left Vietnam the following summer and spent two years in \n     Japan before I returned to Vietnam. While in Japan, I was in \n     another medevac unit whose mission was to ferry casualties \n     from the air bases at Yokota and Tachikawa to several Army, \n     Navy and Air Force hospitals scattered around Tokyo. After \n     the more seriously wounded were sufficiently stabilized, we \n     returned them to the airheads for the long flight home.\n       One afternoon, I was reading a copy of The Stars and \n     Stripes while waiting for an inbound flight at Yokota. My \n     attention was drawn to an announcement by the North \n     Vietnamese government that an American POW had been shot in \n     retaliation for the slaying of a Viet Cong terrorist by South \n     Vietnamese forces. The article identified the POW as Army \n     Sgt. Harold G. Bennett, who had been captured at Binh Gia.\n       It suddenly dawned on me that I had never learned the name \n     of the soldier we were trying to save that afternoon, and \n     I began wondering whether it was Sgt. Bennett.\n       I am still troubled because our rescue attempt was \n     unsuccessful and I never learned the name of the soldier we \n     were trying to save. I have often wondered whether it would \n     have made a difference if the gunships had had more \n     ammunition or if we had arrived a few minutes earlier. After \n     many years of curiosity, I began trying to reconstruct the \n     events of that fateful day.\n       First, I contacted the Pentagon's MIA/POW office and was \n     referred to the Library of Congress. After obtaining several \n     microfiche from the library, I discovered that three \n     Americans had been captured at Binh Gia. Two of them were \n     Army enlisted men and the third was a U.S. Marine Corps \n     captain. While I cannot be certain, it appears the person \n     whom we were trying to save was Sgt. Bennett.\n       The data I have gathered contains little information about \n     Sgt. Bennett's actual capture, but there are several stirring \n     accounts about his later actions as told by other POWs who \n     were held with him in various camps. Their reports indicate \n     that Sgt. Bennett stubbornly resisted his captors at every \n     opportunity and that he participated in frequent hunger \n     strikes. These disruptions may have led to his being shot.\n       Like most of my compatriots, I have witnessed many heroic \n     acts over the years, but the person we were trying to save \n     that day ranks with the most courageous. I cannot imagine \n     what his thoughts were when things began to collapse around \n     him, and there is no way to fathom the despair he must have \n     felt while he was being led from the battlefield with \n     American helicopters circling a few hundred feet overhead.\n       I am still amazed that he could remain so calm during his \n     radio transmissions. To the end, his focus seemed to be on \n     our safety and not his. The willingness to sacrifice himself \n     instead of risking others was a remarkable demonstration of \n     valor. If I ever have to face a life-or-death situation \n     again, I hope I can find some of his courage.\n\n\n                    STAFF SERGEANT HAROLD G. BENNETT\n\n       Staff Sergeant Harold G. Bennett is inducted into the \n     Ranger Hall of Fame for extraordinary courage against \n     numerically superior forces on the battlefields of South \n     Vietnam, and for his conspicuous gallantry while held in \n     captivity by the Viet-Cong. While serving as a Ranger Advisor \n     to the 33rd Vietnamese Ranger Battalion, SSG Bennett \n     volunteered, on Christmas Day, to lead a seven man Ranger \n     combat team on a helicopter (named the ``Suicide Chopper'') \n     into a one-ship landing zone near the Cambodian border in an \n     effort to free three Americans held captive by communist \n     forces. Ranger Bennett and his snatch team landed and quickly \n     worked their way through the camp. The VC had moved the \n     prisoners prior to their arrival.\n       While this mission to liberate the captured Americans was \n     not accomplished, in no way did it detract from the heroic \n     efforts of SSG Bennett to free them. Four days later, on \n     December 29th, 1964, SSG Bennett, with his American RTO, \n     accompanied the 2nd Company of the 33rd Ranger Battalion on \n     the first airlift into Operational Area of the Legendary \n     ``Battle of Binh Gia.'' As the rangers were being overrun by \n     elements of the Viet Cong 9th Division, SSG Bennett remained \n     on the radio refusing any attempt to evacuate him and his RTO \n     from the overwhelming enemy forces and their firepower. After \n     SSG Bennett's capture at Binh Gia, he was labeled a \n     troublemaker by his captors because\n\n[[Page S7425]]\n\n     of his constant aggressiveness in the brutal conditions of \n     the jungle pow camps. He verbally berated his guards, daring \n     them to confront him man-to-man. On one of his three \n     unsuccessful escape attempts, a Viet Cong soldier almost bit \n     off SSG Bennett's finger as he punched the guard. Driven by \n     dedication to duty, personal honor, and his religious faith, \n     the enemy could not break him. In June of 1965, the Communist \n     National Liberation Front announced that they had executed \n     SSG Harold G. Bennett, reportedly in reprisal for actions of \n     the South Vietnamese government; he was the ``first'' \n     American soldier to be executed in Vietnam. Ranger Bennett's \n     exemplary boldness, complete disregard for his own safety, \n     and his deep concern for his fellow fighting men at the risk \n     of his own life, reflects the highest traditions of the \n     United States Army; his actions are the embodiment of the \n     Ranger Spirit.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/06/27/senate-section/article/S7425-1", "month": "06", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7425]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n          RECOGNIZING THE 50TH ANNIVERSARY OF TEMPLE BENJAMIN\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I would like to take this \nopportunity to pay tribute to the past and present leaders and \ncongregation of Temple Benjamin as they celebrate 50 years of service, \nlearning, and faith on June 25, 2005. This milestone provides the \nperfect opportunity to reflect on the rich history of this institution \nand to remember the many individuals who played an integral part in its \nsuccess.\n  In 1955 Rabbi Joseph Kratzenstein, who escaped Nazi persecution and \nultimately settled in Bay City, inspired the original idea for Temple \nBenjamin through his efforts to educate children in the Mount Pleasant \ncommunity. Upon arriving in Michigan, Rabbi Kratzenstein frequently \nvisited the Mount Pleasant area, drawing attention to the need for \nreligious education for local children. The rabbi's call was answered \nby Harry Goldberg, Leo Simon, Ben Traines, and Dr. Phil Silvert, who \nraised the necessary seed money to establish the temple we enjoy today.\n  Within 2 months of laying the first stone, the temple was completed \nand families began to use the services it provided. Temple Benjamin is \none of the first Jewish community and religious centers to be \nestablished in the Central Michigan area and began with 10 families, \nsome of whom would travel more than 50 miles for services. Today, the \ntemple serves more than 50 families and has continued to grow and \nembrace the surrounding community.\n  The founding mission of education, originally developed by Gene \nTraines, has remained a bedrock tenet of Temple Benjamin through the \nyears. Many notable community leaders, including Rose Traines, Mildred \nGoldberg, and Helen Klein, have helped to shape Temple Benjamin's \ninstructional elements and to promote community outreach.\n  In addition to its work with children in Michigan, Temple Benjamin \nhas contributed to the overall welfare and safety of our Nation through \nthe dedicated service of many in the congregation. There are many in \nthe congregation who served in our Armed Forces, including Robert \nKlein, Charles Muskowitz, Arnie Bransdorfer, Joe Simon, and Carvel \nWolfson, who served with distinction during WWII.\n  Through the years, those associated with Temple Benjamin have \nembodied the values of community spirit, faith, and leadership. I know \nmy Senate colleagues join me in congratulating the members of Temple \nBenjamin for their service to the community and in wishing them many \nmore years of success in the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/06/27/senate-section/article/S7425-2", "month": "06", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7425]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              SAMUEL NASSIE, 2005 EAGLE SCOUT OF THE YEAR\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise to share with my colleagues \nthe outstanding accomplishment of one of my constituents, Samuel Nassie \nof Paradise, CA. I am so proud to announce that in May 2005, Samuel was \nnamed the American Legion's national ``2005 Eagle Scout of the Year.''\n  The title of Eagle Scout represents the highest rank a Boy Scout can \nachieve. It takes years of hard work, dedication, leadership and \ncommunity service to earn this honor that only 4 percent of all Boy \nScouts achieve. Therefore, to be selected as the American Legion's \nEagle Scout of the Year from hundreds other highly qualified Eagle \nScouts across the Nation is an extraordinary achievement and I am very \nproud of Samuel for his accomplishments that led to this meritorious \nhonor.\n  Samuel's list of awards and accomplishments are too numerous to list \ntoday, but I would like to share with you some of his work that proves \nSamuel's dedication to his community is second to none. He was the \nfirst Boy Scout in Northern California to receive the William T. \nHornaday Award, the oldest conservation award in the history of this \ncountry, with only 1,000 recipients in its 94-year history. Because of \nhis service to the community, Samuel earned the Medal of Merit Award \nand the Congressional Youth Award in Bronze, Silver, and Gold. At the \nage of 13, Samuel achieved the rank of Eagle Scout. He was chosen as \nEagle Scout of the Year for both California and the United States by \nthe Sons of the American Revolution. The Veterans of Foreign Wars also \nchose him as Eagle Scout of the Year for California and awarded him \nsecond place in the United States. He is a member of the Boy Scout \nHonor Society, and a life member of the National Eagle Scout \nAssociation. Samuel remains active in the Boy Scouts of America by \nteaching at Boy Scout camps and serving as a Junior Scoutmaster for his \nlocal Boy Scout troop.\n  I would like to highlight two of Samuel's community projects that are \nparticularly noteworthy. In his first community service project, \n``Veterans Honor,'' Samuel created a program to locate, identify, plot \nand record the location of every veteran at his local cemetery. Another \ncommunity service project, ``Buckets Full of Batteries,'' created an \nenvironmental program to recycle household batteries. Four years ago, \nhe implemented this program in two school districts and over 20 \nbusinesses in Paradise, and is now working with 4 other cities to \nexpand his program.\n  Samuel maintains a 4.0 GPA, and plans to attend college and study \nAmerican History Education and Business. Samuel has selflessly given \nyears of his time and energy to the community.\n  Samuel Nassie brings a great deal of pride to California. He has \naccomplished more in his 17 years than most of us will in our entire \nlives. His community, State, and country are fortunate to have a \ncitizen of his caliber. I have no doubt that his future will be a \nbright and fulfilling one.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/06/27/senate-section/article/S7425-3", "month": "06", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7425]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                          ENROLLED BILL SIGNED\n\n  At 1:02 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the Speaker \nhas signed the following enrolled bill:\n\n       H.R. 1812.

A bill to amend a provision relating to employees of the \nUnited States assigned to, or employed by, and Indian tribe, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Indian Affairs.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to \naddress conflicts of interest and the appearance of conflicts involving \nformer Federal officers and employees who represent Indian tribes.\n  The legislation amends the Indian Self-Determination and Education \nAssistance Act (ISDEA), 25 US.C. 450i(j), by limiting the exemption \nfrom Federal conflicts of interest laws. Current law exempts from the \nconflicts laws former Federal officers and employees who ``are employed \nby Indian tribes'', thus permitting these former Federal employees \nimmediately to lobby the departments they just left and act as agents \nand attorneys for the tribes. The legislation limits this exemption \nonly to those former Federal employees who are employees of Indian \ntribes pursuant to self-determination contracts or self-governance \ncompacts.\n  The bill clarifies what I believe was the intent of the Congress, as \nevidenced by House Report No. 93-4600 that accompanies the ISDEA, that \nFederal employees who work in an area that is contracted or compacted \nto a tribe be able to continue performing their jobs if they become \nemployees of the Indian tribe for purposes of working in the contracted \nor compacted area. The exception that was made to the conflict laws \nappeared to have been made in response to the recognition that when \nIndian tribes took on the responsibility of operating programs \ntraditionally fulfilled by the Federal Government, they would need \nexperienced individuals to fulfill contracted or compacted functions.\n  Former Federal employees who leave the Federal Government and go to \nwork as outside lawyers or lobbyists for Indian tribes, however, would, \nunder the legislation I am introducing today, be subject to the same \nconflicts of interest restraints that apply to other former Federal \nemployees who work for other entities. The bill takes effect one year \nafter enactment to allow time for people to familiarize themselves with \nthe new law and for tribes to seek alternative representation if \nnecessary.\n  Limiting the waiver of conflicts laws in this manner proposed in this \nbill will address a problem identified by the Inspector General of the \nDepartment of Interior. In a report dated February 2002, entitled \n``Allegations Involving Irregularities in the Tribal Recognition \nProcess and Concerns Relating to Indian Gaming, the IG laid out a \nnumber of contacts by former BIA and DOI officials, who left Federal \nemployment to represent tribes at law firms, to the BIA regarding \nrecognition matters that, but for the exemption from the conflicts \nrules, they would be barred from making. The IG suggested that these \ncontacts were improper, but not illegal. These contacts were all made \nby former Federal employees who worked as outside lawyers and lobbyists \nfor tribes. In his testimony before the Senator Committee on Indian \nAffairs earlier this year, the Inspector General again raised the issue \nof conflicts of interest and referred to a problem of a ``revolving \ndoor'' involving former Department of Interior officials. This \nlegislation seeks to address that problem. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport it. I also ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1312\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Reducing Conflicts of \n     Interests in the Representation of Indian Tribes Act of \n     2005''.\n\n     SEC. 2. ADDITIONAL EMPLOYMENT RIGHTS.\n\n       Section 104 of the Indian Self-Determination and Education \n     Assistance Act (25 U.S.C. 450i) is amended by striking \n     subsection (j) and inserting the following:\n       ``(j) Additional Employment Rights.--\n       ``(1) In general.--Notwithstanding sections 205 and 207 of \n     title 18, United States Code, an officer or employee of the \n     United States assigned to an Indian tribe under section 3372 \n     of title 5, United States Code, or section 2072 of the \n     Revised Statutes (25 U.S.C. 48), or an individual that was \n     formerly an officer or employee of the United States and who \n     is an employee of an Indian tribe employed to perform \n     services pursuant to self-governance contracts or compacts \n     under this Act that the individual formerly performed for the \n     United States, may communicate with and appear before any \n     department, agency, court, or commission on behalf of the \n     Indian tribe with respect to any matter relating to the \n     contract or compact, including any matter in which the United \n     States is a party or has a direct and substantial interest.\n       ``(2) Notification of involvement in pending matter.--An \n     officer, employee, or former officer or employee described in \n     paragraph (1) shall submit to the head of each appropriate \n     department, agency, court, or commission, in writing, a \n     notification of any personal and substantial involvement the \n     officer, employee, or former officer or employee had as an \n     officer or employee of the United States with respect to the \n     pending matter.''.\n\n     SEC. 3. EFFECTIVE DATE.\n\n       The effective date of the amendment made by this Act shall \n     be the date that is 1 year after the date of enactment of \n     this Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CORNYN:\n  S. 1313. A bill to protect homes, small businesses, and other private \nproperty rights, by limiting the power of eminent domain; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce new legislation, \nentitled the Protection of Homes, Small Businesses, and Private \nProperty Act of 2005. I introduce this legislation in response to a \ncontroversial ruling of the United States Supreme Court issued just \nlast Thursday.\n  The protection of homes, small businesses, and other private property \nrights against government seizure and other unreasonable government \ninterference is a fundamental principle and core commitment of our \nNation's Founders. As Thomas Jefferson famously wrote on April 6, 1816, \nthe protection of such rights is:\n\n     the first principle of association, ``the guarantee to \n     everyone of a free exercise of his industry, and the fruits \n     acquired by it.''\n\n  The Fifth Amendment of the United States Constitution specifically \nprovides that ``private property'' shall not ``be taken for public use \nwithout just compensation.'' The Fifth Amendment thus provides an \nessential guarantee of liberty against the abuse of the power of \neminent domain, by permitting government to seize private property only \n``for public use.''\n  On June 23, 2005, the U.S. Supreme Court issued its controversial 5-4 \ndecision in Kelo v. City of New London. In that ruling, the Court \nacknowledged that ``it has long been accepted that the sovereign may \nnot take the property of A for the sole purpose of transferring it to \nanother private party B,''\n\n[[Page S7430]]\n\nand that under the Fifth Amendment, the power of eminent domain may be \nused only ``for public use.''\n  Yet the Court nevertheless held, by a 5-4 vote, that government may \nseize the home, small business, or other private property of one owner, \nand transfer that same property to another private owner, simply by \nconcluding that such a transfer would benefit the community through \nincreased economic development.\n  This is an alarming decision. As the Houston Chronicle editorialized \nthis past weekend:\n\n       It seems a bizarre anomaly. The government in China or \n     Russia might take private property to hand over to wealthy \n     developers to build shopping malls and office plazas, but it \n     wouldn't happen in the United States. Yet, that is the \n     practice the U.S. Supreme Court narrowly approved this week. \n     Local governments, the court ruled, may seize private homes \n     and businesses so that other private entities can develop the \n     land into enterprises that generate higher taxes.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of this editorial be printed in \nthe Record at the close of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. (See \nexhibit 1.)\n  Mr. CORNYN. The Court's decision in Kelo is alarming because, as \nJustice O'Connor accurately noted in her dissenting opinion, joined by \nthe Chief Justice and Justices Scalia and Thomas, the Court has:\n\n     effectively . . . delete[d] the words ``for public use'' from \n     the Takings Clause of the Fifth Amendment and thereby \n     ``refus[ed] to enforce properly the Federal Constitution.''\n\n  Under the Court's decision in Kelo, Justice O'Connor warns,\n\n     [t]he specter of condemnation hangs over all property. \n     Nothing is to prevent the State from replacing any Motel 6 \n     with a Ritz-Carlton, any home with a shopping mall, or any \n     farm with a factory.\n\n  She further warns that, under Kelo,\n\n     [a]ny property may now be taken for the benefit of another \n     private party, [and] the fallout from this decision will not \n     be random. The beneficiaries are likely to be those citizens \n     with disproportionate influence and power in the political \n     process, including large corporations and development firms. \n     As for the victims, the government now has license to \n     transfer property from those with fewer resources to those \n     with more. The Founders cannot have intended this perverse \n     result.\n  Indeed, as an amicus brief filed by the National Association for the \nAdvancement of Colored People, AARP, and other organizations noted:\n\n     [a]bsent a true public use requirement, the takings power \n     will be employed more frequently. The takings that result \n     will disproportionately affect and harm the economically \n     disadvantaged and, in particular, racial and ethnic \n     minorities and the elderly.\n\n  In a way, the Kelo decision at least vindicates supporters of the \nnomination of Justice Janice Rogers Brown to the U.S. Court of Appeals \nfor the D.C. Circuit. That nomination attracted substantial controversy \nin some quarters, because of Justice Brown's personal passion for the \nprotection of private property rights. The Kelo decision announced last \nThursday demonstrates that her concerns about excessive government \ninterference with property rights is well-founded and well within the \nmainstream of American jurisprudence.\n  The Houston Chronicle has called upon lawmakers to take action, \neditorializing this past weekend that:\n\n     lawmakers would do well to pass restrictions on this \n     distasteful form of eminent domain.\n\n  I firmly agree.\n  It is appropriate for Congress to take action, consistent with its \nlimited powers under the Constitution, to restore the vital protections \nof the Fifth Amendment and to protect homes, small businesses, and \nother private property rights against unreasonable government use of \nthe power of eminent domain.\n  That is why I am introducing today the Protection of Homes, Small \nBusinesses, and Private Property Act of 2005. The legislation would \ndeclare Congress's view that the power of eminent domain should be \nexercised only ``for public use,'' as guaranteed by the Fifth \nAmendment, and that this power to seize homes, small businesses, and \nother private property should be reserved only for true public uses. \nMost importantly, the power of eminent domain should not be used simply \nto further private economic development. The act would apply this \nstandard to two areas of government action which are clearly within \nCongress's authority to regulate: (1) All exercises of eminent domain \npower by the Federal Government, and (2) all exercises of eminent \ndomain power by State and local government through the use of Federal \nfunds.\n  It would likewise be appropriate for states to take action to \nvoluntarily limit their own power of eminent domain. As the Court in \nKelo noted, ``nothing in our opinion precludes any State from placing \nfurther restrictions on its exercise of the takings power.''\n  The protection of homes, small businesses, and other private property \nrights against government seizure and other unreasonable government \ninterference is a fundamental principle and core commitment of our \nNation's Founders. The Kelo decision was a disappointment, but I \ncongratulate the attorneys at the Institute for Justice for their \nexceptional legal work and for their devotion to liberty. We must not \ngive up, and I know that the talented lawyers at the Institute for \nJustice have no intention of giving up. In the aftermath of Kelo, we \nmust take all necessary action to restore and strengthen the \nprotections of the Fifth Amendment. I ask my colleagues to lend their \nsupport to this effort, by supporting the Protection of Homes, Small \nBusinesses, and Private Property Act of 2005.\n\n                                Exhibit 1\n\n                             Stealing Home\n\n       It seems a bizarre anomaly. The government in China or \n     Russia might take private property to hand over to wealthy \n     developers to build shopping malls and office plazas, but it \n     wouldn't happen in the United States. Yet, that is the \n     practice the U.S. Supreme Court narrowly approved this week. \n     Local governments, the court ruled, may seize private homes \n     and businesses so that other private entities can develop the \n     land into enterprises that generate higher taxes.\n       The Supreme Court found, 5-4, that local elected officials \n     are not barred by the Constitution from condemning whole \n     neighborhoods and small businesses if, in their view, doing \n     so would lead to redevelopment that increases tax \n     collections.\n       A majority on the court was convinced that the possibility \n     of improving the tax base for the benefit of the wider \n     community satisfies the Fifth Amendment's requirement that \n     private property can be taken by eminent domain only for a \n     public purpose.\n       Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, who dissented, pinpointed the \n     problem with the majority's argument. It cedes \n     ``disproportionate influence and power'' to a community's \n     most powerful and well-connected residents.\n       Public parks, schools and right of way for thoroughfares \n     traditionally have provided the sort of public purpose to \n     justify government's use of eminent domain. Grand \n     redevelopment schemes, especially when they are cooked up by \n     government officials, often lack a sound economic basis and \n     carry the potential of becoming boondoggles that hurt \n     taxpayers.\n       Justice John Paul Stevens wrote for the majority that local \n     officials are qualified judges of whether an economic \n     development project will benefit the community. In this case, \n     city officials in New London, Conn., plan to tear down \n     private homes to make way for a riverfront hotel, offices and \n     a fitness club.\n       ``The city has carefully formulated an economic development \n     that it believes will provide appreciable benefits to the \n     community, including--but by no means limited to--new jobs \n     and increased tax revenue,'' Stevens wrote.\n       But is that universally true? Municipal and county \n     governing bodies frequently miscalculate or wildly \n     overestimate the benefits of tax abatements and other \n     incentives.\n       Besides that, individual taxpayers don't necessarily \n     benefit from increased government revenues.\n       Sometimes the increased revenue proves insufficient to \n     cover the cost of providing services to new development. \n     Sometimes increased revenues are wasted on things other than \n     essential services.\n       Now that the high court has cleared the way for elected \n     officeholders to trump private property rights, abuse of \n     eminent domain becomes more likely, particularly in \n     neighborhoods populated by the least influential citizens. In \n     Texas, lawmakers would do well to pass restrictions on this \n     distasteful form of eminent domain.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LUGAR:\n  S. 1315. A bill to require a report on progress toward the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Foreign \nRelations.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill that calls \non the administration to assess the progress of poverty reduction \nefforts around the world since September 2000, when the Millennium \nDeclaration was unanimously adopted by more than 180 nations, including \nthe United States. Each of these nations signed an agreement to work \ntoward defined objectives, called the Millennium Development Goals, \nwhich include the commitments to: build a global partnership for\n\n[[Page S7431]]\n\ndevelopment; eradicate extreme poverty by halving the number of people \nliving on less than one dollar a day and the number who suffer hunger; \nachieve universal primary education for boys and girls alike; reduce by \ntwo-thirds the under-5 child mortality rate; halt and reverse the \nspread of AIDS, malaria and other major disease; promote gender \nequality, reduce maternal mortality by two-thirds; and ensure \nenvironmental sustainability.\n  This bill also highlights the important research and recommendations \nof the Report of the Commission for Africa that was commissioned by \nPrime Minister Tony Blair in preparation for the July 2005 G8 Summit in \nScotland. The report, entitled ``Our Common Interest,'' is an excellent \nstudy of past development efforts and current opportunities to respond \nto the challenges of extreme poverty in Africa.\n  Three important international forums will occur this year that will \nhelp define the world's response to extreme poverty; the group of Eight \nhighly industrialized countries will meet in July at Gleneagles, \nScotland and will address the challenges and opportunities of the \nAfrican continent; The United Nations Summit to review progress on the \nMillennium Development Goals will occur in September. It will provide \nan opportunity to measure global coherence and commitment to specific \nobjectives in eradicating extreme poverty by 2015; and the The Sixth \nMinisterial Conference of the World Trade Organization will meet in \nHong Kong in December. Progress toward a genuinely equitable trade \nround in Hong Kong could provide a significant boost to global \ninternational development.\n  This bill asks that the Secretary of State produce a report on the \ncommitments made by the United States and the international community \nto achieve the Millennium Development Goals, including the decisions \nmade in regard to these goals in the three upcoming summits. It asks \nthat the report assess the prospects of achieving these goals by 2015 \nand to review policies that maintain continued United States leadership \nin reducing poverty worldwide. The report would be due 60 days after \nthe completion of the WTO summit December 13-18, 2005.\n\n  The purpose of this report is to encourage a discussion of the goals \nthemselves and the practical challenges with which each of these goals \nmust contend. This discussion should take place within and among donor \nand developing governments, on a continuing basis. The upcoming summits \nare an important opportunity to continue that discussion as well as to \nmake concrete efforts, and if necessary adjustments, to achieving such \ngoals.\n  Since the Millennium Summit in 2000, the United States has taken \nsteps to invest in development in a more comprehensive manner. \nPresident Bush made an historic commitment to address the threat and \nimpact of HIV-AIDS on the countries most affected by this pandemic. The \nUnited States also established a bold new development initiative that \nclosely parallels important elements of the MDGs and the \nrecommendations of the Commission for Africa report. The Millennium \nChallenge Corporation has begun to deliver billions in assistance to \ndeveloping nations that are committed to investing in their own people, \nto ruling justly, and to encouraging economic freedom. In addition, the \nUnited States removed barriers to trade with eligible African countries \nthrough the successful Africa Growth and Opportunity Act.\n  There are many other significant efforts by the United States to \naddress the challenges to poor countries face, from technical \nassistance to bilateral and multi-lateral debt relief, from peacekeeper \ntraining and equipping to capacity building and emergency assistance. \nWhether bilaterally or through multilateral institutions, the \ninternational community should capitalize on a coordinated strategy \nthat reinforces the prospect of a more peaceful and stable world.\n  The commitment of the United States to the moral and humanitarian \ngoal of reducing the inequities seen across the developing world is a \nkey factor in achieving greater security at home and abroad. Since \nSeptember 11, 2001, our nation has been engaged in a debate over how to \napply national power and resources most effectively to realize the \nmaximum degree of security. Throughout this process, I have been making \nthe point that we are not placing sufficient weight on the diplomatic \nand economic tools of national power.\n  Even as we seek to capture key terrorists and destroy terrorist \nunits, we must be working to perfect a longer term strategy that \nreshapes the world in ways that are not conducive to terrorist \nrecruitment and influence. To win the war against terrorism, the United \nStates must assign U.S. economic and diplomatic capabilities the same \nstrategic priority that we assign to military capabilities. There are \nno shortcuts to victory. We must commit ourselves to the painstaking \nwork of foreign policy day by day and year by year. As we undertake \nthis mission, we must be persistent in our advocacy among our fellow \nnations to encourage a global partnership and commitment to eradicating \npoverty.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1315\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``International Cooperation to \n     Meet the Millennium Development Goals Act of 2005''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) At the United Nations Millennium Summit in 2000, the \n     United States joined more than 180 other countries in \n     committing to work toward goals to improve life for the \n     world's poorest people by 2015.\n       (2) Such goals include reducing the proportion of people \n     living on less than $1 per day by \\1/2\\, reducing child \n     mortality by \\2/3\\, and assuring basic education for all \n     children, while sustaining the environment upon which human \n     life depends.\n       (3) At the 2002 International Conference on Financing for \n     Development, the United States representative reiterated the \n     support of the United States for the Millennium Development \n     Goals and advocated, along with other international \n     participants, for a stronger focus on measurable outcomes \n     derived from a global partnership between developed and \n     developing countries.\n       (4) On March 22, 2002, President Bush stated, ``We fight \n     against poverty because hope is an answer to terror. We fight \n     against poverty because opportunity is a fundamental right to \n     human dignity. We fight against poverty because faith \n     requires it and conscience demands it. We fight against \n     poverty with a growing conviction that major progress is \n     within our reach.''.\n       (5) The 2002 National Security Strategy of the United \n     States notes that ``a world where some live in comfort and \n     plenty, while half of the human race lives on less than $2 \n     per day, is neither just nor stable. Including all of the \n     world's poor in an expanding circle of development and \n     opportunity is a moral imperative and one of the top \n     priorities of U.S. international policy''.\n       (6) The National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the \n     United States concluded that the Government of the United \n     States must offer an example of moral leadership in the world \n     and offer parents and their children a vision of the future \n     that emphasizes individual educational and economic \n     opportunity as essential to the efforts of the United States \n     to defeat global terrorism.\n       (7) The summit of the Group of Eight scheduled for July \n     2005, the United Nations summit scheduled for September 2005, \n     and the Sixth Ministerial Conference of the World Trade \n     Organization scheduled for December 2005 will provide \n     opportunities to measure and continue to pursue progress on \n     the Millennium Development Goals.\n       (8) The summit of the Group of Eight scheduled for July 6 \n     through July 8, 2005, in Gleneagles, Scotland, will bring \n     together the countries that can make the greatest \n     contribution to alleviating extreme poverty in Africa, the \n     region of the world where extreme poverty is most prevalent.\n       (9) On June 11, 2005, the United States helped secure the \n     agreement of the Group of Eight Finance Ministers to cancel \n     100 percent of the debt obligations owed to the World Bank, \n     African Development Bank, and International Monetary Fund by \n     countries that are eligible for debt relief under the Highly \n     Indebted Poor Countries Initiative, the initiative \n     established in 1996 by the World Bank and the International \n     Monetary Fund for the purpose of reducing the debt burdens of \n     the world's poorest countries, or under the Enhanced HIPC \n     Initiative, as defined in section 1625 of the International \n     Financial Institutions Act (22 U.S.C. 262p-8), which are poor \n     countries that are on the path to reform.\n       (10) The report prepared by the Commission for Africa and \n     issued by Prime Minister Tony Blair on March 11, 2005, \n     entitled ``Our Common Interest'', called for coherence and \n     coordination in the development of an overarching package of \n     actions to be carried out by the countries of Africa and the \n     international community to address the complex\n\n[[Page S7432]]\n\n     interlocking issues that challenge the continent, many of \n     which have already been addressed individually in previous \n     summits and under the Africa Action Plan enacted by the Group \n     of Eight.\n       (11) The United States has recognized the need for \n     strengthened economic and trade opportunities, as well as \n     increased financial and technical assistance to Africa and \n     other countries burdened by extreme poverty, through \n     significant initiatives in recent years, including--\n       (A) the African Growth and Opportunity Act (19 U.S.C. 3701 \n     et seq.) that has opened United States markets to thousands \n     of products from Africa;\n       (B) the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief \n     developed under section 101 of the United States Leadership \n     Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Act of 2003 (22 \n     U.S.C. 7611), the major focus of which has been on African \n     countries;\n       (C) the Millennium Challenge Corporation established under \n     section 604 of the Millennium Challenge Act of 2003 (22 \n     U.S.C. 7703) that is in the process of committing new and \n     significant levels of assistance to countries, including \n     countries in Africa, that are poor but show great promise for \n     boosting economic growth and bettering the lives of their \n     people; and\n       (D) the United States has canceled 100 percent of the \n     bilateral debt owed to the United States by countries \n     eligible for debt relief under the Enhanced HIPC Initiative.\n       (12) The report prepared by the Commission for Africa \n     entitled ``Our Common Interest'' includes the following \n     findings:\n       (A) The people of Africa must demonstrate the leadership \n     necessary to address the governance challenges they face, \n     setting priorities that ensure the development of effective \n     civil and police services, independent judiciaries, and \n     strong parliaments, all of which reinforce a stable and \n     predictable economic environment attractive to investment.\n       (B) Many leaders in Africa have pursued personal self-\n     interest rather than national goals, a tendency that has been \n     in some instances exacerbated and abetted by the manipulation \n     of foreign governments pursuing their own agenda in the \n     region to the detriment of the people of Africa.\n       (C) More violent conflict has occurred in Africa during the \n     period between 1965 and 2005 than occurred in any other \n     continent during that period, and the countries of Africa \n     must engage on the individual, national, and regional level \n     to prevent and manage conflict.\n       (D) The capacity to trade is constrained by a derelict or \n     nonexistent infrastructure in most African countries as well \n     as by the double-edged sword of tariff and nontariff barriers \n     to trade that complicate markets and discourage investment \n     both within and beyond the continent.\n       (E) The local resources for investment in people and the \n     institutions necessary for good governance have been \n     squandered, misappropriated, and, to an increasingly \n     devastating effect, spent on servicing debt to the developed \n     world. Such resources should be reoriented to serve the needs \n     of the people through the use of debt forgiveness and support \n     for institutional reform and internal capacity building.\n       (F) Failing to prevent conflict in Africa results in \n     incalculable costs to African development and expense to the \n     international community and the investment in preventing \n     conflict is a fraction of such costs and expenses, in human, \n     security, and financial terms.\n       (G) Despite difficulties, there is optimism and energy \n     reflected in the scope of activities of individuals such as \n     2004 Nobel Peace Prize recipient, Wangari Maathai, as well as \n     those of improved regional organizations such as the African \n     Union and the New Partnership for Economic Development's Peer \n     Review Mechanism, and subregional entities such as the \n     Economic Community of West African States, the Inter-\n     Governmental Authority on Development, and the potential of \n     the Southern African Development Community.\n       (H) Political reform in Africa has produced results. For \n     example, while in 1985 countries of sub-Saharan Africa ruled \n     by dictators were the norm, by 2005 dictatorships are a \n     minority and democracy has new life with governments chosen \n     by the people increasing fourfold since 1991.\n       (13) The report prepared by the Commission for Africa \n     entitled ``Our Common Interest'' includes the following \n     recommendations:\n       (A) At this vital moment when globalization and growth, \n     technology and trade, and mutual security concerns allow, and \n     common humanity demands, a substantial tangible and coherent \n     package of actions should immediately be taken by the \n     international community, led by the most industrialized \n     countries, in partnership with the countries of Africa, to \n     address the poverty and underdevelopment of the African \n     continent.\n       (B) The people of Africa must take responsibility and show \n     courageous leadership in addressing problems and taking \n     ownership of solutions as the means for ensuring sustainable \n     development, while implementing governance reform as an \n     underlying prerequisite for foreign assistance effectiveness.\n       (C) Each developed country has unique strengths and \n     capacity to add value to a comprehensive assistance plan and \n     should join their individual efforts to a coherent whole that \n     is more efficient and responsive to Africa and the people of \n     Africa.\n       (D) The international community must honor existing \n     commitments to strengthen African peacekeeping capacity and \n     go beyond those commitments to invest in more effective \n     prevention and nonmilitary means to resolve conflict through \n     such regional organizations as the African Union and the \n     subregional Economic Community for West African States.\n       (E) A massive investment in physical infrastructure should \n     be made to support commerce, extend governance, and provide \n     opportunities for education, healthcare, investment and \n     growth.\n       (F) Donors and the governments of the countries of Africa \n     should devote substantial investment in the men and women of \n     Africa through the education and health sectors, enabling and \n     extending recent gains made to reach far more broadly into \n     remote regions.\n       (G) The public sector should actively engage the private \n     sector in driving growth through partnerships by reforming \n     the laws, bureaucracy, and infrastructure necessary to \n     maintain a climate that fosters investment by developing \n     public-private centers of excellence to pursue such reforms.\n       (H) The countries of Africa must maximize the participation \n     of women in both business and government, protect the rights \n     of women, and work to increase the number of women in \n     leadership positions so as to capitalize on the ability of \n     women to deliver scarce resources effectively and fairly.\n       (I) The international community must work together to \n     dismantle trade barriers, including the immediate elimination \n     of trade-distorting commodity support.\n       (J) International donors should strengthen multilateral \n     institutions in Africa to respond appropriately to local and \n     regional crises as well as to promote economic development \n     and ensure the people of Africa are granted a stronger voice \n     in international forums.\n       (K) The international community must join in providing \n     creative incentives for commercial firms to research and \n     develop products that improve water, sanitation, health, and \n     the environment in ways that would dramatically reduce \n     suffering and increase productive life-spans in Africa.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to provide for the collection and maintenance of cord \nblood units for the treatment of patients and research, and to amend \nthe Public Health Service Act to authorize the Bone Marrow and Cord \nBlood Cell Transplantation Program to increase the number of \ntransplants for recipients suitable matched to donors of bone marrow \nand cord blood; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, today, I am pleased to introduce ``The Bone \nMarrow and Cord Blood Therapy and Research Act of 2005.'' I am grateful \nthat Senators Dodd, Burr, Reed and Ensign have joined me as sponsors of \nthis important, bipartisan bill. All five sponsors of this bill have \nbeen working on this legislation for the past few months. We have met \nwith organizations that are deeply interested in participating in this \nnew program and heard their input. We talked to other Senators, \nincluding members of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pension \nCommittee, who have a deep commitment to getting this legislation \nsigned into law by the President. This bill was a group effort and I \ncommend the sponsors of this bill on a job well done.\n  I am pleased that this legislation will be considered by the Senate \nHELP Committee on Wednesday; we are hopeful it will then be passed by \nthe Senate in the near future. HELP Chairman Enzi and Ranking Democrat \nKennedy and their staffs have been very supportive of our efforts in \ngetting this bill through the Senate in a timely manner. I greatly \nappreciate their willingness to work with all of us on this important \nissue.\n  As many of my colleagues know, I introduced a bill earlier this year \nS. 681, the Cord Blood Stem Cell Act of 2005. I have introduced that \nlegislation during the past three Congresses. The bill I have \nintroduced with my colleagues today is a much improved version of my \noriginal cord blood legislation, primarily because it reflects a \ncompromise between the key stakeholder groups that are deeply \ninterested in providing federal funding to establish cord blood banks \nfor public use. This legislation creates an easily accessible network \nof adult stem cell transplant material for the treatment of patients \nand supports the research into the uses of such cells.\n  One of the biggest changes in this bill is the establishment of a \nthree year demonstration project for the collection and storage of cord \nblood units for a family in which a child has been diagnosed with a \ncondition that will benefit from a cord blood transplant at no cost to \nthe family. When we were meeting with individuals interested in this \nlegislation, we were told by scientific experts that the most \nsuccessful cord blood transplants come from a sibling's cord blood. \nOnce a cord blood unit is put in a public cord blood bank, there is no \nguarantee that a family will be able to get that specific cord blood \nunit back if it is needed. Therefore, we believed that it was necessary \nto create this demonstration project so that families would have \nimmediate access to its cord blood units. It is important to emphasize \nthat the only families that may participate in this demonstration \nproject are those that have a sick child or parent.\n  In addition, this legislation includes language calling for single \npoint of access. The purpose of a single point of access is to provide \nhealth care providers with the ability to search for bone marrow donors \nand cord blood units through a single electronic point of access. \nToday, doctors have to search several places in order to find available \ncord blood units and bone marrow donors. A single point of access \nimproves this process dramatically for both doctor and patient by \nmaking the search process much more efficient.\n  There is strong, bipartisan interest throughout the Congress for \nusing adult stem cells to treat a wide variety of medical conditions. \nOur bill not only reauthorizes the National Marrow Donor Program, but \nit also creates a national network of public cord blood banks. \nTogether, these two programs for umbilical cord blood and adult bone \nmarrow will provide us with a widely-accepted source of hematopoietic \nstem cells for transplant and research.\n  For several decades, thousands of Americans have received and been \nsaved by bone marrow transplants. But thousands more die for lack of an \nappropriate donor. The good news is that research now suggests that the \nblood and stem cells from human placenta and umbilical cords may in \nsome cases provide an alternative to bone marrow transplantation. For \nsome patients, particularly those for whom a bone marrow match cannot \nbe found, transplantation of these cells may be a life-saving therapy. \nCord blood stem cells are readily available, and they require less-\nstringent matching from donors to recipients, thus decreasing the \ndifficulty of finding a fully matched donor.\n  Cord blood transplantation has been used successfully to treat \nleukemia, lymphoma, immunodeficiency diseases, sickle cell anemia, and \ncertain metabolic diseases. However, the number of available cord blood \nstem cell units in the United States is insufficient to meet the need. \nThe Bone Marrow and Cord Blood Therapy and Research Act of 2005 will \nestablish an inventory of 150,000 new cord blood stem cell units that \nreflects the diversity of the United States' population. In conjunction \nwith the five million potential bone marrow donors registered through \nthe National Marrow Donor Program, this cord blood network will enable \n95 percent of Americans to receive an appropriately matched transplant.\n  The Bone Marrow and Cord Blood Therapy and Research Act of 2005 also \nincorporates recommendations from the Institute of Medicine's recent \nreport on cord blood. The Institute provided Congress with guidelines \nand recommendations to enhance the structure, function, and utility of \nthe program. As a result, I am confident that this Nation's system for \nobtaining adult stem cells for transplantation purposes will improve \ndramatically, and that many more of our citizens will have access to \nthe life-saving therapies they offer. Through transplants of this \nnature, we can finally cure previously incurable diseases such as \nsickle cell anemia. It is my hope that this legislation will help us \nensure that children with this and other illnesses will be able to \nachieve their full potential, unhindered by poor health.\n  My goal, which I share with the other sponsors of this bill, is to \ncreate the best possible system to provide patients, clinicians, and \nfamilies with access to these life-saving treatments. I believe the \ncurrent bill does this by ensuring that the number of bone marrow \ndonors and cord blood units available for transplant and research \nincreases in the coming years.\n  The integrated system will include not only the international bone \nmarrow donor registry, but also a network of qualified cord blood banks \nwhich will collect, test, and preserve cord blood stem cells. In \naddition, the system will educate and recruit donors, facilitate the \nrapid matching of donors and recipients, and quickly make such cells \navailable to transplant centers for stem cell transplantation.\n  The establishment of a national infrastructure for transplant \nmaterial will help save the lives of thousands of critically ill \nAmericans. We must be sure that our Nation can meet the needs of \npatients and physicians by ensuring a strong future for bone marrow and \ncord blood in this country. My primary goal is to ensure that the \namount of transplant material available for patient care and research \nincreases in the coming years. The only way that goal may be \naccomplished is through strong federal support. I look forward to \nworking with my colleagues on doing everything possible to provide \ntransplant patients with the best possible options by ensuring a strong \nfuture for bone marrow and cord blood transplantation in this country. \nThis is a good bill and I urge my colleagues to support it.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n\n[[Page S7434]]\n\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1317\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Bone Marrow and Cord Blood \n     Therapy and Research Act of 2005''.\n\n     SEC. 2. CORD BLOOD INVENTORY.\n\n       (a) In General.--The Secretary of Health and Human Services \n     shall enter into one-time contracts with qualified cord blood \n     banks to assist in the collection and maintenance of 150,000 \n     new units of high-quality cord blood to be made available for \n     transplantation through the Bone Marrow and Cord Blood Cell \n     Transplantation Program and to carry out the requirements of \n     subsection (b).\n       (b) Requirements.--The Secretary shall require each \n     recipient of a contract under this section--\n       (1) to acquire, tissue-type, test, cryopreserve, and store \n     donated units of cord blood acquired with the informed \n     consent of the donor in a manner that complies with \n     applicable Federal and State regulations;\n       (2) to encourage donation from a genetically diverse \n     population;\n       (3) to make cord blood units that are collected pursuant to \n     this section or otherwise and meet all applicable Federal \n     standards available to transplant centers for \n     transplantation;\n       (4) to make cord blood units that are collected, but not \n     appropriate for clinical use, available for peer-reviewed \n     research;\n       (5) to make data available, as required by the Secretary \n     and consistent with section 379(c)(3) of the Public Health \n     Service Act (42 U.S.C. 274k(c)(3)), as amended by this Act, \n     in a standardized electronic format, as determined by the \n     Secretary, for the Bone Marrow and Cord Blood Cell \n     Transplantation Program; and\n       (6) to submit data in a standardized electronic format for \n     inclusion in the stem cell therapeutic outcomes database \n     maintained under section 379A of the Public Health Service \n     Act, as amended by this Act.\n       (c) Related Cord Blood Donors.--\n       (1) In general.--The Secretary shall establish a 3-year \n     demonstration project under which qualified cord blood banks \n     receiving a contract under this section may use a portion of \n     the funding under such contract for the collection and \n     storage of cord blood units for a family where a first-degree \n     relative has been diagnosed with a condition that will \n     benefit from transplantation (including selected blood \n     disorders, malignancies, metabolic storage disorders, \n     hemoglobinopathies, and congenital immunodeficiencies) at no \n     cost to such family.

REPORT ON LICENSURE OF CORD BLOOD UNITS.\n\n       Not later than 90 days after the date of enactment of this \n     Act, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, in \n     consultation with the Commissioner of Food and Drugs, shall \n     submit to Congress a report concerning the progress made by \n     the Food and Drug Administration in developing requirements \n     for the licensing of cord blood units.\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senator Hatch, Senator \nBurr, Senator Reed, and Senator Ensign in introducing legislation that \nwill significantly benefit some of the most gravely ill patients--those \nin need of a blood stem cell transplant. By reauthorizing the national \nprogram for bone marrow, creating a similar program for umbilical cord \nblood, and expanding the national stockpile of umbilical cord blood \nunits, this legislation will dramatically increase the chances that \npatients in need of a life-saving transplant will be able to find an \nappropriate genetic match.\n  The bill that we are introducing today is similar to legislation that \nSenator Hatch and I introduced earlier this year to create a national \nnetwork of cord blood banks and a cord blood registry. However, there \nare two important differences. First, this legislation is consistent \nwith recommendations made by the Institute of Medicine, IOM, in their \nrecent report, ``Cord Blood: Establishing a National Hematopoietic Stem \nCell Bank Program,'' about the structure of a national cord blood \nprogram. Second, and more importantly, this bill would also reauthorize \nthe national bone marrow program, and put both bone marrow and cord \nblood under the auspices of a single national program. This structure \nreflects the complimentary nature of bone marrow and cord blood, and \nwill ensure that physicians and patients can more easily find the best \npossible match for transplantation.\n  The therapeutic benefits of bone marrow are well established. Bone \nmarrow transplants have been used for nearly half a century to treat \npatients suffering from diseases such as leukemia, Hodgkin's Disease, \nsickle cell anemia, and others. The use of cord blood as an alternative \nto bone marrow is a more recent development, but one that is just as \npromising and exciting.\n  The bill that we are introducing today will begin a new national \ncommitment to the development of this technology which has the \npotential to reduce pain and suffering and save the lives of so many \nAmericans afflicted with some of the most debilitating illnesses. Cord \nblood has already been used successfully in treating a number of \ndiseases, including sickle cell anemia and certain childhood cancers. \nHowever, the use of cord blood is still in an early stage relative to \nthe use of bone marrow, and may have even broader application in the II \nfuture.\n  Like many Americans, I had never heard of cord blood before the birth \nof my first daughter, almost 4 years ago. It is not widely used--at \nleast in this country. Approximately 95 percent of all bone marrow \nreconstitutions are done using a bone marrow transplant--only 5 percent \nuse cord blood. This figure is surprising when we consider the benefits \nof cord blood.\n  First, it can be very difficult to find a suitable bone marrow donor. \nAccording to a General Accounting Office, GAO, report, of the 15,231 \nindividuals needing bone marrow transplants between 1997 and 2000 who \nconducted a preliminary search of the National Bone Marrow Donor \nRegistry, NBMDR, only 4,056 received a transplant--a 27 percent success \nrate. This number is even lower for minorities. Cord blood would not \nonly produce an additional source of donation; it also does not require \nas exact a genetic match as bone marrow.\n\n  In addition, cord blood is readily available. While it can take \nmonths between finding a bone marrow match and actually receiving a \ntransplant, a unit of cord blood can be utilized in a matter of days or \nweeks. Cord blood also lowers the risk of complications for both the \ndonor and the recipient. The need to extract bone marrow from the donor \nis eliminated, and the risk of infection or rejection by the recipient \nis significantly reduced. Finally, research has suggested that cord \nblood might produce better outcomes than bone morrow in children.\n  Why then, given all of these benefits, has the use of cord blood not \nbecome much more prevalent in the United States? In Japan, where the \nuse of cord blood in clinical settings is more advanced, nearly half of \nall transplants now use cord blood rather than bone marrow.\n  The relatively infrequent use of cord blood in our country is at \nleast partly attributable to the lack of a national infrastructure for \nthe matching and distribution of cord blood units. There are a handful \nof cord blood banks around the country doing excellent work, but there \nis a much more developed infrastructure for bone marrow. This is thanks \nto legislation passed by Congress in 1986 that established a national \nregistry for bone marrow, which this bill would reauthorize. Our bill\n\n[[Page S7438]]\n\nwould create a similar infrastructure for cord blood, operating under \nthe auspices of a newly established Bone Marrow and Cord Blood Cell \nTransplantation Program. In addition to connecting physicians and \npatients with a suitable bone marrow donor or cord blood unit, the \nprogram would be required to educate the general public about cord \nblood and bone marrow, and encourage an ethnically diverse population \nof donors.\n  Our bill would also provide grants to qualified cord blood banks to \nacquire 150,000 new cord blood units. This number is consistent with \nrecommendations made by the IOM, and should be sufficient to provide a \nsuitable match for 90 percent of the U.S. population.\n  Finally, the legislation authorizes an appropriation of $15 million \nfor each of fiscal years 2007 through 2010 for the cord blood inventory \ngrants, and $186 million over the next 5 years for the establishment \nand maintenance of the Bone Marrow and Cord Blood Cell Transplantation \nProgram.\n  Before finishing today I would like to make it clear that, just as I \nbelieve that cord blood should act as a complement to, not a \nreplacement for, bone marrow, I also believe that cord blood does not \neliminate the need for research into the potential benefits of \nembryonic stem cells. Just as cord blood seems to be preferable to bone \nmarrow for treating certain individuals or conditions--and the reverse \nis certainly true as well--the same may prove to be true for embryonic \nstem cells. Certainly, we should provide doctors with the best tools to \nhelp cure their patients, whether those tools come from bone marrow, \ncord blood, embryonic stem cells, or another source entirely.\n  I firmly believe that the strengthening of our national \ninfrastructure for bone marrow and the creation of a similar \ninfrastructure for cord blood will save the lives of thousands of \ngravely ill Americans. I urge my colleagues to support this \nlegislation.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I join my colleagues, Senators Ensign, Dodd, \nHatch, and Burr, in introducing the Bone Marrow and Cord Blood Therapy \nand Research Act of 2005. This bipartisan legislation represents a \ncritical step forward in expanding access to lifesaving therapies to \nmillions of patients with conditions that can be treated and even cured \nwith bone marrow or cord blood.\n  The bill we are introducing today builds upon the already highly \nsuccessful National Marrow Donor Program that has been in operation \nsince 1987. In addition to reauthorizing this program, our bill calls \nfor the establishment of a formal registry of cord blood units \navailable for transplantation and expands to cord blood transplant \nrecipients many of the program's existing functions, such as donor \nrecruitment, education, information, and patient advocacy, presently \navailable to only bone marrow recipients. It creates an umbrella \nprogram, aptly called the Bone Marrow and Cord Blood Cell \nTransplantation Program.\n  Our legislation also captures many of the key recommendations of the \nInstitute of Medicine, IOM, in their April 2004 report entitled, ``Cord \nBlood: Establishing a National Hematopoietip Stem Cell Bank Program.'' \nThe report called for a stepped up effort to expand the inventory of \ncord blood units available for transplantation and, when appropriate, \nfor research. Our bill establishes a grant program for qualified cord \nblood banks to help facilitate building an inventory of 150,000 new \ncord blood units. At that level, 95 percent of Americans with a \ncondition that can be treated through a cord blood transplant could \nfind a genetically suitable match. Additionally, the bill establishes \nan advisory council to consult and make recommendations to ensure the \nefficient and effective operation of the program.\n  Another important aspect of this bill is the creation of a \ndemonstration project to study cord blood donations within families \nwhere a first degree relative has been I diagnosed with a condition \nthat could benefit from a cord blood transplant. The legislation sets \naside 5 percent of the cord blood inventory grants for the collection \nand storage of cord blood units at no cost to such families. This \neffort will be beneficial for families who find themselves in the \ntragic situation of having a sick child with another child on the way \nwhose cord blood could provide a cure to the sibling. This \ndemonstration program ensures that families will have this treatment \noption available to them.\n  I believe that the Bone Marrow and Cord Blood Transplantation and \nResearch Act of 2005 represents a strong compromise that upholds the \nprincipals my colleagues and I held as essential in developing a \ncombined bone marrow and cord blood program. The bill also builds on \nthe many strengths of the National Marrow Donor Program, which has \nfacilitated over 20,000 transplants since its inception and has built a \ndonor registry of over 5.5 million potential donors.\n  I urge the support of all of my colleagues for this bipartisan \nlegislation so that we can send it quickly to the President for his \nsignature.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/06/27/senate-section/article/S7438-1", "month": "06", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7438-S7439]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 1020.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of S. 1316 introduced earlier \ntoday.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 1316) to authorize the Small Business \n     Administration to provide emergency relief to shellfish \n     growers affected by toxic red tide losses.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, today Senator Snowe and I have introduced a \nbill to help a group of nearly 300 fishermen, known as aquaculturists, \nwho are falling through the cracks of the Government's disaster \nassistance programs. Right now these businesses are prohibited from \nreceiving SBA disaster loans, and they are eligible for USDA disaster \nloans only under limited circumstances.\n  To our dismay, we have learned that SBA has come across this dilemma \nmany times in the past, most recently last year in Connecticut, and yet \nno one at that agency has ever tried to coordinate with the Department \nof Agriculture. To make matters worse, the SBA waited two weeks to let \nus know that they wouldn't be able to serve all our small businesses. \nSo even in those cases in which these harmed small businesses would be \neligible for loans from the USDA, hundreds of small businesses are left \nwaiting for the Secretary of Agriculture to go through the same hoops \nto certify a disaster and make that agency's disaster loans available. \nI appreciate all the Farm Service Agency has done to expedite the \nprocess, and compliment their staff for being so responsive. However, \nthis isn't right.\n  Our State has been hit by the worst case of red tide in more than 30 \nyears. These small business owners have seen their income disappear \nbecause they can't sell their inventory. With no income they can't pay \ntheir bills, invest in seeds to plant future crops, and they can't \nafford to maintain their current crops. They need access to these low-\ncost loans to help them makes ends meet until the Government opens the \nshores and declares shellfish once again safe to eat.\n  Businesses in trouble can't, and shouldn't have to, wait for this \nredtape to be resolved. To make sure this doesn't happen in the future, \nI am joining Senator Snowe to make it possible for aquaculturists to be \neligible for SBA economic injury disaster loans. This will complement \nwhat the Department of Agriculture's Farm Services Agency can offer in \ndisaster loans. I want to also assure my colleagues that businesses are \nonly eligible for loans through the SBA or Farm Service Agency but not \nboth. This is already prohibited by law, and the agencies have in place \nprocedures to protect against misuse. I than Senator Snowe for working \nwith me to help our fishermen hurting from red tide.\n  I ask unanimous consent that an article on this problem be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n      Shellfish Growers Feel Snubbed by ``Red Tide'' Loan Program\n\n                         (By Michael Kunzelman)\n\n       Boston.--Shellfish grower Barbara Austin has been out of \n     work, just like hundreds of shellfishermen, ever since a \n     toxic ``red tide'' closed shellfishing areas across the state \n     earlier this month.\n       The difference is that she and nearly 300 other \n     aquaculturists aren't eligible for the same low-interest \n     loans to help them weather the financial storm.\n       Austin, of Wellfleet, pursued a loan from the Small \n     Business Administration before learning they're reserved for \n     the state's roughly 1,500 shellfishermen. The state's 287 \n     licensed aquaculturists, who plant and harvest shellfish, \n     aren't eligible because the SBA considers them farmers, not \n     fishermen.\n       Austin said the rule was ``kind of a slap in the face.''\n       ``If they're going to make offers like this, they should \n     have been clear about what they're really offering,'' she \n     said Tuesday.\n       In response, members of the state's congressional \n     delegation Tuesday sent a letter to Agriculture Secretary \n     Mike Johanns, urging him to make emergency financial \n     assistance available to aquaculturists and fish farmers in \n     eight Massachusetts counties.\n       Democratic Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, who also spearheaded a \n     letter to Federal Emergency Management Agency Director \n     Michael Brown asking him to meet with the delegation, said \n     FEMA should coordinate the federal disaster relief for those \n     affected by the red tide.\n       The shellfishermen, said Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., \n     ``shouldn't be blocked from receiving low interest loans \n     because of bureaucratic red tape.''\n       The SBA's enforcement of an ``obscure rule'' was a \n     surprise, said Mark Forest, district director for U.S. Rep. \n     William Delahunt, D-Mass.\n       ``Obviously, we are not pleased,'' Forest said. ``We're \n     working to get the problem fixed quickly.''\n       Efforts to reach SBA regional director William Leggerio \n     weren't immediately successful Tuesday.\n       On June 9, Gov. Mitt Romney declared a state of emergency \n     and asked the SBA for disaster assistance for the \n     shellfishing industry, which is losing an estimated $3 \n     million a week. Less than a week later, the SBA announced \n     that it would offer loans of up to $1.5 million with a 4 \n     percent interest rate.\n       Other forms of financial assistance could be available \n     soon. The state also is asking for disaster aid from the \n     Federal Emergency Management Agency.\n       In the meantime, most of the shellfish beds shut down along \n     the coast of Massachusetts will remain closed for at least \n     four to five more weeks, state shellfish biologist Michael \n     Hickey said Tuesday.\n       Hickey said the size and intensity of the toxic algae bloom \n     is dropping in the waters off the North Shore and Cape Cod, \n     but it could take two more weeks for the bloom to completely \n     disappear. After that, he added, it would take two to three \n     more weeks before shellfish beds can reopen.\n       ``The good news is that areas we do have open are safe. The \n     shellfish on the market is safe. The beaches are safe,'' \n     Hickey said. ``The bad news is, it's not over. (The bloom) is \n     not going to be over for another couple of weeks.''\n       The red tide algae contaminates shellfish such as clams and \n     mussels, making them unsafe for people and animals to eat. \n     The outbreak is the region's worst since 1972.\n\n\n[[Page S7447]]\n\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL.
