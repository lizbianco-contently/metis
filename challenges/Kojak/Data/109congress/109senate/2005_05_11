Mr. President, over the recess last week, I had the \nopportunity to travel to Israel, the West Bank, Jordan, Lebanon, and \nEgypt. Yesterday, I reported on the Israel leg of my fact-finding \nmission. Today I will continue briefly with that discussion of some of \nmy observations of the West Bank.\n  It was an invaluable experience. I and my entire group learned a \ntremendous amount about the Palestinian perspective. Following my \nmeetings in Jerusalem, we made our way to Ramallah in the West Bank to \nmeet with the leadership of the Palestinian Authority. As we drove \ntoward the city, we could see from our windows that everyday life for \nPalestinians in the West Bank is, indeed, a struggle. We had to pass \nthrough multiple checkpoints, predominantly through the security \nbarrier, the so-called fence, much of which is newly constructed.\n  As I learned on my visit to the Middle East, the fence has been, in \ntruth, very successful in preventing terrorist attacks, although it was \nquite remarkable that you had to stop and be checked out before passing \nthis fence, which sometimes you had to cross multiple times.\n  We could also see the toll the Intifada has taken on the lives of the \nPalestinian people. Streets were pockmarked, buildings were run down, \nand a pall hung over the landscape itself. It is clear the Palestinians \nneed one thing; that is, hope--hope for the future, hope for a better \nlife, hope for a more secure life. They need their economic services \nimproved. They need their social services improved. They need to \nbelieve there will be tangible benefits from choosing dialog over \nviolence.\n  This view was reinforced during my meeting with Palestinian Finance \nMinister Salam Fayyad. I learned from him that the unemployment rate in \nthe West Bank is officially 27 percent, but it far exceeds that number. \nThe people are suffering. That is why I strongly support President \nBush's efforts to increase assistance to the Palestinian\n\n[[Page S4888]]\n\npeople. President Bush has pledged to help improve economic support \nprograms and strengthen Palestinian democratic institutions.\n  The Finance Minister and I discussed President Bush's generous \nproposal to provide assistance to the Palestinian Authority. The \nFinance Minister agrees this assistance is crucial as President Abbas \nseeks to strengthen the mandate he earned in the January Palestinian \nelections.\n  From the Finance Minister's office we went on to the Presidential \ncompound in Ramallah to meet with President Mahmoud Abbas. The meeting \nwas constructive. The parties on all sides appear to appreciate the \nimportance of a longstanding and meaningful dialog on ways to bring \npeace and security to the Middle East. We had a very open and candid \ndiscussion about the status of the peace process, the Palestinians' \nobligations under the roadmap, and the need for both sides to establish \ngreater trust. In particular, we talked of the need to coordinate the \nIsraeli withdrawal from the Gaza Strip so that the Palestinian \nAuthority can reestablish a strong presence in that territory. This \nwhole concept of coordination seemed and is so critical to that \nsuccessful disengagement.\n  It is crucial that after that withdrawal the Palestinian Authority is \nable to strengthen its democratic institutions and maintain security \nand maintain law and order.\n  We discussed Israel's withdrawal from the Gaza Strip. I believe that \nis a courageous decision on the part of the Israelis. President Abbas \nexpressed his concern over unilateral Israeli measures, stressing that \nprogress toward peace should be made through dialog, bringing people \ntogether through negotiation and through coordination.\n  To that end, President Abbas expressed his commitment to dismantling \nthe terrorist organizations and preventing terrorist attacks against \nIsrael. This came up again and again. He conveyed to me his firm belief \nthat nonviolence is the path to a Palestinian State.\n  In our discussions it was evident that President Abbas is a serious \nleader, an elected leader, but also a leader who is in a very difficult \nsituation. His election victory gave him a strong mandate to depart \nfrom his predecessor's legacy, Arafat's legacy, of violence and \nterrorism. But he must also compete for that popular support with \nviolent factions such as Hamas that continue to reject peace with \nIsrael, and at the same time they garner support among the people by \nproviding social services to the people. That is what President Abbas \nfaces.\n  I strongly believe it is, therefore, necessary that the United States \ncontinue to support President Abbas in his efforts to transform the \nPalestinian Authority's reputation for cronyism, corruption, and \nnontransparency. We need to actively help his administration reform and \nstrengthen the Palestinian security and improve economic services. We \nmust continue to support both economic and social services and offer a \nstable and peaceful alternative to the radicals that reject peace.\n\n  We also had the opportunity to talk with an independent Presidential \ncandidate who lost in the election but garnered significant support--a \nphysician, Dr. Mustafa Barghuti, who ran as an independent in the \nPresidential elections 5 months ago. He spoke of a need for a strong, \nviable, independent party to serve as an alternative to Hamas. Like \nPresident Abbas, he believes peace is the only path to an independent \nPalestinian State.\n  Dr. Barghuti took me on a tour of his medical relief prevention and \ndiagnostic center for cardiovascular disease in Ramallah. It was quite \nimpressive. It is a model he developed as a physician that he hopes, \nwith the appropriate resources, he will be able to spread through the \nWest Bank. We share that common bond of being physicians and had a \ngreat dialog on the importance of social services provided through \nhealth care to further build that support of this new government.\n  My experience in the West Bank in my meetings with the various \nleaders of the Palestinian Authority bolstered my belief that President \nAbbas is a genuine partner for peace in the Middle East. I also \nwitnessed firsthand how the conflict has deeply affected the daily \nlives and routines of many Palestinians.\n  I take this opportunity to urge my colleagues to support President \nAbbas in his efforts to improve the lives of the Palestinian people and \nmake their governing institutions more accountable and responsible to \nall. I am hopeful his nonviolent approach to relations with Israel will \neventually lead to a viable, independent Palestinian State that is able \nto live side by side with Israel in peace and security for both.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/05/11/senate-section/article/S4888-1", "month": "05", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4888]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, from its beginnings, America has stood \nfor fairness, opportunity and justice. Generation after generation our \nNation has been able, often with intense debates, to give greater \nmeaning to these values in the lives of more and more of our citizens. \nWe know today we are a better Nation when our democracy and our \npolicies reflect these values. We are a stronger America when our \nactions respect those values for all our citizens especially those who \nare the backbone of America those--who work hard every day, who care \nfor their families, and who love their country.\n  Fairness; opportunity; justice.\n  But what we have seen in recent years is a breach of these values in \norder to reward the powerful at the expense of average Americans.\n  Those in power passed massive tax breaks for the wealthy and short-\nchanged everyone else.\n  They granted sweetheart deals to Halliburton Corporation in Iraq \nwhile our troops went without armor.\n  They let the polluters write the pollution rules for our water and \nour air.\n  They let the oil industry write the energy policy in secret meetings \nin the White House.\n  Two weeks ago, over the opposition of every Democrat in the House and \nSenate, they forced through a Federal budget that preserves corporate \ntax loopholes at the expense of college aid, and slashes Medicaid for \npoor mothers to pay for tax breaks for millionaires.\n  They twisted arms for 3\\1/2\\ hours in the dead of night on the floor \nof the House to pass by a single vote a so-called Medicare reform that \nlavishes billions of dollars on HMOs and drug companies at the expense \nof senior citizens and the disabled.\n  They broke the ethics rules of the House of Representatives, then \nchanged the rules to avoid investigation.\n  They want to break the promise of Social Security to our citizens by \nprivatizing it, handing it over to Wall Street, and cutting benefits \nfor middle-income Americans.\n  Their actions are a setback for the cause of fairness, opportunity \nand justice for all.\n  Now, Republican leaders want to break the Senate to get their way \nthis time with the Nation's courts.\n  It's not as if the Senate has failed to confirm President Bush's \nnominations to the Federal courts. So far, we have approved 208 of his \nappointments and declined to approve only 10. We have blocked only the \nvery, very few who are so far out of the mainstream that they have no \nplace in our Federal judiciary. And yes, we have been willing to \nfilibuster those nominees to protect America from their extremism.\n  Yet, Republican leaders now propose to scuttle the very Senate rules \nthat have protected our constitution and our citizens for more than two \ncenturies in a no-holds-barred crusade to\n\n[[Page S4889]]\n\ngive rightwing activist judges lifetime appointments to the Nation's \ncourts.\n  They want to break the rules to put judges on our courts who are \nfriendly to polluters and hostile to clean water and clean air.\n  They want to break the rules to put judges on the courts who are \nhostile to civil rights, hostile to disability rights, hostile to \nwomen's rights, and hostile to workers' rights.\n  They even want to break the rules to put judges on the bench who \ncondone torture.\n  The Nation's Founders understood that those in power might believe \nthat the rules most Americans live by don't apply to them. That is why \nthey put in place a democracy that preserves our rights and freedoms \nthrough checks and balances. These checks and balances protect our \nmainstream values by preventing one party from arrogantly and \nunilaterally imposing its extreme views on the Nation.\n\n  The Constitution grants the President a check on Congress by allowing \nhim to veto any measure that he believes crosses the line.\n  It establishes an independent judiciary of judges with lifetime \nappointments and irreducible salaries, so they will be immune to \npolitical pressures and can serve as a valuable check against illegal \nor unconstitutional actions by the President or Congress.\n  It gives the President and the Senate the shared duty of appointing \nqualified men and women to the courts, as a check against a President \nwho tries to force his will on the courts.\n  The Founders deliberately designed the Senate to be a special \nadditional check. It is smaller than the House. It has 6 year terms \ncompared to 2 years for the House, and 4 for the President. Our terms \nare staggered, so that at least two-thirds of us are veterans of a \nprevious Congress. We have unique powers over treaties, appointments, \nand impeachments. We have full power over our own rules, so that we can \nbe more deliberate and deliberative in our action. The Senate was meant \nto check an overreaching Executive--or an overreaching House as well, \nand to resist the fads of public opinion. Over the centuries, we have \nrepeatedly played this balancing and stabilizing role, especially when \nthe independence of the judiciary was threatened by an overreaching \nChief Executive.\n  Thomas Jefferson, at the peak of his popularity and with his party \ncontrolling Congress, pushed the Senate to remove a Supreme Court \nJustice whose decisions Jefferson disagreed with, but the Senate said \n``no.''\n  Franklin Roosevelt tried to expand the Supreme Court, so that he \ncould pack it with Justices who would support his views. Again, a \nSenate--a Senate under his party's control--said ``no.''\n  Richard Nixon, having lost one Supreme Court nomination battle to a \nbipartisan coalition, dared us to reject a second, even worse \ncandidate. But a bipartisan Senate majority honored the Founders' trust \nby saying ``no.''\n  Throughout our history, the Senate, has structured its processes to \nreflect the unique powers entrusted to it. For such irreversible steps \nas conferring lifetime judicial authority on nominees for the bench, it \nhas given the minority the ability to protect our republic from the \ncombined tyranny of a willful executive branch and an equally willful \nand like-minded small majority of Senators. Thus the Senate's rules \nhave allowed the minority to make itself heard as long as necessary to \nstimulate debate and compromise, and even to prevent actions that would \nundermine the balance of powers, or that a minority of Senators \nstrongly oppose on principle. Especially with respect to appointments, \nas to which the Senate's ``advice and consent'' is a matter of \nconstitutional prerogative, there has never been a constitutional \nright, or even a right under the Senate rules, to a floor vote on a \nnomination that would allow a bare majority to automatically \nrubberstamp the President's choice.\n  In fact, until 1917, the Senate had no limit on debate at all, and \nduring that time countless nominees, including judges, not only failed \nto receive Senate consent, but failed to receive the up or down vote \nthat some pretend has been available as a matter of right.\n  The cloture rule adopted in 1917 permitted debate to be ended on \nlegislation if two-thirds of the Senate voted to do so, but that rule \ndid not apply to Senate proceedings on nominations. In 1949, the rule \nwas extended to all issues, including nominations. Still, there was no \n``right to an up-or-down vote on the floor'' on a matter, because there \nremained many different ways to prevent it from ever reaching the \nfloor.\n  In 1975, the two-thirds rule for cloture was reduced to three-fifths, \nbut there was no change in the basic rule: the only floor vote you have \n``a right to'' is a floor vote on cloture, and if you lose that vote, \nthe matter does not go forward unless a later cloture vote succeeds or \nuntil the opponents are prepared to vote. That has been the consistent \npractice since the first cloture rule 88 years ago. Everyone knows that \nis the rule. It has been followed without exception in every Senate \nsince then. We can argue--and most of us have--whether cloture should \nor should not be invoked on a particular matter. But if the majority is \nnot large enough to win a cloture vote, it cannot move ahead to a final \nvote on that matter, including a nomination. That is what the rules \nsay. That is what they have always said. And that rule has never been \nbroken, especially when the issue is changing the Senate rules \nthemselves, which still requires a two-thirds majority for cloture.\n\n  Just 19 years after the cloture rule was extended to nominations, \nRepublicans in the Senate led a filibuster against a Supreme Court \nnomination, the nomination by President Johnson of Abe Fortas to be \nChief Justice. The Senate Historian describes it accurately on the \nSenate website: ``October 1, 1968: Filibuster Derails Supreme Court \nAppointment.''\n  Some have tried to rewrite the history of that filibuster. But three \nof us know what happened in 1968 because we were Senators then. \nPresident Johnson was one of the best vote counters in our history. If \nyou want to hear a master at work, just listen to his detailed \ndiscussion of Senate and House votes on President Johnson's tapes. \nLyndon Johnson would not have sent the Fortas nomination to the Senate \nif he was not completely confident that a majority of the Senate would \nsupport the nomination. And in fact those of us who favored the \nnomination believed he had that support.\n  The Judiciary Committee reported the Fortas nomination favorably, but \nits Republican opponents, knowing that they still lacked the votes to \ndefeat the nomination outright, launched a filibuster on the floor, \nattacking the nominee on a number of different fronts, in an effort to \ndraw away his supporters. In the end, cloture failed, and President \nJohnson withdrew the nomination.\n  We may never know what the final vote would have been if there had \nbeen no filibuster. But there can be no doubt that what occurred was a \nfilibuster of a Supreme Court nomination, and that the purpose of that \nRepublican-led filibuster was to prevent an up-or-down vote on the \nnomination. Even though there may have been a majority in support of \nthe nomination when the process started, under the Senate rules at that \ntime there was no way for the majority to cut off the minority's right \nto continue debate unless two-thirds of the Senate voted to do so. As \nthat cloture vote made clear, there would never be a floor vote on the \nnomination, unless its opponents ended their filibuster.\n  In fact the Senate has never allowed a bare majority to silence the \nminority on any bill or treaty or nomination, least of all on judicial \nnominees, whom the Framers were determined to keep independent, and \nwhose independence was assured by the Senate's joint role in their \nappointment. The idea that we should relinquish any part of our power \nover judicial appointments, while leaving that power intact for \nnonjudicial nominations and for all legislation, is not only \nirrational, it is bizarrely backward.\n  Certainly, this is no time to reduce the ability of the Senate as a \nwhole, and of individual Senators, to assure judicial independence. We \nneed independent courts more than ever. We know that activist groups \nand their supporters in Congress are putting heavy and well-organized \npressure on the courts. They want to restrict rights and liberties in \nthe name of national security. They want to subordinate individual \ninterests to powerful economic interests. They want to intrude\n\n[[Page S4890]]\n\nGovernment into sacrosanct areas of family and religion. They want to \nreverse longstanding precedents that allow the Nation to realize its \nfull potential.\n  When one political party controls all the levers of power in both the \nWhite House and Congress, and that party feels beholden to a narrow \nideological portion of its base, the independence of the courts is more \nvital than ever. Despite its razor-thin victory in the all-important \npolitical campaign last year, following its especially narrow victory \nin the election in 2000, which was decided by a 5 to 4 vote in the \nSupreme Court, the Republican party evidently believes it has absolute \npower. House Republicans yield to the White House, bending House rules \nto the breaking point to give the President his way. The President has \npersonally picked the majority leader of the Senate and through him \nseeks to impose unprecedented strict party discipline on Republican \nSenators.\n  Now, in a trial run for doing the same to the Supreme Court, the \nPresident wants to pack key appellate courts with activist ideological \njudges he knows could not possibly command a bipartisan consensus in \nthe Senate. It is clear from their records and their resumes that they \nhave been selected precisely because the most radical forces on the \nRepublican right believe they will advance their ideological agenda on \nthe bench.\n  In these circumstances, we as Senators have not only the right, but \nthe obligation, to use every power at our disposal, within the Senate's \nrules and traditions, to focus the attention of the Senate and the \nNation, and ultimately the President, on the overreaching abuse of \npower by the White House and the Republican majority. That is what our \nSenate powers and our Senate rules are meant to do. That is what checks \nand balances are all about. That is why the filibuster exists.\n  The Republican argument to the contrary is irrational, \nincomprehensible and hypocritical. They say that if we dare to use the \nwell-established Senate rules to preserve the independence of the \ncourts, then they are entitled to break the Senate rules to stop us. \nThey assert--and this is the keystone of their argument--that we are \nabusing the filibuster by actually using it, even on a very few \nnominations. They seem to say it is permissible to filibuster if you \nalready have a majority of Senators with you; that is, if you don't \nneed to filibuster. But it is not permissible to filibuster if you are \nin the minority, which is, of course, the only time you need to \nfilibuster. They say you are permitted to filibuster if you don't have \nthe votes to prevent cloture, but are not permitted to do so if you do \nhave the votes to prevent cloture. In short, their argument seems to be \nthat you are allowed to filibuster only when you don't need it or can't \nmake it stick. In a word, their argument is absurd.\n  The fact is, the Republicans showed in 1968 how the filibuster can be \nused to change minds when you don't start with enough votes, whether it \nis Senators' minds, citizens' minds, or just the President's mind.\n  During the Bush years, the filibuster has been used as an exceptional \ntool against a small number of judicial nominations--10 out of 218--in \ncontrast to nearly 70 judicial nominations blocked from a floor vote by \nother Republican tactics during the Clinton administration.\n  But here is the most important reason the Republican arguments make \nno sense: It is the President, not the Senate, who determines how often \nthe filibuster is used.\n  Whenever President Bush decides he would rather pick a fight than \npick a judge, then he is likely to be creating the need to filibuster. \nThere is no need for a filibuster if the President takes the ``advice'' \nof the Senate seriously, under the ``advice and consent'' clause of the \nconstitution, when he nominates lifetime judges for important courts. \nPresident Clinton did so with Senator Hatch, the Republican chairman of \nthe Senate Judiciary Committee at the time, on his nominations of \nJustice Ginsburg and Justice Breyer in the 1990s, and other Presidents \nhave done so throughout history.\n  Those who do not like the filibuster should take their complaints to \nthe other end of Pennsylvania Avenue, where the real responsibility \nlies.\n  The claim that filibustering judges is unconstitutional is without a \nshred of support in the Constitution or in history. The Republican \nleadership seems to be on the verge of abandoning that claim. The \nrecent compromise suggested by Senator Frist would allow the practice \nto continue for legislation, and for all Cabinet and other executive \nbranch appointments, and even for lifetime Federal district judges. \nNone of these categories is constitutionally distinguishable from \nFederal appellate court nominations and Supreme Court nominations under \nthe Senate rules. If anything, Article III lifetime appellate judges \ndeserve the filibuster's extra insulation from Executive abuse even \nmore than short-term Cabinet and diplomatic appointments, let alone \nlegislative actions that can be reversed by future legislation.\n  In short, neither the Constitution, nor Senate Rules, nor Senate \nprecedents, nor American history, provide any justification for \nselectively nullifying the use of the filibuster.\n  Equally important, neither the Constitution nor the rules nor the \nprecedents nor history provide any permissible means for a bare \nmajority of the Senate to take that radical step without breaking or \nignoring clear provisions of applicable Senate Rules and unquestioned \nprecedents.\n  Here are some of the rules and precedents that the executive will \nhave to ask its allies in the Senate to break or ignore, in order to \nturn the Senate into a rubber stamp for nominations:\n  First, they will have to see that the Vice President himself is \npresiding over the Senate, so that no real Senator needs to endure the \nembarrassment of publicly violating the Senate's rules and precedents \nand overriding the Senate parliamentarian, the way our presiding \nofficer will have to do.\n  Next, they will have to break Paragraph 1 of Rule V, which requires 1 \nday's specific written notice if a Senator intends to try to suspend or \nchange any rule.\n  Then they will have to break paragraph 2 of Rule V, which provides \nthat the Senate rules remain in force from Congress to Congress, unless \nthey are changed in accordance with the existing rules.\n  Then they will have to break paragraph 2 of Rule XXII, which requires \na motion signed by 16 Senators, a 2-day wait and a three-fifths vote to \nclose debate on the nomination itself.\n  They will also have to break Rule XXII's requirement of a petition, a \nwait, and a two-thirds vote to stop debate on a rules change.\n  Then, since they pretend to be proceeding on a constitutional basis, \nthey will have to break the invariable rule of practice that \nconstitutional issues must not be decided by the presiding Officer but \nmust be referred by the Presiding officer to the entire Senate for full \ndebate and decision.\n  Throughout the process they will have to ignore, or intentionally \ngive incorrect answers to, proper parliamentary inquiries which, if \nanswered in good faith and in accordance with the expert advice of the \nparliamentarian, would make clear that they are breaking the rules.\n  Eventually, when their repeated rule-breaking is called into \nquestion, they will blatantly, and in dire violation of the norms and \nmutuality of the Senate, try to ignore the minority leader and other \nSenators who are seeking recognition to make lawful motions or pose \nlegitimate inquiries or make proper objections.\n  By this time, all pretense of comity, all sense of mutual respect and \nfairness, all of the normal courtesies that allow the Senate to proceed \nexpeditiously on any business at all will have been destroyed by the \npreemptive Republican nuclear strike on the Senate floor.\n  To accomplish their goal of using a bare majority vote to escape the \nrule requiring 60 votes to cut off debate, those participating in this \ncharade will, even before the vote, already have terminated the normal \nfunctioning of the Senate. They will have broken the Senate compact of \ncomity, and will have launched a preemptive nuclear war. The battle \nbegins when the perpetrators openly, intentionally and repeatedly, \nbreak clear rules and precedents of the Senate, refuse to follow the \nadvice of the Parliamentarian, and commit the unpardonable sin of \nrefusing to recognize the minority leader.\n  Their hollow defenses to all these points demonstrate the weakness of\n\n[[Page S4891]]\n\ntheir case: They claim, ``We are only breaking the rules with respect \nto judicial nominations; we promise not to do so on other nominations \nor on legislation.'' No one seriously believes that. Having used the \nnuclear option to salvage a handful of activist judges, they will not \nhesitate to use it to salvage some bill vital to the credit card \nindustry, or the oil industry or the pharmaceutical industry, or Wall \nStreet, or any other special interest. In other words, the Senate \nmajority will always be able to get its way, and the Senate our \nFounders created will no longer exist. It will be an echo chamber to \nthe House, where the tyranny of the majority is so rampant today.\n  Our Republican colleagues also claim that ``Senate Democrats have \npreviously used majority votes to change the rules'', so they can do it \ntoo. That spurious claim depends entirely on a pseudo-scholarly article \nby two Republican staffers, who happen, unintentionally, to have \nprovided enough facts to rebut the claim. As Senator Byrd and other \nexperts on the rules have shown, the instances they rely on do not \ninvolve breaking the rules or changing the rules. They were narrow and \nminor interpretations to fill gaps in existing rules, but always \nconsistent with the underlying rules and their purposes, and always in \nkeeping with the regular procedures of the Senate. They never allowed \ndebate on any nomination or bill to be cut off without the required \ncloture vote. The Nuclear Option, in contrast, involves major changes \nin the essence of key rules, without following the required procedures \nfor changing the rules. In fact, even at the start of a new Congress, \nthe one time when some of us thought the rules might be changed by a \nmajority, the Senate has repeatedly and explicitly rejected the \nproposition that the rules can be changed without following the rules.\n  Why would our Republican colleagues try to do this? The simplest \nanswer is that they will do it because they think they can get away \nwith it. If enough Republicans accede to this raw exercise of unbridled \npower, and ignore the rules and traditions and comity and history and \npurpose of the Senate, and think they can pull it off and not be held \naccountable, then they will try it.\n  Obviously, their party is also being driven by an irresponsible \nfringe force that does not care about the credibility of their party or \nthe institutional interests of the Senate or the future of our checks \nand balances form of government. They were the ones who compelled their \nleaders on both sides of the Hill to intrude in the tragic case of \nTerri Schiavo. The overwhelmingly hostile reaction to that fiasco \nshould be enough to encourage the White House not to go down such paths \nagain, especially after Stanley Birch, a conservative appointee of the \nfirst President Bush, on a conservative federal circuit court of \nappeals, excoriated Congress for its unconstitutional interference with \nthe courts, and particularly excoriated Republican opponents of \njudicial activism for hypocritically pushing their own corrosive brand \nof judicial activism.\n  Sadly, with Dr. Frist's encouragement and support, the same rabble \nrousers recently accused us of blocking nominees because they are \n``people of faith,'' thus suggesting that the 208 judges whom we have \nnot blocked are not ``people of faith.'' Clearly these activist \nideologues do not agree with the Founders about the need for judicial \nindependence, for the separation of powers, or for the separation of \nchurch and state. They have no respect for history, no respect for \nchecks and balances, and no respect for the role of the Senate. They \nsimply want as many judges as possible who will follow their \ninstructions.\n  Fortunately, the vast majority of Americans' share our commitment to \nbasic fairness. They agree that there must be fair rules, that we \nshould not unilaterally abandon or break those rules in the middle of \nthe game, and that we should protect the minority's rights in the \nSenate.\n  Even in the darkest days of the government's failure to respond to \nthe civil rights revolution, half a century ago, the Senate never tried \nto allow a bare majority to silence a substantial minority. Yet that is \nexactly what Republicans want to do now. There simply is no crisis \nwhich justifies such a drastic and destructive action.\n\n  Who are the nominees the Republican leadership wants confirmed so \ndesperately that they are willing to resort to tactics like these? \nObviously, they are doing it in anticipation of the battle soon to come \nover the nomination of the next Supreme Court Justice. The judges \nnominated so far who have been filibustered by the Senate show how \ntruly appalling a Supreme Court nominee may be, if the President can \navoid a filibuster.\n  President Bush has said he wants judges who will follow the law, not \ntry to re-write it. But his actions tell a different story. The \ncontested nominees have records that make clear they would push the \nagenda of a narrow far-right fringe, rather than protect rights \nimportant to all Americans.\n  Priscilla Owen, Janice Rogers Brown, William Myers, Terrence Boyle, \nand William Pryor would erase much of the country's hard-fought \nprogress toward equality and opportunity. Their values--favoring big \nbusiness over the needs of families, destroying environmental \nprotections, and turning back the clock on civil rights--are not \nmainstream values.\n  As a Texas Supreme Court Justice, Priscilla Owen has shown clear \nhostility to fundamental rights, particularly on issues of major \nimportance to workers, consumers, victims of discrimination, and women. \nNeither the facts, nor the law, nor established legal precedents, stop \nher from reaching her desired result.\n  Owen was elected to the Texas Supreme Court with donations from Enron \nand other big companies. She consistently rules against employees, and \nconsumers who challenge corporate abuses. She bent the law in an \nattempt to deny relief for the family of a teenager, who was paralyzed \nafter being thrown through the sun roof of the family car in an \naccident. She wanted to reverse a jury award for a woman whose \ninsurance company wrongly denied her claim for coverage of heart \nsurgery. She argued that the Texas Supreme Court should reinterpret a \nkey civil rights law to make it harder for victims of discrimination to \nget relief.\n  It's not just Senate Democrats who question Justice Owen's record of \njudicial activism and her willingness to ignore the law. Even many \nnewspapers that endorsed her campaign for the Texas Supreme Court now \noppose her confirmation after seeing how poorly she served as a judge. \nThe Houston Chronicle wrote that Justice Owen ``too often contorts \nrulings to conform to her particular conservative outlook.'' The paper \nalso noted that ``It's saying something that Owen is a regular \ndissenter on a Texas Supreme Court made up mostly of other conservative \nRepublicans.''\n  The Austin American-Statesman wrote that she ``seems all too willing \nto bend the law to fit her views.'' The San Antonio Express-News \nopposed her nomination, reminding us that ``[w]hen a nominee has \ndemonstrated a propensity to spin the law to fit philosophical beliefs, \nit is the Senate's right--and duty--to reject that nominee.''\n  Her own colleagues on the conservative Texas Supreme Court have \nrepeatedly accused her of the same thing. They clearly state that \nJustice Owen puts her own views above the law, even when the law is \ncrystal clear. Justice Owen's former colleague on the Texas Supreme \nCourt, our new Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, has said she was \nguilty of ``an unconscionable act of judicial activism.'' Some claim \nthat Attorney General Gonzales didn't mean this criticism. But this was \nno single, stray remark. To the contrary, both he and her other \ncolleagues on the Texas Supreme Court have repeatedly noted that she \nignores the law to reach her desired result.\n  In one case, Justice Gonzales held that Texas law clearly required \nmanufacturers to be responsible when retailers sell their defective \nproducts. He wrote that Justice Owen's dissenting opinion would \n``judicially amend the statute'' to let the manufacturers off the hook.\n  In a case in 2000, Justice Gonzales, joined by a majority of the \nTexas Supreme Court, upheld a jury award holding that the Texas \nDepartment of Transportation and the local transit authority were \nresponsible for a deadly auto accident. They said that the result was \nrequired by the ``plain meaning'' of Texas law. Justice Owen \ndissented, claiming that Texas should be\n\n[[Page S4892]]\n\nimmune from these suits. Justice Gonzales again stated that her view \nmisread the law, which he said was ``clear and unequivocal.''\n\n  In another case, Justice Gonzales joined a majority opinion that \ncriticized Justice Owen for ``disregarding the procedural limitations \nin the statute,'' and ``taking a position even more extreme'' than was \nargued by the defendant in the case.\n  In another case in 2000, private landowners tried to use a Texas law \nto exempt themselves from local environmental regulations. The court's \nmajority ruled that the law was an unconstitutional delegation of \nlegislative authority to private individuals. Justice Owen dissented, \nclaiming that the majority's opinion ``strikes a severe blow to private \nproperty rights.'' Justice Gonzales joined a majority opinion \ncriticizing Justice Owen's view, stating that most of her opinion was \n``nothing more than inflammatory rhetoric which merits no response.''\n  In another case, Justice Owen joined a partial dissent that would \nhave limited the right to jury trials. The dissent was criticized by \nthe other judges as a ``judicial sleight of hand'' to bypass the \nconstraints of the Texas Constitution.\n  For the very important D.C. Circuit, the President has nominated \nanother extreme right-wing candidate. Janice Rogers Brown's record on \nthe California Supreme Court makes clear that--like Priscilla Owen--\nshe's a judicial activist who will roll back basic rights. When she \njoined the California Supreme Court, the California State Bar Judicial \nNominees Evaluation Commission had rated her ``not qualified,'' and \n``insensitive to established legal precedent'' when she served on the \nstate court of appeals.\n  All Americans, wherever they live, should be concerned about such a \nnomination to this vital court, which interprets federal laws that \nprotect our civil liberties, workers' safety, and our ability to \nbreathe clean air and drink clean water in their communities. Only the \nD.C. Circuit can review the national air quality standards under the \nClean Air Act and national drinking water standards under the Safe \nDrinking Water Act. This court also hears the lion's share of cases \ninvolving rights of employees under the Occupational Safety and Health \nAct and the National Labor Relations Act.\n  Yet Janice Rogers Brown's record shows a deep hostility to civil \nrights, to workers' rights, to consumer protection, and to a wide \nvariety of governmental actions in many other areas--the very issues \nthat predominate in the D.C. Circuit.\n  Perhaps most disturbing is the contempt she has repeatedly expressed \nfor the very idea of democratic self-government. She has stated that \n``where government moves in, community retreats [and] civil society \ndisintegrates.'' She has said that government leads to ``families under \nsiege, war in the streets.'' In her view, ``when government advances . \n. . freedom is imperiled [and] civilization itself jeopardized.''\n  She has criticized the New Deal, which gave us Social Security, the \nminimum wage, and fair labor laws. She's questioned whether age \ndiscrimination laws benefit the public interest. She's even said that \n``Today's senior citizens blithely cannibalize their grandchildren \nbecause they have a right to get as much `free' stuff as the political \nsystem will permit them to extract.'' No one with these views should be \nconfirmed to the Federal court and certainly not to the Federal court \nmost responsible for cases affecting government action. It's no wonder \nthat an organization seeking to dismantle Social Security is running \nads supporting her nomination to the second most powerful court in the \ncountry.\n  Janice Rogers Brown has also written opinions that would undermine \ncivil rights. She has held, for example, that the First Amendment \nprevents courts from granting injunctions against racial slurs in the \nworkplace, even when those slurs are so pervasive that they create a \nhostile work environment in violation of Federal job discrimination \nlaws. In other opinions, she has argued against allowing victims of age \nand race discrimination to obtain relief in state courts, or to obtain \ndamages from administrative agencies for their pain and suffering. She \nhas rejected binding precedent on the constitutional limits on an \nemployer's ability to require employees to submit to drug tests.\n  President Bush has selected William Myers for the important Ninth \nCircuit Court of Appeals. Mr. Myers is a long-time mining and cattle \nindustry lobbyist. He has compared Federal laws protecting the \nenvironment to ``the tyrannical actions of King George'' over the \nAmerican colonies. He has denounced our environmental laws as \n``regulatory excesses.'' In the Interior Department, he served his \ncorporate clients instead of the public interest. As Solicitor of \nInterior, he tried to give public land worth millions of dollars to \ncorporate interests. He issued an opinion clearing the way for mining \non land sacred to Native Americans, without consulting the tribes \naffected by his decision although he took the time to meet personally \nwith the mining company that stood to profit from his opinion.\n\n  William Myers is a particularly inappropriate choice for the Ninth \nCircuit, which contains many of America's most precious natural \nresources and national parks, including the Grand Canyon and Yosemite \nNational Park, and which is home to many Native American tribes. The \nNinth Circuit decides many of the most important environmental disputes \naffecting America's natural heritage. It has a special role in \nsafeguarding the cultural and religious heritage of the first \nAmericans. It deserves an impartial judge who will deal fairly with \nenvironmental claims, not a mining company lobbyist clearly opposed to \nenvironmental protections. The Ninth Circuit needs judges who will \nrespect Native American rights, not a judge the head of the National \nCongress of American Indians has called the ``worst possible choice'' \nfor Native Americans.\n  The nomination of Terrence Boyle is still pending in the Judiciary \nCommittee. By all appearances, he was chosen for his radical views, not \nhis qualifications. His decisions as a trial judge have been reversed \nor criticized on appeal more than 150 times, far more than any other \ndistrict judge nominated to a circuit court by President Bush. The \nSupreme Court unanimously reversed him in a voting rights case, in \nwhich Justice Clarence Thomas wrote that he had ignored established \nlegal standards.\n  In fact, he has made serious mistakes in cases that matter most to \nAmericans' daily lives. Time and again, the conservative Fourth Circuit \nhas ruled that Judge Boyle improperly dismissed cases asking protection \nfor individual rights, such as the right to free speech, or the right \nof free association, or the right to be free from discrimination, or \nthe right to a fair and lawful sentence in a criminal case. It's no \nwonder that his nomination is opposed by a broad coalition of \norganizations nationally and in his home state of North Carolina \nrepresenting law enforcement officers, workers, and victims of \ndiscrimination.\n  Last, but by no means least disturbing, the President has renominated \nWilliam Pryor to the Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit. Mr. \nPryor is no true ``conservative.'' He has pushed a radical agenda \ncontrary to much of the Supreme Court's jurisprudence over the last \nforty years, and at odds with important precedents that have made our \ncountry a fairer nation.\n  Mr. Pryor has fought aggressively to undermine the power of Congress \nto protect civil rights and individual rights. He's tried to cut back \non the Family and Medical Leave Act, the Americans with Disabilities \nAct, and the Clean Water Act. He's been contemptuously dismissive of \nclaims of racial bias in the application of the death penalty. He's \nrelentlessly advocated its use, even for persons with mental \nretardation. He's even ridiculed the current Supreme Court justices, \ncalling them ``nine octogenarian lawyers who happen to sit on the \nSupreme Court.'' He can't even get his facts right. Only two of the \nnine justices are 80 years old or older.\n  Mr. Pryor has criticized Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act, which \nhelps ensure that all Americans can vote, regardless of their race or \nethnic background. He's even called the Voting Rights Act, which has \nbeen repeatedly upheld by the Supreme Court, ``an affront to \nfederalism.'' His hostility to voting rights belongs in another era--\n\n[[Page S4893]]\n\nnot on a federal court. As Alabama's Attorney General, in a case \ninvolving a disabled man forced to crawl up the courthouse stairs to \nreach the courtroom, Mr. Pryor argued that the disabled have no \nfundamental right to attend their own public court proceedings. His \nnomination was rushed through the Committee despite serious questions \nabout his ethics and even his candor before the Committee.\n  History will judge us harshly in the Senate if we don't stand tall \nagainst the brazen abuses of power demonstrated by these nominees. The \nissues at stake in these nominations go well beyond partisan division. \nThe basic values of our society--whether we will continue to be \ncommitted to fairness and opportunity and justice for all--are at \nissue.\n  Many well-qualified, fair-minded nominees could be quickly confirmed \nif the Bush administration would give up its right-wing litmus test. \nWhy, when there are so many qualified Republican attorneys, would the \nPresident choose nominees whose records raise so much doubt about \nwhether they will follow the law? Why force an all-out battle over a \nfew right-wing nominees, when the nation has so many more pressing \nproblems, such as national security, the economy, education, and health \ncare?\n  Our distinguished former colleagues, Republican Senator David \nDurenberger and Democratic Senator and Vice President Walter Mondale, \nrecently urged the Senate to reject the nuclear option. They reminded \nus that ``Our federal courts are one of the few places left where \nissues are heard and rationally debated and decided under the law.''\n  Five words they used said it all--``let's keep it that way.'' To \nreach the goals important to the American people, let's reject the \nnuclear option, and respect the checks and balances that have served \nthe Senate and the nation so well for so long.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the minority has expired.\n  The Senator from Nevada.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/05/11/senate-section/article/S4893-1", "month": "05", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4893-S4896]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    FILIBUSTER OF JUDICIAL NOMINEES\n\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I would like to think that if some of the \nfinest and most respected jurists in our country's history were \nnominated today to sit on the Federal bench, their successful \nconfirmation by the Senate would be guaranteed. I am talking about \njurists such as Chief Justice John Marshall, Chief Justice Earl Warren, \nand Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes. Imagine where we would be today \nwithout their bright, insightful legal minds.\n  Unfortunately, in today's bitter and partisan atmosphere, I don't see \nhow any of them would make it through this grueling, humiliating, and \nendless judicial nomination process. That is a disturbing thought. We \nmust put an end to this mockery of our system before it becomes \nimpossible to undo the damage.\n  I am sure a lot of Americans believe this is politics as usual. It is \nnot. Filibustering of judicial nominations is an unprecedented \nintrusion into the longstanding practice of the Senate's approval of \njudges.\n  We have a constitutional obligation of advise and consent when it \ncomes to judicial nominees. While there has always been debate about \nnominees, the filibuster has never been used in partisan fashion to \nblock an up-or-down vote on someone who has the support of a majority \nof the Senate.\n  In our history, many nominees have come before us who have generated \nstrenuous debate. Robert Bork and Clarence Thomas are two of what the \nother side would consider more controversial figures to be considered \nfor a position on the Federal bench. It is important to note that both \nof these men, despite the strong feelings they generated from their \nsupporters and their detractors, received an up-or-down vote. Now, \nsadly, due to the efforts of the Democrats in the Senate, the 214-year \ntradition of giving each Federal candidate for judge a solid ``yea'' or \n``nay'' is at risk.\n  Senate tradition is not the only thing at risk here, though. The \nquality of our judiciary is at grave risk. It is and should continue to \nbe an honor to be nominated to serve on the Federal bench. Nominees are \naware of the rigorous process that goes along with their nomination--\nintense background checks and the opening of one's life history to the \npublic. However, highly qualified and respected nominees do not sign on \nto being dragged through a bitter political battle. If we allow the \nfilibustering of nominees to continue, I fear that those highly \nqualified candidates will decline to put themselves and their families \nthrough the abyss of this process. The American judicial system will be \nsorely hurt should this happen. And it already happened with Miguel \nEstrada, who was an outstanding nominee. We cannot afford to let this \nhappen and let it continue.\n  I believe that anyone who has been nominated by the President and is \nwilling to put his or her name forward and be subjected to the rigorous \nconfirmation process deserves a straight up-or-down vote on his or her \nnomination in both committee and on the floor of the Senate. \nGuaranteeing that every judicial nominee receives an up-or-down vote is \ntruly a matter of fairness. It doesn't mean that there is no debate or \nopportunity to disagree. It does mean fair consideration, debate, and a \ndecision in a process that moves forward.\n  I say that today with the Republican President in the White House and \na Republican majority in the Senate, but I know we will uphold the up-\nor-down vote when we eventually have Democrats back in control. That is \nbecause this is the fairest way to maintain the health of the judicial \nnomination process and the quality of our courts.\n  Our Founding Fathers set up a form of Government with three separate \nbranches, and they were all very distinct. The current state of affairs \nin the Senate threatens the very balance of power. Although the up-or-\ndown vote is critical to maintaining that balance, there is a need to \nreform the committee process as well. Each committee should discharge \nnominees, whether it is with a positive or a negative vote. But at some \npoint, that nominee deserves to have a vote of the full Senate on the \nfloor. The committee should not have the power to kill a nominee on its \nown.\n  I sincerely hope we can put an end to this crisis, judge judicial \nnominees on the basis of their character, qualifications, and \nexperience, and return to fulfilling our constitutional duty.\n  I understand that the majority leader has just put forward a proposal \nto correct the unfair treatment of judges. Senator Frist's proposal \nwill ensure that each and every nominee will be treated fairly. It will \nensure that each nominee will receive a fair up-or-down vote, whether a \nRepublican President or a Democrat President nominates him or her.\n\n  I commend Senator Frist for his leadership. His proposal ensures \nfuture nominees are treated fairly. I urge my colleagues to adopt \nSenator Frist's proposal.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Vitter). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I would like to take a few moments to \ndiscuss the issue that seems to be the major topic of debate now in the \nSenate. It is that of the question of how we approach the nomination \nand confirmation of judges.\n  Frankly, I think that the level of hostility and the level of debate \nthat has increased around this issue is becoming alarming to the \nAmerican people--not so much necessarily because of their objection or \nconcern about the various positions being taken but because of the \nconcern about how the Senate is running, the question of whether we in \nthe Senate are working on the business of the American people in a way \nthat is in the best interest of public discourse, or whether the \ndynamic in the Senate is deteriorating into a highly partisan, highly \npersonal, and highly difficult climate in which we are increasingly \nfacing gridlock.\n  Mr. President, I would like to go back through the debate because a \nlot has been said about what the role of the filibuster is as we \napproach the issue of confirmation of judges. I believe it is important \nbecause, frankly, I notice in some of the advertising that\n\n[[Page S4894]]\n\nis going on across the country right now that the argument being made \nseems to be that the filibuster was established in the Constitution by \nour Founding Fathers as one of the checks and balances of our system.\n  The reality is that from 1789 until 1806, the Senate did not have \nanything close to a filibuster. In fact, the Senate had the traditional \nmotion for the previous question in its rules, which, for those who \ndon't follow these things closely, meant that a majority could close \ndebate on any issue when there was a motion to proceed to a vote. The \nmajority could close the debate.\n  So, clearly, there is no mention of the filibuster in the \nConstitution and, clearly, until at least 1806 there was no possibility \nfor utilization of the filibuster in the Senate. Even after 1806, when \nfor other reasons the Senate eliminated the motion for the previous \nquestion, the idea of filibustering never really took hold in the \nSenate until much later. In fact, it was about the 1840s when a group \nof Senators realized that under the rules there was no way for them to \nbe stopped from debating, and they basically started the idea of \nfilibustering and approaching the management of issues in the Senate by \nutilization of the tool of filibustering--namely, refusing to stop \ndebating and let the Senate move on to a vote.\n  Even though that practice started in the 1840s, it was used very \nsparingly and over the years really wasn't that big of a problem. When \nSenators tried it, they worked out issues they were raising, and issues \nwere resolved. The Senate never really adopted a cloture rule until the \n1917 timeframe. The cloture rule, for those who don't follow Senate \nprocedure that closely, is the rule by which the Senate tries to stop a \nfilibuster. It has been in different forms over the years, but in its \ncurrent form--since 1917, it has evolved--it requires 60 votes in the \nSenate to adopt cloture, which means that we will then go into a \nprocess which will eventually wind down debate on a bill and move us to \na point where we can vote on a matter. So even in 1917, when the \noriginal cloture rule was adopted, it didn't really mention judicial \nnominations, because at that point the Senate didn't really contemplate \nthe use of the filibuster on judicial nominations.\n\n  The cloture rule was rewritten in 1949. At that time, it was expanded \nto include all matters which technically included judicial nominations. \nBut even after 1949, filibusters were rarely, if ever, even tried on \njudicial nominations; and when they were tried on judicial nominations, \nwith one exception, when both parties supported the filibuster, even \nwhen filibusters were tried on judicial nominations, they were stopped. \nNever, until this last Congress, the Congress previous to this, with \nthat one exception I mentioned when both parties supported it, did the \nSenate support the utilization of a filibuster on the nomination of a \njudge.\n  In the last couple of years, we have seen an increasing and frequent \nutilization of filibusters for nominations on the judiciary. That is \nwhat brought us to this battle right now. The question the Senate is \ngrappling with and which the American people, I believe, are \njustifiably very concerned about is, What should the role of the Senate \nbe? What should the procedure of the Senate be when considering \njudicial nominations?\n  That takes us, in my opinion, back to the U.S. Constitution. In \narticle II of the U.S. Constitution, which is the core around which \nthis debate should focus, it provides that the President shall nominate \nand, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, shall appoint \njudges of the Supreme Court and all other officers of the United \nStates, which includes judges of the other courts. The President shall \nnominate and, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, shall \nappoint. So the question there is, Does the Constitution absolutely \nprohibit a filibuster? No. Does the Constitution absolutely authorize \nfilibusters? No. The Constitution simply says the President shall \nnominate and, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, he \nshall appoint judges.\n  Our job now is to determine how to run the rules of the Senate in the \nclosest accommodation to the spirit of the Constitution of the United \nStates.\n  The question, as I see it, is, Does the Constitution contemplate that \nthe President is entitled to a vote on his nominees? And if so, is that \nvote a majority vote or is it a vote of a supermajority, like 60, or \ntwo-thirds? It has been argued on the floor today that all the \nConstitution contemplates is some kind of a vote, whether it be a 60-\nvote supermajority, a two-thirds vote, or a majority vote, that the \nSenate can decide, but all the Constitution contemplates is some kind \nof a vote.\n  I disagree. I believe the Constitution contemplated that by a \nmajority vote the Senate would give its advice and consent. I believe \nthe best way to operate this Senate is to utilize the principle of \nadvice and consent as one in which we should give the President an up-\nor-down vote on those nominees who are able to get sufficient support \nto get out of the Judiciary Committee to the floor of the Senate. As I \nsay, historically, never, until the last Congress, has the Senate \noperated in any other way.\n  There are those who have tried filibusters, but never have just 41 \nSenators stood solidly together and said: No, we will not allow a \nnominee who has enough majority support to get to the floor of the \nSenate to have a vote.\n  There are those who are saying the President is trying to pack the \nCourt and that the President is trying to change the dynamics of the \njudiciary with people who are out of the mainstream. Again, I do not \nbelieve anything could be further from the truth.\n  There has been a lot of debate on this floor over the last few weeks \nabout these nominees, but let's look at a couple of these nominees to \nsee what it is we are talking about.\n  One of the filibustered nominees is Justice Priscilla Owen. She has \nserved on the Texas Supreme Court since 1995. In 2000, Justice Owen was \noverwhelmingly reelected to a second term on that court, receiving 84 \npercent of the public vote. I do not think that is out of the \nmainstream.\n  During her 2000 election bid, every major newspaper in Texas endorsed \nher. Before joining the supreme court, she was a partner with a well-\nrespected Texas law firm, having practiced law for 17 years.\n  Justice Owen has significant bipartisan support in Texas, including \nthree former Democratic judges on the Texas Supreme Court and a \nbipartisan group of 15 past presidents of the State bar of Texas.\n  Whether one agrees or disagrees with her philosophy, one cannot argue \nthat she is not mainstream. In fact, a bipartisan group of 15 former \npresidents of the State bar of Texas--that bipartisan group about which \nI talked--states:\n\n       Although we profess different party affiliations and span \n     the spectrum of legal and policy issues, we stand united in \n     affirming that Justice Owen is a truly unique and outstanding \n     candidate to appointment to the Fifth Circuit [Court of \n     Appeals].\n\n  They go on to say she has all the qualities to be a good independent \njudge.\n  Another who is being attacked is the Honorable Janice Rogers Brown, a \nnominee from the Supreme Court of California to be on the District of \nColumbia Circuit Court. In her 9 years on the California Supreme Court, \nJustice Brown has earned the reputation of being a brilliant and a fair \njustice who rules on the law.\n  Her nomination has received broad support from across the political \nspectrum, and she also stood for reelection in the California judicial \nsystem where she received 76 percent of the public vote in California \nthe last time she was on the ballot, which belies the notion that she \ncould be out of the mainstream.\n  She has dedicated over 25 years of her legal career to public service \nand she, too, is supported by a broad array of bipartisan jurists and \nlegal scholars in her State.\n  Let me talk about one more, a nominee from my State, the State of \nIdaho, William Myers, who has been nominated to the Ninth Circuit Court \nof Appeals. Bill Myers is a former Solicitor of the Department of \nInterior and is a highly respected attorney who has extensive \nexperience in the fields of natural resources, public lands, and \nenvironmental law. He actually was confirmed by this Senate by \nunanimous consent when he was confirmed to serve as Solicitor of the \nDepartment of Interior.\n  Before coming to the Department of Interior, he practiced at one of \nthe most respected law firms in the Rocky Mountain region, and he has a \nrich history of service in public offices. He is a\n\n[[Page S4895]]\n\nvery avid outdoorsman and conservationist and has himself wide support \nfrom bipartisan interests. In fact, the former Democratic Governor of \nIdaho, Cecil Andrus, indicated he is one who deserves our support, has \nthe integrity, judicial temperament, and experience to be a good judge.\n  Former Democratic Wyoming Governor Mike Sullivan, who also served as \nU.S. Ambassador to Ireland under the Clinton administration, endorsed \nMr. Myers, saying he is ``a thoughtful, well-grounded attorney who has \nreflected by his career achievements a commitment to excellence.''\n  My point in reviewing these three candidates, because my time is \nlimited today, is to show that although there is an argument that the \nPresident is trying to submit candidates who are not in the mainstream, \nthe argument does not fit the facts. What is happening is President \nBush is being denied the opportunity for even a vote on his nominees to \nbe the judges on the various circuit courts of this country.\n  I think we ought to come back to the Constitution and to the initial \nquestion which I pose: What does the Constitution of the United States \ncontemplate in terms of how the Senate should operate when it fills its \nrole as providing advice and consent in the nomination and appointment \nof judges?\n  I think it is very important to note that what we are debating is not \nthe elimination of the filibuster. We have an Executive Calendar and a \nlegislative calendar in the Senate, and the proposal is to address the \nmanner in which filibusters are utilized only on a portion of the \nExecutive calendar. The Executive calendar is that part of our business \nin which the Senate deals under the Constitution with the executive \nbusiness of the President with the Senate.\n\n  We are suggesting our rules should contemplate that when the \nConstitution gives the President business to conduct with the Senate \nand says the Senate should give its advice and consent on the \nPresident's nominations, the Senate's rules should not prohibit the \nPresident from getting a vote.\n  All we are asking, not that these nominations be all unanimously \napproved or automatically accepted, is the President get a vote up or \ndown on his nominees.\n  It is my hope we will not have to get to the point where on the \nSenate floor we have a protracted and bitter battle. We have an \nopportunity to discuss these matters among ourselves and try to do what \nthe American people expect of us, and that is to bring more comity to \nthe Senate in our individual relations among each other.\n  I believe there is room for finding a compromise that can resolve \nthis issue in a way that will bring dignity and respect to the Senate \nand will enable us to fulfill the spirit of what the Constitution \ncontemplates when it says the Senate should provide its advice and \nconsent to the nominations of the President.\n  Mr. President, I thank you for my time, and I yield back the \nremainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas is recognized.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, how much time remains in morning \nbusiness on this side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 6 minutes 25 seconds remaining.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I yield myself such of that time as I \nmay consume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I am going to follow on the \npresentation of my colleague from Idaho on the issue of judges because \nit is the pending issue before the Senate. We are on the highway bill, \nand it is important legislation, but this issue is what has captured \nthe attention of this body, the executive branch, and people across the \ncountry: the problem of getting judges approved.\n  My colleague from Idaho well portrayed some of the nominees and what \nis taking place. I will point out a couple of common issues. I serve on \nthe Judiciary Committee. We have had these individuals in front of us, \nin some cases, for 4 years. They are well known to this body, to the \npeople here, and they have been fully vetted. The reason they are at \nthis point in getting through is they are extremely well qualified. \nThere may be philosophical differences with them, but if they are \nallowed to have a vote, they will be confirmed because they are well \nqualified. If they were not well qualified, if they were outside of the \nmainstream of judicial thought, they would not be confirmed and we \nwould not be debating this issue.\n  We have the Democratic Party deciding: OK, we are going to stop them. \nActually, they are well qualified and we cannot stop them on a majority \nvote; we are going to stop them on a filibuster and require a \nsupermajority vote.\n  They have taken that tactic. It is unprecedented. They have taken \nthat tactic which is within the rules of the Senate.\n  I want to point out what is going to happen if they persist in that \ntactic because then they put it back on us or the President to take \naction in response.\n  We can say we are not going to do anything, we are just going to let \nan unprecedented filibuster take over, to which a lot of us are saying \nthat is not right, that is not our job. This may force the President to \ndo a whole group of recess appointments, a right he has under the \nConstitution. He has been waiting for 4 years for some of these \nnominees. He would rather not do that, I am sure. I have not talked \nwith him, but I am sure he would rather not do that. He can say: If you \nare not going to let my judges through, you are supposed to give advice \nand consent, and if you are not going to give advice and consent, then \nthis is the action I have to take. Or it is going to force us to change \nthe filibuster rule on the issue of judges because of the unprecedented \nuse and requirement of a supermajority.\n  What I am pointing out is, while the Democrats can take this tactic, \nit is going to force a response which would be legal by a Republican \nmajority in the Senate, by the President, but all of which is \nunsatisfactory and not right. We ought to be voting on these judges.\n  We have seen the numbers. I think if the numbers were not so extreme, \nwe would not feel so forced into a corner, but the numbers are extreme. \nThe Senate has accumulated the worst circuit court confirmation record \nin modern times, thanks to this partisan obstruction. Only 35 of \nPresident Bush's 52 circuit court nominees were confirmed, which is a \nconfirmation rate of 67 percent. In comparison, President Johnson's \nconfirmation record in his first term in office was 95 percent, as were \n93 percent of President Carter's nominees.\n\n  The other side may point to the district court, the trier of fact, \nlevel of confirmations. Yes, those are there, but the circuit courts \nare the ones that get to review and interpret the law, and we are \ntrying to get judges who will interpret and not write the laws.\n  A number of people are willing to allow judges to write laws. I am \nnot one of those. That is our job. That is my constitutional role, that \nis my constitutional requirement, and the oath I took to the \nConstitution to write the laws and not to pass them off to the \njudiciary or to say: Well, it is too tough for us, let's let it pass \nthrough there.\n  Plus, what irritates so many people is the use of the judiciary in so \nmany areas that are so personal and deeply felt within this society. \nPeople are saying this is not right, this is something that should come \nin front of legislative bodies. Maybe it will take several election \ncycles for the body politic to get in a position to resolve these \nissues, and that is fine, it should take time on these major issues \nbefore us.\n  Also, I do not want to just focus on the numbers. We should remember \nthese nominees are not some sort of political prop. These are good \npeople with careers and commitment to public service, the quality and \ndepth of which is enviable.\n  Also, I note that a solid majority of people agree strongly with the \nPresident's position that he should pick judges who strictly interpret \nthe law rather than legislating from the bench, what the judges think \nthe law should be. Ignoring this mandate, some in this body, spurred on \nperhaps by outside interest groups, are threatening yet again to \nfilibuster these judge nominees.\n  We are now embarking on a dangerous area if we talk about changing \nthe role of the judiciary in this society and blocking nominees because \nthey are going to stay with the interpretation of the law and not write \nlaw. I\n\n[[Page S4896]]\n\nthink we should be thinking long and hard before we go with judges and \ngive a license for them to be more expansive in their role in the \nlegislating arena. That is wrong. It is not in the Constitution. It is \nnot the division of powers. We should have judges who strictly \ninterpret. That is what these nominees are about and much of the base \nof this fight is about.\n  I urge my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to think about \nwhat they will force in response by this tactic, and there will be a \nresponse to this tactic. I do not think it is wise for this body to \nmove toward that route.\n  I thank the Chair for this time. I yield the floor and yield back the \nremainder of time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the Senate will \nresume consideration of H.R. 3, which the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 3) to authorize funds for Federal-aid \n     highways, highway safety programs, and transit programs, and \n     for other purposes.\n\n  Pending:\n\n       Inhofe amendment No. 605, to provide a complete Substitute.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire is recognized.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, the highway bill which is presently before \nus comes to us pursuant to a budget agreement that was passed last \nFriday morning. In fact, I guess it was passed about 1 a.m. Friday \nmorning. That budget agreement had in it language that said there would \nbe $284 billion spent on highways under this highway agreement. It also \nhad language in it referencing something which is called a reserve fund \nwhich essentially says if legitimate offsets could be found, and if \nthey were determined to be legitimate by the chairman of the Budget \nCommittee, then that number could be increased by the amount of those \nlegitimate offsets.\n  Initially, when the bill was brought forward it was brought forward \nat $284 billion. It was brought out of committee at $284 billion. On \nMonday during the wrapup session, by unanimous consent, that bill, \nwhich had already been subject to a substitute, was hit with another \nsubstitute that had 1,300 pages in it. Within those 1,300 pages--and \nthey are not absolutely sure of this number yet--somewhere in the \nvicinity of $11.5 billion of new spending out of the highway trust \nfund. That in and of itself was inconsistent with the budget resolution \nthat had been passed last Friday in that it was $11.5 billion over that \nresolution and was therefore out of kilter relative to the allocation \ngiven to the committee, the Public Works Committee.\n  In addition, within those 1,300 pages which were submitted by \nsubstitute, by unanimous consent, on Monday night, one legislative day \nafter the budget had been passed, were representations that the offsets \nhad been placed in to pay for the $11.5 billion. There was no referral \nof those offsets to the Budget Committee as was required under the law \nthat had just been passed on the prior legislative day in the reserve \nfund of that law. In fact, the offsets as represented first were \noffsets which would apply to the general fund, not to the highway fund, \nand therefore created a violation of the Budget Act. But second were \noffsets which do not pass what we might refer to as the ``straight \nface'' test. In other words, they were not legitimate offsets. In fact, \none of the offsets which was referred to has been used 14 times in the \nlast 2\\1/2\\ years--14 times. Yet it was referred to with a straight \nface, although I am sure there was a smile behind it, as a legitimate \noffset.\n  It would be humorous were it not for the fact that it adds a $11.5 \nbillion burden to the taxpayers, which on the prior Friday we had said \nwe were not going to do to the taxpayers. So the bill as presently \npending under the substitute, as put forward on Monday night, the 1,300 \npages which are so extensive that CBO, which is the scorekeeper around \nhere, has even had trouble figuring out what is in it, that bill is \npresently in violation, or that substitute is in violation of the \nBudget Act. It is quite simply unequivocally, unquestionably a budget \nbuster.\n  One must ask the very obvious question that when the Senate passes a \nbudget on Friday of the legislative week, if on the Monday of the next \nweek, which amounts to the next legislative day, if that next Monday \nyou are going to by unanimous consent, late in the afternoon, during \nwrapup, put forward a substitute which includes in it a budget-busting \nexpansion of spending with a euphemistic and illusory statement of \noffsets--self-serving, also, by the way--if we are at all serious as a \nCongress about disciplining ourselves when it comes to protecting the \nAmerican taxpayer relative to the rate of growth of the Federal \nGovernment and Government expenditures. It would appear that if this \nsubstitute is allowed to survive in its present form, with this \nadditional money being spent, which exceeds significantly what was \nagreed to in a budget that was passed the day before, the answer to \nthat question would have to be, regrettably, no, we are not.\n  In addition to that problem, there is the issue of the President. \nNow, rolling the Budget Committee around here is sort of good \nentertainment, and it happens, unfortunately, too regularly. But \nrolling the President of the United States, and especially when the \nparty of the President of the United States decides to roll the \nPresident of the United States, is something a little more significant. \nThe President has said 284 is the number, the President has said even \nif there are offsets, 284 is the number and we are not going above that \nnumber. Yet a bill is reported to the floor that met that number with \nthe clear, obvious understanding now that it was going to be gamed, \nthat 284 number was going to be ignored. And now we have a bill that is \nprobably 295, 296, maybe 300. We are just not sure. We are talking \nbillions, folks, just to put it in context. That is not $296. That is \n$296 billion, which is a lot of money.\n  So the President has made it very clear--he has made it clear in his \npress conference, his administration has made it clear, the director of \nOMB has made it clear, and in an agreement with the House leadership \nthere was a clear understanding the highway bill would spend $284 \nbillion, not $296 billion, whether it was offset or not. Yet that \nposition of the President is being--well, it is being more than \nignored. It is being run over by a bulldozer or maybe a cement mixer or \nmaybe a paver. But in any event it is being run over. And that seems a \nlittle bit inappropriate, slightly inappropriate to me. Since the \nPresident has decided to try to exercise some fiscal discipline, it \nwould seem that we as a party that allegedly is a party of fiscal \ndiscipline would follow his lead rather than try to run him over.\n\n  So you have two problems. You have the problem of a Republican Senate \nrunning over a Republican President because we want to spend more \nmoney--or at least some Members of the Senate do--and then you have the \nRepublican Senate running over the Republican budget because some \nmembers want to spend more money. Then you have this gamesmanship, I \nguess would be the best term for it, which occurred on Monday night \nwhen you take 1,300 pages and throw it in under unanimous consent and \nput in it language which raises spending by $11.5 billion and has these \nproposed offsets which do not pass the straight face test.\n  So you wonder about that and you have to ask yourself where are we \nreally going if we can't even discipline ourselves on something like \nthis. You have to remember this bill did not start out at 284. It \nstarted out 2 years ago at, I think it was 219, maybe it was 220, maybe \nit was 230. It was in that range. Then last year, through another \nsleight of hand dealing with the funding mechanism, we shifted--we \ndidn't but some did--$15 billion or $18 billion--I do not recall \nexactly--out of the general account over to the highway account \nclaiming that there was no revenue impact, that this was an offset, of \ncourse, putting an $18 billion hole in the general fund in exchange for \ncovering up with the extra spending\n\n[[Page S4897]]\n\nin the highway fund. Then that, with a couple other manipulations, got \nus up to this 284 number which means that we are already in the hole on \nthis bill relative to the budget approximately $18 billion before this \nnext exercise of adding $11.5 billion on top of it.\n  It is my obligation, obviously--I end up drawing the short straw \naround here by some degree by being Budget chairman, but it is an \nobligation I take on because somebody has to do it and it should be \ndone--to be sort of the person who comes to the floor and says: What \nthe heck are we doing? We pass a budget on Friday which says we are \ngoing to control spending, says we are going to limit highway spending \nto $284 billion, and then on Monday in wrapup, with 1,300 pages of \nobfuscation, there is thrown in $11.5 billion of new spending, and \nthrown in are a lot of illusory and baseless offsets. What the heck are \nwe doing?\n  Well, in the context of what the heck are we doing, I have at least \nthe right to make us vote on this, at least the right to say to my \nfellow colleagues, if you want to do it, do it in the open a little \nbit. The way we should have done it, of course, was the way it was \noriginally structured. There should have been a straight up-or-down \nissue of whether, A, this additional $11.5 billion was a good idea to \nspend over the budget; or, B, properly offset. That is not now possible \nto do. I admit the folks who thought this out were creative and they \nstructured it so that is no longer possible to do. It was possible to \ndo on Monday until there was wrapup but not possible to do now.\n  That is the way it got structured, so I am left with very few \noptions.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the right to retain the floor for the \npurposes of discussing with the leader of the bill the timing on this \nnext vote. Is it the leader's position that he would want to vote at \n11:15?\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, in response to the distinguished chairman, \nyes, anytime after 11:15 and before 12 o'clock.\n  Mr. GREGG. Well, I will make the motion now and then ask we be in a \nquorum call until 11:15.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I would rather not do it because I will make a motion to \nwaive after the Senator makes the point of order. That is debatable and \nI would like to make it.\n  Mr. GREGG. We can just set the vote at 11:15 and you can debate it.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Sure. That is fine.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that upon my making \nthe point of order, should the chairman make a motion to waive that \npoint of order, that vote be at 11:15 with the yeas and nays being \nconsidered as being ordered.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Reserving the right to object, will the Senator \nrepeat the unanimous consent request?\n  Mr. GREGG. I am asking that we move to this vote at 11:15, but if the \nSenator needs 5 minutes, we can make it 11:20.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Make it 11:30. Then I would have no problem with it, \nand we will try to use time as quickly as we can.\n  Mr. GREGG. I would ask that the time be evenly divided.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Yes. No objection.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Reserving the right to object.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. INHOFE. For clarification purposes, are we now talking about a \nvote at 11:30; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I believe I reserved the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire does have the \nfloor. The Senator from New Hampshire is recognized.\n  Is there an objection to the vote occurring at 11:30 with the time \nequally divided? Is there any objection to that restated request?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I make a point of order that the pending \nsubstitute increases spending in excess of the allocation to the \nCommittees on Environment and Public Works, Banking and Commerce. \nTherefore, I raise a point of order against the amendment pursuant to \nsection 302(f) of the Budget Act.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I move to waive any relevant provisions of the Budget Act \nfor the substitute and the bill.\n  Mr. GREGG. The yeas and nays have been ordered, as I understand it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The yeas and nays have not been ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There appears to \nbe a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, there can be honest differences of \nopinion. The way this has worked historically, and I have had the \nexperience on this type of legislation for 19 years now, is that we \ncome up with a bill. The bill we came up with is based on a formula. It \nis not a pork bill. It is a spending bill because it is a spending bill \non infrastructure for America.\n  My job, and the job of the ranking leader, Senator Jeffords, is to \ncome up with a bill that meets the infrastructure needs of America. \nThen we look to the Finance Committee to help us to find the funds to \nfinance it. I am not about to pass judgment, as others appear to be \nreadily willing to do, to cast disparaging remarks on the nature of the \noffsets or the nature of the product of the Finance Committee. I know \nwe came up with a good bill. It is one that is not nearly as high, in \nterms of the amount of money that would be spent, as the needs. In \nfact, it has been looked at and evaluated that if we are to pass a \nbill, even at the $295 billion over the 6-year period, of which 5 years \nare remaining, that it would not even maintain what we have today.\n  I also want to correct something else because the very distinguished \nchairman of the Budget Committee is certainly knowledgeable in all of \nthese areas. He talks about being conservative and talks about doing \nthese things in a proper and appropriate way. Well, I would challenge \nanyone to match my conservative performance and credentials, and yet I \nhave always said that when one comes to this body there are two areas \nwhere conservatives are big spenders. One is in national defense and \none is in infrastructure. That is what we are supposed to be doing. We \nare supposed to be building the infrastructure and improving the \ninfrastructure.\n  This bill is not just any type of bill that is coming along. This is \na bill that is a matter of life and death. We put together a formula to \ndetermine how the distribution between the States should take place. In \nthat formula, one of the elements is the mortality rate on the highways \non a per capita basis. Now, if no one is concerned about the number of \nlives that are lost, quite frankly my State of Oklahoma has more lives \nlost on the highway than the average State. Consequently, that is one \nof many determining factors in a formula. The formulas have factors for \nthe donee States and the donor States, the number of miles and, I might \neven add to my friend from New Hampshire, even covered bridges.\n  This bill probably could be considered by most people as the most \nimportant bill we will have this entire year. It is probably the second \nlargest bill we will have this entire year. It is one that lets us \nrebuild the infrastructure of America. We all have heard the \nstatistics. There is no sense going over and plowing those fields \nagain, but it is one also that is a huge jobs bill.\n  I am not one to say that WPA--actually the WPA looks pretty good now \nafter a few years, but I do not look at Government as the ultimate \nemployer. But when they talk about for each billion of new construction \nit provides 47,000 jobs, it is a huge jobs bill. It is very \nsignificant.\n  Many people are supporting this bill. There are Democrats, \nRepublicans, liberals, conservatives. As a conservative Republican, I \nwholeheartedly support it. I support it at the higher level because I \nthink that is what we are supposed to be doing.\n  I am sure there will be those who want to talk a little bit about the \nproduct of the Finance Committee. I know the ranking member of my \ncommittee, Senator Jeffords, wants to make a statement or two. We have \nbetween now and the next 25 minutes to discuss this. I just want to \nassure my friend, the chairman of the Budget Committee, I am very \nsincere, and I think\n\n[[Page S4898]]\n\nwe are doing the right thing. While I do not always agree \nwholeheartedly with the President, I do 99 percent of the time. In this \ncase, I disagreed last year. Last year, when we came up with $318 \nbillion, we should have passed that. I believe the Finance Committee \nwas sincere when they said we had this covered, and it was something \nthat I supported at that time. The President did not support it.\n\n  There are a lot of things we pass that I would like to debate and not \npay for. This is not one of them. I feel very strongly that we should \ngo ahead. Quite frankly, I do not think the number is high enough, but \nif this is all we can cover, then I am happy with that. The most \nimportant thing is we have to have a highway bill. We are on our sixth \nextension right now. The States are wondering what we are doing. They \nhave no way of planning in advance. They cannot plan for the next 5 \nyears. All they can do is say: We have another 6-month extension. What \nwill we do for the next 6 months? Then we all miss the construction \nseason. In States such as that of my friend from Vermont, a northern \nState, and the State of New Hampshire, we have already missed the \nmajority of the construction season. So it is very important that we \nnot continue with extensions and that we get this bill passed. To do \nthis, we already have a cloture motion in effect. We need to get by \nthis motion, and I think we will be doing that.\n  I yield to the ranking minority member.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise today in support of manager's \npackage for the highway bill.\n  This package, which combines all four titles of the Safe, \nAccountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation Equity Act, increases \nfunding for our highways and transit systems by $11.2 billion.\n  I commend Senators Grassley and Baucus for putting together a package \nthat not only increase the resources for our States but does not add to \nthe Federal deficit.\n  One cannot drive this highway bill on empty. Funding is its fuel, and \nwe need to make sure this bill has a full tank when it leaves the \nSenate and heads to conference.\n  The White House argues that the financing of the manager's package is \nbased on gimmicks.\n  To that I say nonsense.\n  If Senator Grassley and Senator Baucus tell me it is paid for, then I \nbelieve them.\n  Frankly, compared to the funding levels in last year's highway bill, \ntoday's package is modest.\n  The President should be claiming victory and applauding our actions \nrather than threatening a veto.\n  This additional funding will mean we can make more roads safer, make \nsure more Americans face less traffic, and create more jobs.\n  This additional funding benefits every State, every city, every \ncountry and every town. This additional funding makes all the world of \ndifference.\n  I would yield the floor at this time and offer the Senator from \nArkansas such time as he desires to discuss the transportation bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, we do want to hear from the Senator from \nArkansas, but in fairness, we should go back and forth. The chairman of \nthe subcommittee, Senator Bond, wants to be heard first. Does the \nSenator from Vermont have an objection to that?\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. That is fine.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Graham). The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. How much time do we have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Six minutes for the proponents of the motion.\n  Mr. BOND. I ask that I be given 4 minutes of that, allowing 2 minutes \nfor my colleague on the other side of the aisle.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, we are once again asking for the support of \nour colleagues to raise the contract authority or budget authority in \nthe highway bill. We said we were going to do this when we brought it \nto the floor. Eighty of our Members voted in the Budget Act to allow \nthe Finance Committee to come in with additional resources, which they \nhave done. There has been discussion about the legitimacy of the \noffsets and the Finance Committee actions. The Joint Tax Committee has \nscored it. That is the authoritative view. It does not add to the \nbudget. The comments about this being a budget buster are absolutely \nwrong. These funds are paying for the money we add.\n  I will explain a little bit of complicated budgetary process. There \nare two things called the obligation limit, which is the amount that \ncan be spent, the guaranteed amount. Traditionally, we have put a \nhigher number into the bill for what we call budget authority, or what \nis called contract authority. That is because the highway departments \ncannot spend all of the money that they contract, and to enable them to \nspend the $283.9 billion guaranteed spending proposed by the President \nwe have to have a higher contract or budget authority number.\n  This measure, which was added by the Finance Committee and which is \nnow subject to the point of order, was designed to raise, with a fully \noffset amount, the spending so that we could provide additional funds \nfor badly needed State roads.\n  Let me be clear. This amount that was added will enable us to bring \nall donor States up to 92 cents on the dollar by the end of the period. \nIt will also guarantee those States which are at the bottom of the list \nin terms of increases to get at least a 15-percent increase. It is \nimperative that those who joined with us in the 80-vote majority to add \nthe provision allowing the Finance Committee now reaffirm that they \nbelieve this money is necessary.\n  The additional money, contract or budget authority, will not be \nspent, the obligation limit will increase slightly, but we cannot spend \nthe money the President said we should spend, the $283.9 billion, \nunless we increase the contract authority. Obviously, that's lots of \nconfusion but that is where we are.\n  I urge my colleagues who understand, as the chairman and ranking \nmember of the committee and my colleague Senator Baucus on the \ncommittee understand, we have to have this money for safety, for \neconomic development, for continued growth and the health of our \neconomy.\n  I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of our time for use by my \ncolleague.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I rise to offer my support for the motion \nto waive the budget point of order and also to support the efforts of \nthe Senator from Oklahoma and urge my colleagues to also support those \nefforts. This legislation is 2 years overdue. I am very pleased we are \nfinally making some headway on getting this done. Forcing our States to \noperate under the uncertainty caused by short-term extensions is no way \nto govern. We are now in the sixth extension, and it is my hope that we \nare able to complete our work in the Senate and complete the conference \nbefore the current extension expires at the end of the month.\n  I also thank Senator Inhofe, Senator Bond, Senator Jeffords, and \nSenator Baucus for their very hard work on this bill and all the time \nthey have spent and their efforts in working in such a bipartisan way. \nI also thank Senator Shelby and Senator Sarbanes on the hours they have \nput in on the transit portion, and I thank Senators Lott and Inouye, as \nchairman and cochair of the Commerce Committee Subcommittee on Surface \nTransportation and Merchant Marine for their work on the safety \nportions of this bill.\n  Economic development is a very important part of any infrastructure \ndevelopment--we talked about that a little bit this morning already--\nbut not at the expense of the safety of families. This bill enhances \nthe safety of our roadways.\n  As a member of the Commerce Committee, I was very happy to have the \nopportunity to play a role in developing the safety titles. It is good \nlegislation that will increase the safety of our highways for all \nAmericans, and it is bipartisan legislation, developed with the input \nof safety groups, industry, the administration, as well as State and \nlocal officials.\n\n[[Page S4899]]\n\n  Every great nation in the history of the world has flourished because \nof improvements to its infrastructure. If you look at the great periods \nof development and invention in the world, almost all of them have \ncoincided with advances in transportation options, whether it is safely \nmoving people, expanding trade, or increasing contact between cultures. \nMy constituents remind me all the time about the importance of roads \nand relieving congestion and creating economic growth--virtually every \ntime I go to Arkansas. Last week when I was there, people were asking \nme, when in the world are you going to get the highway bill done?\n  Our constituents are very smart. As I travel the State I hear the \nsame four things over and over, and I believe they are right. They tell \nme the four things we must accomplish in this highway bill are, No. 1, \nwe must produce a highway bill that addresses critical infrastructure \nneeds that are not currently being met; No. 2, we must produce a \nhighway bill to spur economic development and the creation of jobs.\n  How is my time doing, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. PRYOR. I ask unanimous consent for 2 more minutes.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I yield the Senator 2 minutes off of my \ntime, even though he doesn't appear to be agreeing with me.\n  Mr. PRYOR. I will make it quick. I thank the Senator for yielding the \ntime.\n  No. 3, we must produce a highway bill to increase the safety of our \ntransportation system for American families and, No. 4, we must produce \na highway bill that anticipates future needs.\n  I could go on and on about how important it is for job creation, \nwhich we talked about a few moments ago; about how much more congested \nour highways are today as opposed to 10 years ago, and how congested \nthey will be in 20 years from now.\n  I offer my support and encourage my colleagues to support the efforts \nof Senator Inhofe and others as we go through this very important \nlegislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I want to take this opportunity to \nrespond to the points raised to justify the budget point of order. The \nreason I want to do that now is because there are some things that are \nnot clear about this legislation. I tried to make them clear in my \nremarks yesterday, but it is obvious that if they had been clear, there \nwould not have been a budget point of order.\n  One of the points made by the chairman of the Budget Committee and \nother Members of the Senate is that the Senate highway bill is larger \nthan the President's request. It was alleged that Senate authorizers \n``snuck in'' a change in their substitute, without a separate vote, to \nincrease the bill's level of funding above $284 billion. Senate budget \nstaff is correct that the amendment on the Floor that is pending is \nlarger in size than the bill requested by the President. Senate \nleadership, all authorizing committees, and the Finance Committee were \nwell aware of this fact and made a determination to offer a substitute \namendment in excess of the President's request. This makes perfect \nsense and, of course, is in keeping with separation of powers and the \nfact that the President, under our Constitution, proposes and the \nCongress, under the Constitution, disposes.\n  A majority of the Senate wishes to provide more infrastructure \nresources than the executive branch. The substitute bill, with \nincreased funding, is completely offset or revenue-neutral. As a matter \nof fact, the bill contributes positively and substantially towards \ndeficit reduction. As indicated in my statement yesterday, the \nadministration and the budgeteers should focus on deficit reduction \nrather than on the top-line spending number. The Senate continues to \noffset legislation and, by so doing, exercises fiscal restraint, a fact \nbeing continuously ignored by some in this body.\n  Another point made is that provisions passed in the JOBS bill last \nOctober--sometimes referred to as FSC/ETI bill--signed by the President \nin October, that somehow the provisions we had in that bill relating to \nfuel fraud did not increase general fund receipts or even things \ndealing with other tax provisions did not increase general fund \nreceipts. I speak of acronyms that we used last fall that may not be \nfamiliar to people now that we are by that legislation. But we \nconstantly talked about the ethanol provisions with the acronym, VEETC, \nvolumetric ethanol excise tax credit, and fuel fraud provisions that \nwere enacted in the JOBS bill which other Members of this body have \nalleged, and I quote here, ``have made the highway trust fund healthier \nby $2 to $3 billion annually only by definition, since merely moving \naround deck chairs has not changed the Federal Government's bottom \nline.''\n  That is a serious accusation considering how careful we were over a \nperiod of months last year not only to work on the VEETC provisions to \nbring in money to the Federal Government that was fraudulently not \nbeing paid but also to make sure that we did it in a fiscally sound \nway.\n  This is my answer to that accusation. Last year the JOBS bill enacted \nethanol and fuel fraud provisions that increased projected receipts to \nthe highway trust fund by $17 billion during the period of the highway \nbill reauthorization, 2005 to 2009. These provisions were also included \nin last year's transportation bill but had to be enacted instead in the \nJOBS bill after it became clear that we would not get a conference \nagreement on the highway bill.\n  That is an unfair accusation that somehow all this work that we went \nthrough is just moving around deck chairs but has not changed the \nFederal Government's bottom line. Seventeen billion dollars coming in \nduring that period of time, $17 billion, some of which was being \nfraudulently avoided.\n  Congress had good reasons to enact the ethanol changes in the JOBS \nbill. These changes helped to pay for a large bipartisan tax bill to \nprovide tax relief to domestic American manufacturing. And these \nethanol changes accompanied other energy incentives in that bill that \nhad overwhelming support of both Chambers and both parties. Because of \nthose ethanol changes, fuel excise tax receipts are now going into the \nhighway trust fund. That means the Federal highway program now has more \ndollars available to it. It is just common sense. That is how trust \nfund accounting works.\n  It seems that some would now allow us to ignore those accounting \nrules. Some would like us to pretend that those new fuel tax dollars \nare not in the trust fund. You can't change what are just plain facts \nof life. These funds are in the highway trust fund.\n  This Congress should not pretend that a law enacted by a previous \nCongress did not happen. We are not using fuzzy arithmetic or fuzzy \naccounting. We are not just moving deck chairs around and not affecting \nthe Government's bottom line. We are, in a very real way, affecting the \nGovernment's bottom line. And we are going to have, not only people who \nwere avoiding paying taxes paying those taxes, but we are going to be \nable to have better transportation infrastructure, better highways by \nwhat we are doing. We should not ignore standard fund accounting rules \nbecause a minority of this Senate disagrees that taxes paid on a gallon \nof ethanol should not go into the highway trust fund.\n  The administration did not object to these provisions as part of the \nJOBS bill last October. The President signed that bill and now the \nadministration's own transportation proposals rely on these new trust \nfund receipts that were developed in a bipartisan way by the Senate \nFinance Committee. The changes that we made in the JOBS Act made good \nsense, common sense, but that comes out also as good policy. They \nraised money for the highway trust fund.\n  We have every right--indeed, we have every obligation to the people \nwho pay money into the road fund--to use those funds to improve \nAmerica's highways.\n  If you don't use trust fund money for highways or for other \ntransportation reasons, you should not be taxing it in the first place. \nBut once it is taxed, those people who are fraudulently not paying that \ntax are guilty and should pay that tax. Our provisions do that.\n  Another claim by the Budget Committee is that the Finance Committee \nhas not provided real offsets for increased burdens to the general \nfund. My colleague from New Hampshire, chairman of the Budget \nCommittee,\n\n[[Page S4900]]\n\nsuggests that our bill offsets, including economic substance, are \nillusory. He is concerned that these offsets, which were also passed \nduring the last Congress, will be dropped in conference.\n  Now, the Joint Committee on Taxation, as we all know--maybe some of \nus forget--is the official scorekeeper on tax matters in the Congress, \nnot the Congressional Budget Office. The Finance Committee has provided \ntax law changes that have been scored by the Joint Committee on \nTaxation as fully offsetting any increased burden to the general fund. \nThe Joint Committee on Taxation is the official scorekeeper for revenue \nprovisions under the Congressional Budget Act. It is not the Senate \nBudget Committee that is the scorekeeper; it is the Joint Committee on \nTaxation. Section 201(g) of the Budget Act restricts the Congressional \nBudget Office in a manner in which it carries out its responsibilities \nrelated to revenue legislation. Section 201(g) provides, in pertinent \npart:\n\n       For the purposes of revenue legislation, which is income, \n     estate and gift, excise, and payroll taxes, considered or \n     enacted in any session of Congress, the Congressional Budget \n     Office shall use exclusively during that session of Congress \n     revenue estimates provided to it by the Joint Committee on \n     Taxation. During that session of Congress, such revenue \n     estimates shall be transmitted by the Congressional Budget \n     Office to any committee of the House of Representatives or \n     the Senate requesting such estimates, and shall be used by \n     such committees in determining such estimates.\n\n  This, then, should put to rest this debate about whether these \noffsets that are in my amendment and in Senator Baucus's amendment--\nthat is a bipartisan amendment--are real. They have been scored by the \nJoint Committee on Taxation, the official scorekeeper under the \nCongressional Budget Act for revenue purposes.\n  I kind of think that maybe the Budget Committee is living in an ivory \ntower. It is particularly troubling that this nonsense attack--that the \noffsets are not real--comes from a committee that doesn't have to do \nany of the heavy lifting to find real offsets and real savings. But \ninstead just find reasons to complain about some other committee's \nwork. It must be nice to be able to just pick numbers out of thin air \nand try to claim the numbers are real or, in this instance, somehow not \nreal, even though the Joint Committee on Taxation scores it as revenue-\nneutral, or better than revenue-neutral, as reducing the deficit. But \nit is the Finance Committee, not the Budget Committee, that actually \nhas to do the hard work of finding, negotiating, and drafting the \npolicies that can pass the Senate and create these real offsets.\n  Yesterday, I said 40 percent of the new funding is hard trust fund \nmoney. Of course, the Finance Committee gets no credit for that effort, \nno credit at all. It is a ridiculous charge. It is so easy to throw \nrocks around here. How about dealing with constructing policy instead \nof throwing rocks? I would like to see some of that.\n  The complaints we are hearing are from a committee that has no \nresponsibility to find real numbers, real offsets, or real savings. It \nreminds me of an agricultural economist telling a farmer how to farm. I \nsuggest that those who are sitting on the fence giving this farmer--and \nI am an Iowa farmer--stewardship advice about how to farm should get \noff the fence and get some dirt under their fingernails, and I will be \nhappy to show them how to start the tractor. And I say this as a person \nwho has been very loyal in my membership on the Budget Committee, as \nwell as being chairman of the Finance Committee, because out of 48 \namendments that were offered to destroy the budget that came out of the \nBudget Committee, I supported the chairman on 47 of the 48 amendments.\n  Now, the suggestion was also made that we have used these revenue \nraisers in the previous Congress. None of the offsets included in the \nhighway substitute have passed the Senate this year as part of any \nother legislation. Even if that were the case, those additional \nanticipated revenues are available until they are passed by both Houses \nand enacted into law.\n  There seems to be an additional concern that the offsets used in this \nbill would not survive a conference with the House. As a person who \nworked for 8 years and 3 days--from when I first introduced the \nbankruptcy reform bill to when the President signed the bill a month \nago--if I would have ever stopped because a bill passed the Senate but \nsomehow didn't get to the President, we would never have a bankruptcy \nreform bill. But we passed that bill seven or eight different times--\nthe conference report, plus original legislation through the Senate. \nHow you get things done in the Senate is by sticking with it--just \ndon't give up.\n  And we are doing that here. We continue to close corporate tax \nloopholes the same way. People on the Budget Committee are finding \nfault that we might pass the Senate and not get out of conference. That \nsomehow means we are using a smokescreen. Let me suggest that on the \nJOBS bill last year, which I have already referred to several times in \nmy remarks today, we passed through the Senate $39 billion of corporate \ntax loophole closers, and we ended up out of conference with $24 \nbillion of that $39 billion. I don't think that is such a bad track \nrecord. If it had not been for the Senate and the bipartisan approach \nof the Finance Committee, we would not even have those $24 billion of \nloophole closers--money coming into the Federal Treasury. So you cannot \njust stop. Because these offsets, whether they be fraudulent use of tax \ndollars, nonpayment in a fraudulent way of gas tax money or other \nloophole closers--in all of these cases we have people finding ways to \navoid paying their share of taxes that ought to be paid.\n\n  One has to keep at it. There is a constant game around here of \nlawyers, accountants, and investment bankers that like to game our Tax \nCode. It is pretty hard to keep ahead of them, but I am determined, and \nSenator Baucus is determined, to keep ahead of them. So I am not going \nto have anybody tell me we are not legitimate when we pass things \nthrough the Senate that maybe cannot survive conference because \neventually they do survive conference, and eventually they are signed \nby the President.\n  The Senate cannot be subjected to the expectation of passage in the \nHouse as a standard for this body. The Senate has to focus on what is \npossible in the Senate, and differences will be resolved and reconciled \nwith the other legislative body during the conference process.\n  As an additional point, I note it was Ways and Means Chairman Bill \nThomas, not the Senate Finance Committee, who first proposed \ncodification of the economic substance doctrine, which is the largest \nrevenue provision added in the substitute bill. I would also like to \nrecite a little of the history of this matter so we will not presume \nthat something maybe will not get through conference because maybe it \ndid not get through conference last October, particularly when the \nchairman of the House Ways and Means Committee first brought up this \nissue.\n  The Senate Finance Committee began its work on tax shelter \nlegislation in 1999. During the years 2000 and 2001, the Finance \nCommittee released three discussion drafts to stimulate public comment \non the closing of corporate tax shelters. None of these drafts contains \ncodification of the economic substance doctrine that we are using in \nthis amendment before the Senate right now as an offset. In May 2002, \nthe Finance Committee reported out the Tax Shelter Transparency Act of \n2002, which formed the basis for the tax shelter disclosure rules \nenacted in last fall's tax bill. The Tax Shelter Transparency Act did \nnot contain codification of the economic substance doctrine.\n  In July of 2002, a mere 2 months after the Finance Committee reported \nout its bill, Chairman Thomas laid down H.R. 5095, the American \nCompetitiveness and Corporate Accountability Act of 2002. This bill \nwould have repealed the FSC/ETI regime and used the proceeds for \ncorporate international tax reform. It was also the first time the Ways \nand Means Committee dipped its toe into the waters of tax shelter \nclosing legislation.\n  H.R. 5095 parroted the disclosure provisions of the bipartisan Senate \nFinance Committee-reported bill, but it went one step further--it \ncalled for codification of the economic substance doctrine. So where \ndid folks get the idea around here that somehow economic substance \ndoctrine codification is blue smoke, intended to mislead the Senate \ninto believing that something is\n\n[[Page S4901]]\n\nrevenue-neutral when it is not because this bill is revenue-neutral as \nscored by the Joint Committee on Taxation.\n  As an aside, I remind my colleagues that this additional money comes \nout of the hide of tax shelter promoters and tax shelter participants, \nnot out of the pockets of the honest middle-class working men and women \nof America. This is not phony money, as maybe we were led to believe. \nThis is good tax policy.\n  In emphasizing that the Senate highway bill is bigger than that \nprovided in the budget resolution, the following quote was used: ``[i]t \nappears the Finance Committee floor amendments include provisions quite \nsimilar to those general fund transfers that were included in last \nyear's Senate-passed bill. Such general fund transfers do nothing to \noffset the deficit effect of the increased spending in that \namendment.'' I want to say why that is hogwash. The Members of this \nbody have indicated, and will vote their intent on this issue in just a \nfew moments, to spend more than was included in the Senate budget \nresolution. No procedural games, gimmicks, or end runs will be needed \nto prove this point. As the distinguished chairman of the Senate Budget \nCommittee indicated repeatedly during the budget process, if there are \n60 votes for something, then so be it, and clearly more than 60 members \nof the Senate are in agreement about this budget point of order.\n  But we do take issue with the fact that we were accused of sending an \namendment to this Floor for consideration by 100 Members of the Senate \nthat did nothing to offset the deficit effect of increased spending. \nThe accusation is purely false and purposely misleading. Our substitute \namendment replaced trust fund and general fund receipts and contributed \nsubstantially to the deficit reduction by more than $10 billion.\n  Finally, to those critics of the Senate Finance Committee title, I \nreissue the challenge I put to them yesterday, that obviously was not \nlistened to. It is the same challenge from last year. If they do not \nlike our Finance Committee title, come forward and tell us they do not \nwant any new money for their State from this highway bill. \nAlternatively, if they want to keep their State's extra money, find \nanother way to get there that will yield 60 votes. I issued the \nchallenge last year, I issued the challenge yesterday, and I reissue \nthat challenge this very hour.\n  Now, I did not get any takers last year, I did not get any takers \nyesterday, and I do not expect to get any takers today. So once again, \nit is easy to complain, but we are here to do the people's business and \nthis amendment that came out of my committee is the people's business--\nit is financially responsible, doing things to close corporate tax \nloopholes, to be fair to middle-class working men and women, to get the \njob done basically of improving our highway and transportation \ninfrastructure.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I say to the Senator from Iowa, the \ndistinguished chairman of the Finance Committee, what a great job they \nhave done. We imposed upon them the obligation or the duty of coming \nforth and coming up with a way to pay for a more robust bill. As I have \nsaid several times before, there are still other things we need to be \ndoing, and even with the action that has been taken, it is not enough, \nbut I understand he does now have it in a position where we are not \nincreasing the deficit; that this is properly offset and I would almost \nbelieve those who oppose what he is doing are people who do not want \nthe bill to start with.\n  We have been inviting people to come down with their amendments. I \nsee the Senator from New Jersey is in the Chamber. I am anxious to get \nas many people down as possible and would encourage those Members who \nhave amendments, keep in mind, the deadline for filing amendments is \nnow behind us and we are operating under cloture right now. We need to \nhave them get down and not wait until the last minute.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. What is the status of the time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 13\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. GREGG. And the opposition?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. No time.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, to respond in part--and in whole, \nhopefully--to some of the points that have been made here, let me begin \nby saying I have an immense amount of respect for the chairman of the \ncommittee and for the Senator from Missouri, for the ranking Democrat \non the committee, the Senator from Vermont, a neighbor who is retiring \nand who has done great service for our country and has decided to relax \nand go back to a beautiful State. Of course, he is going to go to New \nHampshire to buy his goods because we don't have a sales tax, by the \nway. The chairman does exemplary work. He has been a tireless advocate, \nobviously, of trying to get this highway bill across the floor.\n  Honestly, I thought the Budget Committee had done its job when we \nwent to the $284 billion number, which was a lot higher than where the \nPresident had started. I thought the President had done his job when he \nwent to the $284 billion number as a compromise which was a lot higher \nthan he started out. I think he was at $250 billion when he began this \nprocess. I thought we had reached agreement. Then Friday morning at 1 \na.m., when we passed the budget, I was pretty sure we reached an \nagreement. The agreement was $284 billion.\n  Unfortunately, the amendment which showed up Monday night put a \npretty big hole in that budget--$11.5 billion. As I have said earlier, \nwe have to ask ourselves, why did we pass the budget on Friday to have \nthe effect on the next legislative day--the next legislative day--to \nbreak the budget by $11.5 billion.\n  The Senator from Missouri says it is not a budget buster. I have to \npoint out to the Senator from Missouri that yes, it is. That is what we \nare voting on. If it were not a budget buster, the Chair would not rule \nin my favor that it breaks the budget. That is what the motion is. The \nmotion is this violates the Budget Act.\n  It violates the Budget Act on 2 counts. I am not taking the first \ncount because that is a procedural battle. I am taking the second \ncount, which is the substantive battle, which is that this amendment \nviolates the Budget Act because it exceeds the allocation to the \ncommittee by $11.5 billion. So it is a budget buster. If it were not a \nbudget buster, you would not have to waive the rule, you know, so let's \nnot throw that straw dog out there.\n  And the offsets? I agreed with the chairman of the Finance Committee \nwhen he came to the floor last night and said, and I will quote:\n\n       I also understand and agree with the House position that we \n     should not mix general fund offsets and trust fund resources \n     to that end.\n\n  I agree with that. But, yet, this amendment, this substitute, does \nexactly that. It takes money out of the general fund, moves it over to \nthe trust fund, and then claims that the trust fund spending is offset \nby very illusory alleged revenue increases in the general fund, as I \npointed out in my earlier statement. One of these revenue increases, \nthe biggest one, has been used 14 times in the last 2\\1/2\\ years--14 \ntimes. How many times can you use a revenue increase?\n  We all know it is not a real revenue offset. We all know it is going \nto be dropped at conference. It has been dropped at conference every \ntime it gets used; it gets used. It gets dropped, but the spending goes \non. So as a practical matter the offsets, from the standpoint of the \nBudget Committee, do not plug the hole that is put in the budget, first \nbecause they do not apply to the trust fund which creates spending \nbeyond the committee's allocation, and second because they exceed the \ngeneral fund--they will not occur. I guess that's the best way to say \nit. They are not going to happen. The offsets are not going to happen.\n  Excuse me, I don't want to be excessive here: $700 million of the \nalleged $11.5 billion we deem to be legitimate offsets. They will \noccur.\n  But, independent of that, independent of whether this offset issue is \nreal or not, and it is not real, by the way, the President--he is a \nRepublican, he was just elected--reached an agreement with the House. \nHe said, ``I am going to let you spend $30 billion more than I really \nwant to spend in this area,'' but he has said--having made that \nconcession to our colleagues because he got pressure--we are going to\n\n[[Page S4902]]\n\nhold the line at $284 billion. That is it. No more.\n  We all know that highways are important. We all know infrastructure \nis important. But we reached a consensus, first between the President \nand the House leadership. I agree, Senator Inhofe did not sign on to \nthat idea, other than to bring a bill out at that number, but I agree, \nhe is very forthright. He has always been committed to getting a higher \nnumber. But at least within the context of the greater party, the \nRepublican Party, there was an agreement at $284 billion with the \nPresident of the United States. And then we confirmed that agreement \nlast Friday with the budget for which 52 Republicans voted.\n\n  I am not expecting any votes on this issue from the other side of the \naisle. During the budget process they proposed amendments which added \n$260 billion to the budget, so clearly the issue of controlling \nspending is not that high on their testing, on their schedule of agenda \nitems. But it should be on ours. We have a President of our party say \n$284 billion is the number, and when that has been agreed to by a large \nmembership of our party including, I believe, the majority leader in \nthe Senate and the Speaker of the House, and when we confirm that \nagreement by passing a budget that says that is the number, we should \nstay with that number. It is what I would call common sense and \nprobably appropriate action. That is why it is important, I believe, \nthat we hold this number.\n  I respond to one other sidebar representation here--because it needs \nto be responded to but not because it is the essence of the debate--the \nquestion of the amendment that passed when we were marking up the \nbudget, which had 80 votes, relative to how the additional highway \nspending would occur should additional highway spending be approved and \nbe within the budget, called a trust fund. That trust fund had, as part \nof its structure, that if there was to be additional spending over $284 \nbillion, it would have to be offset and it would have to come back to \nthe Budget Committee so the Budget Committee could review it to \ndetermine whether the offsets were legitimate. That did not happen. The \nsubstitute occurred Monday night. We never saw it. It took us a long \ntime to find it. It was 1,300 pages. People have been looking for a \nlong time to find out exactly what it means. Even CBO is having a lot \nof trouble shaking it out. But we know we were never consulted on that \nnumber or how it was offset, which would have been the requirement \nunder that reserve fund. Therefore, the representation that a vote on \nthis waiver issue should be tied into your vote on that amendment issue \nis very hard to connect. In fact, the two pass in the night. There is \nno relationship between the vote that occurred in the budget debate and \nthe vote on this waiver issue.\n  This waiver issue is very simple. The chairman of the committee has \nmoved to waive a budget point of order because the bill as it is \npresently structured spends more than the budget that we passed on \nFriday night by $11.5 billion. It spends that much more than the budget \npassed.\n  The offsets, we believe, are illusory. I presume the Finance \nCommittee will argue that they are not. But they have used them 14 \ntimes before, so I will leave it to the body to decide whether they \nare.\n  But independent of that issue, the offset issue, the simple fact is \nthis amendment puts an $11.5 billion hole in what was an agreed-to \nnumber relative to the allocation, relative to what was going to be \nspent, relative to what the President thought was the understanding, \nand relative to what we had in our budget.\n  I see the majority leader is here. I yield the remainder of my time \nto the majority leader.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I know we will be voting here in a couple \nof minutes, but I did want to rise in support of the Budget Act point \nof order against the pending substitute to the highway bill. I do \ncommend the chairman of the Budget Committee, Senator Gregg, for \nraising it.\n  We do need to exercise fiscal discipline in the Senate. This bill is \na good example. We all want to pass a strong highway bill. It will \nbenefit our economy and will create millions of jobs across the \ncountry. As I have said on the floor many times, it will contribute to \nsafety on our highways. It is long overdue. The previous bill, TEA-21, \nexpired in September of 2003 and on six occasions we have had to pass \nextensions. The current extension expires at the end of this month and \nwe need to get this bill to conference as soon as possible, in my mind, \nso we can resolve what differences exist between the House and the \nSenate bill and so the President can sign it as soon as possible.\n  It should be clear to all of my colleagues the path to getting a bill \nsigned into law will be smooth only if Congress stays within the \nspending parameters that have been laid out by the budget resolution we \npassed last month and by the President of the United States who must \nultimately sign this bill.\n  The budget resolution, as Chairman Gregg has noted, allowed for \ntransportation spending over a 6-year period of $283.9 billion. We \npassed that budget resolution here in the Senate a couple of weeks ago, \non April 28.\n  In addition, the President of the United States has made it clear he \nwill not sign a bill into law that spends more than the amount provided \nfor in the budget resolution--$283.9 billion over 6 years. He made it \nclear publicly, privately, and in the statement of administration \npolicy on this bill, which clearly states:\n\n       Should the obligation or net authorization levels that will \n     result from the final bill exceed these limits the \n     President's senior advisers would recommend that he veto the \n     bill.\n\n  Finally, I want to make clear that sustaining this budget point of \norder will not kill the highway bill. Another substitute would be \noffered that stays within the spending limits set forth in the budget \nresolution and by the President, just as the various titles reported \nout by the different committees of jurisdiction did.\n  I am convinced we can pass a good bill that addresses America's \ninfrastructure needs, creates millions of new jobs, and can be signed \ninto law by the President. We should move forward to do just that.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is expired.\n  The yeas and nays have previously been ordered.

Three-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn having voted in \nthe affirmative, the motion is agreed to, and the point of order fails.\n\n[[Page S4903]]\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Murkowski). The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, the vote that just took place is \nsignificant. We all realize that the Finance Committee has done their \njob. The Joint Tax Committee has verified that their work is good. They \nhave found legitimate offsets. It is easy to say there are not, but \nthere are. While it is very much a concern to everyone in terms of the \nbudget and deficits, I am always ranked, certainly, as in the top five \nmost conservative Members of this body. I can tell my colleagues, I \nwould not vote for something that is going to increase the deficit. \nThis is not increasing the deficit.\n  When we stop to think about what we are supposed to be doing in \nWashington, we talk about a lot of silly programs, but the two most \nimportant things on which you might say I am a big spender are, No. 1, \ndefense and, No. 2, infrastructure. There is nothing more important \nthat we will be voting on this year than this bill. We all know the \nreality that we need to get this to conference, and it was necessary to \npass what we just agreed to in order to get it to conference.\n  I understand Senators Corzine and Lautenberg are ready to offer an \namendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, unfortunately, I rise because I feel it \nis necessary to respond to the statements of the chairman of the \nFinance Committee which were made on this floor, both personal to me as \nchairman of the Budget Committee and to the staff of the Budget \nCommittee, which I thought was an unfortunate decision.\n  Earlier we had a vote on waiving a point of order relative to whether \nthis substitute, which is pending, was consistent with or is consistent \nwith the budget we passed last Friday. Now, by definition that point of \norder would not have to have been waived if it was not well made. And \nby well made, I mean that the Chair would have ruled that this \namendment, this substitute, did and does violate the budget resolution. \nThe reason it violates the budget resolution, and I made this point \nearlier when I spoke, and I think I was accurate--in fact, I believe my \ncomments this morning were entirely accurate, although they were \nrepresented to be inaccurate, regrettably--let me reiterate them. This \nbudget resolution point of order lay because we went from a number of \n$284 billion--and this is the essence of the issue here--which was the \nagreed number, $284 billion--that is the number we agreed would be \nspent on the highway bill--we went from that number, under the \nsubstitute, to a number of $295 billion-plus. We don't know the final \nnumber because, quite honestly, there are so many pages in the \namendment even CBO can't catch up with it, but we know it is at least \n$11.5 billion over the budget number, which was $284 billion.\n  This number, $284 billion, was not only a number which had been \nagreed to under the budget last week, it was a number that the \nPresident had said he wanted and on which the President had reached an \nagreement with the congressional leaders, the Speaker of the House and \nthe majority leader. So it was not a number pulled out of thin air, nor \nwas it a number that was not reached after a significant amount of \nconsultation. It was, rather, a number which was reached after having \nconsidered what we could afford, what was coming into the trust fund, \nwhat was going out of the trust fund, and what could be afforded in \nthis area of highway construction.\n  I think the representation was made, unfortunately, by the chairman \nof the Finance Committee, that the Budget Committee was acting \nirresponsibly, essentially--and that is my characterization; the words \nactually were a little stronger than that--when we raised the point of \norder, saying: Hey, listen, we passed a number at the number $284 \nbillion, the President agreed with the majority leader and Speaker of \nthe House that $284 was the number, and therefore we should stick to \n284.\n  That is our job as a Budget Committee. I understand, certainly, the \nchairman of the Finance Committee chairs the most powerful committee in \nthe Senate by far. The Appropriations Committee is competitive, but our \njurisdiction, unfortunately, with the shift toward entitlement \nspending, has been lessened. It used to be the Appropriations Committee \nhad about 60 percent of the Federal spending. Now it is about 30 \npercent. Finance has about 50 percent of the Federal spending because \nit has all the major entitlement accounts.\n  But we recognize--I certainly do as chairman of the Budget \nCommittee--that the Finance Committee is one of the two most powerful \ncommittees in the Senate, of which the other one is not the Budget \nCommittee. Certainly the Finance chairman has every right to come to \nthe Senate floor and remind us of that, as he did. But it really isn't \nappropriate for him to come to the floor and suggest that we should not \nstill do our job simply because we are not as powerful a committee as \nhis; that our job should be basically we should stand out of the way \nand just be nice little folks who stand in the corner, and when the \nbudget is getting run over by a powerful committee, just say: Hey, no, \nwe don't get involved in that because we are not a powerful committee. \nThe Budget Committee was not structured that way. The Budget Committee \nwas actually structured to be sort of a conscience around here, a \nfiscal conscience of, What the heck are we doing?\n  Yes, we only got 22 votes, which shows maybe our conscience isn't all \nthat strong. But, in any event, we have an obligation to raise the \nissues. So when we raise those issues, I think for the chairman of the \nFinance Committee to come down here and say, in terms which were most \naggressive and most intense, that the Budget Committee was acting \ninappropriately and its staff was acting inappropriately, I just think \nthat is misdirected. It does understand, but it doesn't acknowledge the \nfact that the Budget Committee exists. He is on the Budget Committee; I \nguess he knows it exists--as he mentioned. He has been a good supporter \nof the Budget Committee. I have never denied that. I have always said \nhe was a good supporter of the Budget Committee. I respect him. I think \nhe is one of the best chairman around here, as I think this chairman, \nthe chairman of the Public Works Committee, is. I am constantly \nimpressed by what the Senator from Oklahoma is able to do here. He is \ngood, and I admire that, as is the chairman of the Finance Committee, \nand the chairman of the Finance Committee is not only very good but he \nworks very hard, as the Senator from Oklahoma, to be bipartisan, which \nI think is important, too. I tried to do that when I chaired an \nauthorizing committee. But still that doesn't mean that we should \nignore the importance of this issue.\n\n  To get into the substance, to respond again to some of the points \nthat have to be responded to--I am sorry they have to be respond to, \nbut I do think they have to be responded to because the intensity of \nthe argument that we were not accurate in raising this point of order \nis such that to let it just sit would be wrong. Again, I regret that I \nhave to do this.\n  The point, to go back to the essence of the issue, was that the \nbudget set at $284 billion the level of allocation for the highway \nbill. Under this amendment, that spending goes up to $295 billion-plus. \nThat was the point of order.\n  As an ancillary to that discussion, we did get into the issue of just \nwhat has happened in the history of this highway bill. Yes, last year \nthrough the JOBS bill there was a finessing of the way money flows from \naccount to account around here, so that the highway fund was given a \nlot more money at the expense of the general fund. I made reference to \nthat.\n  I didn't mention ethanol, although the response spent a lot of time \non ethanol. In fact, I specifically didn't mention ethanol because I \nknow that tends to incite some Members around here. I just simply said \nlast year about $15 billion ended up being moved out of general fund \nactivity, or being laid off on the general fund, in exchange for giving \nthe highway fund an extra $15 billion. And no matter how you account \nfor it, we end up $15 billion short. That is just the way it is. The \nmoney gets spent on the highway proposal, and so we are $15 billion \nshort.\n  The way it worked, to get specific, was that the subsidy to ethanol \ngasoline, which is about 5 cents a gallon\n\n[[Page S4904]]\n\nwhich had been borne by the highway trust fund, was shifted over to the \ngeneral fund, so the general fund ended up with about a $13 billion \nhit. The highway fund ended up with a $13 billion windfall, arguably.\n  Then there was about $2.5 billion which historically had gone, since \n1993, from the gas tax into the general fund, because under the 1993 \nagreement there had been an agreement that the gas tax would be \nraised--I think by 5 cents--and it was agreed at that time that half of \nthat would go to the highway fund to build roads and the other half \nwould go to deficit reduction, and historically those moneys have \nstayed there for deficit reduction or in the general fund. So that \nmoney was taken out of the general fund and moved back to the highway \nfund. It was probably a legitimate decision, but it did cost us $2.5 \nbillion or thereabouts. So that is where the number came from. I think \nit was an accurate statement. We were basically putting about a $13 \nbillion hole in the general fund in order to get this bill up to the \n$284 billion level.\n  To go from the $284 billion level to the $295 billion level, which \nagain created the point of order because that exceeded the allocation, \nthe Finance Committee reported a bill which represented that they had \noffsets to pay for that difference. They said Joint Tax had scored it \nthat way.\n  First off, I said the offsets were illusory. I believe they are \nillusory. But I also made the point that even if they are not illusory, \nit didn't matter because it still created the problem for the budget, \nwhich is that you exceeded the $284 billion. But I think it is hard to \nargue--and again I use the term it didn't pass the ``straight face \ntest''--to argue that an offset that has been used 14 times and failed \n14 times is an offset that has much likelihood of success.\n  The chairman makes the point, and it is a legitimate point, that he \nis a stick-to-it guy and he is going to get this someday no matter \nwhat, and he is going to stick to it no matter what. I admire that. He \nis a stick-to-it guy. His work on the bankruptcy bill has been \nextraordinary. His work on a lot of bills around here has been \nextraordinary, and that is probably because he is dogged on some of \nthis stuff. When he bites ahold of something, he stays with it, and \nthat is impressive.\n  But I do think when folks are sitting back in the office, thinking \nabout how to pay for this thing, and they came up with putting in the \nenterprise tax again after 14 attempts at using this item, that they \nknew the likelihood of that happening was very slim. So I think it was \nreasonable to say that number was illusory. But equally important, the \nrepresentation that the Joint Tax Committee is the final arbiter of \nthat question is something I believe has to be clarified, because that \nwas the chairman's position.\n  So I think I would like to know the clarification of this. As \nchairman of the Budget Committee, I believe I have the right to know \nwhether Joint Tax or the Budget Committee is the final arbiter of that \nbecause, as I understand it, under section 201(f), which was cited by \nthe chairman of the Finance Committee, but not entirely:\n\n       The Budget Committee of the Senate and the House shall \n     determine all estimates with respect to scoring points of \n     order and with respect to execution of purposes of this \nact. I ask a parliamentary inquiry of the Chair:\n\n  Who is the proper scorer of points of order relative to revenues and \nexpenses?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is entitled to an answer. Under \nthe Congressional Budget Act of 1974, termination of points of order \nsection 312, the Budget Committee determination for purposes of this \ntitle and title IV, the levels of measuring budget authority outlays, \ndirect spending, new entitlement authority, and revenues for fiscal \nyear shall be determined on the basis of estimates made by the \nCommittee on the Budget of the House of Representatives or the Senate, \nas applicable.\n  Mr. GREGG. I thank the Chair for that ruling. I hope that clarifies \nthat point and responds, I believe, adequately to the points of the \nchairman of the Finance Committee that might not be the case.\n  Let me summarize. We made a point of order, a motion to waive was \nbrought forward, the chairman of the Finance Committee, and the \nchairman of the Transportation and Public Works Committee were \nsuccessful by an overwhelming vote and we lost.\n  I do not think that should lead to the chairman of the Committee on \nFinance coming to the Senate and suggesting the role of the Committee \non the Budget in making these points is in some way inappropriate or \nirrelevant, that we should not take this effort to try to enforce a \nbudget--especially when we passed the budget last week.\n  I admire, as I said, the Finance Committee chairman a great deal. I \nam sorry this misunderstanding has occurred. But I do believe I have an \nobligation as chairman of the Committee on the Budget to at least speak \nup on behalf of my staff, who has done an extraordinary job under \nfairly difficult circumstances.\n  In that context, for a more historical perspective on the highway \nbill, since this was cited by the chairman of the Committee on Finance, \nI ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the Informed \nBudgeteer statement which is a budget statement summarizing the history \nof the highway bill.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                           Informed Budgeteer\n\n       As the May 31 expiration date of the latest extension of \n     federal surface transportation programs rapidly approaches, \n     the pressure is on the Senate to pass a reauthorization bill \n     by the end of this month. The House passed its version of the \n     bill (H.R. 3) last month.\n       The Senate bill is being considered on the floor, as the \n     four committees with jurisdiction--Environment and Public \n     Works (EPW), Banking, Commerce, and Finance--have each marked \n     up their respective titles of the bill. The Banking, \n     Commerce, and Finance titles are added on the floor to the \n     bill reported by EPW.\n       There are several different metrics that participants in \n     the legislative process are using to evaluate this bill \n     besides ``how much does each state get?''--is it more than \n     the President's request, is there enough ``money'' in the \n     highway trust fund, and does the budget resolution allow it?\n       Bigger than the President's Request?\n       The Senate-reported and House-passed bills are, in total, \n     both consistent with the President's FY 2006 Budget request \n     of $284 billion for transportation programs for FY 2004-2009, \n     reflecting the informal conference agreement reached, but not \n     enacted, last year.\n       End of story, right? . . . given this apparent coalescence \n     around a $284 billion bill? Because the Administration drew a \n     line in the sand most recently with a SAP threatening to veto \n     anything above $284 billion (as well as anything creating a \n     new federal borrowing mechanism), the Senate leadership \n     insisted that the bill brought to the floor not breech that \n     level. The authorizers' action, however, has only lived up to \n     the letter, but not the spirit, of that admonition. Senate \n     authorizers snuck in a change to their substitute, without a \n     separate vote, to increase the bill's funding level above \n     $284 billion. So the bill before the Senate currently exceeds \n     the prescribed level by $10-$15 billion.\n       Affordable from the Highway Trust Fund? The latest CBO \n     estimates indicate that revenue now credited to the highway \n     trust fund is sufficient to support a $284 billion bill, \n     mainly due to provisions in the American Jobs Creation Act \n     (AJCA) of 2004 (P.L. 108-357), enacted in the closing days of \n     the 108th Congress. But last summer the highway trust fund \n     could not have supported a $284 billion bill. How can the \n     highway trust fund all of a sudden have sufficient resources?\n       Last summer, the Senate faced the exact same pickle it does \n     now. The Senate's highway spending appetite ($319 billion) \n     was greater than the level of related federal revenues \n     dedicated to highways and transit at that time. The Finance \n     Committee had intended to pay for the additional spending \n     through a combination of (1) brand new revenues from those \n     who had been avoiding gasoline taxes (fuel fraud) and (2) \n     shifting the incidence of revenues the government was \n     already collecting (2.5 cents gas tax), or already not \n     collecting (ethanol subsidy), between the general fund and \n     the highway trust fund (general fund transfers).\n       To the extent that some proposed increases in highway trust \n     fund spending were being justified on the concept of general \n     fund transfers (which do not constitute new revenue to the \n     federal government), that spending would have been a pure \n     increase in the federal deficit. Because of bipartisan \n     concern about such a deficit increase on the part of some of \n     its members, the Finance Committee committed to offsetting \n     some of the general fund transfers with unrelated (to \n     highways) revenue raisers.\n       Such unrelated-but-real new revenues could have mitigated \n     the deficit increase that would have otherwise resulted from \n     the component of higher trust fund spending rationalized by \n     magically ``augmented'' trust-fund balances. However, when \n     the highway bill failed to emerge from conference last year, \n     the fuel fraud and general fund transfer provisions were \n     lifted out of S. 1072 and enacted separately in AJCA, without \n     the accompanying additional offsets that had been promised by \n     the Finance Committee.\n\n[[Page S4905]]\n\n       It is true that the enacted fuel fraud provisions are now \n     bringing a welcome $1 billion or so per year (that was not \n     being collected before) to the federal government and the \n     highway trust fund. But the enacted general fund transfers \n     have made the highway trust fund ``healthier'' by about $2-3 \n     billion annually only by definition, since merely moving \n     around deck chairs has not changed the federal government's \n     bottom line.\n       Nonetheless, because there is a new CBO baseline and a new \n     Congress, highway spending proponents in the Senate only seem \n     to notice that the highway trust fund will now support a \n     higher level of spending than it did six months ago (even \n     though gasoline consumption has not increased, and has \n     probably decreased because of higher prices). They seem to \n     forget that some of the spending that will be done on the \n     strength of these general fund transfers was supposed to have \n     been offset by real revenue increases.\n       Bigger than the Budget Resolution? The ``reported'' Senate \n     transportation bill already exceeded the levels of contract \n     authority allocated for 2006 (for the Banking Committee) and \n     for the 2006-2010 period (for all three committees) by the FY \n     2006 budget resolution just adopted.\n       How can that be if the 2006 budget resolution assumes the \n     $284-billion level? The oversimplified answer is that the \n     budget resolution assumed the stream of contract authority \n     associated with the H.R. 3 as passed by the House (because \n     the House had completed its action, while the Senate had not \n     finished reporting as the conference report on the budget \n     resolution was being finalized). But the spread of the $284 \n     billion across the years and over the different types of \n     transportation spending (highways, transit, and safety) is \n     different in the ``reported'' Senate bill, which means that \n     the Senate bill does not fit an allocation based on the House \n     bill. Therefore, a 60-vote point of order (under section \n     302(f)) applied against the ``reported'' bill.\n       Now that the bill has been increased by $10-$15 billion, a \n     point of order applies against the $295-$300 billion bill. \n     (Last year, a 302(f) point of order was raised against S. \n     1072 the Senate highway bill in the 108th Congress, but the \n     Senate waived it by a vote of 72-24.)\n       Authorizers potentially could avoid a 302(f) point of order \n     by employing the mechanism established in section 301 of the \n     2006 budget resolution, which anticipated that transportation \n     spending demands would exceed the levels allocated by the \n     resolution.\n       Section 301 says that if the Senate EPW, Banking, or \n     Commerce Committee (Transportation and Infrastructure \n     Committee in the House) reports a bill (or amendment thereto \n     is offered) that provides new budget authority in excess of \n     the budget resolution levels, the Budget Committee Chairman, \n     may increase the allocation to the relevant committee ``to \n     the extent such excess is offset by . . . an increase in \n     receipts'' to the highway trust fund. Such legislation \n     increasing receipts must be reported by the Finance \n     Committee.\n       The Finance Committee once again has pledged to provide \n     additional receipts to the highway trust fund to support \n     higher spending on transportation programs, but the title of \n     the bill reported by the Finance Committee does not include \n     any offsets.\n       It appears that the Finance Committee's floor amendment \n     includes provisions quite similar to those general-fund \n     transfers that were included in last year's Senate-passed \n     bill. Such general-fund transfers do nothing to offset the \n     deficit effect of the increased spending in that amendment.\n       This year's Senate floor debate on the highway bill seems \n     all too familiar, with proponents of higher spending on \n     highway and transit programs potentially considering options \n     that would partially ``pay for'' a larger bill by rearranging \n     paper entries on the government's books rather than \n     increasing resources collected by the federal government--the \n     same as last year's debate. Now the Senate must decide \n     whether to allow history to be repeated, a mere two weeks \n     after it adopted a conference report on a budget resolution \n     to enforce fiscal discipline at agreed-upon levels.\n\n\n      An Emergency, a Supplemental, or an Emergency Supplemental?\n\n       While the Senate debated the Iraq supplemental two weeks \n     ago, there was some confusion about the effect of emergency \n     designations and the difference between regular and \n     supplemental appropriations. Over the last four years, \n     Congress has repeatedly approved funding outside the regular \n     appropriations process in response to the wars in Afghanistan \n     and Iraq and the war on terror. The funding has most often \n     been in an emergency supplemental appropriation. Though \n     emergency designations and supplementals are often discussed \n     as if they are interchangeable terms, they are distinct \n     concepts.\n       Supplemental appropriations. A supplemental appropriation \n     is simply an appropriations bill other than the regular \n     appropriations bills that the Congress must consider each \n     fiscal year (most recently there were 13 such regular bills; \n     for 2006 there are 12 in the Senate and 11 in the House). \n     Neither a supplemental bill nor all items in it are \n     necessarily designated as an emergency or even intended for \n     purposes alleged to be emergencies. Simply providing funding \n     through a supplemental appropriation does not trigger the \n     ``do not count'' (for budgetary enforcement) treatment that \n     an emergency designation provides. Each item in a \n     supplemental must include an explicit emergency designation \n     to receive ``do not count'' status.\n       Supplemental appropriations are required when, after the \n     regular appropriations are enacted for the year, new events \n     or information requires adjustments to the previously \n     appropriated amounts. Supplementals are also useful for \n     purposes that are known to be temporary because a \n     supplemental provides a discrete and therefore optically \n     severable amount of money that could discourage those amounts \n     from becoming part of and enlarging regular appropriations in \n     future years.\n       Emergency designations. Emergency designations are attached \n     to individual accounts (and may even be attached to tax \n     provisions or direct spending items in authorization bills), \n     and can be used in any appropriations bill, either regular \n     or supplemental. When a provision is designated as an \n     emergency, the Budget Committee does not count the \n     spending in that line item against the enforceable levels \n     in the budget resolution. Contrary to popular \n     misconception, the emergency spending still counts toward \n     total federal spending and the deficit; it is only not \n     counted for Congressional enforcement purposes.\n       The appropriate use of an emergency designation in the \n     Senate is most recently articulated in section 402(b) of the \n     Conference Report on the 2006 Budget Resolution, which is the \n     source of the authority to not count emergencies for purposes \n     of budgetary enforcement. Section 402 (and its predecessors \n     in the 2004 and 2005 budget resolutions) have required that \n     the report accompanying any bill with emergency spending to \n     explain the manner in which the spending is sudden, urgent, \n     pressing, a compelling need requiring immediate action, \n     unforeseen, unpredictable, unanticipated and temporary. To \n     date, this requirement has been ignored.\n       However, whether the emergency point of order applies does \n     not depend on whether this reporting requirement has been \n     fulfilled or on any evaluation of whether the emergency item \n     actually meets the criteria. Instead, the emergency point of \n     order automatically applies to any non-defense spending item \n     that has an emergency designation. Defense emergencies are \n     exempt from the point of order. The existence of the point of \n     order allows any Senator to use the ``eye-of-the-beholder'' \n     test to confront the rest of the Senate with the issue of \n     whether a non-defense item meets the emergency criteria and \n     warrants an emergency designation so that it does not count \n     for enforcement.\n       If the point of order is raised against a non-defense \n     emergency designation in either a pending bill or amendment, \n     supporters of the spending can move to waive the point of \n     order, which requires 60 votes. If the point of order is \n     sustained, the emergency designation is struck and the \n     spending in the bill or amendment is then counted against the \n     302(a) allocation and other appropriate levels. If the \n     committee is already at or above its allocation (this is the \n     case for fiscal year 2005), the amendment or bill then faces \n     a 60-vote 302(f) point of order.\n       Baseline treatment. While the concepts are not \n     interchangeable, a commonality between emergency spending and \n     supplemental appropriations is their treatment in the CEO \n     baseline. Whether in a regular or supplemental appropriation \n     (and regardless of the presence of an emergency designation), \n     every discretionary spending item appropriated for the \n     current fiscal year is assumed by CBO to continue on, \n     adjusted for inflation, in the subsequent fiscal years for \n     baseline purposes. Statutory rules for constructing the \n     baseline mandate this treatment, and CBO has no discretion to \n     pick and choose which discretionary items may be recurring \n     versus a one-time only expenditure.\n       The Budget Committees are not required to use the CBO \n     baseline as the basis for constructing the budget resolution. \n     But in practice, the Budget Committees use their discretion \n     to adopt an alternate baseline in only limited circumstances. \n     Removing what the Committees view as temporary spending from \n     the baseline is an instance where the Committees occasionally \n     make adjustments to the CBO baseline. However, CBO's 2006 \n     baseline (issued in March 2005) did not include \n     appropriations for Iraq and Afghanistan because a 2005 \n     supplemental has not been enacted, so no baseline adjustment \n     was necessary in this year's budget resolution.\n\n                              TRANSPORTATION BILL COMPARISONS TOTALS FOR 2004-2009\n                                                 [$ IN BILLIONS]\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                              House        Senate       Senate\n                                                               Pres.

Those points having been made, I acknowledge defeat on \nthis point. I admire, as I said, the chairman of the committee for \nbeing a successful chairman who knows how to get things done around \nhere. We may disagree on occasion, but my admiration for him certainly \ndoes not abate in any way because of those disagreements. In fact, my \nrespect grows. But do not expect we will disappear. We were not wilting \nviolets around here on the Committee on the Budget. We will continue to \ntry to make points on the points of order we think are appropriate.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, before the chairman of the Committee on \nthe Budget leaves, there are some areas where an honest disagreement \ncan take place. One is on the idea that if we try to establish a policy \nin this country that addresses something that is an emotional need or \ndesire of any of these Members and it has nothing to do with \ntransportation, that should not be borne on the backs of the highway \ntrust fund.\n  We talk about the ethanol provision which I opposed, but nonetheless \nwe had that, the Senator is right, and the cost of that. If they want \nto pay for it, let them pay for it out of the general fund. Why should \nthe highway trust fund be paying for policies?\n  And the same is true on the deficit reduction. I stood in the Senate \nat that time that took place saying I was for deficit reduction but not \non the backs of the highway trust fund. The reason I say that is \nbecause I have considered this to be somewhat of a moral issue. People \ngo to the pump and they pay tax for gasoline. There is an assumption, \nas wrong as it is, that money should go to repairing roads and highways \nand bridges. I do disagree in that respect.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \npending amendment be set aside so the Senate may consider amendment No. \n606.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, we had a short recess for about an hour \nbecause of a security threat that, by now, has been covered well in the \nmedia. I wish to take this opportunity to thank the Capitol Police and \nthe various assistants throughout the Capitol because when we have that \nsort of alert, which comes very quickly, very unexpectedly while we are \nin session here, but at the same time this huge Capitol Building with \nliterally hundreds and thousands of people working in this complex \nhaving to stop and evacuate in an orderly way is a real challenge.\n  So I thank everybody, including our guests, because at the same time \nwe have all of us who are working here in this Capitol structure, there \nare guests visiting throughout the Capitol. Everybody left in an \norderly way and in a way that was safe and calm. As far as I have heard \nin talking with the Sergeant at Arms, there were no injuries. When you \nhave that sort of rapid departure, that is always a risk.\n  Our Capitol Police, Sergeant at Arms, and the Secretary of the Senate \nall responded in a way that we can all be proud of. Most importantly, \nthe offending aircraft is now on the ground, and the pilot and whoever \nelse was in the plane are being questioned.\n  Now I am happy to turn to the Democratic leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I am grateful that the distinguished \nRepublican leader would come to the floor of the Senate and acknowledge \nthe people who look after us every day. The training of our Capitol \nPolice force is exceptionally good. I was with them, as was the \ndistinguished Republican leader, and I am amazed at their \nprofessionalism as they took us away.\n  I am an alumni of different universities, a proud lawyer, and a \nnumber of other things I have had the good fortune of working with over \na number of years, but I am an alumni of the Capitol Police. I am very \nproud of that. I recognize that the work I did those many years ago as \na Capitol policeman pales in comparison to the problems that face this \nbeautiful building of the American people.\n  I am so confident that we have the best police force in the world \nhere on Capitol Hill. They have to deal with bomb threats and all kinds \nof chemical problems. The Republican leader, who is a doctor, worked \nthrough the anthrax problem; I wasn't involved with that. But they are \nexperts at that. They are aware of anything that is going on in the \nworld regarding terrorism because of these evil people from around the \nworld. This is, if not the No. 1 target, one of the top targets.\n  I appreciate and commend and applaud the majority leader for coming \nhere immediately and recognizing these people who look after us every \nday. Every day, we see them standing around doors, and they don't \nappear to be working real hard, but it is on days such as this that \nthey earn their pay over and over again. I am glad and happy that I had \nthe experience to be a Capitol policeman, and I look forward to \ncontinually being protected, along with the American public, in this \ngreat building by these wonderful men and women.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from New Jersey is recognized.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I once again thank the Senator from \nOklahoma.\n  Before I begin, I echo the remarks of the majority leader and \nminority leader congratulating and thanking the members of the Capitol \nPolice for their efforts in protecting all of us, which they so ably do \nday in and day out. It is a testimony to their forethought that we were \nso efficiently able to move from the Capitol and protect folks. We are \nblessed with their efforts. I also thank the Sergeant at Arms and the \nSecretary of the Senate for their efforts and look forward to saying \n``thank you'' personally to all of the individuals involved.\n  I think I have asked that the pending amendment be set aside and we \nmove to amendment No. 606, if I am not mistaken. Is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Isakson). Amendment No. 606 is the pending \nquestion.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleague, Senator \nLautenberg, who will be joining me in a minute, to offer an amendment \nto the SAFETEA Act, S. 732. Our amendment addresses a serious problem \nwhere Federal highway and mass transit contracts are awarded by States, \nthose situations where Federal money and State money are intermixed in \ncontracting administered by the State. These contracts are often or can \nbe influenced, either by perception or reality, by political \ncontributions. The Government contracting issue I am speaking of is \ncommonly known as ``pay to play.''\n  To address this issue in situations where States administer these \ncontracts with both Federal and State money or where Federal money is \nadministered by the State, Senator Lautenberg and I are offering this \namendment to allow States to set contracting rules that limit campaign \ncontributions by contracting providers. This is something that has been \nin Federal law for over 50 years where there are straight Federal \ncontracts. Unfortunately, there have been far too many cases across the \ncountry where in these circumstances businesses have made contributions \nto public officials or campaign committees and then expected to \ninfluence the awarding of Government contracts. It is not an attractive \nsituation.\n  Last year, two Governors lost their careers in public service due to \npay-to-play scandals in their States. Other high-profile instances of \npay-to-play corruption have occurred across the Nation, particularly in \nmy home State where, on a bipartisan basis, our State legislators and \nGovernors have reacted. But this is not unique to New Jersey. It has \ngone from New Jersey to California, from Philadelphia to Los Angeles \nand beyond. The problem is widespread and needs to be addressed.\n\n  Corrupt practices of pay-to-play have serious implications for the \npublic. They have the effect of limiting competition in many ways \nbecause those who give political contributions then get the edge on \nthose who might want to compete to do the business. They often reduce \nthe quality of infrastructure projects--I will talk about a couple of \nsituations that we see, particularly in my home State--and they lower \nthe confidence of the public in elected officials and in public service \nin general.\n  Finally, and most important--this certainly is the case in my State--\nthey raise the cost of doing business for the government and ultimately \nto the taxpayer.\n  This practice is often more like legalized bribery than I think any \nof us would like to admit, and it results in a corruption tax that all \ncitizens end up bearing. So I think there is a reason to make sure that \nwe act.\n  I regret to say this disease has really impacted my State of New \nJersey. It is something that, unfortunately, has infected both sides of \nthe aisle in the State, both parties. It really needs to be addressed.\n  Just last month, dozens of local public officials--and I mean dozens, \nboth Democrats and Republicans in one of our counties--were indicted \nfor soliciting or taking bribes from people doing business with their \ntowns, and it was often in conjunction with political contributions. \nSadly, New Jersey taxpayers have been hit with this hidden corruption \ntax, higher costs of doing business in our State, and I think it needs \nto be moved against.\n  Our Governor, with bipartisan support in both Houses, was able to \ninstitute a serious pay-to-play ban that requires that any political \ncontribution be less than $300 from anyone who wants to do business \nwith the State. It is a straightforward, easy situation.\n  Honestly, time after time we have had the public trust broken in this \ncontracting procedure, where Federal and State funds have been misused. \nWe had a motor vehicle inspection contract where there was only one \nbidder. It was a cost-plus contract that ended up being over $200 \nmillion above cost. It ended up costing the Federal Government and the \nState a lot more than was necessary. Again, it is a corruption tax. We \nhave had other places--the EZ-Pass toll collection system--where \npolitically favored vendors were able to win no-bid contracts. It seems \nto me we need to make sure we put competition on a level playing field. \nThat is what this amendment is all about.\n  Fortunately, New Jersey and several other States, as I suggested, \nhave, on a bipartisan basis, addressed this issue. It is about \ncontracting law, however, not campaign finance. It is setting the rules \nfor who has the ability to bid. Unfortunately, the Department of \nTransportation recently informed the State of New Jersey that these \ncommonsense limits may not apply to highway or mass transit contracts \nthat use Federal funds. The Department of Transportation argued that it \nmight limit competition when, in fact, I do not understand how limiting \nthe amount of a campaign contribution has anything to do with whether \nsomeone is going to qualify to participate in a contracting bid. The \nState is now seeking an injunction in the Federal courts and there will \nbe all kinds of litigation about this over a period of time. Whether it \ngets overruled or not, I think it is appropriate to institute the \npossibility that, if a State legislature wants to take the stand that \nthey\n\n[[Page S4908]]\n\nwould like to set rules for contracting, on contracts they administer, \nthey have the ability to do it.\n  I think this is important, both for promoting competition but also \nfor ensuring that there is clarity and confidence in the public bidding \nprocess, not only in my State but in a number of other States which \nhave also bought into these kinds of rules. It is really a cross-\nsection across the country in various places.\n  I have here a series of States--Illinois, Kentucky, Ohio, West \nVirginia, South Carolina--a number of places. These are States, as \nshown in the light green, that already have bills before their State \nlegislatures. There are an enormous number of local jurisdictions that \nhave also done it: Los Angeles, San Francisco, Oakland, Chicago--24 \njurisdictions in my own State of New Jersey.\n  We think this is an important States rights issue. We should be able \nto enact laws that fight corruption without interference from the \nFederal Government. I hope we will look at this in a context that we \nwant to make sure that what would work in those individual States is \nactually attended to.\n  Banning pay-to-play is consistent with current Federal practice when \nit is only Federal contracts that are being awarded. The Government \nalready bans pay-to-play for Federal contracts that are awarded \ndirectly.\n  The Securities and Exchange Commission, along with a municipal \nrulemaking board, prevents pay-to-play when Government bond issues are \nat stake--again, a contracting issue, not a campaign contribution rule. \nIn fact, I was instrumental and involved in this as an employer on Wall \nStreet 10 years ago, to ban contributions from bond underwriters \nbecause it interfered too regularly with the overall process.\n  We think we can make a difference. These rules have worked when they \nhave been instituted. They certainly have in the bond underwriting \nbusiness, and they have Federal rules. The Federal Government is \nrefusing to allow States such as New Jersey to enact similar contract \nreforms. I think this is an important step going forward.\n  I want to clarify something about this amendment. We are not \nestablishing a Federal pay-to-play rule in Federal highway contracting. \nSome of the opponents would have you believe that. Those rules are \nalready set by the Federal Government. It is merely respecting the \nrights of the State to establish and maintain their own State \ncontracting practices. It only impacts contributions to State-level \ncandidates, not Federal-level candidates. Federal campaign finance laws \nare in no way affected.\n  This commonsense measure has the support of a number of groups that \nwork to protect the integrity of government spending: Public Citizen, \nCommon Cause, the Brennan Center for Justice.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have letters of endorsement from these \ngroups printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                    The Campaign Legal Center,\n\n                                      Washington, DC, May 5, 2005.\n     Re Safe-TEA/TEA-LU Highway Bill and the Government \n         Contracting Reform Amendment\n       Dear Senator: The Campaign Legal Center strongly urges you \n     to support the Government Contracting Reform Amendment to the \n     Safe-TEA/TEA-LU Highway Bill, which protects the right of \n     states to enact and enforce ``pay to play'' laws.\n       For more than 50 years federal law has prohibited political \n     contributions to federal candidates from federal government \n     contractors. In recent years, state and local governments \n     around the nation have followed Congress' lead by enacting \n     similar ``pay to play'' laws to protect the integrity of the \n     procurement process.\n       The right of states to enact and enforce ``pay to play'' \n     laws has recently come under threat. Late in 2004, the \n     Federal Highway Administration determined that a New Jersey \n     State Executive Order limiting the size of political \n     contributions from government contractors to state candidates \n     violates federal law competitive bidding requirements, \n     established by 23 U.S.C. Sec. 112, for state highway \n     construction contracts involving federal funds.\n       This Federal Highway Administration action affects not only \n     New Jersey, but also threatens enforcement of similar ``pay \n     to play'' laws in Kentucky, Ohio, South Carolina and West \n     Virginia. Further, the Highway Administration action curtails \n     the right of other states around the nation to enact their \n     own ``pay to play'' laws.\n       The Government Contracting Reform Amendment sponsored by \n     Senators Corzine and Lautenberg amends 23 U.S.C. Sec. 112, \n     which establishes the competitive bidding requirement for \n     contracts involving federal highway funds, to state that \n     ``Nothing in this section prohibits a State from enacting a \n     law or issuing an order that limits the amount that an \n     individual that is a party to a contract with a State agency \n     under this section may contribute to a political campaign.''\n       Similarly, the Government Contracting Reform Amendment \n     amends 49 U.S.C. Sec. 5323, which establishes general \n     provisions for the award of contracts involving mass \n     transportation funds, to make clear that state ``pay to \n     play'' laws ``shall be considered to be in accordance with \n     Federal competitive procurement requirements.''\n       State laws restricting political contributions from \n     government contractors are consistent with, and advance the \n     purposes of, the federal law contracting requirements for \n     highway and transit funds. Competitive bidding requirements, \n     and reasonable restrictions on contributions from contractors \n     who do business with the government, both advance the \n     government's interest in avoiding real and apparent political \n     corruption and preserving the integrity of the contracting \n     process.\n       We urge you to support the Corzine-Lautenberg Government \n     Contracting Reform Amendment to the pending Safe-TEA/TEA-LU \n     Highway Bill, to protect states' rights to enact and enforce \n     ``pay to play'' laws.\n           Sincerely,\n     Meredith McGehee,\n     Paul S. Ryan.\n                                  ____\n\n                                        Brennan Center for Justice\n\n\n                                         at NYU School of Law,\n\n                                     New York, NY, April 27, 2005.\n     Re Safe-TEA Act of 2005 and the Corzine pay-to-play amendment\n\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators: I write on behalf of The Brennan Center for \n     Justice to support Senator Jon Corzine's ``pay-to-play'' \n     reform protection amendment to S. 732, the ``Safe, \n     Accountable, Flexible, and Efficient Transportation Equity \n     Act of 2005.'' Since its inception in 1995, the Center's \n     Democracy Program has been working in the area of campaign \n     finance reform on federal, state, and local levels. We \n     believe that the amendment is important for ensuring that \n     states maintain the flexibility to choose effective tools for \n     protecting the integrity of government contracting.\n       Systems for government contract bidding have long sought to \n     satisfy the laudable and compatible goals of contracting with \n     low-cost and ethical bidders. For example, current federal \n     law regarding state transportation projects that use federal \n     money provides that ``[c]ontracts for the construction of \n     each project shall be awarded only on the basis of the lowest \n     responsive bid submitted by a bidder meeting established \n     criteria of responsibility.'' 23 U.S.C. Sec. 112(b)(l) \n     (emphasis added). Federal law expressly charges the state \n     transportation department with establishing the criteria of \n     responsibility. 23 C.F.R. Sec. 635.114(a).\n       Several recent scandals regarding government contracting in \n     New Jersey prompted New Jersey to establish a criterion of \n     responsibility for government contracting, which prohibited \n     the state from contracting with an entity that has \n     contributed to a candidate for or holder of the office of \n     Governor, or to any State or county political party \n     committee, within certain time frames. See New Jersey \n     Executive Order 134 (September 22, 2004). The executive order \n     explicitly stated that ``the growing infusion of funds \n     donated by business entities into the political process at \n     all level of government has generated widespread cynicism \n     among the public that special interest groups are `buying' \n     favors from elected officeholders.'' Id. Courts have \n     recognized that contributions from government contractors \n     present a severe risk of engendering corruption or the \n     appearance of corruption, and thus have generally upheld \n     ``pay to play'' contribution bans. See, e.g., Blount v. SEC, \n     61 F.3d 938,944-48 (D.C. Cir. 1995) (upholding \n     constitutionality of SEC regulations that prohibit \n     municipal finance underwriters from making campaign \n     contributions to politicians who award government \n     underwriting contracts); Casino Ass'n of Louisiana v. \n     State, 820 So. 2d 494 (La. 2002), cert. denied, 529 U.S. \n     1109 (2003) (upholding ban on contributions from riverboat \n     and land-based casinos); Gwinn v. State Ethics Comm'n, 426 \n     S.E.2d 890 (Ga. 1993) (upholding ban on contributions by \n     insurance companies to candidates for Commissioner of \n     Insurance).\n       Recent action by the Federal Highway Administration, \n     however, has threatened to strip New Jersey and other states \n     of their capacity to determine criteria of responsibility, \n     undermining legitimate state efforts to protect against \n     corruption, or the appearance thereof, in government \n     contracting. The FHA took the unprecedented position that it \n     would not authorize federal funds for use in New Jersey \n     transportation contracts because of Executive Order 134. The \n     FHA took this position even in light of the scandals in New \n     Jersey, and despite the facts that (1) all bidders would have \n     notice of New Jersey's responsibility criteria and (2) \n     contracting awards still would be granted to the\n\n[[Page S4909]]\n\n     lowest bidder. The State of New Jersey is challenging the \n     FHA's position in court. In the meantime, however, New Jersey \n     was forced to rescind much of its executive order since it, \n     like most states, significantly relies on federal funding for \n     many of its transportation contracts. No state should be \n     forced to compromise legitimate and well-grounded efforts to \n     protect the integrity of its government in order to receive \n     federal transportation funds.\n       The FHA's position could also undermine the FHA's goal of \n     awarding contracts only to responsible bidders and may risk \n     actual, or the appearance of, corruption in the process of \n     choosing bidders. Without rules prohibiting ``pay to play'' \n     arrangements, states may deem entities ``responsible'' not \n     because they have displayed any objective characteristics of \n     responsibility, but rather because they have made \n     contributions to government officials. Federal ethical \n     standards should provide a floor beneath which a state may \n     not go, but federal law should not be used to restrict a \n     state from implementing stricter ethical standards that it \n     deems necessary to protect the integrity of its government.\n       Senator Corzine's amendment proposes that a provision be \n     added to the Safe-Tea Act of 2005 stating that ``[n]othing in \n     this section may be construed to prohibit a state from \n     enacting a law or issuing an order that limits the amount of \n     money an individual, who is doing business with a state \n     agency for a federal-aid highway project, may contribute to a \n     political campaign.'' For all the reasons discussed above, we \n     urge you to adopt the amendment to ensure that federal \n     highway funding provisions are not wrongly interpreted to \n     permit interference with state efforts to both prevent \n     corruption or the appearance thereof and restore public \n     confidence in its government.\n           Sincerely,\n     Suzanne Novak.\n                                  ____\n\n         Public Citizen, Common Cause, Public Campaign, Democracy \n           21, Center for Civic Responsibility,\n                                                   April 28, 2005.\n     Re Safe-TEA Act of 2005 and the Corzine pay-to-play \n         amendment.\n\n       Dear Senator: Next week you will be considering the ``Safe, \n     Accountable, Flexible, and Efficient Transportation Equity \n     Act of 2005'' (Safe-TEA Act). Public Citizen, Common Cause, \n     Democracy 21, Public Campaign and the Center for Civic \n     Responsibility urge the Senate to adopt the Corzine ``pay-to-\n     play'' amendment to the bill respecting states'' rights to \n     address the problem of corruption in government contracting.\n       Sen. Jon Corzine's amendment proposes that a sentence be \n     included in the Safe-TEA Act, as was done in the House \n     version of the bill, allowing states to implement a very \n     narrow and limited reform of government contracting \n     procedures: restricting potential government contractors from \n     making large campaign contributions while negotiating a \n     government contract to those responsible for awarding the \n     contract.\n       Known as ``pay-to-play,'' many state and local governments \n     are being burdened by the all-too-common practice of a \n     business entity making campaign contributions to a public \n     official with the hope of gaining a lucrative government \n     contract. This practice of attempting to skew the awarding of \n     government contracts in favor of large campaign contributors \n     has taken a serious toll on public confidence in state and \n     local governments across the nation.\n       Last year, two governors in one week--Gov. George Ryan of \n     Illinois (once considered for a Nobel Peace Prize) and Gov. \n     John Rowland of Connecticut--lost their careers in public \n     service due to pay-to-play scandals. A trial is currently \n     underway in the City of Philadelphia concerning corruption \n     charges in the awarding of government contracts with some \n     members of Mayor John Street's administration. Similar \n     scandals have recently racked California, Hawaii, New Jersey, \n     and the City of Los Angeles.\n       Unfortunately, the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) \n     has decided to make it difficult, if not impossible, for \n     states to address this serious problem. For example, the FWHA \n     has decided to punish New Jersey for reforming its \n     contracting system by withholding federal highway funds from \n     the state. We believe you will agree with us that this \n     federal intervention is unjustified and counterproductive. \n     That is why we urge you to support language that makes clear \n     that states have the right to ensure that their contracting \n     procedures conform to the highest ethical standards and offer \n     the best value for taxpayers.\n       New Jersey Gov. Richard Codey reluctantly suspended the \n     state's pay-to-play rules for competitive bid contracts \n     pending the outcome of a court challenge to the FHWA \n     decision. [New Jersey v. Mineta] ``This is a temporary \n     measure forced on us by the federal government,'' Codey said. \n     ``I am not happy about it. In making this necessary, the \n     federal government is dead wrong, but I cannot jeopardize \n     nearly $1 billion in federal transportation funds.''\n       The FHWA has placed itself in the odd position of imposing \n     its preference for a disclosure-only regime on states and \n     localities that have decided a stronger pay-to-play policy is \n     necessary to address their problems of corruption in \n     government contracting. As the FHWA memorandum opines: ``. . \n     . the disclosure of lobbying and political contribution \n     efforts for the year preceding a contract bid is a reasonable \n     means to meet the DOT's Common Rule requirement that the city \n     assure that its contract award system performs without \n     conflict of interest. This is distinct from a provision that \n     actually excludes those making otherwise legal contributions \n     from competing for a contract.''\\2\\\n       Many state, local and non-governmental jurisdictions \n     strongly disagree with the FHWA: disclosure is necessary but \n     not sufficient to end actual or apparent corruption in \n     government contracting. Instead, New Jersey and four other \n     states, the federal government and the Securities and \n     Exchange Commission, along with dozens of local \n     jurisdictions, have opted for a narrowly-tailored system of \n     contribution restrictions on government contractors, in \n     addition to disclosure requirements, as a more effective \n     means to curtail pay-to-play abuses.\n       Sen. Corzine has introduced the pay-to-play protection \n     amendment before you this week, which would add to the Safe-\n     TEA Act: ``Nothing in this section prohibits a State from \n     enacting a law or issuing an order that limits the amount \n     that an individual that is a party to a contract with a State \n     agency under this section may contribute to a political \n     campaign.''\n       Pay-to-play restrictions are far from draconian measures. \n     They are a narrow remedy that focus exclusively on a specific \n     problem. Pay-to-play restrictions are easy for the business \n     community to live with--the SEC's Rule G-37 championed by \n     former SEC Chair Arthur Levitt, which served as a role model \n     for New Jersey's pay-to-play policy, has not resulted in \n     draining the pool of bond bidders--and pay-to-play \n     restrictions are limited in scope and constitutional.\n       The Federal Highway Administration may believe it knows \n     better than the states how to address their problems of \n     actual and perceived corruption in government contracting, \n     but the FHWA has not yet had to suffer the consequences of \n     corruption scandals that the states have faced. The Senate \n     should join the House and include this amendment to the Safe-\n     TEA Act of 2005 allowing the states the authority to assure \n     their citizens that contracts are awarded on merit.\n       For more information, please contact Craig Holman, Public \n     Citizen, at 202-454-5182.\n           Respectfully Submitted.\n\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I also want to note the House of \nRepresentatives included a similar measure in its version of the \nTransportation bill. It was a bipartisan amendment sponsored by New \nJersey colleagues, Frank LoBiondo, a Republican, and Bill Pascrell, a \nDemocrat. This was passed unanimously, the same language, by the House.\n  In my view, this is an imperative step to allow States to have better \ncontrol and more transparency and honesty in their contracting \nprocesses. I think it will move to save money for our States and put in \nplace a greater sense of credibility for the public when it deals with \nits oversight of public contracting. I think we owe the taxpayers this, \nand I urge my colleagues to support the Corzine-Lautenberg amendment. \nWe should join the House, in my view, in instituting this ability for \nStates to control their own contracting process.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I understand my colleague, Senator Lautenberg, along with our other \ncolleagues who left the Senate at the time of the recess, will be \nreturning to speak to this amendment. I will yield the floor, but I \nwould appreciate it if we could reserve the right of Senator \nLautenberg, upon his arrival, to come back and be next on the queue to \nspeak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is the Senator asking unanimous consent in a \nformal request?\n  Is there objection to the Senator's request to allow Senator \nLautenberg the ability to speak when he returns to the Capitol?\n  Mr. BOND. I would amend that request to say, when I am finished \nspeaking, Senator Lautenberg may speak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Is there objection to the \nrequest as modified? Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, there are a number of things that need to be \ncleared up as we consider this amendment. First, the Senator from New \nJersey has mentioned that several States have their own pay-to-play \nrestrictions. But according to the Federal Highway Administration, \nthose States are ones that are restricting contributions where there \nare not competitive bids. They are talking about no-bid contracts.\n  I do not doubt that New Jersey has had problems with no-bid \ncontracts. I will leave it to my colleagues to discuss some of those \nproblems. What we are talking about is changing the competitive bid \nsystem so that one State\n\n[[Page S4910]]\n\ncan opt out of a mandate that the Federal Government has imposed. That \nmandate is, when using Federal aid to highway dollars, you have to bid \nit competitively because when we as national taxpayers are funding \nprojects, then we have a right to see that they are done on a \ncompetitive-bid basis, to make sure that the Federal taxpayers get the \nbest bargain for their money.\n  The name of my colleague, the other Senator from New Jersey, is \nattached to the amendment. I find it interesting that his reputation is \none of sanctioning and penalizing States that do not conform to Federal \nlaws, so it was alarming to me to see this amendment from the New \nJersey Senators that will exempt them from complying with Federal \nregulations. In my State there are a lot of things our chosen \nRepresentatives, the people who serve Missouri in the Missouri General \nAssembly, choose not to do. There are various mandates that impose \nburdens on our State that will limit its ability to get funds. If we \nare going down the road of exempting our States from mandates of the \nFederal Government on Federal highway aid dollars, I think the Missouri \nGeneral Assembly and the Missouri Governor would pass along to me quite \na number of mandates they wish to have taken off of their backs.\n  We just passed another mandate to take $900 million out of the \nhighway trust fund to pay for storm water improvements for local \ngovernments. I think that is an unfortunate mandate; it was adopted by \na very close vote. I hope we will be able to revisit it. But when you \nstart exempting a State from the competitive bid contracts to allow \nthem to impose their own campaign finance laws through the Federal \nhighway aid system, that, to me, does not seem to be a proper use of \nthe Federal highway tax dollars. We have a right to expect that we get \nthe best bargain for the money and that is through competitive bids.\n  This amendment, as I read it, limits competition and changes the \ncurrent Federal process. Political contributions have absolutely no \neffect on the selection of Federal aid highway projects because, unless \notherwise approved by the Secretary, construction projects are awarded \nonly on the basis of the lowest responsive bid that meets the \nestablished criteria, based on the State's department of transportation \nengineering estimates.\n  Very simply put, unless the Secretary of Transportation waives it, \nyou have to take what the State Department of transportation has put \ntogether in its request for bids, and make the best bid complying with \nthat, that is responsive, at the lowest price.\n  That does not offer opportunities for corruption. There may be people \nin New Jersey and other States who find other ways to corrupt the \nsystem. I do not deny that. I think they should be punished. But there \nis no reason, in my view, to repeal the competitive bid standards. If \nStates want to regulate their State projects by limiting competition, \nby all means, they should be free to do it.\n  If it is a State contract, States can put in anything they want. \nThere are other States, as I mentioned earlier, that currently have \npay-to-play laws in place, but there are four States that have pay-to-\nplay laws, two of which--Ohio and South Carolina--only apply to no-bid \ncontracts having no effect on highway and transit projects because \nthese are let under the competitive low-bid method.\n  I believe the Senators from New Jersey think they are being singled \nout by the Federal Highway Administration as Kentucky and West Virginia \nhave similar pay-to-play laws--but both Kentucky and West Virginia have \nexceptions to their provisions. Kentucky excludes contracts awarded \ncompetitively on the basis of the lowest and best bid, while West \nVirginia's exception is the restriction that only applies during \nnegotiation and performance of the contract.\n  These provisions are clearly different from what the Senators from \nNew Jersey seek for their State. To open the process in other States, \nwe do not need to have Federal aid highway dollars used as a means of \nchanging campaign finance laws or changing the competitive bid process \nwhich gives us the best bid on the projects that are funded with \nFederal dollars.\n  I don't want to see State laws preempting Federal laws, but if we are \ngoing to go down that road, as I said, I have a number of amendments, \nand I would certainly ask support for all the areas that Missouri wants \nto exempt from some of the mandates, many of which I think are \nunnecessary from the Federal Highway Administration laws.\n  At this point, I urge my colleagues not to support this amendment \nbecause it provides a very different standard which New Jersey is \nattempting to use in its award of competitive-bid contracts.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. CORZINE. If I might ask the Senator from Missouri, if he has read \nthe New Jersey legislation, in no way by my reading of that legislation \ndoes it supersede the competitive bidding requirement.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. CORZINE. Yes.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent, notwithstanding \nrule XXII, all first-degree amendments to the highway bill must be \nfiled at the desk no later than 3 o'clock. We are extending it from 2 \no'clock to 3 o'clock because of the evacuation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CORZINE. I see the Senator from Missouri is no longer in the \nSenate, but I make very clear the amendment Senator Lautenberg and I \nare proposing in no way undermines the standard that there need be \ncompetitive bids in the Federal highway funds or in Federal funds that \nmix both State and Federal dollars.\n  This is about contracting rules that would encourage competition, not \ndiscourage competition. I believe if we were put side to side with \nKentucky and West Virginia, we would find the New Jersey contracting \nrules are parallel. We would find this is one of the reasons the House \nunanimously agreed to this because it is an additional step that in no \nway undermines the standards that exist by the Federal Government.\n  Again, it reflects the desires of the State legislature and the \nGovernor to have stronger, stricter rules on contracts administered by \nthe State.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I start by commending the chairman of \nthe Environment and Public Works Committee for his work on behalf of \ngetting the funding raised for the Transportation bill.\n  It is critical. There is not a State that would not like to see more \nmoney for highways, transit or whatever else they do--perhaps even for \nlong-distance rail service.\n  The manager of the bill, the chairman of the committee, had to \nwrestle with not only his conscience, but colleagues who felt \ndifferently. There were over 20 ``no'' votes. I wonder if those \nSenators would forgo the extra money that resulted from the increase in \nthe size of the bill. Perhaps that could be polled.\n  I thank my colleague, Senator Corzine, for generating this amendment \nwhich I share in sponsoring to ensure integrity in highway contracting. \nMy friend and colleague from New Jersey has always fought against \ncorruption in public activities and contracting. I am proud to stand \nand fight alongside him to make sure every State has the right to make \nchoices about how it conducts its campaign financing laws and how it \nlooks to better management of the process so corruption is avoided. \nThat is what this is about.\n  One has to look at the bill. It is relatively simple. Frankly, I \nthought it would be something that could be accepted on its face by \nunanimous consent. There is no punitive measure in here.\n  I understand our colleague from Missouri said I was big on sanctions. \nHow right he is. I am big on sanctions. We raised the drinking age to \n21. When our colleague, Senator Dole, was the Secretary of \nTransportation under President Reagan, we sanctioned States who did not \nput that into law.\n  Guess what the outcome is. Twenty thousand young people have been \nsaved over the last 21 years. That is what the sanctions did. Would it \nbe better to not have sanctions and have the freedom for the teens to \nget on the highway and kill themselves? I don't think so. It\n\n[[Page S4911]]\n\nworked. We tried the carrot. But there were not enough carrots to take \ncare of it, so we had to use the stick. That is what you do. That is \nwhat the red lights are for. It is a stick. It says: Do not cross over \nwhen traffic is going the other way, et cetera.\n\n  We are a nation of laws. That is what the structure of our society \nis. There are sanctions against those who would try to buy a gun permit \nwhen they are spousal abusers. There are sanctions. They go to prison. \nYes, I like that kind of sanction.\n  When we look at what we are trying to do, unfortunately, the U.S. \nChamber of Commerce says it should not happen, it reduces competition. \nNothing could be further from the truth because now the little guys \nwho, in their judgment, make a campaign contribution--we foster that \nnotion around here: Contribute if you can. Contribute even if you \ncannot, we sometimes say. But it happens. Money flows. So we say to \nsome small contractor or some attorney or some engineer who has a two-\nperson business: Well, maybe there is an exemption for small business. \nBut, on balance, they are saying the smaller companies cannot make a \ncontribution because then they would be barred from competing. \nCompeting with the big guys? It is outrageous.\n  So this amendment fixes a problem in Federal highway law that \nactually prevents States from taking effective steps to curb \ncontracting abuses.\n  Earlier this year, the Federal Highway Administration withheld some \n$250 million in highway funding from the State of New Jersey. It had \nalready been allocated. What happened? We had to change the law. We had \nto open a loophole so people could contribute, even though our Governor \nat the time and the legislature agreed: No, we should not permit it. I \nam not defending it. I am saying I defend States rights. And many of \nthe people here, particularly our friends on the other side, defend \nStates rights. I think the State ought to be able to decide whether it \nwants to clean up the campaign finance laws.\n  Spokesmen for the FHWA said a State contracting rule designed to \nprevent actual and potential corruption was ``inconsistent'' with \ncurrent Federal law. I do not know where they get that one.\n  What had New Jersey done? The State had simply banned certain large \npolitical contributions by recipient of State contracts. Its mission \nwas to ensure fairness and transparency in the contracting process, and \nour State ought to be commended for it. Instead, New Jersey was \npunished for exercising its own judgment. The Governor signed it. The \nlegislature passed it, the Governor signed it, and it became law. Why \ncannot we do that?\n  The relevant Federal law, section 112 of the highway title, calls for \ncompetitive bidding. The administration has taken the strict view that \nif some bidders are excluded, that could limit competition. Would we \nsay that in the vetting of a company's executive leader, if he had a \ncriminal past and they did not make a contribution, it would be all \nright? No, it certainly would not be all right for that company to \nstart doing State business. But the fact is, if the playing field is \ntilted toward one company, there is no true competition. Maybe the big \nguys can afford to do that. They can rule the roost. But that is what \nour State wants to protect against.\n  States should not have to choose between receiving Federal highway \ndollars they need and restoring public confidence in the Government \ncontracting process. What an anomaly we had here a little while ago. We \nhad people voting to increase highway spending when it is threatened \nthat the President is going to veto it, and we are way over the limit \nthe White House proposed for the highway bill. Seventy some Senators \nsaid: Oh, yes? Impose limits? Well, we are not going to stick with your \nlimits. We are going to raise the limits because our States need \nbridges and highway fixing and investments in transportation. That is \nwhat we want--70 some Senators. So it was not all Democrats. It was a \nmix.\n  It is hypocritical to continue to prohibit States from taking \neffective measures to maintain the integrity of their contracting \nprocess. Federal law already prohibits political contributions from \nFederal Government contractors. So why shouldn't States be allowed to \ndo it, if they want to--one State by itself, any State that wants to do \nit? This amendment simply allows States to enact similar reforms when \nthey so choose.\n  The House of Representatives has already approved a similar provision \nin its version of the transportation bill. I ask my colleagues to \nsupport this amendment to promote good Government, to promote \ncompetition. It is a vote for States rights, and a vote against \ncorruption in public contracting.\n  Once again, I commend my colleague from New Jersey, Senator Corzine, \nfor his initiative.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sununu). The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. TALENT. Mr. President, I thank the Chair for recognizing me.\n  I want to take a few minutes, if I can, to pause from this debate on \nthe amendment to make a few comments about the underlying highway bill. \nI wanted to have a chance to do this when we debated the motion to \nwaive the budget point of order, but I was not able to do so because of \nthe unanimous consent agreement that limited time for debate.\n  So I thought I would do it now because I am very grateful to my \nfriends, the managers of this bill on both sides of the aisle, Senator \nJeffords and Senator Inhofe, my good friend and a zealous worker for \nbetter transportation infrastructure, Senator Bond and, of course, \nSenators Grassley and Baucus for their amendment which we adopted \nearlier increasing the size of this highway bill. I thought it was \nimportant that those of us who feel strongly about this come down and \nsay so.\n  We have a problem with transportation infrastructure. The problem is \ngetting to be so big that awareness of it has penetrated even here in \nWashington. But everybody in America, at least everybody in Missouri I \ntalk to, already knows about it, and has known about it for a very long \ntime. Because they have to drive on these roads. They have to use the \nrail and the transit. For them, it is not an abstract question of \npublic policy. For them, it is a question of getting where they need to \ngo, to do what they need to do, safely and on time, to make this \ncountry run. It is getting harder and harder because the roads are no \ngood.\n  I am going to try to contain my frustration about this issue. It is \nhard because this is not rocket science. A lot of the issues we \nconfront here are very difficult.\n  This really isn't that difficult. We know how to build roads. We know \nwe need to do it. The question is whether we have the will to do what \nwe obviously need to do and what will empower our people to help us \ncreate the wealth and opportunity that will then enable us to do the \nother things we need to do.\n  I said there was a problem before. The statistics have been repeated \noften enough, but I guess in the Senate nothing is ever said quite \nenough so I am going to repeat them. Thirty-two percent of the Nation's \nroads are in poor or mediocre condition; 37 percent of the urban roads \nare in poor or mediocre condition; 28 percent of the bridges are \nsubstandard. I can show you some substandard bridges in Missouri. As a \nresult of this, our Nation loses about $65 billion a year in lost man-\nhours and lost productivity because people are stuck on the highways. A \nrecent report said it was three times what it used to be in 2003. We \nlose $50 billion a year in extra maintenance costs because our cars and \nour vehicles are damaged as a result of the bad roads.\n  Who among us has not had the experience of hitting a pothole and \nsaying to ourselves, ``There goes that shock absorber. That is another \nfront-end alignment I will have to get''?\n  This is common knowledge throughout America. The Department of \nTransportation studied it in 2002, 3 years ago. The problem hasn't \ngotten any better since then. They concluded--and this is a rather big \nstudy--that $375 billion is what we needed in the next highway bill to \naddress the problem. We don't have $375 billion in this bill. We have \nunder $300 billion. We have less than we had last year. We have more \nthan we would have had, if not for the heroic efforts of the bill \nmanagers. But we don't have enough even with what they have added. Yet\n\n[[Page S4912]]\n\npeople on this floor say that this is too much.\n  This is a problem I have been working on with my friend from Oregon, \nSenator Wyden. We believe it is time to begin using bonding as part of \nour Transportation financing package. We have proposed the Build \nAmerica Bond Act. A number of people have joined us in cosponsoring the \nbill. My friend from New Jersey is one of them. This is legislation \nthat would create a federally chartered, nonprofit corporation that \nwould issue about $38 or $39 billion in bonds and set aside $8 or $9 \nbillion of that in a fund which would then accumulate interest over \ntime and be used to pay off the principal. Then we would have $30 \nbillion for immediate investment in the Nation's transportation \ninfrastructure.\n  We could get that money out in the next construction season or two. \nWe could begin taking some of these vital projects that are constantly \nmoved to the right, moved from 2010 to 2015, to 2020, and start moving \nthem back to the left on the time line. We could build some of the \nbridges we need, fix some of the roads that are substandard.\n  We also have a provision in the bill that says some of the bonds have \nto be in low enough denominations that Americans can purchase them, \naverage folks can go out and buy a $50 bond, a $25 bond, knowing that \nthey are investing in American roads, transportation infrastructure, \nand jobs to make America competitive for the future.\n  I am pleased that we have made some progress on this. The bill \nmanagers were good enough to include a provision for the underlying \ncorporation in the bill. We don't have authority to issue the bonds \nyet, but we have the corporation in the bill.\n  I am also very grateful to the managers of the bill for including in \nthe substitute amendment my amendment to authorize private activity \nbonds, $15 billion in transportation highway infrastructure bonds.\n  These bonds could be issued in a partnership between States and \nlocalities and private companies for specific projects. The localities \nwould repay the principal through a variety of revenues, including \nannual appropriations or charging rent for the infrastructure that was \nbuilt. Since the bonds are tax exempt, it means the holders would pay \nno taxes on them to the Federal Government. They would be preferred by \nthe market. We could get $15 billion in a kind of bond money out there \nright away to begin addressing the problems that the country is facing.\n  Nobody really argues with what I have said. That is one of the things \nthat is frustrating. The people who supported the budget motion, who \nwant the bill to remain small, don't argue that there is no problem. \nYou can't argue the fact that there is a problem. What they say is: We \ncan't fix the problem because we have a deficit. We can't spend more \nmoney on transportation infrastructure because we already have a \ndeficit.\n  Investment in transportation infrastructure is dynamic. That means it \nhelps grow the economy. It helps produce revenue. We understand that in \nevery other context. Nobody argues with that in any other context \nexcept the highway bill. All the economic models say about $1 billion \nin investment in transportation infrastructure produces 47,500 jobs. \nEvery dollar invested returns $5.75. That is the multiplier effect.\n  The same people who are saying we can't spend money on highway and \ntransportation infrastructure will stand up in the context of a trade \nbill and say: The reason it is OK to pass an open trade bill--and I \nhave supported many of them--even though we will be trading with \ncountries that have lower wage rates than we do, is that we are still \ncompetitive because we have a more sophisticated financial system, a \nmore sophisticated telecommunications system, and a more sophisticated \ntransportation system. They are right. That is one of the reasons we \ncan be competitive with countries that pay lower wage rates because we \ncan get our products to market because decades and decades and decades \nago other Senators and other Congressmen had the foresight to invest \nin transportation infrastructure.\n\n  I know we have a budget deficit. We have a transportation deficit. It \nisn't going to get better if we don't do anything. Saying we can't \ninvest in transportation infrastructure because we are worried about \nthe budget is like a farmer who is hard pressed saying: You know what, \nI am afraid my cash flow isn't what it should be. I am not going to buy \nfuel for the combine.\n  It is like a homeowner saying: The budget is tight. I am really hard \npressed. I am not going to fix the hole in the roof because that might \ncost money.\n  This is a problem that is not going to get better if we don't do \nanything about it. Every 5 or 6 years we pass another highway bill, and \nthe people who are concerned about the cost say: It is bigger than it \nwas 5 or 6 years ago. Yes, it is bigger. Every year, even though the \nhighway bill is bigger, the gap between what we are spending and what \nwe need gets bigger, too.\n  This year, even under the amendment we adopted earlier, we have about \na $80-billion gap. I guarantee, if we don't do something about it, 5 \nyears from now it will be bigger than that.\n  What do the people who opposed the amendment on budget grounds want \nto do? What can you do to build more transportation infrastructure? You \ncan raise taxes. They don't want to do that. I understand that. It is \nhard to raise gas taxes when gas prices are up. That is a hard thing to \ndo. They don't like bonding either. That is out. They don't want \ngeneral revenue to be used for highways. That is out. Now they are \nsaying they don't want other streams of revenue. Even though it would \npay for it, they don't want that used either. So they are all for \nfixing infrastructure as long as we don't use taxes, bonding, general \nrevenue, or any other revenue to do it.\n  Stop and ask yourself a question for a second: What is the domestic \nachievement of the Eisenhower administration that people remember? The \nbuilding of the interstate highway system. Roll Call magazine, one of \nthe Capitol Hill magazines, did a survey of congressional scholars and \nasked them what the most significant bills were that the Congress \npassed in the last 50 years. No. 4 on their list was the interstate \nhighway bill passed in the 1950s, which they pointed out intensified \neconomic growth, boosted domestic tourism and made possible just-in-\ntime manufacturing processes.\n  How can anybody say that investment in transportation infrastructure \ndoes not produce economic growth?\n  I know we have a vote coming up soon. I will close by saying a couple \nthings. In the first place, the bill where we now have it--I was going \nto say it is the least we should do, but the truth is it is not as much \nas we should do. I urge the bill's managers to go to conference with \nthis bill as it now is and do everything possible to hold this number \nor, if possible, find some way to inject more money into transportation \ninfrastructure this year. I know they are committed, and they are going \nto try to do that. I urge them to stand by their commitment. This is \nworth doing, and it is worth doing now. We cannot afford to give \nanother 5 or 6 years away to the locusts and then come back here and \nface the same problem we have now, except it is bigger.\n  I believe in the people of this country. I am not one to focus on the \nproblems we have. Any Senate, any time in the Nation's history, if it \nwants to focus on the problems of the country, can get discouraged. I \nknow we are fighting a war now, and we have education issues and health \ncare issues we have to address, and they are all very big.\n  The reason I am optimistic is I believe in the American people. I \nbelieve in the productivity and ingenuity of the American people. The \nanswer to all these problems, broadly speaking, is to empower them, to \nlet them have the resources they need--which is one of the reasons I \nhave been for tax reduction--so they can make the economy grow. Let \nthem do what they do in their everyday lives, raising their families, \ndoing their jobs, running their small businesses, to keep the economy \ngrowing and make us prosperous and strong and free. But the American \npeople cannot on their own build roads. They can do a lot of things on \ntheir own or together in private businesses or associations of one kind \nor another, but they cannot build roads. That is a job the Government \nhas to do. We will deal with the transportation deficit, and the \nAmerican people will deal with the budget deficit as well if they can\n\n[[Page S4913]]\n\nget to work in the morning. Let's help them do that.\n  I congratulate the managers on adopting the amendment. I hope we can \ndo even better in conference.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I do have a statement I wish to make in \nopposition to the Corzine amendment; however, the junior Senator from \nSouth Dakota is here. I would like to yield to him for up to 6 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator does not have the right to yield \ntime.\n  The Senator from South Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished chairman for his \ngood work in moving this bill along. This is legislation that is long \noverdue. It is time that we move forward to vote so we can get help to \nthese highway departments across this country, particularly in States \nsuch as mine, Northern States, where we are going to lose the \nconstruction season if we don't get something done, get a bill passed, \nand get a permanent authorization in place.\n  I speak in opposition to the pay-to-play amendment that has been \noffered to the Transportation bill.\n  For my colleagues who might not be aware of this issue, the Acting \nGovernor of New Jersey issued an executive order last September which \nblocks anyone who makes political contributions to state officials, \ncandidates or parties in excess of $300 from bidding on any contract \nfor services, material, supplies or equipment or to acquire, sell or \nlease any land or Federal building where the value of the contract \nexceeds $17,500.\n  While it is clearly New Jersey's prerogative to institute such pay-\nto-play laws when it comes to State contracting, this New Jersey \nexecutive order effectively violated the free and open competition \nprovisions governing Federal Aid Highway and Transit Contracting and \nwent much further than pay-to-play laws in other States.\n  It's my understanding that New Jersey's Acting Governor, Richard \nCodey, issued this executive order in response to corruption and kick-\nbacks that were uncovered with respect to no-bid State contracts.\n  Seeing that almost all of the contracts that occur under the Federal \nHighway and Transit programs are based on sealed low-bid contracts, the \nSenate should not adopt this amendment because it would undo the \nexisting uniform rules that all States must follow when it comes to \nFederal contracting.\n  Congress has specifically stated in past highway and transit \nauthorizations that we should encourage fair and open competition.\n  Congress should encourage competition by cultivating the broadest \ngroup of competent qualified contractors to do the work. We want to \nensure that we are getting the best work done for the best price.\n  The low bid system was used to build our interstate system and \nNational Highway System. It provides the highest quality product at the \nlowest possible price through competition. It should be maintained and \nstrengthened, not weakened by adopting the amendment by the Senator \nfrom New Jersey.\n  Soon after New Jersey's Acting Governor issued his Executive Order \nlast year, the U.S. Department of Transportation was forced to withhold \na portion of New Jersey's transportation funding because the State was \nnot complying with Federal contracting requirements--this was done \nafter the U.S. Department of Transportation attempted to work this \nissue out with New Jersey Officials.\n  Soon thereafter, the New Jersey legislature stepped in and passed a \nbill on March 22, 2005 that excludes Federal aid highway funding from \nthe Governor's previous pay-to-play executive order--thereby restoring \nNew Jersey's Federal transportation funding.\n  I share the Senator from New Jersey's concern about illegal activity \nwhen it comes to no-bid contracting. However, there is nothing that \ncurrently prohibits states from taking action to prosecute those \nresponsible for such illegal activities.\n  Further, since the current low-bid sealed contracting process used on \nFederal transportation contracts protects against instances of \ncorruption or impropriety, and the fact that the New Jersey legislature \nhas ensured that its pay-to-play regulations don't impact Federal \ntransportation contracts, I'm a little puzzled why this amendment is \nneeded--unless of course the Senator from New Jersey is seeking to \nchange the existing Federal contracting process.\n  Federal contracting law already includes a process for the exclusion \nof contractors who have acted illegally--and the Federal Government \nalso has a debarment process that prohibits contractors who have \ncommitted fraud or bribery from bidding on future contracts.\n  Because the State of New Jersey is currently suing the U.S. \nDepartment of Transportation in Federal district court concerning the \nprevious withholding of Federal transportation funds, now is not the \ntime for the Senate to weigh-in on this matter. The Senate should allow \nthe court to hear the case on its merits.\n  My colleagues will also be interested to know that the Senate \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee rejected this amendment when we \nmarked up the transportation bill on March 16.\n  The U.S. Department of Transportation has informed me that there has \nnot been one single case of kick-backs or corruption with regard to \nlow-bid Federal aid highway contracts in New Jersey.\n  Most importantly, the U.S. Department of Transportation opposes this \namendment and has informed me that the Corzine Amendment would create \nan unmanageable patchwork of local restrictions and requirements when \nFederal aid funds are used on a project.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote against this amendment and to allow the \nFederal Highway Administration and those State governments that are so \ninterested in getting a highway bill put into place to enable them to \naddress the critical transportation needs this country faces, to get \nthis highway bill passed and defeat this amendment.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, first, I agree with the comments of the \nSenator from South Dakota. He has dramatically shortened my speech \nagainst the Corzine amendment because he said some things I would have \nsaid. I emphasize that the problem is not with sealed bids, it is with \nno bids. It could be that they have unique problems in New Jersey, but \nI would not want those problems that are there to encumber what we are \ntrying to do in States such as Oklahoma and New Hampshire and South \nDakota. There had been abuses that are pretty well known in New Jersey.\n  An example is the case of the law firm of DeCotiis, FitzPatrick, Cole \n& Wisler, which has reportedly thrived by exploiting a system that \nencourages politicians to reward their political contributors with \nState contracts that are no-bid contracts--not low-bid but no-bid \ncontracts.\n  The Record, a New Jersey paper which did an extensive investigation \ninto this DeCotiis firm and their relationship to public officials, \nstated in a December 2003 article that:\n\n       A sweeping review of DeCotiis's work for towns and public \n     agencies shows how high rollers in this pay-to-play \n     sweepstakes reap huge returns from investments in the right \n     politicians. In a study of DeCotiis's legal bills for towns \n     and public agencies across New Jersey, as well as interviews \n     with dozens of elected officials, the Record has found that \n     the DeCotiis firm billed at least 128 government entities for \n     nearly $26.6 million during the 2\\1/2\\-year period starting \n     January of 2001. From Alpine to Atlantic City, in 15 of New \n     Jersey's 21 counties, and in many departments of State \n     government, DeCotiis's lawyers are charging the taxpayers for \n     contracts that, under Jersey law, can be awarded without \n     competitive bidding.\n\n  I have other examples of corrupt kinds of dealings, but I believe my \npoint has been made that here the issue is with no-bid contracts, not \nsealed-bid contracts.\n  I question, also, the constitutionality of something in terms of the \nfirst amendment, but that has not even been discussed.\n  There could be a problem. I would be sympathetic to the problem and \nperhaps the Senator from New Jersey will be holding a position in the \nnot too distant future where he can deal directly with some of the \nproblems that are within the State of New Jersey but are not all over \nthe country.\n  So I join my colleague from South Dakota in urging the defeat of the\n\n[[Page S4914]]\n\namendment, and at the appropriate time I plan to move to table the \namendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I appreciate the comments. I can \nunderstand the point of view if the bipartisan legislation from the \nState of New Jersey would in any way interfere with low-bid, sealed \ncontracts on Federal projects. I would not be in favor of this, either. \nNo-bid contracts should not be an accepted way of doing business in \ngovernment. At least from the legal advice and understanding that I \nhave of the New Jersey legislation, it does the opposite. It requires \nthat it would conform both to Federal regulations and adds the \nadditional element that there be restrictions on those participating \nwho have contributed more than $300 in a contract that is over $17,500.\n  Practically speaking, the reality is that the Department of \nTransportation, and Republican and Democratic administrations in New \nJersey--and I suspect this can very well be the case in other places--\nsets specifications. Those who both lobby and contribute often arrange \nthose specifications, so there are situations where those who have the \nability to participate in the bidding contracts are limited and those \nspecifications are written in a way that gives a bias to the \ncontracting exercise. All this legislation that the State of New Jersey \nis asking for, its States rights ability to impose, are supplemental to \nthe rules and regulations that the Department of Transportation is \ntaking, and I believe it will protect the public and enhance the \nconfidence for the State of New Jersey.\n  It is not an imposition on any other State. They do not impose these \npay-to-play rules. It has no impact on another State. We are only \nasking for the ability of the State of New Jersey to put down the rules \nthat the State legislature, on a bipartisan basis, believes will lead \nto lower costs and greater transparency to the bidding process.\n  I understand there is a difference of view, but I feel strongly about \nit and ask my colleagues to consider the fact that this is a \nsupplemental and in no way undermines Federal regulations, does not \nimpose this standard on any other State, and does go a long way toward \ndealing with concerns that people on both sides of the aisle in my \nState believe are undermining public trust and raising the cost to the \nFederal Government and the State government in doing business in our \nState.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I appreciate the comments, even though I \ndisagree with them, of the Senator from New Jersey. I know he is \nsincere. I know there is a problem and he is trying to correct the \nproblem and there is an honest difference of opinion.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a letter from the U.S. Chamber of \nCommerce opposing the Corzine amendment, a letter from the American \nRoad & Transportation Builders Association opposing the Lautenberg-\nCorzine amendment, and also a letter from the Transportation \nConstruction Coalition, which is, I believe, almost every labor union \nin the United States, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                        Chamber of Commerce of the\n\n\n                                     United States of America,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 10, 2005.\n     Hon. Daniel Akaka,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Akaka: As the Senate continues debate on H.R. \n     3, the reauthorization of the Transportation Equity Act for \n     the 21st Century (TEA-2l), the U.S. Chamber of Commerce \n     strongly opposes an amendment by Senators John Corzine (D-NJ) \n     and Frank Lautenberg (D-NJ) that attempts to change federal \n     competitive highway and transit contracting rules.\n       For over 25 years, federal law has forbidden states from \n     implementing ``pay-to-play'' provisions for state highway and \n     transit construction contracts (23 USC Sec. 112). Federal \n     highway and transit contracts are awarded in an open-bid \n     environment, and it is unnecessary to have an individual \n     state attempt to change these federal contracting rules.\n       In November 2004, the state of New Jersey passed an \n     executive order with language that included federal highway \n     and transit contracting in the state's ``pay-to-play'' \n     provisions. On January 21, 2005, the U.S. District Court for \n     New Jersey ruled against the state and reaffirmed the federal \n     statute, which led to New Jersey's final ``pay-to-play'' law \n     continuing the longstanding exemption of ``pay-to-play'' for \n     federal competitive highway and transit contracting.\n       Supporting the Corzine/Lautenberg amendment would adversely \n     affect the ability of business leaders to support candidates, \n     and thus, undermine the importance of allowing business \n     executives and their employees the ability to legally \n     participate in the political process, while other groups \n     would not be impacted.\n       The U.S. Chamber of Commerce will consider using votes on \n     or in relation to this issue for inclusion in our annual \n     ``How They Voted'' ratings. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce is \n     the world's largest business federation representing more \n     than three million companies and organizations of every size, \n     sector and region.\n           Sincerely,\n     R. Bruce Josten.\n                                  ____\n\n                                    American Road & Transportation\n\n\n                                         Builders Association,\n\n                                      Washington, DC, May 9, 2005.\n       Dear Senator: As the Senate continues debate on H.R. 3, the \n     federal surface transportation program reauthorization bill, \n     the American Road & Transportation Builders Association \n     (ARTB) urges you to oppose an amendment by Senator Frank \n     Lautenberg that would modify federal transportation \n     procurement standards to allow states to penalize \n     transportation construction firms that participate in the \n     political process.\n       The Lautenberg amendment would allow states to preclude \n     individuals who have made financial campaign contributions to \n     state and local officials from competing for federal-aid \n     highway and transit construction work. By excluding \n     individuals who exercise their right to participate in the \n     political process, the amendment would contradict the open \n     competitive bid system of procurement that has been a \n     hallmark of the federal transportation programs for almost 50 \n     years. Under this system, contracts are awarded to the lowest \n     qualified bidder. Political contributions, or the lack \n     thereof, have no role in the awards outcome.\n       An ARTBA analysis of Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) \n     bid data for the period 1958 to 2003 found that winning \n     highway contractor bids on federally-funded projects have \n     averaged 6.7 percent below the government's own internal cost \n     estimates for the advertised jobs. In total over the 45-year \n     period, the winning contractor bids have come in $22.8 \n     billion under estimated cost.\n       This analysis proves that the low-bid system works in the \n     public interest. It also shows that highway contractors have \n     been giving the public outstanding value for their tax \n     dollars. Transportation construction industry contractors \n     routinely build highways and bridges that meet exact \n     government specifications for materials, quality, durability \n     and environmental protection for substantially less than the \n     government expects to pay.\n       Consequently, we urge you to protect the integrity of the \n     open competition, low-bid system for transportation \n     construction work and oppose the Lautenberg amendment to H.R. \n     3.\n       Sincerely,\n                                                   T. Peter Ruane,\n     President & CEO.\n                                  ____\n\n                                       Transportation Construction\n\n\n                                                    Coalition,\n\n                                                      May 9, 2005.\n       Dear Senator: The 28 national associations and construction \n     unions of the Transportation Construction Coalition (TCC) \n     urge you to oppose the Lautenberg amendment to H.R. 3, the \n     highway and transit program reauthorization bill. The \n     Lautenberg amendment would restrict competition for federal \n     highway and transit work and apply a nationwide solution to a \n     state-specific issue.\n       The Lautenberg amendment would allow states to prevent \n     companies from performing federal-aid highway and transit \n     work funded by this bill if they made legal contributions to \n     state and local elected officials. The amendment is based on \n     a New Jersey law that significantly limits competition for \n     transportation construction work by blocking any individual \n     that made political contributions of more than $300 from \n     bidding on any contract that exceeds $17,500.\n       The ``pay to play'' laws of other states typically focus \n     only on no-bid contracts. The New Jersey version, however, \n     applies to a much broader class of projects. Highway and \n     transit projects are typically procured using the lowest \n     competitive bid method, which requires an objective and \n     public evaluation of sealed bids.\n       Congress has specifically stated in past highway and \n     transit reauthorization bills that states should encourage \n     fair and open competition. States accomplish this objective \n     by cultivating the broadest group of competent qualified \n     applicants to perform transportation construction work and by \n     excluding companies that have acted illegally. The low bid \n     system was used to build the nation's highway system and \n     provides the highest quality product at the lowest possible \n     price.\n       We urge you to oppose the Lautenberg amendment to H.R. 3. \n     The amendment would significantly undermine the federal \n     commitment to the competitive bid system.\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I move to table the Corzine amendment and \nask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n\n[[Page S4915]]\n\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion.\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered.

The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, there has been a great misunderstanding \naround here as to how we came up with offsets, how we are going to take \ncare of paying for an additional amount of money in this package.\n  I compliment the chairman of the Finance Committee, Senator Grassley, \nalong with the ranking minority member of the committee, Senator \nBaucus, for the hard work they have put in on this legislation and, \nquite frankly, disagree with the criticism to which they have been \nsubjected.\n  I want to reemphasize, if I could, that it is important we get this \nlegislation done. I am very pleased we have two more amendments that \nare down here. The deadline for the filing of amendments is now over as \nof right now. We do have several amendments. We are going to invite \nthese people to bring their amendments down. I am pleased there are two \namendments that are already down here. We look forward to taking up \nthose amendments.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 625\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 625.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Jersey [Mr. Lautenberg], for himself \n     and Mr. Dodd, proposes an amendment numbered 625.\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I ask unanimous consent the reading of the amendment \nbe dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To provide funding for motorcycle safety programs in States \n                     without universal helmet laws)\n\n       At the end of subtitle D of title I, add the following:\n\n     SEC. __. UNIVERSAL HELMET SAFETY STANDARD FOR OPERATION OF \n                   MOTORCYCLES.\n\n       Section 153 of title 23, United States Code, is amended--\n       (1) in subsection (a), by striking ``fiscal year--'' and \n     all that follows through ``(2) a law'' and inserting ``fiscal \n     year a law'';\n       (2) in subsection (f)--\n       (A) in paragraph (2), by striking ``fiscal year--'' and all \n     that follows through ``(B) had in effect at all times a State \n     law described in subsection (a)(2)'' and inserting ``fiscal \n     year had in effect at all times a State law described in \n     subsection (a)''; and\n       (B) in paragraph (3), by striking ``fiscal year--'' and all \n     that follows through ``(B) had in effect at all times a State \n     law described in subsection (a)(2)'' and inserting ``fiscal \n     year had in effect at all times a State law described in \n     subsection (a)'';\n       (3) in subsection (h)--\n       (A) in paragraph (1), by striking ``subsection (a)(2)'' and \n     inserting ``subsection (a)''; and\n       (B) in paragraph (2), by striking ``subsection (a)(2)'' and \n     inserting ``subsection (a)'';\n       (4) by redesignating subsections (i), (j), and (k) as \n     subsections (j), (k), and (l), respectively; and\n       (5) by inserting after subsection (h) the following:\n       ``(i) Motorcycle Helmet Use Laws.--\n       ``(1) Fiscal year 2009.--If, at any time in fiscal year \n     2008, a State does not have in effect and is not enforcing a \n     law that makes unlawful throughout the State the operation of \n     a motorcycle if any individual on the motorcycle is not \n     wearing a motorcycle helmet, the Secretary shall transfer 1.5 \n     percent of the funds apportioned to the State for fiscal year \n     2009 under each of subsections (b)(1), (b)(3), and (b)(4) of \n     section 104 to the apportionment of the State under section \n     402.\n       ``(2) Fiscal year 2010 and thereafter.--If, at any time in \n     fiscal year beginning after September 30, 2008, a State does \n     not have in effect and is not enforcing a law described in \n     paragraph (1), the Secretary shall transfer 3 percent of the \n     funds apportioned to the State for the succeeding fiscal year \n     under each of subsections (b)(1), (b)(3), and (b)(4) of \n     section 104 to the apportionment of the State under section \n     402.\n       ``(3) Applicable provisions.--Paragraphs (3), (4), and (5) \n     of subsection (h) shall apply to obligations transferred \n     under this subsection.''.\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I offer this amendment to address \nmotorcycle safety on our roads. In 1995, Congress repealed the \nmotorcycle helmet law, which I authored in 1991. Since the law has been \nrepealed, motorcycle deaths have nearly doubled, and my amendment would \nsimply reinstate the helmet law.\n  Head injuries are one of the leading causes of death in motorcycle \ncrashes. Under my amendment, States that do not require motorcycle \nriders to wear helmets would have funds, but they would have them \nshifted to motorcycle safety programs.\n  Last month, the Department of Transportation released preliminary \nfindings that over 3,900 people were killed in motorcycle crashes last \nyear. This is almost double the number of motorcycle crash victims of \n10 years ago when the Federal helmet law was repealed.\n  If we look at the chart, we see what happened since 1996, the year of \noperation after the law was repealed. We had a much smaller number, and \nit grew on a regular pattern up to 2004, the last recorded year.\n  This is not just a matter of more riders on the roads. The rate of \ndeaths per mile traveled has almost doubled as well. We have learned an \nimportant lesson from this data: Helmets save lives. Repealing helmet \nlaws have led to more deaths.\n  By coincidence, I had a talk with one of our colleagues before when \nwe were voting on the previous amendment. He recalled for me the fact \nthat he had a motorcycle accident. During the time of the fall, he \nsaid, as he bounced around the pavement, he thanked the Lord that he \nwas wearing a helmet that had a face piece to it. It saved him from \nwhat they said would have been almost instant death.\n  Funny enough, when people look at me and they see the white hair, \nthey can't believe I am an expert skier, having done so for 59 years. I \nhave two children who are competitive skiers, one lives in Colorado, \nand I have a granddaughter who is on her way to becoming a competitive \nskier. We are skiers. Skiing is in our blood, and we ski fast and hard. \nI had a fall 2 years ago, 2 days after I bought a helmet. I hadn't worn \nit for the 50-some years before that. When I fell, I fell so hard I did \na tumblesalt in the air--and I'm not an acrobat--and I landed on my \nhead. I didn't realize, for a month, I was hurt, until my vision \nstarted to blur and my balance was unsteady. I was rushed to a \nhospital--I was with my wife in New York City--and the next day on an \noperating table and had what they call a hematoma. Doctors had to go on \ntwo sides of my head with\n\n[[Page S4916]]\n\na drill or whatever they use to get there and drain the fluid that had \ngathered. I thank God regularly that I am in the condition I am after \nthat kind of accident. But the difference was that helmet. I had the \nhelmet 2 days.\n  I went back to the ski shop, and I said: I thought this was supposed \nto prevent my getting hurt. He pointed to a tiny crack in the helmet, \nand he said to me: If you hadn't been wearing this helmet, that crack \nwould have been through your skull, and we would not have been here \ntalking about it. So I am a confirmed user of helmets.\n  I had been on the board of a hospital in New Jersey and worked very \nclosely with our principal medical school and its hospital. I talked to \nthe emergency room physicians. I know that much of the head and neck \ntrauma that comes about comes about as a result of motorcycle \naccidents.\n  A Transportation Department survey showed that from 2000 to 2002, \nhelmet use among motorcycle riders dropped from 71 percent to 58 \npercent nationally. They stopped using helmets, mostly.\n  The Transportation Department found that in those States where \nuniversal helmet laws had been repealed, helmet use plummeted from 99 \npercent to 50 percent. In other words, where helmet laws are on the \nbooks, almost every rider wears a helmet. Where there is no such law, \nonly about half of the riders are protected against head injury.\n  My amendment, to be simply understood, would reinstate the minimum \nsafety standard which first was enacted in 1991. This is not a matter \nof ideology or so-called States' rights. It's a matter of doing what is \nright. Helmets save lives. Universal helmet laws work.\n  No matter what some people might suggest, riding without a helmet is \nnot a victimless indiscretion. Motorcycle crashes burden our health \ncare system and the taxpayers unnecessarily. The Transportation \nDepartment estimates that unhelmeted riders involved in crashes cost \ntaxpayers $853 million in the year 2002 alone.\n  Riders without helmets are much more likely to suffer brain injuries, \nwhich obviously are often slow healing, with long-time hospitalization. \nIt costs twice as much to treat a patient who does have brain injuries.\n  I don't think taxpayers ought to be saddled with the costs of \nmotorcyclists who sustain serious injuries because they want to feel \nthe wind in their hair. I urge my colleagues to vote to help save the \nlives of so many of their constituents who are motorcycle enthusiasts. \nI once rode a motorcycle. In my earliest moments, I slipped and fell \nand picked gravel out of my legs for about 2 weeks thereafter. But we \ndon't want to stop the sport. We want to spare the families of the \nmotorcycle riders and their friends from needless loss and to spare \ntaxpayers from bearing the costs of risky behavior.\n  I want to read a comment that we received. It is by Joe A--to protect \nhis testimony. This is his testimonial to his NXT helmet.\n\n       On May 13th, 2004, I was riding my Harley through the small \n     college town of Newark, Delaware, when a distracted student \n     in the oncoming lane decided to make a left turn about 15 \n     feet in front of me. I was going about 25 miles per hour and \n     she appeared to be doing the same. In an instant, I collided \n     head on, flew off my bike and into her windshield.\n       I did a `head plant' which took out the windshield, rolled \n     me over the car and onto the roadway beside the car. This \n     left about a 4-inch gouge in my helmet but no serious head \n     injuries. The paramedics were amazed . . . that I was able to \n     carry on a lucid conversation with them. Thanks to your \n     superior product, I was able to walk out of the hospital \n     about an hour and a half later with no serious injuries.\n       My doctor told me that without my helmet I would have been \n     dead or had severe brain injury and it's an impressive fact \n     that I'm able to write this e-mail and send pictures three \n     days after the accident. I have no doubt that without your \n     helmet the outcome would have been very different for me.\n\n  Mr. President, it makes sense to do what we can to protect the \npublic. Again, this is not telling anybody that they should ride or \nshould not ride. We say, when you ride, don't spend my money, please. \nDon't burden the Medicare or health care insurance programs with your \nlingering injury or your death or other family problems. Don't burden \nus. You have no right to do that.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote for the amendment. It promotes the \nminimum safety standard for motorcycles, significant funding which can \nbe used for other health care essential studies on childhood diabetes, \nasthma, autism, and many other afflictions that wreak havoc on \nfamilies.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from New \nJersey for bringing his amendment to the Senate. We have been urging \nMembers to bring their amendments to the Senate. I thank him also for \nthe very thoughtful, sincere, and articulate way he expressed and \nexplained his amendment. I disagree, but I know he has strong feelings, \nand we are anxious to get a vote on his amendment.\n  It is my hope--and I know the ranking minority member, Senator \nJeffords, agrees--to get as many of these votes lined up for, perhaps, \nstacked votes. We do not have a time yet, but I assume that would be \nacceptable with the author of this amendment to stack these votes with \nperhaps some other amendments.\n  Currently, 21 States and the District of Columbia have helmet laws; \n26 States have limited helmet laws, including my State of Oklahoma. \nOurs are for 17 and under. Only four States, as I understand, have no \nhelmet requirement.\n  As recently as last year when we were discussing the highway bill, \nthe U.S. Department of Transportation released a statement in which \nthey said:\n\n       The administration opposes sanctions and withholding State \n     funds, both of which would jeopardize important State level \n     safety programs in infrastructure maintenance programs \n     already in place.\n\n  Let me share a personal experience. Many years ago, back in the \nmiddle 1960s, I believe 1967, my first year in the State legislature, \nmy first act in January of 1967, I came to Washington, DC, to testify \nbefore the Environment and Public Works Committee chaired at that time \nby Jennings Randolph of West Virginia. I was impressed with myself \ncoming up to testify before this lofty committee that I now chair.\n\n  I was protesting Lady Bird's Highway Beautification Act of 1965. The \nreason was it was withholding funds, our funds, in order to accomplish \na policy which we could agree or disagree on.\n  I have to admit to the Senator from New Jersey that I come from a \nlittle bit of a prejudiced perspective because I would be concerned \nabout mandates for quite some time.\n  The highway bill is important for addressing real transportation \ninfrastructure needs, but I question it is a place to spend a lot of \ntime for other policies.\n  I will share with the Senator from New Jersey a study done last year \nof the California Motorcycle Safety Program, designed by Dr. John \nBillheimer, completed in 1996, that found that rider training \ndramatically reduces accidents and thus eliminates injuries and \nfatalities. Specifically, the study stated:\n\n       An analysis of statewide accident trends shows that total \n     motorcycle accidents have dropped by 67 percent since the \n     introduction of the California Motorcycle Safety Program with \n     a drop of 88 percent among those under 18-year-old drivers.\n\n  There is much that can be done to dramatically reduce fatalities. I \ncan recall we were debating a motorcycle helmet law in the State senate \nmany years ago in the 1970s when testimony came forth that a helmet \nwill impair one's vision to some degree, that there are sometimes \naccidents that have occurred because of the restriction. I know there \nhave probably been studies on that, but it is something to be \nconsidered.\n  I fundamentally oppose this type of approach. I know consistency is \nnot always something we have in this Senate, but it is consistent with \nmy feelings over the last 30 years in addressing this type of \nsituation.\n  I believe the Senator from New Jersey has every right to get a vote \nto measure the Senate, so at the appropriate time it would be my \nintention to table the amendment, call for the yeas and nays, and stack \nthis with perhaps some of the other amendments, maybe the amendment of \nSenator Harkin,\n\n[[Page S4917]]\n\nwho is prepared to offer his amendment now.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I was heartened at the beginning of \nthe remarks by my colleague from Oklahoma and couldn't wait to hear the \nrest of it. Then I realized I could have waited.\n  My colleague is an adventurous fellow who sometimes flies airplanes \nwithout fuel. He is quite a daredevil. I support some of the enthusiasm \nhe has for a chance-taking. It is amazing I got as far as I did in \nlife, but here I am with a few broken things here and there.\n  In all seriousness, there is no transfer of funds; there is no loss \nof funds. Any money that is not used to promote helmet wearing is used \nfor motorcycle safety within that same State. I was pleased to hear \nthere is a way to protect lives besides using helmets. But when we saw \nwhat happened when the helmets came off, they were not blinded by any \nhelmet problems for the most part, they were just killed.\n  The United States DOT has a helmet design that will not impair vision \nbut will promote safety. That is the critical issue.\n  I hope between now and the time a vote occurs that the intelligent \nleader of the committee, who cares about people, will see a difference \nin view than that which was initially expressed.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, again, I am hoping that Senator Harkin is \non his way and is prepared to offer his amendment. I look forward to \nconsidering that.\n  In the meantime, let's keep in mind we now have a limited period of \ntime in which to work. The time is here. We are open for business. We \nwant to have the amendments sent to the Senate. We invite our Members \nto do so.\n  In the meantime, I will reconfirm and restate one of the reasons for \nthe urgency of this bill. Not only is this one of the largest bills of \nthe year, it is thought by many to be the most important bill we will \nconsider in that it is a matter of life and death.\n  We have core safety programs. If we were operating on an extension we \ndo not have in this bill, we will not have the core safety programs and \npeople will die. It is as simple as that, if we do not get this done.\n  Consequently, it is always worth repeating how important it is to get \nthe bill completed and what would happen if we do not. We are in our \nsixth extension. This extension expires May 31. On May 31, if we do not \nhave something in place, we have another extension. If we have an \nextension as opposed to a bill, there is not a chance to improve the \ndonor status. There are many States that are donor States, like my \nState of Oklahoma. Under this bill as it is now, the minimum donor \nState of 90.5 percent would be increased to 92 percent, which does not \nsound like a big increase, and is not as large as I would like, but it \nmeans hundreds of thousands of dollars to each State.\n  Without the bill, we will not have that. We will just have an \nextension of what we have today at 90.5 percent. We would have no new \nsafety core programs if we are not able to pass this bill.\n  Again, we have talked about the difficult job in putting together a \nfair formula. The fair formula is one that no one thinks is fair. \nPerhaps we have a fair formula as a result of that type of analysis. \nOne of the factors in the 20-some factors of a formula is the \nfatalities of the States. My State happens to be a high-fatality, per \ncapita State, so there is a consideration in the formula for that. If \nwe do not pass the bill, we will not have any of the safety programs.\n  Right now, we have some streamlining provisions that took us--and I \nam sure the distinguished ranking minority member, Senator Jeffords, \nwould agree with this--we spent 3 years coming up with what we can do \nto protect the environment and at the same time streamline the process \nof building roads so we do not come into delays that are costly delays \nand use up our mile dollars. We have done that. We have come to a lot \nof compromises.\n  It is kind of interesting, I think those of us on the committee, who \nall supported these streamlining provisions, did not really like the \nway they turned out. I thought they were not strict enough. Some \nthought they were too strict. Nonetheless, they are there. But if we do \nnot pass a bill, we do not have them, so they are still going to be \nstumbling along trying to build roads with all kinds of obstacles out \nthere that are obsolete.\n  If we do not pass a bill, we will not have the ability to use the \ninnovative financing that is given to the States. This bill, for \nexample, has recognized something that I believe is very important; \nthat is, we should expand the opportunity of the States to have more \nchances to get involved, more opportunities to use innovative financing \nmethods that may work. My State of Oklahoma is different from the State \nof Vermont, for example. What works in Vermont may not work in \nOklahoma. But we recognize that. This bill will allow the States to be \nable to start being creative in expanding their ability to pay for more \nroads in a way that is a custom that would be workable within their \nStates. That is a very important aspect of this legislation.\n  If we are operating on an extension and do not have a bill, we are \nnot going to have this program called the Safe Routes to School. The \nSafe Routes to School Program is one that is certainly supported \nstrongly by the Senator from Vermont, as well as many of the Members of \nthe other body. This is something that many people feel very strongly \nabout, that some people think is one of the most important parts of \nthis bill: the Safe Routes to Schools. This will save young lives in \nAmerica. If we do not pass this bill--and we are not going to pass it \nif we are working on an extension--young lives could very well be lost.\n  One of the biggest problems we are having right now--I know my State \nof Oklahoma is not a lot different from other States--is we are sitting \nback there with the department of transportation, we are sitting back \nthere with highway contractors who have the labor set up, all ready to \ngo to work, all ready to repair roads, to build roads, to build \nbridges, and there is no certainty. They do not know for sure we are \ngoing to pass a bill. If we do not pass a bill, we may be on a 1-month \nextension, we may be on a 2-week extension, we may be on a 1-year \nextension. There is no way we can plan ahead and get the most from our \ndollars if we do not have a bill. There would be 5 years remaining on \nthis bill for people to be able to plan for the future. So that \ncertainty is very important.\n  A lot of the States are border States. My State of Oklahoma is not a \nborder State, but a lot of them are. They have to deal with the NAFTA \ntraffic. This bill has a borders program as well as a corridors program \nbuilt into it to take into consideration some of the unique problems \nthat come with the expanded traffic from trade. If we do not pass a \nbill, we will not have any help for these people. If we do pass a bill, \nwe have provisions to be helpful to them.\n  The bill calls for a national commission to explore how to fund \ntransportation in the future. There are some ways, if you look way down \nthe road, maybe 5 years from now or 10 years from now, where maybe--\njust maybe--we can do something different for a change.\n  We have said several times here, and others have mentioned it, that \nthis interstate highway program initially came into being many years \nago, back in the 1950s, when Dwight Eisenhower was President of the \nUnited States. He observed during World War II, when he was General \nEisenhower, that he was not able to get the troops and supplies moved \naround the country, to get them in place, to be shipped over to fight \nour battles.\n  When he became President, what is the one thing everybody remembers \nabout Dwight Eisenhower? They remember the roads program, the highway \nprogram. It was funded in a way with taxes the same way we are funding \nit today. So we are talking about a half century, nearly, that we have \nbeen funding this program the same way. With this bill, we have \nestablished a commission that will look at new ways of partnering, new, \ncreative ways of funding roads.\n  I can tell you, many people have come to our committee--we have had \nhearings on this--and they have talked about how much better we can do \nit if we just have a chance to get away from this mold we have been \nliving in, the methods we are using and have been using for the last \nhalf century. If we just operate on an extension, we do not have a \nchance to do any of that.\n\n[[Page S4918]]\n\n  This bill is more than just a highway bill. We have talked about \nbridges and highways a lot. But this is an intermodal transportation \nbill. A lot of people do not realize it, but my State of Oklahoma is \nactually a navigable State in terms of barge traffic coming in and out \nof the State. We have chokepoints with regard to train travel, channel \ntravel, air travel. This bill addresses those chokepoints. At the \npresent time, without this bill, that is not going to happen.\n  Lastly, and this is probably the most important thing, the bill has \nfirewall protections to make sure people--I have always thought of this \nas a moral issue. If somebody is driving up to the pump and he or she \npays that tax, I never hear anyone complaining about the high taxes on \nmotor fuel because they recognize and believe all that money is going \nto go to road improvement, to new roads and new bridges. But, in fact, \nthat is not the case because, like any trust fund, the propensity of \npeople in elected positions--whether it is State or Federal--to spend \nthe taxpayers' money is insatiable. They will go and rob these trust \nfunds, whether it is the Social Security trust fund, the highway trust \nfund, or any of the other trust funds we have, and put it in other \nprograms. It is when nobody is looking. Well, we have firewalls in this \nbill that would preclude that from happening.\n  One of the things I liked about the bill we had last year was that we \nchanged all those provisions where they had been using trust fund money \nto support policies that have nothing to do with transportation. We \nare, to a great extent, going to be doing that with this bill, too.\n  So the urgency of passing this bill is upon us. We have to do it this \nweek. It would be Monday at the latest, but this week, I would say, in \norder to get it to conference, come back from conference, have the \nconference report adopted in both the House and the Senate, and then \nsigned by the President. We can do that if we move expeditiously now, \nbut if we do not, it is not going to happen. We have a May 31 deadline. \nWhat is today? May 11. Today is May 11. So we have 20 more days to get \nthis all the way out of the Senate, into conference--of course, the \nHouse has already passed the bill, so they are waiting for us now--have \nit considered in conference, and then have it sent back here. That is \nnot much time.\n\n  Things do not happen very quickly around here. But I know Senator \nJeffords and I will do everything that is necessary in that conference \nto make sure we come out with a good bill, get that bill back here, \npassed the House, passed the Senate, and to the President's desk, to \nhave a highway bill. If we do not do it, none of these 10 things I \nmentioned are going to happen--none of them.\n  There may be parts of the bill you don't like. There are parts of the \nbill I do not like. But I hope people realize that just operating on an \nextension, after we are on our sixth extension now, is no way to do \nbusiness. We are here to do a better job for the American people.\n  Hopefully, some people will be coming down to the Chamber.\n  I yield the floor to Senator Jeffords.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coburn). The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I thank again Senator Inhofe and Senator \nBond for their leadership on this bill. I am glad to be here on the \nSenate floor continuing to debate this important legislation.\n  This managers' package we have before us today will increase the \nfunding in our legislation $11.2 billion and ensures that all States \nwill have the resources necessary to improve their highways, roads, and \nbridges.\n  This package will be the catalyst that helps get this bill completed \nthe way it I should be--fully funded. I sincerely thank Senators \nGrassley and Baucus for their tremendous efforts in crafting the \nfinance title of this proposal.\n  This package will create jobs. It will save lives. It will reduce \ntravel time. And it will improve the quality and structure of our \nNation's surface transportation system.\n  Just this week, the Texas Transportation Institute at Texas A \nUniversity released its annual Urban Mobility Report. This highly \nrespected report once again tells us we need to do better when it comes \nto transportation in this country. The report tells us that traffic \ncongestion delayed travelers 79 million more hours--79 million more \nhours--and wasted 69 million more gallons of fuel in 2003 than in 2002.\n  The report tells us that overall in 2003, there were 3.7 billion \nhours of travel delay and 2.3 billion gallons of wasted fuel, for a \ntotal cost of more than $63 billion. But this bill is about more than \nreducing traffic congestion. The U.S. Bureau of Transportation \nStatistics says there are approximately 45,500 transportation-related \nfatalities per year, 94 percent of which occur on highways. That is \nbecause over a quarter of our interstates remain in poor or mediocre \ncondition. Fourteen percent of our bridges are structurally obsolete. \nThis is unacceptable. Something must be done.\n  That is what we are trying to do here today. We have worked very \ndiligently to reach a compromise that will move us forward in safety, \ncommerce, environmental protection, and congestion reduction.\n  I encourage all Senators to come to the floor and offer their \namendments sooner rather than later. Let's get this bill done so our \nStates can get started with their critical work. Let's get this bill \ndone this week so we can move it to conference with the House as soon \nas possible.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Vermont for his \nexcellent statement. I agree with all of it.\n  I see the Senator from New Jersey is not in the Chamber, but let me \nmake one comment. When I was talking about the withholding of funds and \nthe Federal mandates, he is accurate in the fact that funds would not \nbe withheld. It would mandate that 3 percent of the money of the \nportion of funds that would go to his State would be taken from the \nsurface transportation program, the National Highway System, and the \ninterstate maintenance programs. That is the problem I have. In a way \nthat is withholding money. That is a mandate that is backed up by \nwithholding funds.\n  It is my understanding we have two Members who are due to bring their \namendments. We encourage them to come.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 652 to Amendment No. 605\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I have an amendment I would like to have \nconsidered. My amendment is No. 652, which I have filed and is at the \ndesk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending amendment is temporarily laid \naside.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from North Dakota [Mr. Dorgan] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 652.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To provide for the conduct of an investigation to determine \n whether market manipulation is contributing to higher gasoline prices)\n\n       At the end of chapter 3 of subtitle E of title I, add the \n     following:\n\n     SEC. 15__. INVESTIGATION OF GASOLINE PRICES.\n\n       (a) In General.--Not later than 90 days after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Federal Trade Commission shall \n     conduct an investigation to determine if the price of \n     gasoline is being artificially manipulated by reducing \n     refinery capacity or by any other form of market \n     manipulation.\n       (b) Report.--On completion of the investigation under \n     subsection (a), the Federal Trade Commission shall submit to \n     Congress a report that describes--\n       (1) the results of the investigation; and\n       (2) any recommendations of the Federal Trade Commission.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, first, we are deliberating in the Senate \nabout\n\n[[Page S4919]]\n\na highway bill. I appreciate the work the chairman of the committee and \nranking member have done on this piece of legislation. It has been a \nlong and tortured process to get this piece of legislation to the floor \nof the Senate. While I may not agree with every single line in the \nbill, I admire their work. I think their work is commendable, and it \nwill advance this country's interests. For that reason, I intend to \nsupport the legislation.\n  I think with respect to this country's future, its economy, future \nopportunities in expanding our economy, there is nothing that more \nquickly expands the country's economy or more quickly provides \nopportunity all across this country than the investment Congress makes \nin a program that provides for highway and bridge construction and road \nmaintenance and repair. It is a sure way to put people to work \nimmediately all across this country.\n  This highway bill has been long delayed, but now while it is on the \nfloor, I also want to not only commend the committee for its work, I \nwant to offer an amendment that deals with something that relates to \nit.\n  Let me discuss briefly the amendment and then describe why I want \nthis amendment considered on this bill. My amendment simply deals with \nthe price of gasoline and asks the FTC to, within 90 days of the \nlegislation being enacted, conduct an investigation of gasoline prices \nin this country. Let me describe a bit of the background for this. I \ndon't allege there is corruption, price fixing, or collusion. What I do \nknow is this: When big companies get bigger and more companies become \nfewer companies, there is a capability to influence the marketplace in \na significant way. I chaired the hearings in the Senate that \ninvestigated the Enron situation. Now, having sat in the chair \ninvestigating what Enron did with respect, not to gasoline, but with \nrespect to electricity sales on the west coast, the creation of \nstrategies called Death Star, Fat Boy, Get Shorty--all of which were \nstrategies to literally steal from the pockets of people living on the \nwest coast. They bilked people out of billions of dollars by \nmanipulating and overpricing with respect to the electricity market. We \nknow that now and we also know that some executives from that company \nare on trial, about to go on trial, or have finished their trials, and \nsome have been sentenced to 10 years of hard tennis at a minimum \nsecurity prison. Others will get a stiffer penalty. It was wholesale \nstealing from the American people. Why? One, because they could; and, \ntwo, because there are people who are corrupt in their hearts engaging \nin these practices.\n  I don't allege the same exists with oil. I don't have any idea with \nrespect to oil and the price of gasoline. I understand that the \ncircumstances with oil are complicated. Sixty percent of the oil we use \nin this country--incidentally, the increased usage substantially is for \ntransportation--comes from off our shore. The pricing for oil coming \nfrom the spot market relates to supply and demand, I am sure, but the \nsupply largely comes from Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Kuwait, Venezuela, and \nothers. Now, we are really fooling ourselves if we think it is not \nholding America hostage and our economic future hostage with 60 percent \nof our oil coming from off our shores and most of it coming from \ntroubled parts of the world.\n  If, God forbid, terrorists should interrupt the flow of oil into this \ncountry tomorrow night, our economy would be belly up very quickly. So \nthat calls for and begs for a new energy policy, instead of simply \nsaying that our exclusive energy policy is digging and drilling, which \nwe must do; but if that is our exclusive policy, that is a ``yesterday \nforever'' policy. We need a new energy policy on the floor of the \nSenate.\n  I also think even as all of these events are occurring--the price of \noil increasing, the spot market showing the price of oil is $50 or $52 \nor $55 a barrel, and the price of gasoline is increasing at the pumps, \nand you drive up to a gas pump someplace and somebody is driving a \n6,500- or 7,000-pound car, perhaps a humvee, and you wonder a little \nbit about how all this works. When I drive up next to a humvee and \neverybody has a right to drive a humvee I think of the Latin term, \n``totus porcus.'' I am not sure why I think of that. When somebody sits \nthere with a 7,000-pound vehicle, with one person in the vehicle going \nto work, you wonder about that. The marketplace probably takes care of \nsome of that, although somebody who is going to buy a humvee probably \ndoesn't care much about the price of gasoline.\n\n  The price of gasoline is an interesting phenomenon in our country. As \nthe price of oil goes up, and we hear about it on the news, all of a \nsudden, that day or the next day the price of gasoline goes up with a \nblink of an eye, following the price of oil. Then the price of oil \ncomes down a bit, and the price of gasoline doesn't move down with \nquite the same rapidity. Something interesting is going on. I would \nlike to discuss a bit of it.\n  Since 1990, the number of major oil and gas companies has gone from \n34 to 13. The number of refining companies has gone from 13 to 7. The \nother day, I noticed that while we have very high prices for oil and \ngasoline, Exxon Oil had the highest profit ever for a corporation--\nrecord profits. So I am asking myself the question: Why should an oil \ncompany have record profits just because the price of oil is high and \nthe price of gasoline is higher? Has the margin between those two \nprices changed with respect to those that are delivering it? The answer \ncomes in the evaluation of what has happened to total revenues and to \nnet income for the major oil companies. As we have gone from more to \nfewer oil companies, what we see is now, with the price of oil and \ngasoline in many cases at near record levels, so, too, are the profits \nof the oil companies. There have been profit increases year to year of \n108 percent, 79 percent, 101 percent, 152 percent, 1,000 percent, 400 \npercent--these are the major oil companies and the increase in their \nprofits from 2003 to 2004.\n  Question: Given what we know about what has happened in some areas \nand in some industries with respect to manipulation of supply and \ndemand and manipulation of prices, should we not have aggressive \noversight and investigation to make sure the consumer is protected? I \ndon't have the information to come to the floor to say there is \nsomething fundamentally wrong in the pricing strategy, but there are \nsome indications, it seems to me, that some enterprises that have now \nmerged successfully and become larger and stronger and have better \ncapability to be involved in affecting the market in a more deliberate \nway are increasing their profits because they can, not because there is \naggressive and robust competition, but because they have the economic \nclout to do it.\n  I am wondering if on behalf of the American consumers we ought not \nhave aggressive oversight and aggressive investigation.\n  Now, we have seen activities from very large oil companies in the \nCongress. The House of Representatives, by the way, just passed an \nenergy bill saying we need more incentives for these energy companies \nto be exploring for more oil and natural gas, at a time when the oil \nprices are at a record high. Even the President says that doesn't make \nany sense at all. It is interesting while they are wanting more tax \nincentives to explore for more oil, they are busy buying up stock with \nextra profits. That is what they are doing: they are not putting those \nprofits in the ground. I find that interesting as well.\n  I think the FTC is the appropriate agency to investigate gas prices. \nI think, on behalf of American consumers, we ought to take a hard look \nat it, and the FTC is the place to do it. I pulled up at a four-way \nstop sign near Mohall, ND, one day, and there was an old car in front \nof me, and it was well used and well worn, with the back bumper kind of \naskew and not much of a paint job left. It had four or five people in \nit, and it was belching smoke out of the back end. They had a plain, \nsimple little bumper sticker. The bumper sticker from this old wreck of \na car that is now stopped at a four-way stop said: We fought the gas \nwar and gas won.\n\n  Well, the message from that old car, ``gas won,'' is a message I \nthink everybody understands. We are talking about a big industry that \nhas consolidated and merged so that there are far fewer companies, with \nmuch greater market clout, and I think we need substantial oversight. \nThe basic consumer protection statute enforced by the Federal Trade \nCommission is in section 5(a) of the Federal Trade Commission\n\n[[Page S4920]]\n\nAct. It provides that unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or \naffecting commerce are declared unlawful. Unfair practices are defined \nto mean those that:\n\n     cause or are likely to cause substantial injury to consumers \n     which is not reasonably avoidable by consumers themselves and \n     not outweighed by countervailing benefits to consumers or to \n     competition.\n\n  In the State of North Dakota, a State I represent in the Senate, we \nactually drive a lot because we are a State that is 10 times the size \nof the State of Massachusetts. We have 642,000 citizens and we drive a \nlot. In fact, it is interesting; we drive almost twice as much per \nperson as they do in New York. The average North Dakotan drives twice \nas much per person per year as a New Yorker, which means of course the \nburden of the gas tax itself is twice as high, but that is all right. \nWe understand that. We like where we live. North Dakota is a wonderful \nState. But because gasoline is a significant issue for us and the price \nof gasoline is important for people who drive as much as we do, it is \nvery important to us that we see that these prices are fair.\n  It is hard for me to understand how at a time when the oil prices \nhave spiked and gasoline prices have risen substantially, how the \nprofit margin has increased so dramatically for the oil companies \nthemselves if in fact this is a competitive market. If it is not a \ncompetitive market, then I think there needs to be substantial \ninvestigation to see whether the consumers are being gouged.\n  Let me say again when I chaired the hearings about the manipulation \nof the market and the grand theft that occurred with the Enron \nCorporation bilking billions of dollars from consumers on the west \ncoast, California, Oregon, Washington, and so on, it was unbelievable \nto see what those companies did because they could. They had larceny in \ntheir heart and they decided to profit to the tune of billions of \ndollars by literally stealing from consumers. As I have said before, I \nam not alleging that is happening here. I do not have the foggiest idea \nwhat the mechanics are for the pricing strategies or what has led to \nrecord profits for the oil companies.\n  All I know is the oil companies are bigger. They have more muscle. \nThey have more capability to affect the marketplace, and I believe when \nthere are fewer competitors and less competition, there is a \nresponsibility on behalf of consumers to ask for a referee to look over \ntheir shoulder and see that everything is all right.\n  I only wish we had done that earlier in the Congress when it was \nquite clear that the wholesale prices for electricity charged by Enron \nand others in the west coast marketplace--I only wish we had been more \naggressive and we had demanded the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission \nand others to be in there up to their neck in investigating what was \ngoing on, but the Congress was late. The Federal Energy Regulatory \nCommission was asleep from the neck up. As a result, there was grand \ntheft on the west coast from those markets, particularly by the Enron \nCorporation. Let us not let that happen with other industries.\n  Again, I do not allege that is the case here. I do not have the \nfoggiest idea what the ingredients are of these pricing strategies, but \nI would like the Federal Trade Commission, on behalf of the American \npeople, to take a good hard look. So my amendment would provide that be \nthe case 90 days following the enactment of this legislation, and we \nwould then have the benefit of a formal Federal Trade Commission study \nof gasoline pricing.\n  I think on behalf of the American people, given this time, given \nthese circumstances, we ought to expect that and demand that and that \nis what I do in this amendment.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. We are encouraging Members to come to the floor. The \nSenator from Iowa is prepared to offer an amendment, and another behind \nhim. I am hoping we will be able to get these amendments so we can \nperhaps have some stacked votes tonight--maybe 6 o'clock or so--\nwhenever the leadership on both sides agrees that is the appropriate \ntime.\n  I will state again how significant it is we pass this bill. It will \nbe very costly in terms of dollars if we do not get it completed. There \nare a lot of programs incorporated in this lengthy bill that I do not \nagree with and we debated them for 3 years. I had to lose some and I \nwon some.\n  This is one I don't think there is one member of the committee I \nchair of 10 Republicans and 8 Democrats who will say they got \neverything they wanted. Maybe that is a sign that we did a pretty fair \njob. We need to have the bill passed.\n  We need to do what we can to avoid another extension. An extension \ncauses all of the 10 problems I outlined a few minutes ago. There is a \nclear right and wrong in this case. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, we do have at least one amendment, the \nLautenberg amendment, that is ready for a vote. It might be that the \nHarkin amendment will be ready for a vote also, if the Senator can get \nready in the next 30 minutes. I announce it is our intention to have a \nvote at 5:30, and there will be either one or two or even three votes, \ndepending on what comes down between now and 5:30.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 618 to Amendment No. 605\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside the \npending amendment, and I call up amendment No. 618 and ask for its \nimmediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Iowa [Mr. Harkin], for himself, Mr. \n     Kennedy, Mr. Obama, and Mr. Carper, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 618.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, the amendment I am offering, on behalf of \nSenators Kennedy, Obama, Carper, and myself, calls for several simple \nadjustments to current practices at the Federal, State, and local \nlevel. The costs are minor, but the impact on safety for those who walk \nand ride bikes would be large. With the safety improvements that could \nresult from this amendment, I believe we could increase pedestrian and \nbike traffic, and we could increase exercise to the benefit of \nAmerican's health. We can reduce traffic congestion, and we can provide \nfor safer travel for those who want to walk or ride a bike.\n  At the outset, I want to acknowledge that there are funds in the bill \nfor increased bike paths and trails. We have kept the enhancement \nmoney. That is all well and good. I don't know the exact amount of \nmoney, but there is a quite a bit involved. The problem is there is \nnothing in current practice that requires State departments of \ntransportation or metropolitan planning organizations to integrate in \ntheir planning upfront for bike paths and sidewalks when they are \nplanning highways. Again, I think a lot of the good money for bike \npaths and trails will be used to redo and retrofit what they should \nhave done in the first place. That is what we always seem to be doing--\nwe'll fix it up and add something later on. That always costs more \nmoney.\n  What this amendment does is it says: Let's have them at the initial \nplanning stage integrate into their planning sidewalks and bike paths.\n  The fact is, our current transportation system has been engineered in \na way that is, in many cases, unfriendly and often very dangerous to \nnonmotorized travel. Again, my amendment promotes Federal, State, and \nlocal actions to make walking and biking safer and to increase the \ntotal number of walking and bicycling trips.\n  Specifically, the amendment requires each State to adopt a ``complete \nstreets'' policy to accommodate bicyclists and pedestrians by ensuring \nthat all users are considered when communities are built or modernized. \nWhile studies show that Americans would like to bike and walk more, \nmany roads do not have sidewalks or bike paths, making them dangerous \nfor pedestrians and bike riders. In many cases, traffic lights do not \nallow enough time for the elderly or people with disabilities or \nchildren to safely cross busy intersections. Meanwhile, we are \nconstructing new housing developments without sidewalks. Go out and \ntake a look at some of the new housing developments being added in any \nState. A lot of times there is not even a sidewalk. How can you ask \nkids to walk to school if they don't have a sidewalk?\n  My wife and I get up every morning. We have a mile route that we \nwalk. We have sidewalks for part of the way, and there aren't any \nsidewalks for the rest of the way. Again, it is about getting this \nintegrated in the initial planning.\n  While studies show that Americans would like to bike and walk more, \nmany roads don't have sidewalks or bike paths. It is dangerous for \npedestrians. We are building roads without bike lanes. Quite frankly, \nwe are heading in the wrong direction. Quite frankly, to promote more \nhealthy living, we must promote people walking or biking more. I will \nhave more to say about that in a minute.\n  Experts I talk to tell me that even a modest increase in pedestrian \nand bike traffic will get some cars off the road. That can have a \nsignificant positive impact on traffic congestion and gridlock. \nResearch shows that often a surprisingly small increase in the number \nof cars can make the difference between a smooth flow of vehicles and a \ntime-wasting traffic jam.\n  According to the U.S. Department of Transportation, the number of \ntrips that are taken that are 1 mile or less is about one out of four. \nIn other words, about 25 percent of all trips taken are 1 mile or less. \nNearly half of all the trips taken in this country are under 5 miles. \nSo it wouldn't take a huge shift to have an effect on traffic \ncongestion. The path to safer travel on foot or by bike is also the \npath to a smarter, healthier, more efficient vehicle transportation \nsystem.\n  Each of the provisions in my amendment is intended to help us move \nforward toward safer travel for people in vehicles, pedestrians, for \npeople who use bikes or people who use wheelchairs, or for people \nsimply trying to cross a road safely in a neighborhood.\n  When we debate the highway bill, we typically talk about the Nation's \ninfrastructure deficit, about jobs and economic competitiveness, the \nmovement of goods, and other broader transportation goals. But we \nneglect other matters that are of real concern to people all across \nAmerica in terms of transportation. For example, what are we doing to \nimprove the safety of pedestrians and bicyclists?\n  In the Washington, DC, area we have recently experienced a rash of \npedestrian fatalities. All across the country\n\n[[Page S4922]]\n\nbicyclists put their lives at risk on roads that make no accommodation \nfor nonmotorized traffic. No one denies that over the years we have \nbuilt a transportation system that neglects and endangers nonmotorized \ntravel. Again, this costs us dearly in terms of needless loss of life \nor permanent disabilities caused by accidents.\n  It also has other consequences. When we give people no alternative to \nusing their cars, they use their cars. So we add more and more vehicles \nto our roads and highways, 25 percent of which are used for trips of \nless than a mile. This translates into traffic delays, congestion, \noften gridlock. We simply must give more attention to the safety of \npedestrians and those who use bicycles or who walk or who use \nwheelchairs.\n  It is pretty shocking when we look at the statistics. Our Federal \nsystem for tracking fatalities, known as FARS, tells us that during the \ndecade from 1994 to 2003, nearly 52,000 pedestrians were killed in \ntraffic accidents in the United States. During the same 10-year period, \nmore than 7,400 bicyclists were killed. Though the data is less \nreliable with regard to injuries, we know the number of nonfatal \ninjuries ran into the hundreds of thousands during that same 10-year \nperiod.\n  In 2003, the most recent year for which we have data, nearly 5,000 \npedestrians and more than 600 bicyclists were killed in the U.S., \nagain, with many more thousands injured. Fully 13 percent of all \ntransportation fatalities are pedestrians and bicyclists--13 percent. \nThat is a rate far in excess of the share of trips taken by pedestrians \nand bicyclists. The bottom line is it is disproportionately dangerous \nto be a pedestrian or bicyclist in the U.S. This is one big reason why \npeople are opting not to walk or ride a bicycle. Instead, they are \ngetting in their cars and they are contributing to traffic jams. Again, \nabout 25 percent are going less than a mile, and over half of the time \nthey are going less than 5 miles.\n  The journey to work data in the 2000 census tells a dismal story. \nCompared to 1990, despite a big increase in population, the number of \npeople who walked to work fell by almost three-quarters of a million--\n727,000, to be exact. In 1990, 3.9 percent of Americans walked to work. \nTen years later, in 2000, that had fallen to 2.9 percent--a 25-percent \ndecline in the number of Americans who walk to work, in a 10-year \nperiod of time.\n  These various statistics tell us that many fatalities and injuries to \npedestrians and bicyclists are preventable if we make the safety of \nnonmotorized travel a higher priority, and that is exactly what my \namendment is intended to do, to put it into the planning stage and make \nit a higher priority. This amendment, I guess you could say, is also \ndesigned to significantly reduce the number of car trips taken.\n  As I said, consider that trips of a mile or less represent the \nhighest share of all car trips we make every day--a quarter of all of \nthose trips. This means there is a huge, untapped potential to shift a \nsignificant portion of these short-distance trips to foot or bicycle, \nif we make some modest adjustments and if we step up our focus on \nsafety.\n  A 2003 transportation research board study showed that residents of \nneighborhoods with sidewalks were 65 percent more likely to walk than \nresidents of neighborhoods without sidewalks. That kind of makes sense. \nAs I said, my wife and I take a mile walk in the morning, and we have \nsidewalks part of the way, and part of the way we are out in the \nstreet. Fortunately, there is not a lot of traffic at that time. More \nthan once, we have been walking down the street where there are no \nsidewalks and you don't hear a car coming and they slip by you. I have \noften thought what if I happen to step one way or the other while \nwalking and do not hear that car coming. That is why people don't walk \nmore.\n  A study in Toronto documented a 23-percent increase in bicycle \ntraffic after the installation of a bicycle lane. Think about that. \nThey put in a bicycle lane and there was a 23-percent increase in \nbicycle traffic because people are more safe. They can travel on a \nbicycle and know they are not going to get hit. As a Senator who is a \nchief sponsor of the Americans with Disabilities Act, which we passed \n15 years ago, I can testify that stepped-up attention to pedestrian \nimprovement and access will be enormously beneficial to people with \ndisabilities and also to our growing population of seniors.\n  Right now, about 85 percent of bus and rail users get to the bus \nstops and subway stations on foot. Many are people with disabilities. \nAnd seniors have no choice but to rely on costly paratransit services; \nthey cost a lot of money. A lot of times we pay for it out of taxpayer \ndollars. We can reduce those costs by building new walkways and \nimproving the existing walkways.\n  I have something here that was put out by the National Association of \nCounty and City Health Officials called Public Health and Land Use \nPlanning and Community Design.\n  It says here that a Texas study--that is the State I referred to \nearlier--found that for three out of five disabled and elderly people, \nthere are no sidewalks between their homes and the closest bus stop. I \nwill repeat that. A Texas study found that for three out of five \ndisabled and elderly people, there are no sidewalks between their homes \nand the closest bus stop.\n  One of the reasons we passed the Americans with Disabilities Act was \nso more people with disabilities would get into the workforce. More \noften than not, they rely on a bus to get there. How are they going to \nget to the bus stop if they don't have a sidewalk on which to even get \nto the bus stop?\n  Over 55 percent of all pedestrian deaths occur in neighborhoods that \nare often designed with no sidewalks or otherwise inadequate pedestrian \naccommodations. So, again, in terms of helping people with disabilities \nmake sure they can get to a job, or get to shopping, or whatever they \nneed to do, they rely upon transit services, buses. But if they cannot \neven get to the bus stop, what good is it?\n  Over the last two generations, we have seen dramatic changes in how \nchildren go to school. As recently as 30 years ago, up to 70 percent of \nchildren were walking or riding bikes to school. Outside of every \nschool you would see bicycle racks loaded with dozens of bikes. Not \nanymore. Today, nearly 90 percent of our kids are traveling to school \nin vehicles, mostly buses. But if you checked the high school parking \nlots, you know it is cars, too. In addition, a growing number of \nparents are driving their kids to school, putting further stress on the \nroadways during the morning rush hour. Again, the logical alternative \nis to provide safe, convenient options to encourage children to walk or \nbike to school.\n  I was saying earlier to Senators on the floor, I remember my own two \ndaughters, when they went to public school out in Virginia. We live \nabout a mile from school. Well, there was a sidewalk about a third of \nthe way, and about two-thirds of the way there was no sidewalk. It was \na busy thoroughfare. How are you going to let them bike? You are not \ngoing to let them walk. So they got a car to drive a mile. I would not \nlet our kids walk on that street and neither would our neighbors. \nAgain, they will come along later and retrofit a sidewalk and that will \ncost more money, or they will put in a bike path later. Why don't we do \nit up front, get the planning done up front?\n  That is what this amendment is all about. Our focus in a \ntransportation bill, I believe, should not strictly be on moving \nvehicles. We should be more broadly focused on moving people and making \nit possible for more people to move themselves by foot or by bicycle. \nFor every American who opts to get to work, school, or the grocery \nstore by foot or bicycle, that is less costs for road building and \nmaintenance, zero contribution to traffic congestion, zero costs in \nterms of pollution and environmental degradation. Every walking and \nbicycle trip that substitutes for a car trip, especially during rush \nhour, makes a big difference.\n  In local situations, where we can encourage hundreds or thousands of \npeople to shift to walking and bicycling, this can have a dramatically \npositive impact on the transportation system.\n  So improving and expanding sidewalks and bike paths is not only about \nsafety, it is about maximizing the performance of our transportation \nsystems. Again, the good news is, to make a positive difference, large \nnumbers of vehicles do not need to be moved off a congested roadway. \nJust some of them need to be moved. It is the incremental user that \nspells the difference between\n\n[[Page S4923]]\n\nfree-flowing traffic and time-wasting congestion, and that is why any \nthoughtful, effective transportation policy for this Nation must aim \nfor at least modest gains in walking and bicycling.\n  So again I have talked about how, by investing in sidewalks and bike \npaths, we can reduce the stresses on our transportation system. I have \nalso talked about how this can improve safety for pedestrians and \nbikers. There is one other huge benefit that, by itself, would justify \npassing this amendment. Simply put, by encouraging more Americans to \nspend more time walking and biking, we can have a major positive impact \non their health and their wellness. We can reduce the incidence of \nobesity and chronic diseases. This, in turn, will lead to savings in \nhealth care costs, including Medicare and Medicaid.\n  Ninety million people in the United States are living with chronic \ndiseases, and many of these can be prevented through changes in \nlifestyle--for example, by eating nutritious foods and getting plenty \nof physical exercise. I wish to stress, physical exercise. When all is \nsaid and done, aside from tobacco use and genetic predisposition, there \nare essentially two things that lead to chronic disease: Poor nutrition \nand lack of physical activity. They also contribute to being overweight \nand obese.\n  So we need to be doing everything possible to encourage Americans to \nengage in more walking and bicycling. We can begin by making it \npossible for more young people to walk or to bike to school.\n  Currently, only 8 percent of elementary schools and 6 percent of high \nschools provide daily physical education year round for all students. \nMore than one-third of youngsters in grades 9 to 12 do not engage \nregularly in vigorous physical activity. No wonder we have an epidemic \nof childhood obesity. No wonder that American adolescents rank as the \nmost overweight in the industrialized world.\n  And the picture is just as bleak for adults. Almost 40 percent of \nAmerican adults are sedentary. In the United States, only six percent \nof trips are by walking or biking, compared to 49 percent of trips in \nSweden and 54 percent of trips in Italy.\n  Research shows that the amount of time people spend in their cars \ncorrelates more strongly with overweight and obesity than income, \neducation, gender, or ethnicity.\n  One remarkable study compared the health of people living in walking-\nand-biking-friendly cities with the health of people living in \nsprawling, car-dependent suburbs. The study, published in 2003 in the \nAmerican Journal of Health Promotion, found that people living in \ncounties marked by sprawling development are likely to walk less and \nweigh more than people who live in less sprawling counties. In \naddition, people living in more sprawling counties are more likely to \nsuffer from high blood pressure. These results hold true after \ncontrolling for factors such as age, education, gender, and race and \nethnicity.\n  One does not need a Harvard study to establish another correlation: \nThe correlation between the decline in physical activity and \nskyrocketing health-care, Medicaid, and Medicare costs. We build \nsubdivisions without sidewalks, schools without playgrounds, and cities \nwithout bike lanes, and then we wring our hands about rising rates of \noverweight, obesity, and chronic disease. We systematically neglect \nwellness, fitness, and common-sense disease prevention and we are \nshocked, shocked that health care costs are ravaging Federal, State, \nand corporate budgets.\n  Someone once defined insanity as doing the same old thing over and \nover again and expecting a different result. Well, our current health \ncare approach is, by definition, insane. In fact, in America, today, we \ndon't have a true health care system, we have a sick care system. If \nyou are sick, you get care. We continue to spend hundreds of billions \non pills, surgery, treatments, and disability. But we are under-\nfunding, cutting or eliminating programs designed to keep people fit \nand well and out of the hospital.\n  We cannot go on like this. We are choking our economy. We are \nexploding the Federal budget. And we are, literally, killing ourselves.\n  Consider the obesity epidemic. Some 65 percent of our population is \nnow overweight or obese. The incidence of childhood obesity is now at \nepidemic levels. Alarm bells are going off all over the place. But our \nGovernment has done virtually nothing.\n  And the Federal budget is being eaten alive by health care costs. It \nis also State budgets. It is family budgets. And it is corporate \nbudgets.\n  Look at the numbers. Last year, nationally, we spent more than $100 \nbillion on obesity alone. Medicare and Medicaid picked up almost half \nof that tab.\n  This is unwise. It is uneconomic. And, as we now know, it is totally \nunsustainable. If we are going to control Medicare and Medicaid costs, \nand private-sector health care costs, as well, we need a radical change \nof course. We need a fundamental paradigm shift toward preventing \ndisease, promoting good nutrition, and encouraging fitness and \nwellness. This will be good for the physical health of the American \npeople. And it will be good for the fiscal health of Government, \ncorporate, and family budgets.\n\n  That is exactly what this amendment is about. Yes, this amendment is \na step towards reducing the burdens and stresses on our transportation \nsystem. It will improve safety for pedestrians and bikers. By \nencouraging walking and bicycling, it will also have significant health \nbenefits. And, as a consequence, it will help to hold down health care \ncosts and reduce the burden on Medicare and Medicaid.\n  Now let me explain the specific ways that my amendment will help us \nto capitalize on these opportunities.\n  My amendment asks the Secretary of Transportation to report to \nCongress each year as to how the Federal research dollars provided in \nthis legislation are advancing progress on safety and other issues \nrelated to walking and bicycling.\n  It also asks the Secretary to establish goals for increasing walking \nand bicycling, and to set milestones toward achieving these goals.\n  Looking into the future, it asks each State department of \ntransportation to have a policy statement on ``complete streets,'' so \nthat when they undertake projects funded under this highway bill, some \nconsideration must be given to the needs of non-motorized users.\n  Larger metropolitan planning organizations--that is, regional \ntransportation agencies serving 200,000 or more people--can choose to \nadopt a ``complete streets'' policy or satisfy certain criteria in \ntheir planning process. And these agencies must show how their long-\nrange plans and transportation improvement programs will increase \nwalking and bicycling. It does not require that sidewalks or bikeways \nbe built along side rural roads or intercity roads.\n  Finally, under my amendment, these large metropolitan planning \norganizations, or MPOs, are encouraged to work with their local \ngovernments on improvements designed to increase biking and walking. In \naddition, the MPOs would be directed to designate a bicycle and \npedestrian coordinator, a move that would be in line with a requirement \nplaced on state transportation departments dating back to the 1991 \nISTEA law.\n  Each of these provisions is designed to better align our current law \npractices with key features of the bill before us.\n  In the SAFETEA bill, the committee has provided for important \nfinancial commitments to bikes and trails. But we need to fully \nintegrate the needs of pedestrians and bicyclists into the complete \ntransportation process.\n  There are also provisions in my amendment regarding how we conduct \nFederal research activities. This is designed to expand our knowledge \nof effective pedestrian and bicycle safety practices, and to help our \nState and local partners understand the best methods and practices for \naddressing these safety needs.\n  Provisions in this ``Complete Streets'' amendment will help us to \nensure that we are designing transportation projects, up front, with \npedestrian and bicycle safety in mind, so we don't have to keep going \nback and retrofitting. So many of the programs in the SAFETEA bill \ninvolve re-doing and retrofitting what we didn't do right in the first \nplace. In the future, as each State adopts a ``Complete Streets'' \npolicy, this can be avoided.\n  Finally, this amendment attempts to set modest goals for increasing \nthe\n\n[[Page S4924]]\n\nnumber of walking and bicycling trips, while reducing pedestrian and \nbicycle fatalities.\n  I believe that this modest package of policy improvements can and \nwill make a significant difference. I am very pleased by the broad \nrange of organizations that enthusiastically endorse this amendment.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Yes.\n  Mr. INHOFE. We are trying to lock in votes for tonight, and I was \npreparing for a unanimous consent request, but to do that we would have \nto give--I think the Senator needs to give the other side at least a \ncouple of minutes to respond. The request would be to have two votes \ntake place beginning at 5:30 on the Lautenberg amendment and the Harkin \namendment. Could I interrupt the Senator to make that unanimous consent \nrequest?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Absolutely.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that--\n  Mr. HARKIN. Wait just a second, Mr. President. The Senator said he \nwants to do what at 5:30?\n  Mr. INHOFE. We want to ask unanimous consent to proceed to a vote on \nthe two amendments beginning at 5:30.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Well, I had a request from Senator Carper who wanted to \nspeak. I assume Senator Bond may want to speak. I do not know. That is \nonly 7 more minutes.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I have been informed, if we are not able to get it at \nthis time, we will not be able to have the votes tonight. I would \nrather have them tonight.\n  I ask unanimous consent that at 5:30 today, the Senate proceed to a \nvote in relation to the Lautenberg amendment No. 625 to be followed by \na vote in relation to the Harkin amendment No. 618, with no second \ndegrees in order to the amendments prior to the votes and with the time \nuntil then equally divided; provided further that there be 2 minutes \nequally divided for debate between the votes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 618, as Modified\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I wonder if \nthe Chairman would permit me to modify my amendment by striking lines 6 \nthrough line 16 on page 5 dealing with research.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Yes. There is no objection to that. That will be included \nby UC.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I ask unanimous consent to do that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is so \nmodified.\n  The amendment (No. 618), as modified, is as follows:\n\n       At the end of subtitle D of title I, add the following:\n\n     SEC. __. NONMOTORIZED TRANSPORTATION SAFETY.\n\n       Section 120(c) of title 23, United States Code, is \n     amended--\n       (1) in the first sentence, by striking ``The Federal'' and \n     inserting the following:\n       ``(1) In general.--The Federal'';

Is there objection to the request from the \nSenator from Oklahoma?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  There will be 2\\1/2\\ minutes per side remaining on this amendment.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I wanted to make sure the Senator from \nMissouri had adequate time to speak. I think I have made my case. I \nwanted to point out who is in support of this amendment. I have a nice \nchart that says it all. The American Association of Retired People, the \nAssociation of Metropolitan Planning Organizations, the MPOs, are in \nfavor of this, as well as America Bikes, Natural Resources Defense \nCouncil; Paralyzed Veterans of America, again, because of the \ndisability issue; America Walks; the American Heart Association \nstrongly supports this; the American Public Health Association; the \nAmerican Society of Landscape Architects; the American Planning \nAssociation, among a lot of others, are in favor of this amendment.\n  I hope we can adopt this amendment for a number of reasons, not the \nleast of which is for the health and welfare of the American people and \nto get more people walking and biking but to get it done upfront, so \nwhen they are planning, it is integrated upfront, and that\n\n[[Page S4925]]\n\nis really what this amendment does, in essence.\n  This amendment asks for upfront planning, that they have a policy \nstatement, that metropolitan planning organizations have a complete \nstreets policy, that all of this is done upfront. Let us quit coming in \nand backfilling and putting in bike paths and sidewalks after the fact. \nLet us get it done upfront. That is really what this is all about.\n  I ask unanimous consent that letters from the following national \norganizations be printed in the Record: the Surface Transportation \nPolicy Project, AARP, America Walks, the National Center for Bicycling \nand Walking, the Metropolitan Planning Organizations, the League of \nAmerican Bicyclists, The American Society of Landscape Architects and \nthe National Resources Defense Council, and a fact sheet from the \nNational Association of County & City Health Officials.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                            Surface Transportation\n\n\n                                               Policy Project,\n\n                                      Washington, DC, May 9, 2005.\n     Hon. Tom Harkin,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Harkin: On behalf of the Surface \n     Transportation Policy Project, I am writing to indicate our \n     strong support for the ``Complete Streets Amendment'' you \n     will offer during Senate debate on the SAFETEA legislation.\n       Your amendment proposes important, albeit modest, \n     improvements to prompt the federal, state, regional and local \n     partnership to embrace policy actions that will help expand \n     travel options in the U.S., focusing specifically on \n     improving safety for pedestrians and bicyclists.\n       The simple policy adjustments you are proposing are \n     complementary to the other important provisions in the bill, \n     notably the renewal of the Surface Transportation Program and \n     its Transportation Enhancements Program as well as the \n     inclusion of new initiatives to promote ``fair share'' \n     expenditures under the Safety program and the Safe Routes to \n     School program. These programs bolster state and local \n     efforts to retrofit transportation facilities now in place \n     and help ``complete our streets'' in communities throughout \n     the nation.\n       Importantly, your amendment, with its emphasis on the \n     adoption of ``Complete Streets'' policies by state \n     transportation departments and the largest metropolitan \n     planning organizations, will help ensure that, going forward, \n     all users--transit users and other pedestrians of all ages, \n     including those with disabilities, as well as bicyclists--are \n     given full consideration in how we design new and modernize \n     existing facilities with the federal dollars SAFETEA makes \n     available. It also calls upon the U.S. Transportation \n     Department to report on how research funds are deployed to \n     facilitate walking and bicycling and prompts the Secretary to \n     exert more leadership to make these trips safer and more \n     frequent. Finally, it rightly focuses on the planning process \n     in our largest metropolitan areas where a substantial \n     majority of Americans live and work, insisting that more \n     attention be given to plans and investments that promote \n     broader travel options in these areas.\n       We strongly support this amendment and urge your colleagues \n     to incorporate these provisions during full Senate action on \n     SAFETEA.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Anne P.

May 11, 2005.\n     Hon. Tom Harkin,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Harkin: AARP commends you for your leadership \n     in offering the ``Complete Streets Amendment'' during Senate \n     debate on the SAFETEA legislation. Safe mobility options are \n     essential to the independence and well-being of older \n     Americans.\n       Over one-fifth of persons age 65 and over do not drive. A \n     growing number of older Americans are looking for other \n     mobility choices, either because they have stopped driving, \n     want to reduce their driving, or because they want to be more \n     physically active. Walking is an important travel option for \n     older persons and, under the proper conditions, can provide a \n     safe, healthy transportation alternative for carrying out \n     daily activities. In fact, walking is the most common mode of \n     travel for older persons after the private vehicle\n       A recent AARP survey, however, found that one-fifth of \n     persons age 75 and above perceived poor sidewalks, dangerous \n     intersections, and lack of places to rest as barriers to \n     walking. Older persons also have the highest rate of \n     pedestrian fatalities of any age group. We believe it is \n     important that communities provide infrastructure that allows \n     people of all ages to have safe mobility choices, including \n     walking and bicycling.\n       The Safe and Complete Streets Act of 2005 would help \n     accomplish this goal by:\n       Requiring that state transportation departments adopt \n     ``Complete Streets'' policies when constructing new \n     transportation facilities with federal funds, using the \n     Federal Highway Administration's policy statement on \n     accommodating pedestrians and bicyclists as its basis;\n       Directing the U.S. Secretary of Transportation to promote a \n     goal of increasing the number of pedestrian and bicycle \n     trips, while seeking to reduce accidents involving \n     pedestrians and bicyclists;\n       Focusing research on the safety of nonmotorized travel; and\n       Requiring metropolitan planning organizations serving a \n     population of 200,000 or more to designate bicycle/pedestrian \n     coordinators and include the safety needs of pedestrians and \n     bicyclists in their long-range transportation plans.\n       AARP appreciates your commitment and dedication to \n     providing mobility options for all Americans and we look \n     forward to working with you towards accomplishment of this \n     important goal. If you have any further questions, please \n     feel free to contact me, or have your staff contact Debra \n     Alvarez in Federal Affairs Department at (202) 434-3814.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                                David Certner,\n\n     Director, Federal Affairs.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                                America Walks,\n\n                                         Boston, MA, May 10, 2005.\n     Hon. Tom Harkin,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Harkin: I'm writing on behalf of America \n     Walks, a national coalition of more than 60 pedestrian \n     advocacy organizations located throughout the nation, to \n     express our support for your Complete Streets amendment to \n     the federal transportation bill.\n       Andy Hamilton, President of America Walks, is out of town \n     and asked me to let you know of our organization's support \n     for your efforts.\n       Communities with sidewalks will encourage people to walk \n     more, which will improve public health while at the same time \n     reducing traffic congestion, particularly around schools.\n       Complete streets will improve safety. For decades, our \n     roads have been designed with a single-minded focus on moving \n     as many cars as possible as fast as possible. Your amendment \n     will encourage communities to provide resources that enable \n     the roads to also become safe for pedestrians, cyclists, \n     seniors, transit users, and people with disabilities.\n       Completing the streets is the right thing to do. And \n     especially as our population ages and increases in girth and \n     Safe Routes to School programs increase in popularity, this \n     is the right time to do it!\n       America Walks appreciates your focus on this very important \n     issue. Your amendment, if passed, will increase \n     transportation choices and safety for all users.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Sally Flocks,\n     Vice-President.\n                                  ____\n\n                                               National Center for\n\n\n                                          Bicycling & Walking,\n\n                                       Bethesda, MD, May 10, 2005.\n     Hon. Tom Harkin,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Harkin: I am writing on behalf of the National \n     Center for Bicycling & Walking to express our appreciation \n     and support for your proposed Complete Streets amendment to \n     the transportation bill.\n       The actions called for in your amendment are the next \n     logical step in a process going back more than 30 years, \n     whereby the Congress has recognized progressive trends \n     related to bicycling and walking emerging at the state, \n     regional, and local levels and incorporated them into our \n     national transportation policy. The policy actions detailed \n     in your amendment will help improve the efficiency and \n     effectiveness of transportation plans, programs, and projects \n     at all levels of government, and provide the American \n     people--people of all ages--with better roads and safer \n     communities.\n       Our country needs this kind of leadership and support. We \n     are beset by a host of public health challenges such as \n     obesity, physical inactivity, and motor vehicle-related \n     injuries and fatalities. We know we need to be more active \n     and the public health experts have identified walking and \n     bicycling as two of the best opportunities available to \n     improve and maintain our health.\n       Sadly, the streets in many of our communities are not yet \n     inviting places to take a walk or ride a bike. However, we \n     know how to make them better. Your proposed amendment will \n     ensure that we do what needs to be done, for our health and \n     for the health and well-being of our children and \n     grandchildren.\n       Thank you.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                               Bill Wilkinson,\n\n     AICP, Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n                                       Association of Metropolitan\n\n\n                                       Planning Organizations,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 10, 2005.\n     Hon. Tom Harkin,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Harkin: On behalf of the Association of \n     Metropolitan Planning Organizations, we write in support of \n     your amendment to improve the safety of nonmotorized \n     transportation, including bicycle and pedestrian safety. \n     Metropolitan Planning Organizations (MPOs) are charged with \n     planning for the nation's transportation needs and they work \n     to protect and improve regions throughout the United States. \n     MPOs\n\n[[Page S4926]]\n\n     provide a locational nexus for representatives from various \n     modes of transportation to come together in support of a more \n     complete regional transportation system. We believe that your \n     amendment will further the goal of ``Complete Streets'' and \n     will provide much needed safety improvements for bicyclists \n     and pedestrians, while alleviating congestion on our nation's \n     roads.\n       We are pleased to see that this amendment targets MPOs in \n     urban areas with populations greater than 200,000. While we \n     recognize the importance of this amendment, we believe that \n     requiring all MPOs to designate a bicycle/pedestrian \n     coordinator would place an undue burden on our smallest \n     members. Those MPOs that represent populations of greater \n     than 200,000 are capable of these additional requirements, \n     assuming that the PL increase to 1.5% that is currently in \n     the Senate bill is realized. We are concerned, however, that \n     if these requirements are imposed without a corresponding \n     funding increase, we may not be able to meet these added \n     expectations. The 2000 census designated 46 new MPOs but no \n     additional funding was provided for these MPOs. As a result, \n     over 350 MPOs are now sharing a pot of money that was \n     established for approximately 300 MPOs.\n       We believe that ``Complete Streets'' is an important goal \n     of a regional transportation system. We are pleased to see \n     that you are offering this amendment as part of the \n     transportation reauthorization bill. Please feel free to \n     contact Debbie Singer at 202-296-7051 or dsinger@ampo.org if \n     you have any further questions.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Mayor Rae Rupp Srch,\n     AMPO President.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                League of American Bicyclists,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 11, 2005.\n     Hon. Tom Harkin,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Harkin: On behalf of the 300,000 affiliated \n     members of the League of American Bicyclists and the nation's \n     57 million adult bicyclists, I am writing to support the \n     inclusion of the ``Complete Streets Amendment'' as part of \n     SAFETEA.\n       In ISTEA and TEA-21, Congress established the principle \n     that new road projects and reconstructions should provide \n     safe accommodation of bicycling and walking. While some \n     states are beginning to make progress in this area, federal \n     guidance on this issue has been overlooked by many state and \n     local transportation agencies.\n       The Complete Streets Amendment seeks to address this issue \n     by simply directing all states to adopt a ``Complete Streets \n     Policy'' to ensure that states build streets and highways \n     that adequately accommodate all transportation users--\n     including bicyclists, pedestrians, and people with \n     disabilities. In addition, the amendment encourages local \n     action on bike/ped safety, sets goals for nonmotorized \n     transportation, and focuses research on nonmotorized travel \n     safety.\n       These are all important issues to the bicycling community \n     and beyond. Other important issues that we are pleased that \n     the bill managers have already recognized include:\n       Strengthening our core programs (Enhancements, Recreational \n     Trails, CMAQ, etc.);\n       Establishing a Fair Share for Safety Provision, which ties \n     safety spending to fatality crash rates by transportation \n     mode; and\n       Providing a National Safe Routes to Schools Program, which \n     provides funding to improve infrastructure and education to \n     make it safer for our nation's children to bike and walk to \n     school.\n       We applaud you for your leadership on this issue. Likewise, \n     we applaud the bill managers for their commitment to \n     completing action on a reauthorization bill that includes \n     good investments that will give all Americans safer places to \n     bike and walk.\n       The adoption of the ``Complete Streets Amendment'' does not \n     add to the cost of the overall bill and is, in fact, \n     complementary to the bicycling provisions already included. \n     As such, we support its inclusion in SAFETEA.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Mele Williams,\n     Director of Government Relations.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                            Natural Resources Defense Council,\n\n                                      Washington, DC, May 9, 2005.\n     Hon. Tom Harkin,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Harkin, On behalf of NRDC and our 600,000 \n     members, I am writing to express support for your Complete \n     Streets Amendment. This set of commonsense policies would \n     spur new construction and retrofitting of highways and roads \n     that aren't currently accessible to bikers and pedestrians--\n     i.e., ``completing the streets'' so that all users are \n     welcome, not just drivers.\n       The amendment is particularly timely, as public health \n     experts encourage Americans to walk and bike as a response to \n     the obesity epidemic. Completing our streets can help to meet \n     this goal. In fact, one study found that 43 percent of people \n     with safe places to walk within 10 minutes of home met \n     recommended activity levels, while just 27% of those without \n     safe places to walk were active enough. And another recent \n     study found that residents are 65% more likely to walk in a \n     neighborhood with sidewalks.\n       Benefits include more than increased physical activity. Air \n     quality in our urban areas is poor and linked to increases in \n     asthma and other illnesses. Replacing car trips with biking \n     or walking means less air pollution. And if each resident of \n     an American community of 100,000 replaced just one car trip \n     with one bike trip just once a month, it would cut carbon \n     dioxide (CO2) emissions by 3,764 tons per year in \n     the community.\n       In short, I commend you for offering this amendment, which \n     would provide Americans with more transportation choices, \n     improve public health and reduce pollution.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Deron Lovaas,\n     Vehicles Campaign Director.\n                                  ____\n\n                                               American Society of\n\n\n                                         Landscape Architects,\n\n                                      Washington, DC, May 9, 2005.\n     Hon. Tom Harkin,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Harkin: On behalf of the American Society of \n     Landscape Architects, I write to convey our strong support \n     for your proposed ``Complete Streets'' amendment to the \n     SAFTEA legislation in the 109th Congress. In order to provide \n     for safer and more active communities, we must complete our \n     streets and roadways by ensuring that they are designed and \n     operated to enable access for all users, including \n     pedestrians, bicyclists and transit riders of all ages and \n     abilities. In the past, the concerns of non-motorized \n     transportation users have been bypassed all too often, and \n     your amendment takes a critical, common sense step toward a \n     more comprehensive, integrated and effective transportation \n     system.\n       Because of our nation's inherent strengths, continued \n     growth, and boundless potential, we sometimes overlook the \n     obvious as we forge ahead. We have arrived at the point where \n     we have to take measures to better accommodate life outside \n     of our automobiles. This is not a simple task, but, with \n     proper planning, the benefits of a visionary approach will \n     far outpace our initial efforts. Your amendment provides an \n     appropriate and timely framework for those efforts by \n     encouraging planning, prioritizing and research by states and \n     municipalities.\n       If the Complete Streets Amendment is passed by the Senate, \n     protected in conference, and signed into law along with the \n     rest of SAFTEA, we can forecast the results with a great \n     degree of confidence. Complete Streets will lead to improved \n     safety, and promote a more active American lifestyle, with \n     more walking and bicycling for health. Complete Streets will \n     also help ease the transportation woes with which so many of \n     us are increasingly familiar. Roadways that provide varying \n     travel choices will give people the option to avoid traffic \n     jams, reducing congestion and increasing the overall capacity \n     of our transportation network.\n       This amendment also has an important place in the \n     transportation bill because Complete Streets make fiscal \n     sense. Integrating sidewalks, bike lanes, transit amenities, \n     and safe crossings into the initial design of a project \n     spares the costly expenses of retrofits later on ``down the \n     road.''\n       As practitioners of urban design and revitalization, site \n     planning, land use policy and master planning, landscape \n     architects are continually engaged with public officials, \n     developers and homeowners to design the places in which we \n     live, work, and seek recreational opportunities. The American \n     Society of Landscape Architects heartily encourages creating \n     and improving access to places for physical activity within \n     our communities.\n       It is not asking too much to make Complete Streets a \n     national transportation priority. The Congress has worked \n     long and hard to craft an effective transportation package, \n     and the Complete Streets Amendment will put the country on \n     the same ``planning page,'' providing us with sound footing \n     as we move towards a stronger, safer, and healthier future. \n     It is our hope that the United States Senate will recognize \n     and endorse the wisdom of the Harkin Complete Streets \n     Amendment. We thank you for your exemplary leadership on this \n     critical component to the overall health, wellbeing, and \n     functionality of our communities.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Patrick A. Miller,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n\n  Factsheet--National Association of County and City Health Officials\n\n\n                        understanding the issues\n\n       Land use, community design, and transportation planning \n     have an impact on the health of communities in relation to \n     diseases and injuries, as well as quality of life and well \n     being. Environmental conditions such as air quality, ground \n     and surface water contamination, and the re-use of \n     brownfields (used lands where expansion or redevelopment is \n     complicated by real or perceived environmental contamination) \n     affect disadvantaged populations more severely, particularly \n     given the current separation between land use planning and \n     public health. Local public health agencies (LPHAs) can \n     ensure that community health is emphasized throughout the \n     planning process by becoming involved during the early stages \n     of land use planning. In order to ensure a better quality of \n     life and the sustainability of our communities, it is \n     important for planners and public health officials to \n     collaborate on healthy solutions to the environmental health \n     problems that exist where we live, work, and play. Planning \n     and design decisions have a tremendous impact on a wide range \n     of public health issues, including:\n\n\n                              air quality\n\n       Asthma and other respiratory diseases are caused, in part, \n     by poor air quality. Poor air\n\n[[Page S4927]]\n\n     quality is tied to pollution emitted from automobiles and \n     other motor vehicles. In the United States, automobiles \n     account for over 49 percent of all nitrogen oxide \n     (NOx) emissions, which contribute to smog and lead \n     to serious health matters. Between 1980 and 1994, asthma \n     rates rose by 75 percent. People in sprawling communities \n     drive three to four times more than those who live in \n     efficient, well-planned areas, thus increasing vehicle \n     emissions that contribute to poor air quality.\n\n\n                             water quality\n\n       The National Water Quality Inventory: 1996 Report to \n     Congress identified runoff from development as one of the \n     leading sources of water quality impairment, accounting for \n     46 percent of assessed estuary impairment. In the United \n     States, wetlands are being destroyed at a rate of \n     approximately 300,000 acres per year, much of it for new \n     development. Wastewater also poses a serious threat to water \n     quality. In Florida, it is estimated that onsite sewage \n     treatment and disposal systems discharge 450 million gallons \n     per day of partially treated, non-disinfected wastewater, \n     which can lead to contamination of ground water supplies.\n\n\n                             traffic safety\n\n       According to the National Personal Transportation Survey, \n     walking accounts for only five percent of trips taken and \n     less than one percent of miles traveled, due in part to a \n     lack of appropriate and safe options for pedestrians. \n     Approximately 4,882 pedestrians were killed by vehicles and \n     78,000 injured in 2001. A Texas study found that for three \n     out of five disabled and elderly people, there are no \n     sidewalks between their homes and the closest bus stop. Over \n     55 percent of all pedestrian deaths occur in neighborhoods, \n     which are often designed with a bias toward cars, with no \n     sidewalks or otherwise inadequate pedestrian accommodations.\n\n\n                           physical activity\n\n       Community design often presents barriers to physical \n     activity, contributing to increased risk for obesity, heart \n     disease, diabetes, and other chronic diseases. Barriers \n     include, but are not limited to, the absence of sidewalks, \n     heavy traffic, and high levels of crime. Today, nearly one in \n     four Americans is obese, and at least 50 percent are \n     overweight. As access to recreational infrastructure may be \n     limited, people with disabilities often have less opportunity \n     to engage in physical activity. People are more likely to be \n     physically active if they can incorporate activity into their \n     daily routine. A 1996 report from the U.S. Surgeon General \n     determined that each year, as many as 200,000 deaths are \n     attributable to a sedentary lifestyle.\n\n\n                             mental health\n\n       According to the Human Environment-Research Lab, studies \n     have shown that exposure to greenspace helps to foster an \n     increased sense of community, and also lessens the effects of \n     chronic mental fatigue, which reduces violence and aggressive \n     behavior. A Cornell University study found that children \n     whose families relocated to areas with more greenspace \n     experienced an increase in cognitive functioning. Lack of \n     accessibility, such as absence of ramps and narrow doorways, \n     can contribute to an increase in isolation for the elderly \n     and people with disabilities. Increased commuting time has \n     been linked with physical and stress-related health problems. \n     It is estimated that for each additional 10 minutes of \n     driving time, there is a 10 percent decline in civic \n     involvement.\n\n\n                          Hazardous Materials\n\n       Hazardous materials are transported, stored, manufactured, \n     or disposed of in many communities. Often, zoning and \n     environmental regulations do not provide for the separation \n     of incompatible land uses, like placing housing near areas \n     zoned for use or storage of hazardous materials. In addition, \n     hazardous waste sites continue to be a significant concern. \n     The Environmental Protection Agency determined that one in \n     every four children in the United States lives within one \n     mile of a National Priorities List hazardous waste site. The \n     United Nations Environment Programme links exposure to heavy \n     metals with certain cancers, kidney damage, and developmental \n     retardation.\n\n\n                             Social Justice\n\n       Evidence demonstrates that environmental hazards, air \n     pollution, heat-related morbidity and mortality, traffic \n     fatalities, and substandard housing disproportionately affect \n     low-income and minority populations. Environmental Protection \n     Agency data shows that Hispanics are more likely than Whites \n     to live in air pollution non-attainment areas. Asthma \n     mortality is approximately three times higher among Blacks \n     than it is among Whites. As neighborhoods undergo \n     gentrification, people of a lower socioeconomic status are \n     pushed to the fringes, limiting their access to social \n     services. A lack of public transportation options often \n     exacerbates the problem and leaves minority populations \n     disproportionately affected by less access to quality \n     housing, healthy air, good quality water, and adequate \n     transportation.\n\n\n                             Role of LPHAs\n\n       Because most land use planning occurs at the local level, \n     it is essential that LPHAs become more integrated in the \n     planning process in order to address and prevent unfavoravble \n     outcomes for public health. LPHAs must assume a diverse and \n     proactive approach in order to be successful in this role, \n     including:\n       Forging partnerships between LPHAs and local planning and \n     transportation officials in order to bring health to the \n     planning table.\n       Using data to arm and inform stakeholders and decision \n     makers, substituting national data if local data is \n     unavailable.\n       Expanding the role of LPHAs in commenting on development \n     plans.\n       Electing health officials to planning boards and other \n     community positions.\n       Attending planning meetings regularly.\n       Serving as information conduits, keeping abreast of current \n     processes and policies, and disseminating information to \n     community members.\n       Adopting local resolutions on health and land use/\n     transportation planning.\n\n\n                             naccho's role\n\n       NACCHO's goal is to integrate public health practice more \n     effectively into the land use planning process by enhancing \n     the capacity of LPHAs to be involved in land use decision \n     making. Through the development of tools and resources, \n     NACCHO strives to promote the involvement of LPHAs with \n     elected officials, planners, and community representatives in \n     regard to health issues and land use planning. Focus groups \n     conducted by NACCHO during the past year explored strategies \n     for integrating public health and land use planning. To learn \n     more, visit www.naccho.org/project84.cfm, or call (202) 783-\n     5550 and ask to speak with a member of NACCHO's environmental \n     health staff.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. This amendment will improve our transportation system. It \nwill improve pedestrian and bicycle safety.\n  And it will be good for the health and wellness of the American \npeople. I urge my colleagues to join me in a strong, bipartisan vote in \nfavor of this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri is recognized.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, as noted by the Senator from Iowa, this bill \nincorporates more for bicycles and pedestrians than most highway users \ncan support. We have been very generous. The activities are eligible \nunder the core programs for the National Highway System, STP, CMAQ, \nhighway bridge funding. They are eligible under scenic byways, Federal \nlands, rails and trails.\n  Do not get me wrong. I like bikes. I used to be a big bike rider. I \nam a big walker. But this is a highway bill. This is not a bill for \nbicycles and pedestrians. I would urge everyone to get exercise. The \nproposal we have before us would require my State department of \ntransportation to plan for bicycles, completing Highway 63 from Macon \nto the Iowa line. Most of my good friends along there are not going to \nride a bicycle from Macon to the Iowa line, to the wonderful farm \nfields in north Missouri or along the hilly mountain paths of Highway \n60 in southern Missouri in the Ozark Mountains or Highway 13 or Highway \n71.\n  We have plenty of programs. Bicycle transportation and pedestrian \nwalkways are under here. It provides grants of $2 million. They want a \nbicycle clearinghouse like a Publishers Clearinghouse.\n  The proponent of this amendment says he needs it for the metropolitan \nplanning organizations. Well, if my colleagues will look at section \n134(a)(3) contents, the plans and programs for each metropolitan area \nshall provide for development and operation facilities, including \npedestrian walkways and bicycle transportation. Metropolitan planning \norganizations already are mandated to do that.\n  Section 1823 has enhancement projects approved. They are eligible for \nfacilities for pedestrians and bicycle activities, preservation for \nabandoned railway corridors. Similar to the administration's proposed \nSAFETEA, we elevated SAFETEA to a core program. This part, known as \nHSIP, there is a mandatory set-aside specifically for bicycle and \npedestrian activities. We set it up as $717 million, and since the \noverall level of the bill has been raised by $8 billion, this level has \ngone up.\n  There is also the Safe Routes to School Program. If you want people \nto be safe going to school, the National Highway Traffic Safety \nAdministration said 24 people die a year on average from school bus \ntransportation, but it is far and away the safest way for children to \ngo to and from school. That is by schoolbus.\n  A number of my colleagues have amendments regarding bicycle and \npedestrian activities. It seems that they have some different \npriorities than the mayors and the community leaders and the State \ndepartments of transportation I see in my State. They want to make sure \nwe have roads. If the department of transportation in Iowa and\n\n[[Page S4928]]\n\nMissouri want it, they can plan for it, as can the metropolitan \nplanning organizations. I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired. Under the \nprevious order, the hour of 5:30 having arrived, the question is on \nagreeing to the Lautenberg amendment.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

There will now be 2 minutes of debate equally \ndivided on the Harkin amendment.\n  The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, this amendment is about doing what is \nlogical regarding sidewalks and bike paths in the planning stages. You \nwill hear there is money in this bill for sidewalks and bike trails. \nThat is true. But more often than not, we are always doing things after \nthe fact. We are redoing it.\n  All this amendment says is in the planning upfront, you plan for \nsidewalks where they are logical. You plan for bike paths where they \nare logical. You plan it in the beginning, not doing it later on. These \nare some of the organizations who support the amendment: the American \nAssociation of Retired People, the Association of Metropolitan Planning \nOrganizations--they are the ones who have to do the planning; they are \nin favor of this amendment--American Bikes, Paralyzed Veterans of \nAmerica--people with disabilities need more sidewalks--the American \nHeart Association, and the American Public Health Association.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to oppose this \namendment. This provides tremendous resources for bicycles and \npedestrians, more than $717 million in a mandatory set-aside for bike \nand pedestrian activities. Metropolitan planning organizations are \nalready required under existing law to plan for bike and pedestrian \nfacilities. What this amendment says is: If you are planning a highway \nfrom Leftover Shoes to Podunk Junction in the middle of a State with \nnobody around, you would have to plan for a bike path. We have a lot of \nroads through our Ozark hills and farmland where the danger is \ninadequate two-lane highways. People are not going to ride bicycles \nalong those highways. They need the lanes to drive their cars. Putting \nan additional planning burden on agencies that don't want or need bike \npaths is another unwarranted mandate. I urge my colleagues to oppose \nthe amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment \nNo. 618, as modified.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, just today I initiated an \neffort to ask Peruvian President Alejandro Toledo to reopen an \ninvestigation into the brutal torture-murder of a young journalist from \nmy state.\n  The 28-year-old reporter, Todd Smith, was found dead 15 years ago, \nhis body discovered in Peru's violent coca-producing region. This son \nof a Florida appellate judge worked for The Tampa Tribune, and was \ninvestigating the drug traffic in the northern Peruvian jungle.\n  Officials in Peru were quick to say the murder was the work of the \nShining Path--a Maoist insurgent group said to be involved in \nprotecting cultivators of the coca plant. Specifically, Peru's Interior \nMinistry said Todd had been captured by Maoist rebels and possibly sold \nto drug traffickers for $30,000.\n  Four years later, a secret counterterrorism trial in Peru resulted in \na Shining Path guerrilla being sentenced to 30 years in prison for \ntaking part in the murder.\n  He was the only person ever tried for the crime--and even he \nreportedly has received an early release. Little else was known.\n  Now, however, the transcript of that secret 1993 trial has emerged, \nincluding an intelligence report that identifies a businessman who \nfounded a Peru airline as one of the masterminds behind Todd's killing. \nThe complete court file was obtained by a Lima-based institute for a \nfree press and society.\n  According to one of several detailed intelligence reports in the \ntrial transcript, the guerrillas who tortured and strangled Todd were \nworking for Peru businessman Fernando Zevallos, and two others \nallegedly involved in the drug trade.\n  But Zevallos--labeled a Peruvian cocaine kingpin last year by the \nBush administration--was never charged in the case. The New York Times \nquotes American and Peruvian authorities as saying he has evaded \njustice for so long by bribing court officials and killing witnesses.\n  It has been over 15 years since a son of Florida and a member of the \nfourth estate was tortured and strangled to death in the jungles of \nPeru--and clearly, justice has yet to be served.\n  In January, I went to Peru and there I established a working \nrelationship with President Toledo and was joined by Ambassador \nFerrero, Peru's ambassador to the United States\n  Today, through proper diplomatic channels, I made a formal request \nthat President Toledo immediately reopen the investigation into Todd \nSmith's death; and, that his government cooperate fully with our State \nDepartment and FBI. And Ambassador Ferrero told me he ``would put all \n[his] effort into this.\n  I hope my Senate colleagues will join me in demanding that justice \nfinally be served in this case.\n  Todd's parents, and his two sisters, deserve no less.\n  Mr. President, I am going to birddog this with everything I have to \nsee that this case is brought to justice. I do believe the Peruvian \ngovernment clearly has an interest, now that the secret court files \nhave come to light, to get to the bottom of this. I earnestly hope we \nwill get the cooperation of the Peruvian government in reopening the \ninvestigation. There is no excuse, when an American newspaper reporter \nis brutally tortured and murdered, that we should not have all the \nfacts. If it leads, in fact, to this businessman, then so be it. We owe \nthis especially to this family in Florida that for so long has not \nknown any of the facts of this brutal killing of their son.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Talent \namendment at the desk, which is identical to the amendment previously \nagreed to, be agreed to and the motion to reconsider be laid on the \ntable.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, it saddens me to report today that \nanother young Iowan has fallen courageously in service to his country \nas part of Operation Iraqi Freedom. Sergeant David Rice, a fire support \nspecialist with the 1st Battalion, 5th Field Artillery Regiment, 1st \nInfantry Division, died on April 26 when his vehicle overturned near \nMuqdadiyah. He was 22 years old.\n  David grew up in Sioux City, IA, and attended East High School where \nhe excelled in football, wrestling, and track and field. He joined the \nArmy after graduating from East in 2001 and was on his second tour of \nduty in Iraq.\n  David Rice is remembered by friends and family as a hard-working, \nquiet leader. In memory of Sergeant Rice, I would like to recognize \ntoday all of our military men and women, like David, who have been the \nquiet, dedicated leaders who have helped see our country through this \ndifficult time. My prayers go out to the family of Sergeant David Rice, \nhis father David, his mother Laurinda, and his sister Stevie. They \nshould know that his leadership and sacrifice have not gone unnoticed \nbut have earned him the gratitude of a Nation.\n\n[[Page S4930]]\n\n                     Sergeant Angelo L. Lozada, Jr.\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I rise today to remember and honor Sergeant \nAngelo Lozada, Jr. of Nashua, NH for his service and supreme sacrifice \nfor his country.\n  Angelo demonstrated a willingness and dedication to serve and defend \nhis country by joining the United States Army. Just as many of \nAmerica's heroes have taken up arms in the face of dire threats, Angelo \ndedicated himself to the defense of our ideals, values, freedoms, and \nway of life. His valor and service cost him his life, but his sacrifice \nwill live on forever among the many dedicated heroes this Nation has \nsent abroad to defend freedom.\n  Angelo felt the call to serve our Nation early, and dutifully joined \nthe Reserves after he graduated from high school. He served for 6 years \nin the New Hampshire Army National Guard's Bravo Battery, 1st \nBattalion, 172nd Field Artillery Regiment before signing up for active \nduty on July 26, 2000. He was deployed to Iraq in 2003, where he served \nin Alpha Battery, 2nd Battalion, 17th Field Artillery Regiment, 2nd \nInfantry Division, stationed out of Camp Hovey, Korea. Tragically, on \nApril 16, 2005, Angelo made the ultimate sacrifice for this great \nNation. He died of injuries sustained while conducting combat \noperations in Ar Ramadi, Iraq.\n  Throughout his career, Angelo earned a series of accolades which \ntestify to the dedication and devotion he held for his fellow soldiers, \nthe Army, and his country. Angelo's hard work and dedication \ncontributed greatly to his unit's successes and placed him among many \nof the great heroes and citizens that have paid the ultimate price for \ntheir country. Angelo was recognized posthumously for his courageous \nactions in Iraq by receiving the Bronze Star, the Purple Heart, and an \nArmy Commendation Medal. He had also been recognized throughout his \ndistinguished career by receiving the Army Achievement Medal, Army Good \nConduct Medal, National Defense Service Medal, Global War on Terrorism \nExpeditionary Medal, Global War on Terrorism Service Medal, Korean \nDefense Service Medal, Army Service Ribbon, and the Weapons \nQualification Badge, M-16 Expert. He was also a graduate of the Primary \nLeadership Development Course and was recently promoted to Sergeant in \nMay of 2004.\n  Angelo was truly an exceptional soldier with more than 10 years of \nservice and a father of three who had decided to reenlist after his \ntour of duty in Iraq. He leaves behind a family with a proud tradition \nof military service, including three brothers who served in the Army.\n  My condolences and prayers go out to Angelo's family, and I offer \nthem my deepest sympathies and most heartfelt thanks for the service, \nsacrifice, and example of their soldier, Sgt Angelo Lozada, Jr. He was \nrespected and admired by all those around him, and continually \nperformed above and beyond all expectations while in the United States \nArmy. Because of his efforts, the liberty of this country is made more \nsecure.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/05/11/senate-section/article/S4930-1", "month": "05", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4930]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           MORE OPPOSITION TO THE GUN INDUSTRY IMMUNITY BILL\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, since the reintroduction of the Protection \nof Lawful Commerce in Arms Act, many law enforcement and community \ngroups around the country have publicly stated their opposition to the \nbill. In Michigan alone, the bill is opposed by organizations including \nthe Michigan Association of Chiefs of Police, the League of Women \nVoters of Michigan, the Michigan Partnership to Prevent Gun Violence, \nand local chapters of the Million Mom March.\n  Law enforcement and community groups oppose the misnamed ``Protection \nof Lawful Commerce in Arms Act'' because it would significantly weaken \nthe legal rights of gun violence victims. The bill would provide \nmembers of the gun industry with legal protections not enjoyed by other \nindustries and deprive many gun violence victims with legitimate cases \nof their day in court.\n  Two former Directors of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms \nhave added their voices to the already considerable and growing \nopposition to this bill. In a letter to Congress, former ATF Directors \nStephen Higgins and Rex Davis state that the gun industry immunity \nlegislation would threaten the ATF's ability to effectively enforce our \nNation's gun laws. Specifically, they cite provisions in the bill that \nwould likely block the ATF from pursuing administrative proceedings \n``to revoke a gun dealer's federal firearm license if the dealer \nsupplies guns to criminals or other prohibited buyers'' and ``to \nprevent the importation of non-sporting firearms used frequently in \ncrimes.'' Later in the letter, former Directors Higgins and Davis \nstate:\n\n       We know from experience how important it is that ATF be \n     able to enforce our nation's gun laws to prevent firearms \n     from being obtained by terrorists, other criminals, and the \n     gun traffickers who supply them. To protect our citizens from \n     the scourge of gun violence Congress should be strengthening \n     our laws and increasing ATF's resources and ability to \n     enforce those laws. To handcuff ATF, as this bill does, will \n     only serve to shield corrupt gun sellers, and facilitate \n     criminals and terrorists who seek to wreak havoc with deadly \n     weapons. To take such anti-law enforcement actions in the \n     post-9/11 age, when we know that suspected terrorists are \n     obtaining firearms, and may well seek them from irresponsible \n     gun dealers, is nothing short of madness.\n\n  Combined, former Directors Higgins and Davis have more than two \ndecades of experience in leading the ATF. We should recognize their \nextensive knowledge of gun violence issues and follow their advice. \nInstead of providing a single industry with broad immunity, we should \nbe protecting the legal rights of gun violence victims and enhancing \nthe effectiveness of our law enforcement agencies.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a list of some of the law enforcement \nand community organizations opposing this legislation be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                         Michigan Organizations\n\n       Michigan Association of Chiefs of Police\n       League of Women Voters of Michigan\n       Michigan Partnership to Prevent Gun Violence\n       Detroit Million Mom March Chapter\n       East Metro Detroit Million Mom March Chapter\n       Mid-Michigan/Lansing Million Mom March Chapter\n       Novi Million Mom March Chapter\n       Southwest Michigan Million Mom March Chapter\n       Washtenaw County MMM Chapter\n       West Metro Detroit/Washtenaw County Million Mom March \n     Chapter\n\n\n                 National Law Enforcement Organizations\n\n       International Brotherhood of Police Officers\n       Major Cities Chiefs Association\n       National Black Police Association\n       Hispanic American Police Command Officers Association\n\n\n                      Other National Organizations\n\n       Alliance for Justice\n       American Association of School Psychologists\n       American Association of Suicidology\n       American Bar Association\n       Americans for Democratic Action\n       American Humanist Association\n       American Public Health Association\n       Brady Campaign To Prevent Gun Violence united with the \n     Million Mom March\n       Child Welfare League of America\n       Children's Defense Fund\n       Church Women United\n       Coalition To Stop Gun Violence\n       Common Cause\n       Congregation of Sisters of St. Agnes Leadership Team\n       Consumer Federation of America\n       Consumers for Auto Reliability and Safety\n       Disciples Justice Action Network\n       Equal Partners in Faith\n       Evangelical Lutheran Church in America\n       Hadassah The Women's Zionist Organization Of America\n       HELP Network\n       League of Women Voters of the U.S.\n       Legal Community Against Violence\n       National Council of Jewish Women\n       National Council of Women's Organization\n       National Research Center for Women & Families\n       Physicians for Social Responsibility\n       Presbyterian Church (USA)\n       Public Citizen\n       Religious Action Center of Reform Judaism\n       States United to Prevent Gun Violence\n       The American Jewish Committee\n       The Ms. Foundation for Women\n       The Society of Public Health Education (SOPHE)\n       The United States Conference of Mayors\n       Unitarian Universalist Association of Congregations\n       Veteran Feminists of America\n       Women's Institute for Freedom of the Press\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/05/11/senate-section/article/S4930-2", "month": "05", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4930-S4931]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 EMERGENCY SUPPLEMENTAL APPROPRIATIONS\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, when the Senate debated this bill a few \nweeks\n\n[[Page S4931]]\n\nago, I asked my colleagues a simple question. What is the purpose of an \nemergency appropriations bill? The purpose, it seems to me, is to fund \nunexpected priorities--emergencies that simply cannot wait for the \nnormal budget process. The conference report largely fulfills that \npurpose. It covers unexpected costs associated with the war on terror, \ntsunami relief, and national security priorities, including funding for \nour troops serving in Iraq and Afghanistan. I strongly support funding \nin these areas.\n  But that is not all it does, Mr. President. This conference report \nhas also served as a magnet for non-emergency spending and includes a \nhost of earmarks. Let me be clear: I support this conference report \nbecause of the critical resources it provides for our troops and for \nour other emergency priorities, including tsunami relief. But at the \nsame time I am deeply disturbed that the Congress isn't exhibiting \nrestraint. Knowing that this conference report was a ``must pass'' \npiece of legislation, we have once again loaded it with unrelated \nprovisions. Let me remind my colleagues that we are experiencing \nenormous budget deficits. At some point, we will have to embrace some \ndegree of fiscal responsibility.\n  We should start with this emergency supplemental. The scope of \nemergency appropriations has traditionally been limited, and for good \nreason. We already have a proper budget and appropriations process. We \ndon't need another. The proper process is supposed to allow Congress to \nmeet Federal responsibilities while closely monitoring the effect our \nspending has on the budget deficit and the national debt. But \nappropriations that are designated as ``emergency'' do not count \nagainst the discretionary budget ceilings that we ourselves set. They \nadd to costs incurred by the government and cause the current budget \ndeficit to grow. With enactment of this measure, supplemental military \nspending alone since September 11, 2001, will top $200 billion. I am \nnot questioning funding the war on terror; but I am questioning the \nunnecessary add-ons.\n  With respect to the substance of this conference report, I am pleased \nthat it will provide the necessary resources to our troops as well as \nadditional funds for our homeland security needs. It increases veterans \nbenefit levels and expands eligibility, and provides higher benefits to \nfamily members of those killed in military service. This foreign \naffairs provisions of the conference report are remarkably, and \ncommendably, free of pork. As one who supports ensuring that every \ntaxpayer dollar counts, I commend my colleagues for their restraint in \nthis area while meeting the President's request for funding for the \nvictims of the South East Asian tsunami.\n  Unfortunately, this conference report also includes some unnecessary \nprovisions, examples of which I will give in just a moment. I fully \nrecognize that it isn't only the fault of the appropriators that the \nCongress has been forced into this new pattern of adopting emergency \nappropriations measures. Overly partisan politics has largely prevented \nus from following the regular legislative order, and that fact must \nchange.\n  I would ask my colleagues whether they believe the following \nexamples--just a select few from this conference report--constitute \n``emergency spending'': $2,000,000 to upgrade the chemistry \nlaboratories at Drew University in New Jersey. According to its \nwebsite, Drew University has a total enrollment of 2,600 students, \noperates with a $200,000,000 endowment, and draws more National Merit \nScholars than many other top liberal arts colleges in the nation. A \nprestigious institution indeed, but I see no way in which funding for \nits chemistry labs is a critical national spending emergency; $500,000 \nfor the Oral History of the Negotiated Settlement project at the \nUniversity of Nevada-Reno; $2,000,000 to continue funding for the \nSoutheast Regional Cooling, Heating and Power and Biofuel Application \nCenter in Mississippi; $4,000,000 to payoff debt at the Fire Sciences \nAcademy in Elko, Nevada; and $2,000,000 for the National Center for \nManufacturing Sciences in Michigan.\n  Additionally, notwithstanding Senate rules against legislating on an \nappropriations bill, the legislation before us today contains plenty of \npolicy-related, non-appropriations language. For example: The \nconference report directs the Secretary of the Interior to allow oil \nand gas exploration underneath the Gulf Island National Seashore, a \nprotected National Park in Mississippi. This changes current Federal \npolicy disallowing such exploration; a line-item in the conference \nresolution blocks the EPA from revising how it collects fees for the \nregistration of pesticides. For several years, similar language has \nbeen routinely added to VA-HUD/EPA appropriations legislation. Now this \nprovision has found a new home in the emergency spending bill; it \nauthorizes the Bureau or Reclamation to study the viability of \nestablishing a sanctuary for the Rio Grande Silvery Minnow in the Rio \nGrande River; it directs the Army Corps of Engineers to complete the \nIndiana Harbor and Canal disposal project; and California lawmakers \nhave seen to it that this bill provides funds for San Gabriel Basin \nrestoration.\n\n  Mr. President, we simply must start making some very tough decisions \naround here if we are serious about improving our fiscal future. Let's \nbe clear about what we are doing. The Government is running a deficit \nbecause it is spending more than it takes in. So each one of the \nearmarks in this bill, we are borrowing money--and saddling future \ngenerations of Americans with unnecessary debt. If we had no choice but \nto act in this way, this might be, a understandable, temporary method \nof budgeting. But the fact is that we do have a choice.\n  At a conference in February, 2005, David Walker, the Comptroller \nGeneral of the United States, said this:\n\n       If we continue on our present path, we'll see pressure for \n     deep spending cuts or dramatic tax increases. GAO's long-term \n     budget simulations paint a chilling picture. If we do \n     nothing, by 2040 we may have to cut federal spending by more \n     than half or raise federal taxes by more than two and a half \n     times to balance the budget. Clearly, the status quo is both \n     unsustainable and difficult choices are unavoidable. And the \n     longer we wait, the more onerous our options will become and \n     the less transition time we will have.\n\n  Is that really the kind of legacy we should leave to future \ngenerations of Americans?\n  Referring to our economic outlook, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan \nGreenspan testified before Congress that:\n\n       (T)he dimension of the challenge is enormous. The one \n     certainty is that (the resolution of this situation will \n     require difficult choices and that the future performance of \n     the economy will depend on those choices. No changes will be \n     easy, as they all will involve lowering claims on resources \n     or raising financial obligations. It falls on the Congress to \n     determine how best to address the competing claims.\n\n  It falls on the Congress, my friends. The head of the U.S. \nGovernment's chief watch-dog agency and the Nation's chief economist \nagree--we are in real trouble.\n  Dire predictions, and what are we doing about it? Are we restraining \nour spending? No, of course not. We are at it again, finding new and \never more creative ways to funnel money to the special interests. We \nhave to face the facts. Congress cannot continue to spend taxpayer \ndollars on wasteful, unnecessary pork barrel projects or cater to \nwealthy corporate special interests any longer. The American people \ndeserve better.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/05/11/senate-section/article/S4931-1", "month": "05", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4931-S4932]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         OLDER AMERICANS MONTH\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, when President Kennedy established Older \nAmericans Month in 1963, he began an important tradition of designating \na time for our country to honor older citizens for their many \naccomplishments and contributions to our Nation. Now, as we recognize \nMay as ``Older Americans Month,'' I welcome the opportunity to reflect \non the contributions senior citizens have made in shaping our Nation \nand to reassert our commitment to enhancing the living standard of our \nsenior community.\n  This year's theme is ``Celebrate Long Term Living.'' Many seniors in \nMaryland exemplify that idea, continuing to lead vital, active lives \nthroughout their ``golden years.'' Bob Ray Perry Hall, from Hamilton, \nMD, who ran every day from April 4, 1967 until his 68th birthday on \nApril 7, 2005, is one such example. Mr. Hall holds the longest \nconsecutive running streak in the United States and the second longest \nrecord in the entire world, a remarkable accomplishment at any age. Ms. \nEvelyn Wright of Annapolis is another\n\n[[Page S4932]]\n\nsenior to celebrate. In 2003, Ms. Wright was named National Master \nField Athlete of the Year for 2003 and since the age of 55, she has \namassed hundreds of medals and trophies as a competitor in Senior \nOlympic events. She started her track and field career with the \nsoftball throw, but now competes in a multitude of events including \npole vault, high jump, long jump, and hammer throw. She continues to \ntravel around the country competing and setting track and field records \nfor her age group. Many seniors in Maryland are enjoying old age by \nstarting new ventures. At age 68 and 66 respectively, Emily Levitas and \nLinda Segal decided to join forces and become co-owners of ``Gotta Have \nBags,'' a successful handbag store located in Hampden.\n  The list of enterprising, energetic, and active Maryland seniors and \nothers throughout the Nation goes on and on and extends to all facets \nof life. We are very grateful for the enormous contributions they make \nday in and day out. But as a Nation, we do not always live up to our \nend of the bargain. There is much to be done to help seniors sustain \nquality long-term living. I have worked diligently in the Senate to \nensure that older Americans are able to live with dignity and \nindependence during their later years, and we will continue to fight \nthe recent slew of misguided attacks on Social Security, Medicare, and \nother programs so crucial to senior citizens.\n  I have significant concerns about the impact of Medicaid cuts on \nseniors. People often forget that Medicaid is the largest funding \nsource for long-term care services, institutional and home-based, for \nthe elderly. Without such aid, many older Americans could not manage to \npay for adequate care. Yet the Administration proposes to slash this \nprogram while extending tax cuts for the wealthiest among us. It is \ndifficult to ``celebrate long-term living'' if you cannot afford to \nsecure reasonable quality healthcare and long-term living facilities.\n  Another critical need that must be addressed is affordable \nprescription drugs. I voted against the Medicare Prescription Drug and \nModernization Act of 2003 because I believed it would jeopardize \npromises that we as a Nation have made to seniors. I was principally \nconcerned that the new law would fail to provide a comprehensive, \nconsistent, and affordable prescription drug benefit to Medicare \nbeneficiaries. Many of the concerns that I had during consideration of \nthat measure are now coming to fruition. Indeed, as we prepare for the \nimplementation of the drug benefit in 2006, we are just now learning \nthat seniors will encounter the uncertainty of incomplete coverage for \ndrug costs, along with rapidly rising pharmaceutical costs. To address \nthese concerns, I favor proposals that provide Medicare beneficiaries \nwith full prescription drug coverage. In addition, a number of my \ncolleagues and I supported legislation during the Senate's \nconsideration of the Medicare overhaul that would have controlled drug \nprices by allowing our Government to negotiate directly with drug \ncompanies. Unfortunately, these proposals were defeated when they came \nto the Senate for a full vote, but I continue to work with my \ncolleagues on these and other proposals to bring drug prices under \ncontrol.\n  On top of all of this, the Medicare trustees have predicted \nexhaustion of the Medicare Hospital Inpatient Trust Fund in 2020. With \nthe rising costs of drugs and health care in general, and the implicit \nlack of means to reduce drug costs in the new law, we will be faced \nwith hard decisions sooner than originally anticipated. The answer to \nthe funding gap must not be to decrease benefits. A comprehensive \nMedicare plan and affordable pharmaceuticals are two important pieces \nthat could help seniors live with dignity and independently, but these \ncrucial needs remain very much in jeopardy.\n  Finally, our seniors deserve the guarantees promised to them after \nyears of contributing to the Social Security program. In 1935, \nPresident Roosevelt sought to create a program that would ``give some \nmeasure of protection to the average citizen and to his family against \nthe loss of a job and against poverty-ridden old age.'' There are those \nwho suggest that the only way Social Security can meet the expanding \ndemand of future retirees is by creating private accounts and \nsimultaneously decreasing benefits. We must work to preserve, not \ndiminish, Roosevelt's legacy. Thus far, Social Security has been \neffective in improving the standard of living and reducing poverty \namong the elderly and disabled by providing an inflation-indexed, \ndefined benefit, no matter how long an individual lives and regardless \nof the vagaries of the stock market. Throughout their lives, seniors \nhave paid into a system with the understanding that their benefits will \nbe there for them when they retire. We must uphold our end of the \nbargain and ensure that these benefits are available. The words of \nPresident Roosevelt should continue to guide our conscience.\n  This Older Americans Month I ask my colleagues to respect and renew \nour commitment to our seniors and all of our citizens. As seniors face \nold age, they should not face uncertainty about their living \nsituations, about their access to health care, and about their \nfinancial circumstances. Our older Americans add great value to our \nNation. We must take this month as an opportunity to redouble our \nefforts on behalf of this and future generations so that our older \nAmericans can continue to ``Celebrate Long-Term Living'' now and well \ninto the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/05/11/senate-section/article/S4932-1", "month": "05", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4932]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                TAKE OUR DAUGHTERS AND SONS TO WORK DAY\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU.

Mr. President, in 1939, before many Members of this \nbody had been born, Miss Elizabeth Bryden of Waltham, MA, came to \nWashington, D.C. to work for Congressman Robert Luce. She continued to \nwork on the Hill, with little interruption, until the start of the 96th \nCongress in 1979. Today, when most Hill staffers remain here for only a \nfew years, Betty Bryden, as she was always known, remains an example of \nrare dedication and extraordinary public service.\n  Her early employers are now mostly names for the history books. For \nexample, Senator Leverett Saltonstall of Massachusetts and Bourke \nHickenlooper of Iowa, not to mention\n\n[[Page S4933]]\n\nGordon Allot of Colorado and Congressman McIntyre of Maine. Several of \nthose gentlemen chaired the Senate Republican Conference, a position I \nnow hold.\n  As the research librarian for the Republican Conference, in the days \nbefore computers, Betty would come into the Russell Senate Office \nBuilding hours before most staffers would arrive. By the time the \nSenate began business for the day, she would have copied, filed, and \ncross-filed, in what must have been one of the world's most elaborate \nreference systems, scores of that day's news items from a wide variety \nof sources. The cumulative result was a towering warren of filing \ncabinets, jammed with thousands of sheets of paper, the location of \neach of which she somehow remembered. It was not unusual for Senators \nto request urgent information from both the Congressional Research \nService and Betty, knowing there was a good chance she would have it on \ntheir desks long before the official system could respond.\n  With today's internet, of course, it is not necessary for our staff \nto literally walk across town through a winter blizzard in order to \nprovide the day's news clips, but that is what Betty was known to do on \noccasion. Little wonder, then, that she had a special place in the \nhearts of many Senators. Another remarkable Republican woman, Senator \nMargaret Chase Smith, was especially close to Betty and requested that \nshe join the board of the Smith Library in Maine, on which Betty still \nserves.\n  It must be admitted that, during most of the period when Betty worked \non the Hill, opportunities for advancement for women were limited. It's \nhard to imagine how they ran this place without the full participation \nof women; we could not manage to do that today. And yet Betty always \nfound ways to make a difference. At the request of Senator Saltonstall, \nfor example, she took under her wing a young man who needed to be \ntrained as a legislative assistant. Even though, as a woman, she was \nnot eligible for the job, she produced a first-rate legislative aide. \nThe young man was named Eliott Richardson, and throughout his later \ncareer he never forgot his teacher and always made a point of paying \nhis respects to her personally when his official duties brought him to \nthe Senate.\n  On behalf of the Senate Republican Conference and its leadership past \nand present, I salute Betty for her lifetime of labor in our behalf \nand, indeed, for the entire Senate. Betty's contributions to this \ninstitution are still appreciated, and she remains an inspiration to us \nall.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/05/11/senate-section/article/S4933-1", "month": "05", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4933]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                     A TRIBUTE TO LEONARD WING, JR.\n\n Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a \ngood friend, Leonard Wing, Jr., who passed away Saturday, April 30, \n2005. Leonard was a decorated war hero, a civic leader, a devoted \nfamily man, and a great Vermonter.\n  I knew Leonard almost my entire life. We grew up across the street \nfrom each other on Kingsley Avenue in Rutland, VT. When I was a young \nboy, Leonard left Vermont to fight in World War II. Leonard was wounded \nand taken prisoner in Europe before escaping and fleeing to northern \nAfrica with help from the Polish underground. For his efforts in the \nEuropean Theatre, Leonard was awarded the Silver Star and the Purple \nHeart, in addition to other commendations. I still remember listening \nin awe as my neighbors in Rutland recounted the heroics of Leonard and \nhis father, MG Leonard Wing, Sr., who was a Vermont legend for his \nmilitary leadership in the South Pacific. Leonard Wing, Jr. went on to \nserve for over 30 years in the Army and Army National Guard before \nretiring as a brigadier general in 1973.\n  After World War II, Leonard returned to the United States and \ncontinued his studies, graduating from the Boston University School of \nLaw in 1950. After law school, Leonard returned to Vermont and became \none of the State's finest attorneys, practicing law in Rutland for 46 \nyears. During his legal career, Leonard served as both the president of \nthe Vermont Bar Association and the State director of the American \nCollege of Trial Lawyers.\n  To residents of Rutland, Leonard is probably best known, however, for \nhis local leadership and civic involvement. Leonard sat for 6 years on \nthe Rutland City Board of School Commissioners, part of that time \nserving as the board's president. Most significantly, Leonard helped \nfound the Havenwood School in Rutland. He also served as president of \nthat school in addition to holding the same post at the Rutland \nAssociation for Retarded Citizens and the Vermont Association of the \nRetarded. These are just a few notable examples of the many charitable \nand civic activities to which Leonard lent his time.\n  Leonard's life was marked by his extraordinary service to his local \ncommunity, his State, and his country. The city of Rutland, and the \nState of Vermont, will not be the same without Leonard's leadership. He \nwill be most missed, however, by those he loved most dearly: his \nfamily. I offer my condolences to his wife Mary and their nine \nchildren. I hope they take comfort in knowing that Leonard's \naccomplishments and service will not soon be forgotten by the scores of \nVermonters whose lives he touched.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/05/11/senate-section/article/S4933-2", "month": "05", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4933]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING T.

LaMar Sleight retired recently from \nhis position as the Director of International and Government Affairs \nfor The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints. LaMar is a native \nof Idaho, born in Montpelier and educated in Preston. In his years of \npublic service, he has set a fine example of leadership and dedication.\n  LaMar served more than 34 years in the military, retiring in 1993 as \na Colonel in the United States Army. He joined the National Guard at \nage 18. Eventually the Guard sent him to OCS and he joined the Army. He \nwas awarded three awards of the Legion of Merit and the Bronze Star \nmedal. His overseas assignments took him to Korea, Vietnam and Germany. \nAssignments closer to home include Oklahoma, Georgia, Nebraska, and \nWashington, DC. His military career clearly influenced his organized \nand structured leadership style.\n  Upon retiring from the military, LaMar took up the challenging \nposition as the Director of International and Government Affairs for \nThe Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints. He has been an \noutstanding liaison for the LDS Church and the international community. \nI have enjoyed my interaction with him during my tenure in Congress, \nwhich extends back more than 12 years.

Mr. President, 40 years ago in the April 1965 \nissue of Electronics magazine, Gordon Moore, a young engineer, \naccurately forecast years of exponential improvements in computer chip \nperformance. His abstract observations led to the most concrete \nresults.\n  In his article entitled, ``Cramming More Components onto Integrated \nCircuits,'' Moore first articulated his thinking on the future of the \nintegrated circuit. Later, he theorized that the number of transistors \non a computer chip would continue to double in power for the same price \nevery 18 months. This postulation became popularly known as Moore's \nLaw, and it was a stunning challenge for scientists and engineers to \ndiscover new phenomena and ideas to maintain America's technological \nmomentum.\n  Shortly thereafter, Gordon Moore helped found the Intel Corporation, \nwhich started as a pioneer in cutting-edge semiconductor technology and \ntoday remains at the frontier of innovation in integrated circuits. \nSince that time, all in accordance with Moore's Law, there have been \nmore than three dozen such doublings in computer chip performance.\n  No wonder that we marvel how our world has changed more in the past \ncentury than in the previous hundred centuries. It took 10,000 years to \nget from the dawn of civilization to the airplane, but just 66 years to \nget from powered flight to the moon landing. In 1971, Intel could fit \n2300 transistors on a silicon chip; later this year, Intel is expected \nto unveil a chip with nearly 2 billion transistors.\n  ``It's kind of a Biblical thing,'' Leon Lederman, the Nobel laureate, \nonce noted, ``Science begets technology. Once we have transistors, we \ncan make computers. When we have computers, we can make much better \ntransistors . . . which can make better computers.''\n  In the years ahead, networked supercomputers operating at speeds of \nover one thousand trillion operations per second will have implications \nas profound as the Industrial Revolution's spread of technology.\n  Such technological innovation, predicted by Moore's Law, has led to \nadvances in virtually every industry and has fundamentally impacted the \nway we live, work, and play. Information technology has become \ncommonplace in our schools, libraries, homes, offices, and businesses--\nand new information technology applications are still developing \nrapidly.\n  Information technology has had a mutually reinforcing relationship \nwith our ``golden age'' of science and engineering. Advances in \nsupercomputers, simulations, and networks are creating a new window \ninto the natural world--making computing as valuable for theory and \nexperimentation as a tool for scientific discovery.\n  It has accelerated the pace of scientific discovery across the board \nin all scientific disciplines. Information visualization and simulation \ntechnologies make it possible to learn, explore, and communicate more \ncomplex concepts. Supercomputer technology, for example, allows \nresearchers to develop lifesaving drugs more rapidly, better understand \nthe functions of our genes once they have been sequenced, or more \naccurately predict tornadoes. Advanced information technology tools \nhave emerged to support ``collaboratories''--geographically separate \nresearch units on different sides of the world functioning as a single \nlaboratory.\n  Perhaps the most important area where information technology's impact \nhas been greatest is in our economic sector. It is commonly credited as \nbeing a key factor in our economy's structural shift from manufacturing \nto services, altering the nature of our work and the needs of our \nworkforce.\n  The widespread diffusion of information technology throughout the \neconomy, and its integration into new business models producing more \nefficient production methods added a full percentage point to the \nNation's productivity after 1995. Economists note that productivity is \nthe most important driver of long-term economic growth, and information \ntechnology increases economic output more than any other type of \ncapital investment.\n  Beginning in 1995, U.S. productivity--spurred by information \ntechnology applications--accelerated to rates of growth not seen in two \ndecades. The difference between 1.5 percent and 2.5 percent \nproductivity growth is the difference between the standard of living \ndoubling in one generation or in two generations. It has enormous \nimplications.\n  The impact of Moore's Law and the resulting U.S. technology industry \nhas also had enormous implications for my home State of New Mexico.\n  We are proud to be part of the drive within the technology industry \nto keep pace with Moore's Law. Small and large businesses alike which \nare part of our local technology industry have led to steadily \nincreasing economic growth and development. Intel Corporation, with \nGordon Moore at its helm, has become a major contributor to our State's \neconomy and is an example of the impact that U.S. technological \nleadership has at a local level.\n  Overall, Intel has a significant economic and fiscal impact on our \nState and region. Intel came to Rio Rancho, just outside of \nAlbuquerque, in 1980 and has grown to become our State's largest \nprivate manufacturer. Intel New Mexico employs more than 5,000 people \nand pays some of the highest wages. In 2001-2002, Intel spent $2 \nbillion on new facilities and upgrades to other facilities.\n  Moreover, Intel's continued growth has brought other benefits to our \ncommunities as well, particularly in the area of education. Intel made \na $2 million donation to the National Hispanic Cultural Center to \nintegrate the latest technology tools in support of the Intel Center \nfor Technology and the Visual Arts. Intel's ``Teach to the Future'' has \nprovided technology training for more than 6,000 New Mexico teachers to \nhelp them incorporate technology into their curricula and help prepare \nour children for the jobs of the 21st century. Intel has also launched \ntwo Computer Clubhouses, technology and mentoring programs for youth in \nAlbuquerque and Santa Fe.\n  While Moore's Law has meant so much to my State and our Nation, we \nneed to acknowledge that engineering, computer chips, and information \ntechnology are about more than our material wealth or our simple \nacquisition of knowledge. Basically, they are about our dreams.\n  We have always been a Nation that is defined by the great goals we \nset, the great dreams we dream. We have always been a restless, \nquesting people--and with willpower, resources, and great national \neffort, we have always reached our horizons and then set out for new \nones.\n  So on this 40th anniversary of Moore's Law, I want to salute the \nextraordinarily important contributions of Gordon Moore, the Intel \nCorporation, and the many other scientists and engineers who have \nhelped us imagine and invent the future.\n  In large measure, their contributions have made this new century \nbefore us so full of promise--molded by science, shaped by technology, \nand powered by knowledge. These potent transforming forces can give us \nlives richer and fuller than we have ever known before.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/05/11/senate-section/article/S4934-2", "month": "05", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4934]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/05/11/senate-section/article/S4935-1", "month": "05", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4935]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S4935]]\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/05/11/senate-section/article/S4935-2", "month": "05", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4935]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 11:15 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 1023.

A bill to authorize the Attorney General to make grants to \nimprove the ability of State and local governments to prevent the \nabduction of children by family members, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today along with Senators \nHutchison, Durbin, Snowe, Leahy and Feingold to reintroduce the \n``Family Abduction Prevention Act of 2005,'' a bill to help the \nthousands of children who are abducted by a family member each year. We \nintroduced this legislation last Congress, but it is just as needed \ntoday as it was then.\n  Family abductions are the most common form of abduction, yet they \nreceive little attention, and law enforcement often doesn't treat them \nas the serious crimes that they are.\n  The Family Abduction Prevention Act of 2005 would provide grants to \nStates for costs associated with family abduction prevention. \nSpecifically, it would assist States with: costs associated with the \nextradition of individuals suspected of committing the crime of family \nabduction; costs borne by State and local law enforcement agencies to \ninvestigate cases of missing children; training for local and State law \nenforcement agencies in responding to family abductions; outreach and \nmedia campaigns to educate parents on the dangers of family abductions; \nand assistance to public schools to help with costs associated with \n``flagging'' school records.\n  Each year, over 200,000 children--78 percent of all abductions in the \nUnited States--are kidnapped by a family member, usually a non-\ncustodial parent.\n  More than half of abducting parents have a history of domestic \nviolence, substance abuse, or a criminal record.\n  Most State and local law enforcement agencies do not treat these \nabductions as serious crimes. Approximately 70 percent of law \nenforcement agencies do not have written guidelines on responding to \nfamily abduction and many are not informed about the Federal laws \navailable to help in the search and recovery of an abducted child.\n  Many people believe that a child is not in grave danger if the \nabductor is a family member. Unfortunately, this is not true, and this \nassumption can endanger a child's life. Research shows that the most \ncommon motive in family abduction cases is revenge against the other \nparent--not love for the child.\n  The effects of family abduction on children are very traumatic. \nAbducted children suffer from severe separation anxiety. To break \nemotional ties with the left-behind parent, some family abductors will \ncoach a child into falsely disclosing abuse by the other parent to \nperpetuate their control during or after abduction. The child is often \ntold that the other parent is dead or did not really love them.\n  As the child adapts to a fugitive's lifestyle, deception becomes a \npart of life. The child is taught to fear those that one would normally \ntrust, such as police, doctors, teachers and counselors. Even after \nrecovery, the child often has a difficult time growing into adulthood.\n  Let me give an illustrative example about a girl named Rebekah. On \nTakeroot.org, a website devoted to victims of family abductions, \nRebekah told the story of when her mother kidnapped her.\n  Her mother was diagnosed as manic and was verbally abusive to her \nchildren and husband. Rebekah's father was awarded full custody of her \nand her brothers. However, one weekend, when Rebekah was 4-years-old, \nher mother took her to Texas.\n  Her mother had all Rebekah's moles and distinguishing marks removed \nfrom her body and she had fake birth certificates made for Rebekah and \nherself. As Rebekah grew up, she was told that her father didn't love \nher and that her siblings didn't want to see her. When the FBI finally \nfound Rebekah, she didn't remember her father and felt very alone.\n  In addition, in many family abduction cases, children are given new \nidentities at an age when they are still developing a sense of who they \nare. In extreme cases, the child's sexual identity is covered up to \navoid detection.\n  Abducting parents often deprive their children of education and much-\nneeded medical attention to avoid the risk of being tracked via school \nor medical records.\n  In some cases, the abducting parent leaves the child with strangers \nat an underground ``safe house'' where health, safety, and other basic \nneeds are extremely compromised.\n  For example, in Lafayette, CA, two girls were abducted by their \nmother and moved from house to house under the control of a convicted \nchild molester. Kelli Nunez absconded with her daughters, 6-year-old \nAnna and 4-year-old Emily in violation of court custody orders. Nunez \ndrove her daughters cross-country, and then returned by plane to San \nFrancisco, where she handed the children to someone holding a coded \nsign at the airport.\n  The person holding the sign belonged to an underground vigilante \ngroup called the California Family Law Center led by Florencio Maning, \na convicted child molester. For six months, Maning orchestrated the \nconcealment of the Nunez girls with help from other people. Luckily, \npolice were able to track down the girls, and they were successfully \nreunited with their father.\n  California has been the Nation's leader in fighting family abduction. \nIn my State, we have a system that places the responsibility for the \ninvestigation and resolution of family abduction cases with the County \nDistrict Attorney's Office. Each California County District Attorney's \nOffice has an investigative unit that is focused on family abduction \ncases. These investigators only handle family abduction cases and \nbecome experts in the process.\n  However, most States lack the training and resources to effectively \nrecover children who are kidnapped by a family member. According to a \nstudy conducted by Plass, Finkelhor and Hotaling, 62 percent of parents \nsurveyed said they were ``somewhat'' or ``very'' dissatisfied with \npolice handling of their family abduction cases.\n  The ``Family Abduction Prevention Act of 2005'' would be an important \nfirst step in addressing this serious issue.\n  I urge my colleagues to quickly act on this important legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 994\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n[[Page S4939]]\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Family Abduction Prevention \n     Act of 2005''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress findings that--\n       (1) each year more than 203,000 children in the United \n     States (approximately 78 percent of all abducted children) \n     are abducted by a family member, usually a parent;\n       (2) more than half of the parents who abduct their children \n     have a history of alcohol or substance abuse, a criminal \n     record, or a history of violence;\n       (3) the most common motive for family abduction is revenge \n     against the other parent, not protecting the child's safety;\n       (4) children who are abducted by family members suffer \n     emotional, psychological, and often physical abuse at the \n     hands of their abductors;\n       (5) children who are victims of family abductions are \n     forced to leave behind family, friends, their homes, their \n     neighborhoods, their schools, and all that is familiar to \n     them;\n       (6) children who are victims of family abductions are often \n     told that the parent who did not abduct the child has died, \n     does not love them, or will harm them;\n       (7) children who are abducted by their parents or other \n     family members are sometimes forced to live in fear of \n     discovery and may be compelled to conceal their true \n     identity, including their real names, family histories, and \n     even their gender;\n       (8) children who are victims of family abductions are often \n     denied the opportunity to attend school or to receive health \n     and dental care;\n       (9) child psychologists and law enforcement authorities now \n     classify family abduction as a form of child abuse;\n       (10) approximately 70 percent of local law enforcement \n     agencies do not have written guidelines for what to do in the \n     event of a family abduction or how to facilitate the recovery \n     of an abducted child;\n       (11) the first few hours of a family abduction are crucial \n     to recovering an abducted child, and valuable hours are lost \n     when law enforcement is not prepared to employ the most \n     effective techniques to locate and recover abducted children;\n       (12) when parents who may be inclined to abduct their own \n     children receive counseling and education on the harm \n     suffered by children under these circumstances, the incidence \n     of family abductions is greatly reduced; and\n       (13) where practiced, the flagging of school records has \n     proven to be an effective tool in assisting law enforcement \n     authorities find abducted children.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to improve the Veterans Beneficiary Travel Program of \nthe Department of Veterans Affairs; to the Committee on Veterans' \nAffairs.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, today, I join my colleagues, Senator Enzi \nand Senator Thune in introducing ``The Veterans Road to Health Care Act \nof 2005.''\n  Montana veterans are often forced to travel hundreds of miles \nthroughout our great State to receive the healthcare they need. Whether \ntraveling to the only Veterans' Administration (VA) hospital located \njust outside of Helena at Fort Harrison, or to one of the eight \nCommunity Based Outpatient Clinics, CBOCs, the distances traveled by \nour veterans is great. We have a lot of dirt between light bulbs in \nMontana. This distance, combined with the increase in gas prices and \nthe cost of lodging for veterans and their families adds up quickly. \nMany of these folks do not have any other option for their health care, \nand I think that anything which can be done to help those who are \ntravel eligible would be appreciated.\n  The Veterans Road to Health Care Act of 2005 would help ease this \nburden by raising the travel reimbursement rate for veterans who must \ntravel to VA facilities for treatment. The current reimbursement rate \nof 11 cents per mile would be increased to the Federal rate of 40.5 \ncents per mile. It seems only fair that veterans who have sacrificed so \nmuch for this country receive the same compensation as Federal \nemployees.\n  My bill would also allow payment under the Travel Beneficiary Program \nto veterans who cannot receive adequate care at their VA facility and \nare thereby forced to travel to another care center for specialized \ntreatment. This referral to another facility for additional treatment \noften increases the costs for veterans from rural States like Montana, \nwho must make another trip and sometimes travel even longer distances, \nfor medical assistance.\n  It is important that veterans in rural areas receive fair \ncompensation, as they travel to obtain healthcare. I want to \nacknowledge Senators Enzi and Thune for joining me in support of this \nbill. Their work on this and all other veterans' issues is to be \ncommended, and I look forward to working with them and my other Senate \ncolleagues to pass this important piece of legislation. We need to do \nthis for veterans in Montana and other rural areas across the country.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of the \nVeterans Road to Health Care Act of 2005 that I introduced with my \ncolleagues Senator Burns and Senator Thune. This legislation would \nraise the travel reimbursement rate for veterans who must travel to \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs' hospitals for treatment. The current \nreimbursement rate is 11 cents per mile. This bill would raise that \nfigure to match the Federal employees travel reimbursement rate which \nis 40.5 cents per mile.\n  The average price for gas in Wyoming right now is $2.20 per gallon. \nThe current rate of 11 cents per mile barely makes a dent in the \nexpenses incurred by veterans who have no choice but to travel by \nautomobile for health care. I have received numerous letters from \nveterans in Wyoming describing how difficult it is to work into their \nbudget the money necessary to travel between their hometown and the VA \nhospital. Being able to access health care is vital; veterans should \nnot have to choose between driving to receive needed treatment and \nbeing able to afford other necessities.\n  In Wyoming, we have two VA Medical Centers, one in Cheyenne and one \nin Sheridan. Veterans have to travel to one of these facilities to be \ntreated for health conditions and be covered by the health care plan \nthat the government provides for them. This poses a serious problem in \nterms of travel expense, especially with the rise in gasoline prices. \nSome towns in Wyoming are over 300 miles away from the nearest VA \nfacility. A veteran living in Riverton must drive 215 miles to the \nSheridan facility or nearly 300 to the Cheyenne facility. This problem \nis then compounded when these facilities, which provide great service \nfor our veterans, must refer the veterans to a larger hospital in Salt \nLake City or Denver for additional treatment or procedures.\n  This bill addresses the health care of veterans who have special \nneeds. It would allow veterans who have been referred to a special care \ncenter by their VA physician to be reimbursed under\n\n[[Page S4940]]\n\nthe Travel Beneficiary Program for their travel to the specialized \nfacility. This applies only to those veterans who cannot receive \nadequate care at their VA facility.\n  This legislation is important to all veterans, but it is especially \nsignificant to those veterans who live in rural states, like my home \nState of Wyoming. Rural States are less populated; there is greater \ndistance between towns and far fewer options for transportation. \nWyoming has miles and miles of miles and miles. Cars are the main mode \nof transportation and many times the only option.\n  It is our duty to compensate our servicemen and women for the \nsacrifices that they made defending the freedoms of this country. With \nour current recruitment and retention problems in the military, it is \nour Nation's responsibility to give veterans the kind of access to \nhealthcare they have earned through their service to our country. The \nrising cost of gasoline should not be a factor for veterans to ignore \ntheir health concerns because they cannot afford to travel to the \nnearest veterans' clinic. I strongly urge my colleagues to support this \nimportant bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BURNS:\n  S. 997. A bill to direct the Secretary of Agriculture to convey land \nin the Beaverhead-Deerlodge Forest, Montana, to Jefferson County, \nMontana, for use as a cemetery; to the Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, this bill conveys 3.4 acres on the \nBeaverhead-Deerlodge National Forest to Jefferson County, MT for \ncontinued use as a cemetery.\n  The Elkhorn Cemetery in Jefferson County has been used as a cemetery \nsince the 1860's. Due to surveying errors and limited information when \nthe National Forest boundaries were surveyed in the early 1900's, the \ncemetery was included as National Forest lands. The cemetery is still \nin use by local families who homesteaded and worked the mines in the \narea. However, Forest Service manual direction strongly discourages \nburials on National Forest lands, placing both the families and Forest \nService in an awkward position.\n  It is clear the cemetery should not have been included as part of the \nNational Forest. The County Commissioners and the local public strongly \nsupport the conveyance.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 997\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Montana Cemetery Act of \n     2005''.\n\n     SEC. 2. CONVEYANCE TO JEFFERSON COUNTY, MONTANA.\n\n       (a) Conveyance.--Not later than 180 days after the date of \n     enactment of this Act and subject to valid existing rights, \n     the Secretary of Agriculture (referred to in this Act as the \n     ``Secretary''), acting through the Chief of the Forest \n     Service, shall convey to Jefferson County, Montana, for no \n     consideration, all right, title, and interest of the United \n     States in and to the parcel of land described in subsection \n     (b).\n       (b) Description of Land.--The parcel of land referred to in \n     subsection (a) is the parcel of National Forest System land \n     (including any improvements on the land) known as the Elkhorn \n     Cemetery, which consists of 10 acres in Jefferson County \n     located in SW1/4 Sec. 14, T. 6 N., R. 3 W.\n       (c) Additional Terms and Conditions.--The Secretary may \n     require such additional terms and conditions for the \n     conveyance under subsection (a) as the Secretary considers \n     appropriate to protect the interests of the United States.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CRAPO (for himself and Mr. Craig):\n  S. 998. A bill to include the State of Idaho as an affected area \nunder the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act (42 U.S.C. 2210 note); to \nthe committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, in the 1950s and 1960s, this country was in \nthe midst of a cold war and arms race, a race to perfect the hydrogen \nbomb. To win the race, nuclear weapons technology was developed using \nabove ground testing in Idaho's neighbor to the south, Nevada. During \nthese tests, Idahoans recount going outside in the evenings to look at \nthe beautiful sunsets caused by the testing. Unfortunately and \nunbeknown to them, these skies were filled with dangerous radiation \nthat very much elevated their exposure and subsequent risk of \ndeveloping cancer.\n  I will not debate whether government authorities adequately knew the \nextent of the long-term dangers to radiation exposure. However, after a \nlong and protracted discussion in this very chamber, Congress did \nrecognize that what had occurred during this time of nuclear testing \nand rightly came forward providing for compensation through the \nRadiation Exposure Compensation Act of 1990 (RECA). This bill said that \nif you lived in certain counties in certain States during a certain \nperiod of time and had specified diseases, you were eligible for \ncompensation. It is now time to review that program and make it work \nfor everyone who may have become ill because of radiation fall-out \nexposure.\n  The criteria established in the Act were driven by limited scientific \nknowledge and political expediency. This was recognized in 1999, when a \ngroup of Senators, led by Senator Hatch, amended RECA to include \nadditional counties in Arizona. During the floor debate at the time, \nSenator Hatch said, ``Through advances in science, we now know so much \nmore about the effects of radiation than we did in the late 1950s and \n1960s. Our current state of scientific knowledge allows us to pinpoint \nwith more accuracy which diseases are reasonably believed to be related \nto radiation exposure, and that is what necessitated the legislation we \nare considering today.''\n  But the truth is even more encompassing than a few more counties. \nAccording to a report from the National Academies of Sciences, a report \ncommissioned by Congress, radiation fall-out didn't know any arbitrary \ngeographic boundaries. It didn't stop because it crossed a State or \ncounty line. The NAS report, released last month, clearly demonstrated \nthat we continue to be wide of the mark in who is eligible for \ncompensation and that is why I am introducing legislation today to \nbring RECA back on course. Information used to establish who would be \neligible for compensation failed to recognize that four counties in \nIdaho ranked in the top five in having the highest per capita thyroid \ndosage of radiation in the nation, more than any county currently \nrecognized by RECA for eligibility. This clear inequity must be \nrectified; Idaho has a documented history of high cancer rates in \npeople who lived in these areas during testing.\n  At this time I would like to thank people like Sheri Garmon, Kathy \nSkippen, Tona Henderson, and so many others who have spent time and \nenergy on this issue. Some like Sheri are fighting multiple cancers and \nyet have taken the time to pursue their belief that they to deserved to \nbe eligible for the RECA program. The NAS report recognizes that the \nRECA program needs revamping, but Idahoans deserve equal treatment with \nthose in Utah, Arizona, and Nevada now. They should not have to wait \nwhile Congress comes up with a better way to administer this program. \nThat is why I am introducing legislation today that will extend the \npresent program to cover the full State of Idaho. And I am encouraging \nmy colleagues to work with me on making the entire RECA program more \ncomprehensive for the future.\n  It is the right thing to do.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WYDEN (for himself and Mr. Smith):\n  S. 999. A bill to provide for a public response to the public health \ncrisis of pain, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WYDEN:\n  S. 1000.

A bill to establish hospice demonstration projects and a \nhospice grant program for beneficiaries under the medicare program \nunder title XVII\n\n[[Page S4941]]\n\nof the Social Security Act, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, several weeks ago, I outlined what I \nbelieved this country needs to do in order to address the true issues \nrelated to how we care for those who are dying. Today, I am introducing \n3 bills to improve access to pain management, increase the number of \nproviders trained to care for those with life-threatening illness, and \nimprove the Medicare hospice benefit.\n  Our medical system is geared towards curing patients, and gives short \nshrift to those we cannot cure. Modern advances in technology allow us \nto live longer, but that also means that many of us will live longer \nwith chronic diseases including pain.\n  The Conquering Pain Act will help those patients living and dying in \npain, support their families and assist providers in getting \ninformation and guidance. This legislation will provide an opportunity \nfor the country to develop and test different ways of providing pain \nmanagement to patients 24 hours a day, seven days a week. It would \ncreate and fund regional networks to assist patients so they would not \nhave to wait until normal business hours to get relief and help \nproviders receive timely information and guidance as they treat \ndifficult cases. This bill would create a website and require access to \nit in health care settings so families, patients and providers can have \ninstant information. In addition, the bill requires several studies so \nwe can better understand the other roadblocks for patients seeking pain \nmanagement. These roadblocks include the lack of health insurance \ncoverage for pain management and the interaction of the enforcement of \nlaws concerning controlled substances and the delivery of appropriate \npain management. I am pleased that my colleague from Oregon is \ncosponsoring the Conquering Pain Act.\n  Another aspect of our health care system that needs strengthening, is \nin assuring that we have providers who know how to provide support and \ncomfort care to the dying. The Palliative Care Training Act will \nincrease the number of providers trained in palliative care. Palliative \ncare is an approach that improves the quality of life of patients and \ntheir families facing the problems associated with life-threatening \nillness. It does so through the prevention and relief of suffering by \nearly identification, assessment and treatment of pain and other \nproblems. Palliative care affirms life and regards dying as a normal \nprocess. It neither hastens nor postpones death and is applicable early \nin the course of illness, in conjunction with other therapies that are \nintended to prolong life, such as chemotherapy or radiation therapy, \nand offers a support system to help patients live as actively as \npossible until death.\n  My legislation provides grants to individuals with appointments as \njunior faculty at accredited medical schools so they will teach other \nproviders palliative care. This is modeled after existing awards for \nthe training of other specialties. When it comes down to it, assuring \nthere is faculty in schools to teach this area of medicine, is an \ninexpensive way of strengthening the health care system in providing \nthis needed care. I am pleased to note that when the National Hospice \nand Palliative Care Association recently testified before the Senate \nHealth, Education and Labor Committee, they identified this legislation \nas addressing an important need.\n  As we look at how to better care for those at the end of life, \nMedicare's hospice benefit bears examination. When the benefit was \nadded to Medicare, it was hailed as a cost effective benefit that would \nassist many. In truth, few Americans know what hospice really is and \nthe benefits it can provide. Too often seniors are advised of the \nbenefits too late to get the full effect of the medical, social and \nspiritual support this benefit can provide. Part of the reason for this \nis Medicare requires the patient to choose between continuing to seek \n``curative'' care or hospice and palliative care. This means that \nliterally the patient must choose between the hope of a cure and \naccepting that they are dying. Not many of us would want to give up \nseeking a cure or want to give up hope. However, that is what the \nMedicare program requires now. The Medicare Hospice Demonstration Act \ntests the idea that patients would not have to give up seeking \n``curative'' care, to get hospice. It is my belief that as people \nexperience what hospice can do for them and for their families, they \nwill find they can accept living the end of their lives with hospice \nand palliative care instead of seeking less effective care that will \nnot cure them or enhance the quality of their life.\n  It the U.S. Senate is going to examine end of life issues, we should \nnot just look at legal issues. I believe these proposals are essential \nelements of the health care system that need to be supported and \nstrengthened.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bills be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bills were ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 999\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, physician-owned specialty hospitals \ncontinue to raise a number of troubling issues, and I feel strongly \nthat additional action to address these issues is needed from Congress. \nToday, I am pleased to join Senator Max Baucus, the ranking Democrat on \nthe Senate Finance Committee, in introducing the Hospital Fair \nCompetition Act of 2005. This bill has an effective date of June 8, \n2005, regardless of when it may be enacted as this is the date the \ncurrent moratorium on specialty hospitals expires.\n  Now, specialty hospitals have existed for quite some time. There are \nother types of hospitals with a special focus, such as children's \nhospitals and psychiatric facilities. But these are not really what we \nare talking about. We are talking about the emergence of a new type of \nhospital. These new facilities are mostly for-profit. They are mainly \nowned by the physicians who refer their patients to these hospitals. \nAnd, they provide treatment in very specific areas such as cardiac, \northopedic or surgical care.\n  The number of these specialty hospitals has more than tripled in the \npast 10 years. While they are still relatively small in number--about \n100--they are increasing quickly. They are mainly located in certain \npockets of the country, concentrated in those States without a \n``certificate of need'' requirement. That means they are mainly located \nin States where hospitals are permitted to add beds or build new \nfacilities without first obtaining approval by the State. This approval \nprocess helps ensure that there is an actual public health need for \nadditional health resources in the community.\n  Congress, in the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and \nModernization Act of 2003 (MMA), placed a moratorium on the development \nof new physician-owned specialty hospital hospitals until June 8, 2005. \nFirst, there were concerns about the conflict of interest inherit in \nphysician self-referral. Second, it was thought that specialty \nhospitals might be an unfair form of competition. And third, in all of \nthis, was a concern about the impact these hospitals may be having on \nthe health care system as a whole.\n  The Medicare Payment Advisory Commission (MedPAC) and the Centers for \nMedicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) were directed by the MMA to study \nand report on a number of issues related to specialty hospitals. \nToday's Hospital Fair Competition Act draws heavily from MedPAC's non-\npartisan recommendations in its March 8, 2005, report to Congress.\n  Three separate government studies have found that physician-owned \nspecialty hospitals treat the most profitable patients and services, \nleaving community hospitals to treat a disproportionate share of less \nprofitable cases, Medicaid cases and the uninsured.\n  An April 2003 report by the Government Accountability Office (GAO) \nfound that patients at specialty hospitals tended to be less sick than \npatients with the same diagnoses at general hospitals. The Centers for \nMedicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) reported in March its preliminary \nfindings that specialty hospitals generally treat less severe cases \nthan community hospitals. And, MedPAC reported that physician-owned \nspecialty hospitals treat patients who are less sick, and thus more \nprofitable, and concentrate on certain diagnosis-related groups (DRGs) \nthat are more profitable.\n  In addition, approximately 93 percent of community hospitals operate \nemergency rooms, compared to less than half of specialty hospitals, \nthus treating any and all patients who walk\n\n[[Page S4947]]\n\nthrough their doors. They also serve a much greater share of poor \npatients, averaging 15 percent versus four percent for specialty heart \nhospitals and one percent for specialty orthopedic hospitals. When \ncommunity hospitals lose their profitable services, they must shift \ncosts to private patients to make up the difference. This then means \nprivate employers may pay higher premiums--all so physician-owned \nspecialty hospitals can profit.\n  Specialty hospitals are able to take advantage of an outdated payment \nsystem. The current inpatient payment rates have not been recalibrated \nin over 20 years. This has resulted in certain patients and certain \ncase types being significantly more profitable to treat than others. In \nfact, specialty heart hospitals have been found by MedPAC to treat \nMedicare patients who are 13 percent more profitable than the average \nmix of patients. And at specialty surgical hospitals this number is 14 \npercent.\n  This bill would make corrections to the payment system so that \ncertain cases and patients are not significantly more profitable or \nless profitable to treat than others. While we believe the secretary \nhas the authority to make these payment changes, this bill will direct \nCMS to do so beginning in 2007. This will improve payment accuracy for \nall hospitals, and will better reflect the actual cost of delivering \ncare.\n  But Medicare payment changes are not enough.\n  I also have great concerns about the inherent conflict of interest in \nphysician ownership. This interest in gaming the system may not be in \nthe best interest of the patient, and this is troubling. Physicians are \npaid by Medicare to treat the patient. In addition, because they are \nowners of the hospital, physician owners get a payment from Medicare \nfor use of the facility. And, because they are also investors in the \nhospital, these physician owners also get dividends on their \ninvestment. MedPAC found these annual dividends for older facilities \nare frequently in excess of 20 percent.\n  I am concerned that this focus on profit may unduly influence \nphysician decision-making on the part of some physicians. This is not \ngood for unsuspecting patients, the Medicare program or taxpayers. Some \nphysicians may choose where to send a patient based on whether or not \nthey think that patient will profit their hospital. In addition, \nchanges to the payment system don't prevent some physician-owners from \nselecting patients based on their insurance. Specialty hospitals would \nlikely continue to treat few--if any--poor or uninsured patients.\n  MedPAC has found that specialty hospital hospitals treat far fewer \nMedicaid recipients than community hospitals in the same market--75 \npercent fewer for specialty heart hospitals, and 94 percent fewer for \nspecialty orthopedic hospitals. In addition, CMS found that specialty \nhospitals provided only about 40 percent of the share of uncompensated \ncare that the local community hospitals provided. We now have 45 \nmillion uninsured Americans in our country, and I continue to be very \nconcerned about their health care.\n  Congress has passed laws that, with very few exceptions, prevent \nphysician physicians from referring Medicare and Medicaid patients to \nfacilities in which they are owners. This was adopted in response to a \nnumber of studies that found that physician-owners tended to make more \nreferrals to their facilities and order substantially more services at \nhigher cost.\n  One exception, however, is the ``whole hospital'' exception. The law \nallows physicians to invest in a ``whole hospital'' because it is \nbelieved that no particular referral would economically advantage a \nspecific physician owner. Because the referrals would be diluted across \nmultiple services, there would not be a direct link to any one \nphysician's income. But specialty hospitals are not really whole \nhospitals. In fact, they are more like a hospital department such as a \ncardiac unit or an orthopedic unit. Under current law, we believe that \nthe secretary has the authority to define what constitutes a whole \nhospital, and we encourage CMS to determine whether specialty hospitals \nmeet this definition. The law clearly states that it is illegal for \nphysicians to invest in hospital departments.\n  This loophole in the law, the ``whole hospital'' exception, is being \nexploited. The Hospital Fair Competition Act will close this loophole. \nNew specialty hospitals will not qualify for the ``whole hospital'' \nexception as of June 8, 2005--the date the moratorium expires.\n  Existing specialty hospitals, those in operation or under development \nbefore November 18, 2003, will be able to continue operating under \ncertain restrictions. These ``grandfathered'' specialty hospitals will \nbe prohibited from increasing their total number of physician owners. \nAlso, the bill caps each individual physician's investment and the \naggregate physician investment in the facility as of June 8, 2005. \nGrandfathered specialty hospitals will not be allowed to expand their \nscope of services. And finally, they will be prohibited from increasing \ntheir number of beds or operating rooms. I believe that halting the \ngrowth in physician ownership at existing specialty hospitals is the \nonly way to prevent the inherent conflict of interest associated with \nself-referral, and ensure that patients' interests are not compromised.\n  Now, I have heard from a number of physician-owners on this issue and \nthey have said to me that they invest in these hospitals because it \nallows them to have greater control over their workplace. It gives them \na say in operations, and more control over the quality and cost of \npatient care. I believe that certain coordinated care incentive \narrangements have the potential to assist physicians in doing just \nthat.\n  So this bill would provide an opportunity to better align physician \nand hospital financial incentives. It would allow physicians to share \nin hospital savings achieved by re-engineering clinical care in the \nhospitals. These well-designed and approved arrangements might include \nagreed-upon use of certain medical devices or implants for certain type \nof surgeries. Or perhaps they would include improving operating room \nefficiency and scheduling. Or they might include the adoption of \nclinical protocols or evidence-based medicine to standardize certain \naspects of the practice of medicine.\n  While these arrangements have the potential to improve patient care \nwhile reducing hospital costs, I want to make sure the patient--the \nMedicare beneficiary--is protected. So, this bill would require the \nsecretary to develop safeguards and monitor these coordinated care \narrangements to make sure that physicians are not profiting for \nincreased referrals or for reducing quality care.\n  In summary, The Hospital Fair Competition Act would:\n  Improve the accuracy of Medicare inpatient payments by directing the \nsecretary to level the playing field by using estimated costs rather \nthan charges in setting the DRG weights; calculating DRG weights at the \nhospital level before aggregating them to a national level; adjusting \nthe DRG weights to account for high cost outlier payments, and ensuring \nthat the DRGs appropriately capture differences in the severity of \nillness of patients.\n  Allow existing specialty hospitals to continue operation under \ncertain restrictions, especially regarding physician investment.\n  Close the ``whole hospital'' loophole by prohibiting new specialty \nhospitals from having ownership or investment interest from physicians \nwho refer Medicare or Medicaid patients to the hospital, effective June \n8, 2005.\n  Allow physicians and hospitals to enter into certain coordinated care \narrangements where physicians could share in savings experienced by a \nhospital by implementing certain cost-reduction efforts.\n  Establish safeguards to ensure that coordinated care arrangements \nprotect quality of care and minimize any impact on physician referrals.\n  I urge all my colleagues to join Senator Baucus and me in support of \nthis very important bill.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today to join Chairman Grassley in \nintroducing the Hospital Fair Competition Act of 2005.\n  This bill, based primarily on recommendations of the Medicare Payment \nAdvisory Commission (MedPAC), will improve the accuracy of Medicare's \ninpatient hospital prospective payment system (PPS); prevent the \nestablishment of new specialty hospitals to which physician-owners can \nself-\n\n[[Page S4948]]\n\nrefer, while allowing existing physician-owned specialty hospitals to \ncontinue with restrictions; and allow ``gainsharing'' arrangements to \nfoster improved physician-hospital efficiency. This legislation is \nimportant for patients, taxpayers, and the Medicare program, and I urge \nmy colleagues to support it.\n  About 17 months ago, Congress passed the Medicare Modernization Act--\nthe MMA. This 400-page bill included many important provisions, \nincluding long-awaited outpatient drug benefits under Medicare.\n  The MMA also included a small provision--Section 507--related to the \nconstruction of physician-owned specialty hospitals. These facilities \nspecialize in cardiac, orthopedic or general surgical care, and are \npartly- or wholly-owned by physicians. The provision was a response to \ngrowing concerns over physician self-referral, and placed a moratorium \non the construction of new, physician-owned specialty hospitals, while \n``grandfathering'' existing facilities and those in development.\n  Having reviewed several independent analyses on this issue, I believe \nCongress was right to place a moratorium on specialty hospital \nconstruction. And I also believe that moratorium should effectively be \nextended permanently, while allowing existing facilities to continue \noperating in their current capacity.\n  Some view specialty hospitals as innovative, focused factories for \nhigh-quality, specialized care. Advocates for these facilities say that \nby focusing on a limited number of services, specialty hospitals \nprovide excellent care at a good price, while adding competition to the \nhealth care marketplace.\n  Others say specialty hospitals flourish because they exploit a \nMedicare loophole allowing physician-owners to select patients who are \nhealthier and, therefore, more profitable.\n  For my part, I don't want to stand in the way of innovation or \ncompetition. For example, I'm glad that Congress brought innovation to \nMedicare in the form of outpatient drug benefits. That was long \noverdue.\n  And hospitals and physicians should work together in innovative ways \nto improve efficiency in health care. The U.S. spends twice as much--or \nmore--per-person on health care compared to any other developed \ncountry. And yet, our health outcomes are worse than theirs. We should \nget a better bang for our health-care buck, and we can take steps to \nthat end by encouraging quality and accountability in health care.\n  That's why I am pushing to advance incentives for quality improvement \nin Medicare, so patients--and taxpayers--get the most for their money. \nI introduced legislation last year to require that Medicare pay \ndialysis providers and Medicare managed care plans based on the quality \nof care they provide. And I am working on legislation to extend these \nprinciples of paying for quality to other parts of Medicare.\n  As for competition, I'm all for it--as long as it's carried out on a \nlevel playing field. But when it comes to physician ownership of \nspecialty hospitals, I'm not convinced the playing field is level. \nThat's because physicians alone choose where patients go on the playing \nfield--either to community hospitals or specialty hospitals. Some liken \nphysician-owners of specialty hospitals to coaches who choose the \nstarting lineup for both teams--in this case, the specialty hospital \nteam and the community hospital team.\n  And for the third time, a Federal agency has told us that the \nhealthiest teams, that is, the most profitable patients, end up at \nphysician-owned specialty hospitals.\n  In 2003, the non-partisan Government Accountability Office (GAO) \nreported that, by and large, specialty hospitals care for relatively \nhealthier patients than their community hospital counterparts. GAO \nsurveyed 25 specialty hospitals, and found that 21 of the 25 had a less \nacute mix patients than community hospitals. GAO determined that of the \nhospitals studied, 17 percent cardiac patients seen by specialty \nhospitals could be classified as severe cases, compared with 22 percent \nin general hospitals. And about 5 percent of orthopedic cases in \nspecialty hospitals were severe, compared with 8 percent in community \nhospitals.\n  Earlier this year, on March 8, MedPAC issued its MMA-mandated report \non specialty hospitals, and arrived at findings similar to those of the \nGAO. MedPAC found that despite shorter lengths of stay, physician-owned \nspecialty hospitals are not more cost efficient than community \nhospitals. MedPAC found that specialty hospitals tend to treat lower \nshares of Medicaid patients than community hospitals. And, just as GAO \ndid, MedPAC found that specialty hospitals treat patients who are \ngenerally less sick--and therefore, more profitable--compared to \ncommunity hospitals.\n  And while the Department of Health and Human Services has not \nofficially issued its MMA-mandated report on the topic--but is expected \nto shortly--HHS reported on March 8 that, based on the small number of \nfacilities it studied, specialty hospitals tend to care for a healthier \npatient population than their community hospital counterparts.\n  I believe the phenomenon of specialty hospitals treating healthier \npatients is the result of a loophole in the Stark self-referral law. \nThis loophole--related to the ``whole hospital exception''--is one that \nshould be closed. If it is not closed, Congress will effectively \nsanction the practice of physician self-referral that has been \nprohibited for years.\n  In 1989, the HHS Inspector General reported that patients of \nreferring physicians who owned or invested in independent clinical labs \nreceived 45% more lab services than Medicare patients in general.\n  In 1992, a study found that physical therapy visits per patient were \n39% to 45% higher in facilities with physician ownership compared to \nthose without. In short, the authors of the study found that \nutilization and charges per-patient were higher when facilities were \nowned by physicians with an ownership interest.\n  In response to these studies and others like them, Congress passed \nthe Stark laws, to prevent physician self-referral, first in the area \nof clinical labs, and subsequently in 10 other areas, including \nphysical therapy and certain imaging procedures.\n  But the Stark laws did not address the issue of physician self-\nreferral to specialty hospitals. In part, that's because there weren't \nmany specialty hospitals at the time. As the GAO pointed out in its \n2003 report, the vast majority of specialty hospitals were built in \n1992 or later.\n  Instead, the Stark law included a provision that has come to be known \nas the ``whole hospital exception.'' While the Stark law prohibits \nphysicians with ownership interest in only a hospital department from \nreferring patients to that department, the law does allow physicians to \nrefer to a facility they partially own, under two conditions. First, \nthe physician must have admitting privileges in that hospital. Second, \nthe physician must have a financial interest in the ``whole hospital,'' \nnot just a department of the hospital.\n  As the GAO explained in 2003:\n\n     ``The premise [of the whole hospital exception] is that any \n     referral or decision made by a physician who has a stake in \n     an entire hospital would produce little personal economic \n     gain because hospitals tend to provide a diverse and large \n     group of services. However, the Stark law does prohibit \n     physicians who have ownership interest only in a hospital \n     subdivision from referring patients to that subdivision. With \n     respect to specialty hospitals, the concern exists that, as \n     these hospitals are usually much smaller in size and scope \n     than general hospitals and closer in size to hospital \n     departments, the exception to Stark could allow physician \n     owners to influence their hospitals'--and therefore their own \n     financial gain through practice patterns and referrals.''\n\n  The problem with the ``whole hospital'' loophole is that it treats a \n10-bed surgical facility the same as a 500-bed community hospital, even \nthough that 10-bed facility more resembles a department of the 500-bed \nhospital than it does the hospital itself. This loophole is unfair, and \nour bill closes it, by preventing the establishment of new specialty \nhospitals to which physician-owners can self-refer.\n\n  Let me note that our bill does nothing to prevent the construction of \nnew specialty hospitals--as long as self-referral is not part of the \nbusiness model. Hospitals specializing in one type of care or another \nhave existed in this country for years, and should be encouraged--as \nlong as their owners and referrers are not one and the same.\n  Opponents of this bill will likely make at least three claims. First, \nthey\n\n[[Page S4949]]\n\nwill state that preventing the construction of new, physician-owned \nspecialty hospitals is anticompetitive. Second, they will suggest that \nsince the average physician-owner's share in a specialty hospital is \nsmall, economic incentives to self-refer are minimal. Third, they will \nclaim the bill thwarts health care quality. Let me take these claims in \nturn.\n  As I stated previously, I am all for competition--as long as it's \nfair. But I don't think it's fair to further a system in which \nphysician-owners can send healthier and more profitable patients to \nfacilities they own, while sending sicker, less-profitable ones to \nhospitals they don't own. There's a reason Congress acted to mitigate \nthe effects of physician self referral over 15 years ago, and I see no \nreason why that principle should not be extended to the specialty \nhospital setting.\n  On the issue of economic incentives, some argue that physician self-\nreferral to specialty hospitals is a non-issue, since physicians \ntypically own a very small share of a particular facility. In fact, \nMedPAC found that in about one-third of specialty hospitals they \nsurveyed, the largest share owned by a single physician was just two \npercent. And as a group, physicians own just over a third of the \ntypical heart hospital. But MedPAC also pointed out that about one-\nthird of orthopedic and surgical hospitals were owned almost entirely \nby their physicians. Perhaps more important, MedPAC showed that even a \nrelatively small ownership interest can reap large profits for an \nindividual physician investor. Page 21 of MedPAC's March report on \nspecialty hospitals says:\n\n     What is the order of magnitude of physicians financial \n     incentives to increase utilization when they own a hospital? \n     What follows is a hypothetical example of the marginal profit \n     associated with a group of cardiologists each referring just \n     one additional patient (above the current patient load) for \n     coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery. In fiscal year \n     2002, the base payment for CABG surgery with cardiac \n     catheterization (DRG 107) was roughly $24,000. Our \n     examination of Medicare cost reports and hospital financial \n     statements suggests that variable costs equal approximately \n     60 percent of the DRG payment, roughly $14,400. Hence the \n     marginal profit--payments minus variable cost--would be \n     $9,600 per patient ($24,000-$14,400). If 10 cardiologists \n     owned a 3 percent interest each and they all induced one \n     additional surgery per year, each cardiologist's income would \n     increase by $2,880 ($9,600 3% 10).''\n\n  In other words, even a small ownership share--just three percent--can \nprovide a strong profit motive--and a strong incentive toward self-\nreferral.\n  Finally, let me address the third claim that will likely be made \nagainst this bill--that it thwarts the provision of quality care. \nSpecialty hospital advocates claim that due to the focused nature of \ntheir mission, physician-owned specialty hospitals provide better \nquality and outcomes than their community hospital counterparts. But \nrecently the New England Journal of Medicine published a study showing \nthat patients undergoing certain heart procedures in specialty \nhospitals were less likely to have coexisting conditions than those \nbeing treated at general hospitals. The authors of the study stated, \n``. . . given that we found no significant differences in outcomes \nbetween specialty and general hospitals with similar volumes or between \nspecialty cardiac hospitals and specialized general hospitals, it could \nbe argued that the specialty-hospital model itself does not yield \nbetter outcomes.'' They also said, ``. . . our study provides no \ndefinitive evidence that cardiac specialty hospitals provide better or \nmore efficient care than general hospitals with similar procedural \nvolumes.''\n  In short, there is solid evidence that despite being less efficient, \nphysician-owned specialty hospitals care for healthier, more-profitable \npatients, leaving community hospitals to care for sicker, less-\nprofitable ones. Economic incentives toward physician self-referral in \nspecialty hospitals are significant. And there is slim evidence that \nspecialty hospitals provide better care than community hospitals.\n  Given this evidence, it's clear that Congress should not facilitate \nthe construction of more physician-owned specialty hospitals. And while \nwe support ``grandfathering'' existing facilities, let me make clear \nthat we do not intend to create another grandfathering period if the \nlegislation is not enacted before June 8, 2005. The intent of this \nbill, even if it passes after June 8, is to effectively make permanent \nthe MMA-mandated moratorium.\n  But this bill does more than simply prevent the establishment of new, \nphysician-owned specialty hospitals. It also takes steps to mitigate \nill incentives in the inpatient PPS, by making the PPS more accurate \nfor all providers of hospital care--community hospitals and \n`grandfathered' specialty hospitals alike.\n  Medicare spends about $100 billion per year on inpatient hospital \nservices, and it's important that this system be accurate. Accordingly, \nMedPAC recommended a number of steps to improve the accuracy of the \nMedicare inpatient payment system. These recommendations should \nmitigate incentives for all hospitals to choose healthy patients over \nsick ones, and to focus on some diagnoses at the expense of others.\n  Medicare pays hospitals for inpatient services based on roughly 500 \nDiagnosis Related Groups (DRGs), which bundle services needed to treat \na patient with a particular disease. DRGs cover most routine operating \ncosts attributable to patient care, including routine nursing services, \nroom and board, and diagnostic and ancillary services. Under current \nlaw, just over five percent of the base payment for all DRGs is set \naside for inpatient outlier payments, even though some DRGs have almost \nno outlier cases. The Hospital Fair Competition Act directs the \nSecretary to adjust the DRG relative weights to account for differences \nin the prevalence of high-cost outlier cases, thereby removing their \ndisproportionate impact on the payment system.\n\n  The bill also improves accuracy of the DRG weights. Currently DRG \nweights are based on the national average of hospital charges for a \nparticular DRG. The rate of growth for these charges may vary \ndramatically, depending on the service. For example, MedPAC has found \nthat hospital markups for ancillary services (e.g., supplies, operating \nroom time) tend to be higher than those of routine services (e.g., room \nand board, nursing care). As these ancillary and routine charges grow \nat different rates, the DRGs reflect that growth, gradually skewing the \nsystem away from the true costs of providing care. In short, a charge-\nbased system causes Medicare to pay too much for some services, not \nenough for others. The Hospital Fair Competition Act directs the \nSecretary to substitute the charge-based system with one based on \nhospitals' costs, as well as base the DRG weights on the national \naverage of hospitals' relative values in each DRG.\n  Mind you, we believe that the Secretary currently has the authority \nto make the payment changes outlined above. The Hospital Fair \nCompetition Act simply directs the Secretary to do so. We also believe \nthe Secretary has the authority to promulgate regulations defining what \na ``whole hospital'' is. When Congress passed the ``whole hospital \nexception'', it did not intend to allow self-referral to facilities \nthat are effectively the equivalent of a hospital wing or department. \nWe believe the Secretary can and should exercise his authority to close \nthe ``whole hospital'' loophole by regulation.\n  Mr. President, some say that the proliferation of physician-owned \nspecialty hospitals is a function of physicians' desire for control \nover their workplace. They argue that physicians typically have no say \nin day-to-day hospital operations, and thus little incentive to improve \nthe quality or efficiency of the care they provide in the hospital. \nMedPAC's recommendations for ``gainsharing'' stand to alleviate some of \nthat concern, by giving physicians more control over their workplace.\n  Gainsharing arrangements allow physicians and hospitals to improve \nhospital efficiency without the undesirable effects of physician self-\nreferral. In a gainsharing arrangement, hospitals and physicians share \ncost-savings gained by means such as streamlining the purchase of \nmedical devices, substituting less-costly items used in surgical \nprocedures, and maximizing operating room efficiency. While gainsharing \narrangements must be developed carefully so as not to compromise \nquality of patient care, gain sharing has the potential to align \nphysician-hospital incentives so that care\n\n[[Page S4950]]\n\ncan be delivered in the most cost-effective manner.\n  I realize that gainsharing arrangements are not a panacea toward \nimproving physician-hospital relations. We can and should do more to \ngive providers of all types a better stake in improving their workplace \nand the quality of care they provide. That's why I am pushing \ninitiatives to tie Medicare payment to quality, so that--unlike the \ncurrent system--the best providers are not paid the same rates as \nmediocre ones. This system of paying for quality stands to improve \naccountability across the spectrum of Medicare provider types, and give \nboth patients and the government more for their money.\n  We all know that Medicare's long-term fiscal future is much in doubt. \nHardly a day passes without a warning about Medicare's finances and the \nretirement of the Baby Boom generation that will complicate the long-\nterm financial picture of the program.\n  Given these warnings, it's imperative that we make the most of the \nresources at hand, and--where possible--make Medicare a better more \nresponsible buyer of health care. By leveling the playing field \nregarding patient referrals; improving the accuracy of Medicare's \ninpatient hospital payments; and giving physicians a larger stake in \ntheir hospital workplaces, this bill stands to do that.\n  Chairman Grassley and I believe these changes will go a long way \ntoward improving much of what ails hospital payment under Medicare, and \nwe urge our colleagues' support for this important legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. McCAIN:\n  S. 1003. A bill to amend the Act of December 22, 1974, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Indian Affairs.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to \namend the Navajo-Hopi Land Settlement Act of 1974 in order to bring the \nrelocation process to an orderly conclusion. I look forward to working \nwith all affected parties on this bill and will work with them to \nensure it takes into account their views. This bill will phase out the \nNavajo-Hopi relocation program by September 30, 2008, and at that time \ntransfer all remaining responsibilities to the Secretary of the \nInterior. It provides a time certain for eligible Navajo and Hopi \nindividuals to apply for and receive relocation benefits and after that \ntime the Federal Government will no longer be obligated to provide \nreplacement homes for those individuals. Under this legislation, the \nfunds that would have been used to provide replacement homes to such \nindividuals will be held in trust by the Secretary for distribution to \nthe individual or their heirs.\n  The Navajo-Hopi Land Settlement Act of 1974 was enacted to resolve \nlongstanding disputes that have divided the Navajo and Hopi Indian \nTribes for over a century. The origins of this dispute can be traced \ndirectly to the creation of the 1882 reservation for the Hopi Tribe and \nthe subsequent creation of the 1934 Navajo Reservation. At the time \nthese reservations were established, Navajo families lived within the \nlands set aside for the Hopi Tribe and Hopi families lived within lands \nset aside for the Navajo Nation and tensions between the two tribes \ncontinued to heighten. In 1958 Congress, in an effort to resolve this \ndispute, passed legislation that authorized the tribes to file suit in \nFederal court to quiet title the 1882 reservation and to their \nrespective claims and rights. That legislation gave rise to over 35 \nyears of continuous litigation between the tribes in an effort to \nresolve their respective rights and claims to the land.\n  In 1974, Congress enacted the Navajo-Hopi Land Settlement Act which \nestablished Navajo and Hopi negotiating teams under the auspices of a \nFederal mediator to negotiate a settlement to the 1882 reservation land \ndispute. The act also authorized the tribes to file suit in Federal \ncourt to quiet title the 1934 reservation and to file claims for \ndamages arising out of the dispute against each other or the United \nStates. The act also established a three member Navajo-Hopi Indian \nRelocation Commission to oversee the relocation of members of the \nNavajo Nation who were living on lands partitioned to the Hopi Tribe \nand members of the Hopi Tribe who were living on lands partitioned to \nthe Navajo Nation. Since its establishment, the relocation program has \nbeen an extremely difficult and contentious process.\n  When this program was first established, the estimated cost of \nproviding relocation benefits to approximately 6,000 Navajos estimated \neligible for relocation was roughly $40 million. These figures woefully \nunderestimated the number of families impacted by relocation and the \ntremendous delays that have plagued this program. By 1996, the United \nStates had expended over $350 million to relocate more than 11,000 \nNavajo and Hopi tribal members. At that time, there remained over 640 \neligible families who had never received relocation benefits and an \nadditional 50 to 100 families who had never applied for relocation \nbenefits. There were also over 130 eligibility appeals pending. Without \nquestion, the funding for this settlement has far exceeded the original \ncost estimates by more than 1000 percent. Since 1975, Congress \nhas appropriated over $440 million for this program.\n\n  At its inception, the relocation program was intended to be a \ntemporary program that was established to fulfill a specific mission \nand we cannot continue to fund it with no end in sight. Moreover, I am \nconvinced that our current Federal budgetary pressures require us to \nensure that the Navajo-Hopi relocation housing program is brought to an \norderly and certain conclusion. It is for that reason that I am \nintroducing the Navajo-Hopi Land Settlement Act Amendments of 2005. \nThis legislation will phase out the Navajo-Hopi Indian relocation \nprogram by September 30, 2008, and transfer the remaining \nresponsibilities under the act to the Secretary of the Interior. Under \nthe bill, the relocation commissioner shall transfer to the Secretary \nsuch funds as are necessary to construct replacement homes for any \neligible head of household who has left the Hopi partitioned land but \nwho has not received a replacement home by September 30, 2008. These \nfunds will be held in trust by the Secretary of the Interior for \ndistribution to such individual or their heirs. In addition, the bill \nincludes provisions establishing an expedited procedure for handling \nappeals of final eligibility determinations.\n  This bill is similar to the legislation I introduced during the 104th \nCongress. S. 1111 proposed to phase out the relocation program by \nSeptember 2001. A hearing was held on that bill and comments were \nreceived from the affected parties. At that time, many of the witnesses \nstated that with limited exception, the program could come to a \nresolution under the time line proposed in S. 1111. Opposition to \npassing the legislation was based in part on the incomplete process of \napproval of the accommodation lease agreements between the Hopi Tribe \nand individual Navajos who were still living on the Hopi partitioned \nlands. That action has since occurred and the Commission has had eight \nadditional years to conclude its responsibilities. Therefore, it is now \ntime for the Congress to act to bring the long and difficult process of \nrelocation to an orderly conclusion.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the bill be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1003\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to prevent a severe reduction in the Federal medical \nassistance percentage determined for a State for fiscal year 2006; to \nthe Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation with \nSenators Snowe, Rockefeller, Hutchison, Reid, and Jeffords that would \nincrease Medicaid Federal matching payments to 28 States by addressing \na problem with the Medicaid funding formula that is expected to result \nin a majority of States in the country having their Federal matching \nrate drop this coming fiscal year.\n  Our legislation, the ``Medicaid Formula Fairness Act of 2005,'' would \nprotect these 28 States from decreases in the amount of Federal funding \nthey can expect to receive in fiscal year 2006. For the vulnerable low-\nincome children, pregnant women, disabled, and senior citizens that the \nMedicaid programs in those 28 States serve. This legislation may be the \nonly thing preventing them from losing their health benefits and \njoining the ranks of our Nation's uninsured, which is already at 45 \nmillion people.\n  In New Mexico, more than one-in-five or over 400,000 New Mexicans are \nuninsured and the State is facing a $78 million reduction in the \nfederal Medicaid matching rate for fiscal year 2006. This is not the \nresult of a dramatic upswing in the economy in New Mexico. The most \nrecent poverty data from the U.S. Census Bureau actually indicates an \nupswing in the percentage of New Mexicans in poverty at 18 percent--the \nsecond highest poverty rate in the country.\n  Thus, at the very time when there are more people in need of medical \ncare through the Medicaid program, the Federal Government is apparently \nreducing its assistance through Medicaid. So how is this possible?\n  The first problem is with the Medicaid matching formula itself. It is \nbased on per capita income, which was established as a proxy for both \nneed and State capacity many years ago. We now have much better data on \nwhat should be the factors in the Medicaid formula, including poverty \nand total taxable resource measures, but the old proxy of per capita \nincome remains.\n  Despite numerous reports from the General Accounting Office, the HHS \ninspector general, and outside organizations calling for such an update \nto the Federal Medicaid formula, nothing has happened over the years. \nRather than fighting that battle again, our legislation acknowledges \nthat we are stuck with per capita income as the formula factor. \nInstead, we take issue with how that factor is dropping Federal \nmatching rates across the Nation while the national poverty rate \ncontinues to rise. Again, how is this possible?\n  In the fall of 2004, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, \nCMS, published the Federal Medical Assistance Percentage, or FMAP, for \nfiscal year 2006 based on per capital income, PCI, data from 2001, \n2002, and 2003. According to the Federal Funds Information for States, \nFFIS, Issue Brief in September 2004, changes in the FMAP will \ncause States to lose a net $527 million in Federal matching funds in \nthe Medicaid Program with decreases of $867 million to 29 States \npartially offset by increases for 9 States.\n\n  CMS acknowledges that 29 States will lose Federal funding, nine \nStates will gain, and the balance of the States will not be impacted by \nthe Medicaid changes because the latter group of 12 States are already \nat the statutory minimum FMAP of 50 percent.\n  Federal law dictates that the FMAP is determined based on the ``three \nmost recent calendar years for which satisfactory data are available \nfrom the Department of Commerce.'' Thus, for fiscal year 2006, the PCI \ndata used is from the years 2001, 2002, and 2003. The Federal intent of \na 3-year rolling average is to limit the fluctuations that States might \nexperience since only one-third of the formula is changed on a yearly \nbasis. In other words, Congress felt it important enough to limit the \nfluctuations in the matching rate through the 3-year rolling average of \nPCI data that the result is the use of data from 2001 for the \ncalculation of the fiscal year 2006 FMAP.\n  However, as analysis by the Oklahoma Health Care Authority indicates, \nin the case of the calculation, of the fiscal year 2006 FMAP, the U.S. \nDepartment of Commerce's Bureau of Economic Analysis, BEA, performed a \ncomprehensive revision of its calculation of PCI in 2003, as it does \nevery 4 to 5 years, and provided revised data for previous years as \nwell. As a result, CMS changed the 2001 and 2002 PCI data for States in \nthe calculation, Consequently, all 3 years of the PCI data were being \nchanged rather than just one-third.\n  The result is rather dramatic fluctuations--mostly negative--to State \nFMAP calculations, As the FFIS Issue Brief indicated, ``Fifteen States \nare projected to have changes of greater than one percentage point in \nfiscal year 2006, compared to only three for FY 2005.'' Not since 1998 \nhave the fluctuations been this dramatic.\n  According to the Congressional Research Service (CRS), the average \nchange in the FMAP between fiscal year 2001 and fiscal year 2002 was \n-0.26 percentage points, for fiscal year 2003 it was +0.32, for fiscal \nyear 2004 it was +0.12, and for fiscal year 2005 it was -0.09. Thus, \nover this 4-year period, the average change in the national FMAP was \nless than 0.2 percentage points. However, due in part to the \nrebenchmarking of data by BEA, the fiscal year 2006 change in the FMAP \nwill be -0.55 percentage points. Compared to average change over the \npreceeding 4 years, the fiscal year 2006 FMAP change will be almost \nthree times as dramatic.\n  As a result, 29 States will absorb a decline in the FMAP for fiscal \nyear 2006. The Oklahoma Health Care Authority estimates that this will \ncost those States $860 million. The largest projected percentage point \ndecreases are for Alaska, -7.42, Wyoming, -3.67, New Mexico, -3.15, \nOklahoma, -2.27, Maine, -1.99, West Virginia, -1.66, North Dakota, \n-1.64, Vermont, -1.62, Utah, -1.38, Montana, -1.36, Alabama, -1.32, \nLouisiana, -1.25, Nevada, -1.14, and Mississippi, -1.08.\n  The largest dollar declines would be experienced by the states of New \nMexico, -$79 million, Louisiana, -$72 million, Alaska, -$69 million, \nTennessee, -$68 million, Oklahoma, -$66 million,\n\n[[Page S4957]]\n\nAlabama, -$55 million, and Maine, -$47 million.\n  FFIS adds, ``While the changes in FY 2006 are significant, for many \nstates they only add to previous reductions. Thirteen states (Alaska, \nKentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Montana, New Mexico, North Dakota, \nOklahoma, Rhode Island, Vermont, West Virginia, Wisconsin, and Wyoming) \nwill experience three consecutive reductions--from the fiscal relief \nFMAP to the base FMAP in FY 2004 to a second reduction in FY 2005 and a \nthird in FY 2006. The cumulative 5-year reduction for a number of \nStates is large, and for many unprecedented--Wyoming (-10.37), Alaska \n(-9.97), North Dakota (-4.14), Vermont (-3.91), Oklahoma (-3.33), Maine \n(-3.22), and South Dakota (-3.24).''\n  The loss in funds to these 29 States is already resulting in planned \ncuts in benefits and services to Medicaid eligible recipients, such as \nlow-income children, pregnant women, the elderly and disabled, and \ndecreased reimbursement to Medicaid providers, including physicians, \nhospitals, nursing homes, community health centers, etc.\n  In an effort to minimize the dramatic fluctuations in the Fiscal Year \n2006 FMAP, this legislation would limit the loss of States in the FMAP \nto 0.5 percentage points, which restores $442 million of the lost \nMedicaid dollars to 18 States. The bill would also give 10 additional \nStates a higher FMAP if changes to PCI for 2001 and 2002 were not \nretroactively applied by CMS. This translates to approximately $229 \nmillion for a total of $671 million. This is still far less than the \n$860 million lost to the 29 States by FMAP reductions.\n  Therefore, this legislation I am introducing with Senator Snowe and \nothers does not hold States entirely harmless. However, it does limit \nthe losses in Federal Medicaid matching funds that States are expected \nto absorb due to problems with the use of per capita income as a factor \nin the Medicaid formula but also in how it is used. Our legislation \nmitigates those problems, and does so with the expressed intent of \npreventing millions of additional Americans from joining the ranks of \nthe uninsured as many of our States will be forced to undertake cuts to \nthe Medicaid program to make up for lost Federal funding.\n  Specifically, the bill allows States to get the better of: 1. the \nFMAP as calculated by CMS; 2. a recalculated FMAP without retroactively \nchanging the 2001 and 2002 per capita income data; or, 3. a hold \nharmless limiting the reduction in the FMAP to 0.5 percentage points.\n  In New Mexico, for example, the ``Medicaid Formula Fairness Act of \n2005'' would restore $66 million of the $78 million that New Mexico is \nscheduled to lose due to the drop in the Federal Medicaid matching \nrate. The other 27 States that would benefit from the legislation and \nthe estimated amount they would receive are as follows: Texas--$113 \nmillion, New Mexico--$66 million, Alaska--$64 million, Oklahoma--$52 \nmillion, Louisiana--$43 million, Maine--$35 million, Alabama--$34 \nmillion, West Virginia--$27 million, Tennessee--$27 million, Florida--\n$25 million, Mississippi--$22 million, Arizona--$22 million, Nevada--\n$17 million, Arkansas--$14 million, Utah--$14 million, North Carolina--\n$14 million, Wyoming--$13 million, Vermont--$10 million, Wisconsin--$9 \nmillion, Rhode Island--$8 million, Georgia--$8 million, Oregon--$6 \nmillion, North Dakota--$6 million, Montana--$6 million, South \nCarolina--$6 million, Idaho--$5 million, South Dakota--$3 million, and \nKansas--$2 million.\n  I would like to thank the Oklahoma Health Care Authority, including \nMike Fogarty and Stephen Weiss, for their outstanding work in analyzing \nthe problem with the Fiscal Year 2006 FMAP and for their technical \nassistance and counsel toward the introduction of this legislation. I \nwould also like to thank Senators Snowe, Rockefeller, Hutchison, Reid, \nand Jeffords for providing bipartisan support as original cosponsors of \nthis important legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and a letter be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There be no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord.\n\n                                S. 1007\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Jeff Bingaman,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Bingaman: On behalf of our 4,700 hospital, \n     health care system, and other health care provider members, \n     and our 31,000 individual members, the American Hospital \n     Association (AHA) is writing to express our support for your \n     legislation to limit FY 2006 Medicaid federal medical \n     assistance percentage (FMAP) reductions.\n       Recently the Bureau of Economic Affairs in the Department \n     of Commerce re-benchmarked per capita income for states, and \n     the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) \n     retroactively applied the changes. The Medicaid FMAP uses a \n     three-year rolling average to smooth out dramatic changes in \n     the states' matching rates from year-to-year. By \n     retroactively applying the new benchmark, however, CMS \n     undermined the rationale of the three-year rolling average; \n     therefore 22 states will see their FMAP drop by more than 0.5 \n     percentage points in FY 2006--a reduction of an estimated \n     $752 million in FY 2006. About $550 million of this is due to \n     the retroactive recalculation.\n       The prospect of more Medicaid hospital payment reductions \n     due to decreased federal Medicaid funding is a serious threat \n     to the viability of hospitals and the patients they serve. We \n     realize that it is critical that states provide their share \n     of the state-federal Medicaid funding match in order for \n     vulnerable citizens to obtain and retain health care coverage \n     and health services. Your legislation would help states by \n     limiting the FMAP drop to 0.5 percent, restoring $468 million \n     of the funds that are lost due to the recalculation of per \n     capita income.\n       We applaud your leadership on this issue and support \n     enactment of this legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Rick Pollack,\n                                         Executive Vice President.\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senator Bingaman \ntoday, along with Senators Rockefeller, Hutchison, Reid, and Jeffords, \nin introducing the Medicaid Formula Fairness Act of 2005. This \nlegislation will provide a temporary increase in Medicaid Federal \nmatching payments to 28 States and thereby avoid a significant loss \nfunds which would otherwise occur due to a precipitous and unpredicted \ndrop in the Federal matching rate for these States next year.\n  Medicaid provides essential medical care to low-income children, \npregnant women, parents of dependent children, senior citizens, and \npeople with disabilities and functions as a critical safety net for our \nmost vulnerable populations. Enrollment in the Medicaid program has \ngrown by nearly one-third since the beginning of 2001, as the numbers \nof those in poverty and individuals without private health insurance \ncontinues to increase. In Maine, where we have an older and less \nwealthy population, more than 300,000 people were enrolled in Medicaid \nlast year. One in five individuals in the State now receives health \ncare services through MaineCare, the State's Medicaid program.\n\n[[Page S4958]]\n\n  States have experienced severe fiscal stress during the last few \nyears, with sharp declines in revenues and budget shortfalls. This \neconomic downturn, from which many States are only now emerging, has \ncontinued to leave many families jobless and without health insurance, \nforcing to turn to Medicaid. This has put an enormous strain on the \nStates such as Maine which are already strapped with budget shortfalls. \nMany States reduced Medicaid benefits last year and even more \nrestricted Medicaid eligibility in an effort to satisfy their budgetary \nobligations.\n  The formula for calculating the Federal matching rate, known as the \nFederal Medical Assistance Percentage, FMAP, which determines the \nFederal Government's share of Medicaid expenditures, has contributed to \nthe Medicaid problems that States are facing. The FMAP formula is \ndesigned so that the Federal Government pays a larger portion of \nMedicaid costs in States with a per capita income lower than the \nnational average. Since Maine is a relatively poor State with a \ndisproportionately large low-income elderly population, it has had a \nfavorable Federal-State match in recent years, 66 percent in 2004. This \ntranslated to $1.4 billion in Federal dollars last year--two-thirds of \nMaineCare's $2 billion in Medicaid spending.\n  The size of Maine's Medicaid population means that any change in the \nFMAP has a disproportionately significant impact on Maine's budget. \nThis year, Maine's Federal matching rate decreased from 66.01 percent \nto 64.89 percent, a drop of more than one percent. The change in FMAP \nfor FY2006 is even greater and will cause 28 States, including Maine, \nto lose a significant amount of Federal matching funds next year. \nMaine's Federal matching rate will drop nearly two points, from 64.89 \npercent to 62.9 percent next year, which will result in Maine losing \n$46.7 million in Federal matching funds.\n  Under existing Federal law, the FMAP is determined based on the three \nmost recent calendar years for which data is available from the \nDepartment of Commerce. This 3 year ``look back'' captures a period of \ntime that is not necessarily reflective of a State's current financial \nsituation. The FMAP for FY 2003, for example, was calculated in 2001 \nfor the fiscal year beginning October 2002. The FY 2003 FMAP was \ndetermined on the basis, of State per capita income over the 3 year \nperiod of 1998 through 2000, when State economies were growing \nsignificantly. Yet in 2003, when this matching rate was in effect, a \nserious economic downturn was affecting many State budgets, and that \ndownturn has contributed greatly to the growth of Medicaid for several \nyears now.\n  We recognized this situation in the last Congress and provided for \nState fiscal relief by providing a temporary increase in the Federal \nMedicaid matching rate, which provided $10 billion in fiscal relief to \nStates during fiscal 2003 and 2004, when we passed the Jobs and Growth \nTax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003 but that temporary Federal fiscal \nrelief has now ended.\n  This Congress has reached a budget agreement which, among its terms, \ncalls for reductions of $10 billion in Medicaid spending over the next \n5 years. At this time, therefore, it is especially crucial that we \ncontinue to provide sufficient Federal matching funds for Medicaid, \nwhich has worked so well over the last 40 years. Our legislation is \nintended to be just a short term fix, for fiscal year 2006. It is my \nhope that we will see the creation of a Medicaid Commission to \nundertake a comprehensive review of the Medicaid program and make \nrecommendations on how to make Federal matching payments more equitable \nwith respect to the States and the populations they serve, as well as \nhow to make them more responsive to changes in States' economic \nconditions.\n  However, today, states such as Maine are facing dramatic and \nunpredictable fluctuations to their State FMAP formulas. This \nlegislation would limit the percentage decrease to a half percentage \npoint for fiscal year 2006 and help mitigate the drastic effects that a \nsevere loss Federal funding would have on our Medicaid population next \nyear.\n  I therefore urge my colleagues to join us supporting this legislation \nto help sustain funding for Medicaid in fiscal year 2006 to help ensure \nthat this critical health care safety net remains intact next year for \nthose who need it most.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/05/11/senate-section/article/S4958-1", "month": "05", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4958-S4960]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 619.

SENSE OF CONGRESS RELATING TO PROJECT EARMARKS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) the House of Representatives adopted a rule in 1914 \n     stating that it shall not be in order for any bill providing \n     general legislation with respect to roads to contain any \n     provision for any specific road;\n       (2) diverting funds to low-priority earmarks diminishes the \n     ability of States and local communities to establish \n     priorities and address mobility problems;\n       (3) the Government Accountability Office has reported that \n     demonstration projects reviewed were not considered by State \n     and regional transportation officials as critical to their \n     transportation needs, and more than half of the projects \n     reviewed were not included in State and local transportation \n     plans;\n       (4) some earmarks have nothing to do with transportation \n     and may worsen congestion by diverting scarce resources from \n     higher priorities;\n       (5) the Surface Transportation Assistance Act of 1982 (96 \n     Stat. 2097) contained 10 earmarks at a cost of $385,925,000;\n       (6) the Surface Transportation and Uniform Relocation \n     Assistance Act of 1987 (101 Stat. 132) contained 157 projects \n     at a cost of $1,416,000,000;\n       (7) the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of \n     1991 (105 Stat. 1914) contained 538 projects at a cost of \n     $6,082,873,000;\n       (8) the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century (112 \n     Stat. 107) contained 1,851 projects at a cost of \n     $9,359,850,000;\n       (9) annual transportation appropriations Acts demonstrate \n     the same trend in increasing earmarking of projects;\n       (10) the funding earmarked for many projects does not cover \n     the full cost of the project and requires State and local \n     communities to cover the unfunded costs; and\n       (11) funding of earmarked projects can have a dramatic \n     effect on the rate of return that a State receives on its \n     contributions to the Highway Trust Fund.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) the Safe, Accountable, Flexible, and Efficient \n     Transportation Equity Act of 2005 should not include project \n     earmarks;\n       (2) if earmarked projects are included, the projects should \n     be included within the funding that a State would otherwise \n     receive so as not to penalize other States; and\n       (3) any earmarked projects should be included in the \n     funding equity provisions of the next surface transportation \n     Act so that the projects do not adversely affect the rate of \n     return that a State receives from its contributions to the \n     Highway Trust Fund.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 721.

TEEN DRIVING SAFETY.\n\n       (a) Short Title.--This section may be cited as the ``Safe \n     Teen and Novice Driver Uniform Protection Act of 2005'' or \n     the ``STANDUP Act''.\n       (b) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The National Transportation Safety Board has reported \n     that--\n       (A) in 2002, teen drivers, which constituted only 6.4 \n     percent of all drivers, were involved in 14.3 percent of all \n     fatal motor vehicle crashes;\n       (B) motor vehicle crashes are the leading cause of death \n     for Americans between 15 and 20 years of age;\n       (C) between 1994 and 2003, almost 64,000 Americans between \n     15 and 20 years of age died in motor vehicle crashes, an \n     average of 122 per week; and\n       (D) in 2003--\n       (i) 3,657 American drivers between 15 and 20 years of age \n     were killed in motor vehicle crashes;\n       (ii) 300,000 Americans between 15 and 20 years of age were \n     injured in motor vehicle crashes; and\n       (iii) 7,884 American drivers between 15 and 20 years of age \n     were involved in fatal crashes, resulting in 9,088 total \n     fatalities, a 5 percent increase since 1993.\n       (2) Though only 20 percent of driving by young drivers \n     occurs at night, over 50 percent of the motor vehicle crash \n     fatalities involving young drivers occur at night.\n       (3) The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has \n     reported that--\n       (A) 6,300,000 motor vehicle crashes claimed the lives of \n     nearly 43,000 Americans in 2003 and injured almost 3,000,000 \n     more Americans;\n       (B) teen drivers between 16 and 20 years of age have a \n     fatality rate that is 4 times the rate for drivers between 25 \n     and 70 years of age; and\n       (C) drivers who are 16 years of age have a motor vehicle \n     crash rate that is almost ten times the crash rate for \n     drivers aged between 30 and 60 years of age.\n       (4) According to the Insurance Institute for Highway \n     Safety, the chance of a crash by a 16- or 17-year-old driver \n     is doubled if there are 2 peers in the vehicle and quadrupled \n     with 3 or more peers in the vehicle.\n       (5) In 1997, the first full year of its graduated driver \n     licensing system, Florida experienced a 9 percent reduction \n     in fatal and injurious crashes among young drivers between \n     the ages of 15 and 18, compared with 1995, according to the \n     Insurance Institute for Highway Safety.\n       (6) The Journal of the American Medical Association reports \n     that crashes involving 16-year-old drivers decreased between \n     1995 and 1999 by 25 percent in Michigan and 27 percent in \n     North Carolina. Comprehensive graduated driver licensing \n     systems were implemented in 1997 in these States.\n       (7) In California, according to the Automobile Club of \n     Southern California, teenage passenger deaths and injuries \n     resulting from crashes involving 16-year-old drivers declined \n     by 40 percent from 1998 to 2000, the first 3 years of \n     California's graduated driver licensing program. The number \n     of at-fault collisions involving 16-year-old drivers \n     decreased by 24 percent during the same period.\n       (8) The National Transportation Safety Board reports that \n     39 States and the District of Columbia have implemented 3-\n     stage graduated driver licensing systems. Many States have \n     not yet implemented these and other basic safety features of \n     graduated driver licensing laws to protect the lives of \n     teenage and novice drivers.\n       (9) A 2001 Harris Poll indicates that--\n       (A) 95 percent of Americans support a requirement of 30 to \n     50 hours of practice driving with an adult;\n       (B) 92 percent of Americans support a 6-month learner's \n     permit period; and\n       (C) 74 percent of Americans support limiting the number of \n     teen passengers in a car with a teen driver and supervised \n     driving during high-risk driving periods, such as night.\n       (c) State Graduated Driver Licensing Laws.--\n       (1) Minimum requirements.--A State is in compliance with \n     this subsection if the State has a graduated driver licensing \n     law that includes, for novice drivers under the age of 21--\n       (A) a 3-stage licensing process, including a learner's \n     permit stage and an intermediate stage before granting an \n     unrestricted driver's license;\n       (B) a prohibition of meaningful duration on nighttime \n     driving during the learner's permit and intermediate stages;\n       (C) a prohibition, during the intermediate stage, from \n     operating a motor vehicle with more than 1 non-familial \n     passenger under the age of 21 if there is no licensed driver \n     21 years of age or older present in the motor vehicle; and\n       (D) any other requirement that the Secretary of \n     Transportation (referred to in this section as the \n     ``Secretary'') may require, including--\n       (i) a learner's permit stage of at least 6 months;\n       (ii) an intermediate stage of at least 6 months;\n       (iii) for novice drivers in the learner's permit stage--\n\n       (I) a requirement of at least 30 hours of behind-the-wheel \n     training with a licensed driver who is over 21 years of age; \n     and\n       (II) a requirement that any such driver be accompanied and \n     supervised by a licensed driver 21 years of age or older at \n     all times when such driver is operating a motor vehicle;

A number of amendments have indeed been filed, and \nSenators who wish to offer amendments should contact the managers at \nonce.
