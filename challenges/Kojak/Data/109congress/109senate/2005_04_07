In the meantime, and under the consent agreement, we will \nbegin consideration of the appropriations bill at 3 p.m. on Monday. As \nannounced last night, there will be a vote on Monday evening at \napproximately 5:15. That vote will likely be on a district judge, \nalthough it is possible that additional votes will occur on amendments \nto the supplemental at that time.\n  I will have further announcements on the Monday schedule at the close \nof business today. Let me say, for all of our colleagues, turning to \nthe supplemental appropriations bill next week means we will have a \nvery busy week, with lots of votes and potentially one or more evening \nsessions.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/07/senate-section/article/S3341-7", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3341]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, I have three or four comments I want \nto make this morning. Most importantly, I want to say a word about the \nnew leadership in Iraq.\n  In a delegation led by the Democratic leader, Senator Reid of Nevada, \nseven of us were in Iraq, in Baghdad, about 10 days ago. We met with \ntwo of the three new leaders who have been chosen. Mr. al-Hasani, the \nnew speaker, a Sunni, spent some time with us. We spent an hour with \nDr. al-Jaafari who, just an hour ago, was named the new Prime Minister \nof Iraq, and who will be the most important leader we will be dealing \nwith.\n  I believe our delegation was one of the first from the Senate to \nspend that much time with the new leader of Iraq. I want to report that \nI was most impressed with what we saw there. We met a man in his late \nfifties, who had been in exile from Iraq for a number of years because \nof the brutality of Saddam Hussein. He is a physician. It seems as \nthough physicians are ascending in all sorts of different places, \nincluding in the U.S. Senate and in Iraq. He is a well-educated man and \nconducted our discussion in English. He showed in his presence a great \ndeal of calm. He is not a quiet man, but he is a calm man who seems to \nknow exactly what he believes and what he thinks.\n  I was taken with the fact that he began his discussion with us with \nabout a 5-minute monolog about the brutality of Saddam Hussein. He said \nhe was ``worse than Hitler, worse than Stalin.'' Those were his words. \nHe said Hussein had murdered a million people in 35 years. In his \nwords, al-Jaafari said ``he had buried 300,000 people alive.'' He said \nthat quietly, but he obviously feels that very deeply.\n  Second, I was most impressed with his understanding of U.S. history. \nWe talked about the difficulty of creating a democracy and how we are \nexpecting them to create a constitution by August. In our situation, \nyears ago, it took us 12 years from the time of the Declaration of \nIndependence to the time of our Constitution. Our Founders locked the \nnews media out for 6 months while they did that. Today, we are \nexpecting the Iraqis to come together--people of different \nbackgrounds--and have a constitution by August, while we watch and \ncriticize on 24/7 television everything they do.\n  He has a good understanding of U.S. history and, I thought, a great \nappreciation for democracy and freedom. He showed not only no \nresentment about the American presence in Iraq, he showed great \ngratitude for the American presence in Iraq. He wants us to stay there \nfor a while, so that there is enough security for their constitutional \ngovernment to form. He seemed very comfortable with that.\n  Finally, he is a brave man--brave during exile, brave today. There \nmay be only a few thousand people in Iraq--a country the size of \nCalifornia with 25 million people--who are causing all the trouble, but \nthey are making it a dangerous place to be. Even the Green Zone and the \nareas around it are not entirely safe.\n  So we have a sophisticated, English-speaking, well-educated, U.S.-\nhistory-knowing, brave man, who is the new leader of Iraq, a man who is \ngrateful for the American presence and who is determined to help create \na democracy. I congratulate the Iraqi people on the substantial \nachievement.\n  Also, Mr. al-Hasani, the new speaker, a Sunni--the new Prime Minister \nis a Shiite--was very impressive to us in the Senate delegation. He, as \nwell as the Prime Minister, wore western clothing in these meetings. I \nsay this as a fact, not as a judgment.\n  Mr. al-Hasani was educated in the U.S. at two major universities. He \nlived in Los Angeles during his exile. He created a business in Los \nAngeles. He went back to Iraq to help create a new democracy. He is \nalso a sophisticated person with a strong knowledge of freedom and \ndemocracy, a strong appreciation of the United States, and he is also a \nbrave man to be undertaking this. I congratulate the Iraqis for that.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/07/senate-section/article/S3342-3", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3342-S3343]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            CONSENT DECREES\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, I will ask unanimous consent to have \nprinted in the Record an article I wrote, which appeared in the Legal \nTimes for the week of April 4, entitled ``Free the People's Choice.'' \nThis involves a piece of legislation that Senators Pryor and Nelson on \nthe other side of the aisle and Senators Cornyn and Kyl on this side of \nthe aisle and I have introduced, which would make it possible for newly \nelected Governors and mayors and legislatures to do what they were \nelected to do and be free from outdated consent decrees their \npredecessors may have agreed to, and which exist with the approval of \nthe Federal courts.\n  We have hundreds of outdated Federal court-approved consent decrees \nacross America, which are running our education systems, foster care \nsystems, Medicaid systems, and they make it impossible for democracy to \nflourish in the U.S., at a time when people are fighting and dying to \ngive other people democracy in another part of the world. We have \nstrong Democratic and Republican support in the Senate for this. In the \nHouse, I finished a meeting with the Republican whip, Roy Blunt, who \nwith Congressman Cooper from Nashville, and all of the Democratic \nCongressmen from Tennessee, have introduced the same bill in the House.\n  This piece of legislation would put term limits on Federal court \nconsent decrees and cause them to be more narrowly drawn and do as the \nSupreme Court said they should do--get these issues back into the hands \nof the elected officials as soon as possible.\n  This legislation has strong support, and I hope it will be moving \nthrough the Judiciary Committee in proper fashion. It is the No. 1 \npriority of the National Governors Association and National Association \nof Counties, and many others. We cannot expect States to control the \ngrowth of Medicaid spending if we do not allow them to make their own \ndecisions. We need to get flexibility from our laws, and we need to get \nthe courts to step aside and let elected officials make policy \ndecisions.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this article be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                  [From the LegalTimes, Apr. 4, 2005]\n\n                        Free the People's Choice\n\n                          (By Lamar Alexander)\n\n       Imagine yourself the governor of a state grappling with a \n     broken public health care system. Your goal is to cover the \n     greatest number of people--particularly children--with the \n     best medicine available. But costs are spiraling out of \n     control, so you and your staff craft a reform package that \n     balances the health care needs of low-income citizens with \n     the fiscal realities of the state budget. The task is tough, \n     but this is why you ran for public office.\n       The story should end there, or, at least, you've reached \n     the point when you would present your plan to your fellow \n     elected officials in the state legislature, and they take a \n     vote--representative democracy at work. Only that's not \n     what's happening in states around the country, whether the \n     issue is health care or transportation or education.\n       Instead, the hands of governors, mayors, even school boards \n     have been tied by costly and restrictive consent decrees \n     handed down by federal courts, sometimes decades before. \n     These judicial orders result from agreements brokered between \n     public officials and plaintiffs engaged in civil court \n     actions. Once\n\n[[Page S3343]]\n\n     these decrees are set, they are very difficult to change, \n     making reform and common-sense adjustments over time \n     virtually impossible.\n       The result is what New York Law School professors Ross \n     Sandler and David Schoenbrod call ``democracy by decree''--\n     public institutions being taken out of public control and \n     placed in the hands of an unelected federal judiciary.\n       There are times when this is absolutely necessary, when \n     state and local governments defy federal law and \n     congressional intent. Desegregation is the best example. In \n     the civil rights era, the judiciary had no choice but to \n     exercise control over public institutions in order to \n     guarantee African-Americans their constitutional rights.\n       While ensuring that states follow the rule of law, consent \n     decrees can also preserve the separation of powers and uphold \n     the ideals of federalism. Unfortunately, in many cases, they \n     have done just the opposite.\n\n\n                          ROADBLOCKS TO REFORM\n\n       The hypothetical I offer above mirrors what is currently \n     happening in my home state of Tennessee. Three specific \n     consent decrees blocked the implementation of Democratic Gov. \n     Phil Bredesen's initial Medicaid reform package, which would \n     have preserved coverage for all 1.3 million enrollees of \n     TennCare, the state's Medicaid program. His plan was passed \n     overwhelmingly by the state's General Assembly and endorsed \n     by major stakeholders in the program, from patients to \n     providers.\n       But mandates set forth in these consent decrees--which far \n     exceed federal requirements--limited the governor's policy \n     choices and continue to drive up program costs. As a result, \n     Bredesen was recently forced to devise a new reform strategy, \n     which would cut 323,000 adults from the program and reduce \n     the benefits of the remaining 396,000 adults. Citing the \n     consent decrees, the courts are now blocking this proposal as \n     well.\n       The consent decrees cover a range of health care issues. \n     One signed by U.S. District Judge John Nixon in 1979, known \n     as the Grier consent decree, prevents the state from placing \n     reasonable limits or controls on prescription drugs, \n     including the use of cheaper generics in lieu of expensive \n     brand-name pharmaceuticals. As a result, Tennessee now spends \n     more on TennCare's pharmacy benefit than it does on higher \n     education.\n       The John B. consent decree, signed by Judge Nixon in 1998 \n     and revised in 2001 and 2004, imposes a host of special \n     requirements for children. From one line of federal code, the \n     court entered a consent decree that established a requirement \n     that Tennessee offer medical screenings to 80 percent of the \n     state's children--a laudable public policy goal but one that \n     should be set by the elected officials whose job it is to \n     manage the program.\n       Finally, the Rosen consent decree, signed by U.S. District \n     Judge William Haynes in 1998, prevents TennCare from \n     limiting enrollment when a person is part of an optional \n     Medicaid population or when a person's eligibility for the \n     program cannot be determined. To make matters worse, on \n     Jan. 29, 2005, Judge Haynes took his authority under that \n     consent degree a step further: He declared that he must \n     approve any changes to the TennCare system that would \n     reduce enrollment. With the budget clock ticking, \n     Tennessee's state legislators are now waiting for a U.S. \n     district judge to give them permission to do their job.\n       And Tennessee isn't alone. There are consent decrees in all \n     50 states on issues ranging from prisons to child care. In \n     Los Angeles, a consent decree entered in 1996 by U.S. \n     District Judge Terry Hatter Jr. has forced the Metropolitan \n     Transit Authority to spend 47 percent of its budget on city \n     buses, leaving just over half of the budget to pay for the \n     rest of the transportation needs of the nation's second-\n     largest city.\n       In New York, a 1974 consent decree entered by U.S. District \n     Judge Marvin Frankel has been mandating bilingual education \n     for more than 30 years. The result is that public schools, \n     which should be vibrant, learning, changing institutions, \n     have no choice but to force students into outdated bilingual \n     programs, even over the objections of their parents.\n\n\n                           A BETTER SOLUTION\n\n       The solution to the problem of democracy by decree is a \n     balanced system that protects the rights of individuals to \n     hold state and local governments accountable in court, while \n     preserving our democratic process through narrowly drawn \n     agreements that respect elected officials' public policy \n     choices. These goals are not incompatible. Last month, I \n     introduced the Federal Consent Decree Fairness Act, \n     bipartisan legislation that does both by establishing new \n     principles and procedures for establishing, managing, and, \n     ultimately, terminating court supervision.\n       The bill takes a three-pronged approach: First, it lays out \n     a series of findings to guide the federal courts in approving \n     future consent decrees. These findings give congressional \n     endorsement to the Supreme Court's call for limiting decrees, \n     as it did in Frew v. Hawkins in 2004. The findings also \n     advocate the entry of consent decrees that take into account \n     the interests of state and local governments and give due \n     deference to their policy choices. And they make it clear \n     that consent decrees should contain explicit and realistic \n     strategies for ending court supervision.\n       Second, the bill places ``term limits'' on decrees, giving \n     states and localities the opportunity to revisit them after \n     the earlier of four years or the expiration of the term of \n     the highest elected official who consents to the agreement. \n     These time frames give consent decrees an opportunity to \n     succeed, while not tying the hands of newly elected \n     officials. They also prevent outgoing officials from agreeing \n     to consent decrees as a way to lock in their successors to \n     policies those successors would not normally support.\n       Finally, this legislation shifts the burden of proof from \n     state and local governments to the plaintiffs in the case for \n     purposes of the motion to vacate or modify the decree. \n     Currently, a consent decree can be vacated or modified only \n     following a showing by the defendant state or local \n     government that circumstances have so significantly changed \n     as to render the decree unworkable. The practical effect is \n     that they must prove a negative--that the decree is no longer \n     necessary. Yet if the purpose of the original agreement was \n     to protect the plaintiff, it's logical that the plaintiff \n     should demonstrate whether continued protection is justified.\n\n\n                          RESPECTING DEMOCRACY\n\n       The goal of the Federal Consent Decree Fairness Act is to \n     ensure that when a federal right is no longer threatened, a \n     consent decree meant to protect that right can be \n     expeditiously ended. When the purpose of the decree has been \n     met, or circumstances have significantly changed, or later \n     officials propose new and improved solutions to a problem, \n     there needs to be a better way to remove the strictures of a \n     consent decree.\n       The Federal Consent Decree Fairness Act would not impact \n     the court's jurisdiction. It wouldn't eliminate consent \n     decrees or even nullify existing ones. And it exempts \n     desegregation cases. The bill merely creates a new judicial \n     procedure that allows state and local governments to request \n     a review of the consent decree under a shifted burden of \n     proof.\n       The intent here is not to diminish the role of the federal \n     courts. Consent decrees are important tools of federalism \n     because they ensure that no government is above the law. From \n     a practical perspective, they save enormous court costs and \n     prevent damaging legal battles.\n       Rather, the goal is to level the playing field for state \n     and local governments. There is no democracy when federal \n     courts run police departments, school districts, foster care \n     programs, and state insurance programs. Judges are not public \n     policy experts, and they are not accountable to the \n     electorate for the choices they make.\n       While the Supreme Court upheld the consent decree in Frew, \n     its opinion captured the problem: ``If not limited to \n     reasonable and necessary implementations of federal law, \n     remedies outlined in consent decrees involving state \n     officeholders may improperly deprive future officials of \n     their designated and executive powers. They may also lead to \n     federal court oversight of state programs for long periods of \n     time even absent an ongoing violation of federal law.''\n       The Frew Court rightly focused on the encroachment of \n     federal power over state and local governments. Our nation's \n     founders envisioned a dynamic but separate relationship \n     between the federal government and the states, and among the \n     three branches of government. The 10th Amendment is clear in \n     its delineation of responsibility: ``The powers not delegated \n     to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by \n     it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or \n     to the people.''\n       And while The Federalist No. 48 sets forth the idea that \n     some connection between the two levels of government is \n     necessary, its writer, James Madison, issues a clear warning: \n     ``It is equally evident that neither of them ought to possess \n     directly or indirectly, an overruling influence over the \n     others in the administration of their respective powers.''\n       Consent decrees have, unfortunately, evolved into a \n     mechanism for the federal judiciary to exercise ``an \n     overruling influence'' on many state and local governments. \n     Reform is desperately needed to fix this broken system. \n     Democracy by decree is no democracy at all.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/07/senate-section/article/S3343-1", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3343-S3344]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     PRAISING THE HOUSE PAGE SCHOOL\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, I would like to now praise the pages. \nI could say good words about the Senate pages and I will. I wanted to \nespecially praise the House page school--and I hope the Senate pages \nwill excuse me for doing that.\n  Madam President, my good friend, Alex Haley, the author of ``Roots,'' \nused to say, ``Find the good and praise it.'' Those words are engraved \non his tombstone. When he wrote the story of Kunta Kinte, he minced no \nwords in describing the terrible injustices his ancestors overcame, but \nhe also acknowledged their courage and perseverance.\n  Since I joined this body, I have made improving the teaching of \nAmerican history one of my top priorities. I have noted some deeply \ndisturbing statistics about students' knowledge of our past. For \nexample, of all the subjects tested by the National Assessment for \nEducation Progress, also known as our Nation's report card, American \nhistory is our children's worst subject.\n\n[[Page S3344]]\n\n  But today I am here to follow Alex Haley's advice to find the good \nand praise it. When it comes to teaching American history, some of the \nbest news can be found right here on Capitol Hill.\n  On January 25, the College Board announced that the House page school \nranked first in the Nation among institutions with fewer than 500 \npupils for the percentage of the student body who achieve college-level \nmastery on the advanced placement exam in U.S. history. Twenty-one \nstudents, or about one-third of the school's student body, took the \nexam, and 18 received the required score of 3 or above to demonstrate \nmastery of the subject.\n  A number of Senate pages also take the AP U.S. history exam. Madam \nPresident, 12 students in the current class of 29 in the Senate page \nschool will take 22 different AP exams this year. Eleven will take the \nU.S. history exam. But results for the Senate pages are not \ncollectively known in the same way we know them in the House, and that \nis because the Senate Page School is only half the size of the House \nschool. Senate pages register for the exam under their home high school \nname, rather than as a student at the page school. But based on what \nshe hears from students, Principal Kathryn Weeden believes Senate pages \nscore very well, but no complete tabulation of scores is available, as \nis with the House.\n\n  House pages attend classes in the attic of the Jefferson Building of \nthe Library of Congress. They are perched atop one the largest \ncollections of historical documents about our country. But location \nalone cannot account for their great success. The House Page School \nputs a strong emphasis on social studies and American history.\n  Students take American history with Sebastian Hobson and Ron Weitzel, \na House Page School teacher of 21 years who will retire this year. \nSurely, much of the credit belongs to Mr. Hobson and Mr. Weitzel. But \nstudents also find a focus on American history in their work with other \nteachers. On Saturdays, students participate in the Washington Seminar, \na program that explores American Government and history here in the \nDistrict of Columbia.\n  Math teacher Barbara Bowen, who is something of an expert on \nPresidents Jefferson and Washington, takes students to Monticello and \nMount Vernon.\n  Computer and technology teacher Darryl Gonzalez takes students to \nFort McHenry and the American History Museum.\n  Science teacher Walt Cuirle includes the history of U.S. energy \npolicy when he teaches his class on energy. Mr. Cuirle also takes \nstudents to Philadelphia for the Benjamin Franklin portion of the \nschool's Washington seminar.\n  Most students take English teacher Lona Klein's course on American \nliterature, which has to include history as they read literature from \nthe Puritans, the Enlightenment, and the slave rebellions. She also \nleads a field trip to Annapolis to see the State house and the Naval \nAcademy.\n  Principal Linda Miranda has made the teaching of American history a \npriority at the House Page School, and it shows. It is no wonder the \nschool has received this recognition from the College Board, which \nadministers the advanced placement exams across the country. Ms. \nMiranda credits the outstanding quality of the students who are \nselected as House pages and her faculty, whom she calls ``Renaissance \nmen and women.''\n  There is no question this has been a team effort at the House Page \nSchool, but I know good leadership starts at the top. So I salute Linda \nMiranda, her faculty, and the students at the House Page School. I hope \ntheir success may be an example to schools across the country as to how \nwe can restore the teaching of American history to its rightful place \nin our schools so our children grow up learning what it means to be an \nAmerican.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Oregon.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/07/senate-section/article/S3344-1", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3344-S3346]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      BIPARTISAN AGENDA FOR OREGON\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, there has been a tumultuous start to this \nsession of Congress with often acrimonious debate about judges, budget, \nand the tragic situation involving Terri Schiavo and her family. But I \nrise this morning with my friend and colleague, Senator Gordon Smith, \nto speak not of division but of bipartisanship and of the hopes we \nshare for our home State of Oregon and for our country.\n  This morning marks the fifth time Senator Smith and I have unveiled \nwhat we call our bipartisan agenda for our home State. It has been our \nprivilege and our pleasure at the beginning of each Congress to travel \ntogether around Oregon to listen to our fellow Oregonians and to find \ncommon ground on issues that matter to our citizens around their dining \nroom tables and in their kitchens.\n  We suspect that what we hear in our joint townhall meetings is what \nother Members of the Senate hear as well. Oregonians, and all \nAmericans, now struggle with health care--families and farmers and \nbusiness owners and health care providers. Oregonians and all Americans \nare struggling to make ends meet in this economy, and this means \nworkers and employers. Oregonians and all Americans want \nopportunities--educational opportunities, job opportunities, \nopportunities so their children have better lives.\n  Oregon has two U.S. Senators--a Democrat and a Republican--but we \nrealize that for the most part, our citizens are not interested first \nin Republican solutions or Democratic solutions; they want solutions \nthat work for Oregon and for our country. They want ideas, and they get \nfrustrated when they see political figures letting petty and partisan \ndifferences get in the way of their interests.\n  In the bipartisan agenda for Oregon in the 109th Congress, we are \nseeking to expand a number of our shared legislative goals to seek good \nfor our fellow Americans. I was especially pleased to join Senator \nSmith as a member of the Senate Finance Committee this year. The \ncommittee oversees vital areas of policy, including health care, \ntechnology tax, trade policy, and many of the items on our agenda fall \nunder the jurisdiction of the Senate Finance Committee.\n  We are also, in this agenda, working to expand our reach not only for \nOregonians but for all Americans by working to tackle one of the most \nimportant and difficult issues in American health care, and that is \nproviding catastrophic health care coverage so that our citizens do not \nhave to go to bed at night fearing they are going to get wiped out by \nmedical costs. This is a matter about which Democrats and Republicans \nhave been talking for years, and there have been good Democratic and \nRepublican ideas about catastrophic coverage for years. The fact is \nthat if you own a hardware store in Alaska, Oregon, Iowa, or Florida, \nand you have five or six people and one of them gets sick, everybody \ngets wiped out in terms of their medical bills.\n  Senator Smith and I believe we can develop a plan that will bring \nthis Congress together, give us the opportunity to pass catastrophic \nhealth care legislation to be enacted and the President can sign into \nlaw.\n  So ours is a bipartisan agenda for Oregon, but it is also an \ninvitation on the part of the two of us to contribute ideas and good \nwill on issues where \nwe have struck common bipartisan ground.\n  Our intention for a few minutes this morning is to speak on a number \nof these items--in effect, one of us speaking for both of us. I am very \npleased to yield to my good friend and colleague, Senator Smith, and to \nthank him for all of the opportunities to work with him, particularly \nfor his willingness to consistently meet me more than half way in our \nefforts to try to work for our State. I thank Senator Smith.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. SMITH. Madam President, I thank my colleague.\n  It seems only yesterday but it was over 8 years ago that Senator \nWyden and I engaged in a very hotly contested race for the seat of Bob \nPackwood, formerly the seat of Wayne Morse. I believe he was called \n``the tiger of the Senate,'' a man for whom Senator Wyden had worked \nearlier in his college years.\n  Ours was a campaign that Oregonians will not soon forget because it \nwas so hard fought. It was a special election. Ron Wyden won that race, \nand I narrowly lost that race. Yet, through a matter of circumstances, \nit was possible for me to continue running for\n\n[[Page S3345]]\n\nthe seat of Mark Hatfield with his announced retirement. So a few \nmonths later, I was elected to the U.S. Senate to the Hatfield seat, \nthe McNary seat, the Baker seat. I think it was a question on every \nOregonian's mind and certainly in the press whether Ron Wyden and I \ncould work together in any fashion because of the difficulty of the \nrace we had run.\n  What I did the morning after my victory was to call Ron Wyden and \ninvite him to breakfast. No sooner had the orange juice been poured \nthan it was very apparent to both of us that we were similar in nature \nin terms of our desire to do right by the State of Oregon. And while we \nwould come at two issues from different political perspectives, we \nquickly recognized that on the matter of one's State, there was a \ncommunity of interest, indeed, an incredible resource, and if we could \nfind a way to put partisanship aside when it came to the borders of \nOregon, we could find many areas where together, as a Republican and a \nDemocrat, we could serve the interests of our Nation but particularly \nthe interests of Oregon.\n  Senator Wyden is the most senior elected Democrat, and I am the most \nsenior elected Republican in our State. We understand that to our \nparties, we owe loyalty on nearly all procedural votes, we owe to our \nparties support of our nominees, but to each other we owe respect, and \nwe have found that easy to come by. So after once being competitors, we \nfound ourselves colleagues.\n  In the course of 9 years, we have found a very rich friendship. We do \nnot editorialize on one another's votes. We try to support in every way \nwe can the initiatives of the other. And we have found that the winner \nis not just our friendship but, much more importantly, the people we \nserve in the great State of Oregon.\n  What we do today is announce yet another bipartisan agenda, this one \nfor the 109th Congress, a list of items that are specific, some \ngeneral, but embark us on an agenda which we think will leave our State \nbetter when this Congress goes to sine die.\n  The common ground we have found in some cases is not on difficult \nissues, but it includes supporting communities, families, and children. \nMuch work needs to be done to confront Oregon's methamphetamine agenda, \nincluding passing the Combating Meth Act and pursuing full funding for \nthe High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area Program.\n  We will help improve access to higher education by keeping 529 higher \neducation savings tax free.\n  We will find new ways to alleviate hunger and the causes of hunger \nfor Oregon's economically vulnerable citizens.\n  A major part of our agenda is aimed at ensuring economic stability \nand growth. This includes defending Oregon timber producers from unfair \ntrade practices and pressing the administration to work diligently for \na new soft wood agreement with our neighbor, the nation of Canada.\n  We will support our ports so they can remain vibrant. We need to \nmaintain funding for Oregon's smaller ports and work to ensure that the \nport of Portland's competitiveness in the future is ensured by dredging \nthe Columbia River channel.\n  Our agenda includes promoting renewable energy and furthering \nOregon's status as the premier State for the development of renewable \nresources through tax and energy legislation.\n  We will work with our colleagues in the House and the Senate to \nprotect the county payments legislation that brings over $200 million \nto Oregon counties annually. This is a program that was started with \nour effort to help vulnerable rural places that have lost timber \nreceipts to have sufficient resources so that their schools can remain \nopen, their streets can remain paved, and their neighborhoods can \nremain safe.\n  We will also work with the understanding that a strong economy \ndepends upon affordable power rates. We will stand up against any \nattempts to force BPA to sell its power at market-based rates or \nrestrict its access to capital for infrastructure investments.\n  Before I yield to Senator Wyden, I note for our friends in the media \nthat one of the most significant issues Senator Wyden has already \nhighlighted on our agenda is our effort to provide for catastrophic \ninsurance. On the issue of health care, our Nation faces a crisis. \nCertainly the people of Oregon do. I have always believed that in \nAmerica, and certainly in Oregon, the loss of one's health should not \nmean the loss of one's home. So what we are going to do together on the \nFinance Committee is pursue an agenda whereby people in America will \nhave the ability to have in emergency situations health care for \ncatastrophic illnesses so their families are not left destitute and \ntheir heirs are not left bankrupted.\n  I yield now to my colleague, Senator Wyden.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, the Senator has summed it up very well. I \npick up on his comments with respect to health care. As my friend \nknows, this has always been my first love, going back to my days with \nthe Gray Panthers. I have been especially proud that Oregon has been a \nleader in this area, first essentially in home health care, using \ndollars that could have gone for institutional care for home care, or \nthe Oregon health plan, which began the debate about tough choices.\n  I particularly want to note with Senator Smith on the floor this \nmorning that Oregon again is in a position of leading on health care, \nand that is because my friend and colleague, through an extraordinary \neffort, has been able to send a message across this country that those \non Medicaid, the most vulnerable people in our society, people who \nalways walk an economic tightrope, balancing their food costs against \ntheir fuel costs and their fuel costs against their medical bills--\nbecause of Senator Smith's efforts during the budget, there is an \nopportunity now to renew the protections those vulnerable people have.\n  He and I agree completely that there are opportunities to promote \nreforms in Medicaid and we are committed to that, but because of \nSenator Smith's effort we are not going to put budget cuts ahead of \nreforms. So as we go to this discussion about health care, I \nparticularly want to commend my colleague because his leadership on \nMedicaid is part of the long tradition of Oregon being first in terms \nof making judgments about health care. I am proud to be able to assist \nin his efforts.\n  My colleagues will see that the Medicaid reform commission Senator \nSmith envisions and other reforms we have worked on are a big part of \nour effort.\n  With respect to catastrophic care, what is so striking about this \ndebate is that experts have known what to do about this issue for \nyears. One can get an awful lot of protection for a relatively small \namount of dollars. For example, on any given day in our country, if \nsomebody gets sick in a small business, it essentially blows the whole \npremium structure for everybody. If just one of the employees, where \nthere is a little store of five or six people, gets sick, then rates \nskyrocket for everyone.\n  What Senator Smith and I are going to do in our catastrophic care \nbill is spread the risk, look to a way, for example, where Government \nmight pick up a bit of that risk. Democrats have proposed it. \nRepublicans have proposed it. Once there is that kind of risk \nspreading, instead of what happens now when one person gets sick and \neverybody pays higher bills, Government picks up a bit of that risk and \nthe costs go down for everybody.\n  The two of us are on the Senate Finance Committee and we are going to \ndo everything we can to try to bring the committee and the Senate \ntogether around these ideas.\n  Members of both political parties have had good ideas on this for \nliterally a couple of decades. I remember talking about catastrophic \ncare when I had a full head of hair, and we should have done it then. \nSenator Smith and I are going to try to tackle it. We will also look at \nsome other issues that have great implications for our State but also \nfor our country overall. One of them involves equity for health care \nproviders.\n  Today, at a time when we have this demographic revolution, and we are \ngoing to have so many more older people, one would think the Federal \nGovernment would try to reward providers for doing the right thing, \noffering good quality care and holding costs down. Instead, the Federal \nGovernment sends\n\n[[Page S3346]]\n\nthe opposite message. The Federal Government basically says to Oregon \nand to other States that are doing a good job, well, tough luck, folks. \nInstead of rewarding you, we are going to actually stick it to you. We \nare going to penalize you and limit your reimbursement in spite of the \nfact that you provide higher quality, more efficient health care.\n  We are going to try to change that reimbursement system. It will \nobviously help our State, but I would submit, if one looks at the \nchallenges for Medicare, the head of the General Accounting Office, \nDavid Walker, has said Medicare is seven times as great a challenge as \nis Social Security. And we cannot afford not to have the Smith-Wyden \nreforms with respect to reimbursement for health care providers. I am \nvery hopeful we will be able to win support in the Finance Committee \nand in the Senate for those reimbursement changes as well. They make \nsense for our State, but they are absolutely critical for our country \nas well.\n  In addition to health care, which will be a prime focus of our work, \nSenator Smith and I want to make sure we promote the use of innovative \ntechnologies, making sure that they are accessible and affordable so as \nto capture the opportunity to use technology to grow incomes and \nstrengthen our economy. Depreciation will be a topic we will focus on \nbecause right now businesses that need new technologies to keep up in \ntough global markets take a big tax hit if they change their equipment \nas frequently as they need to in order to keep up with the competition.\n\n  We intend to work together on the Finance Committee to change tax \nlaws and be able to accelerate the depreciation of equipment and end \nthe penalties our businesses pay for staying on the cutting edge of our \neconomy.\n  We also intend to promote nanotechnology to continue to work to make \nOregon a national leader in the new small science. Americans are not \ncompletely sure what this field is all about. A woman came up to me in \na small store in Oregon recently and said: Ron, I do not know what this \nnanology is, but I am glad you are working on it.\n  The science of small stuff is going to be the wave of the future, and \nunprecedented collaboration between the public and private sectors has \nmade Oregon one of America's leading microtechnology and nanotechnology \ncenters.\n  Senator Smith and I joined to be part of an effort in the Senate to \nprovide billions of dollars for nanotechnology that would create \nregional centers in this exciting field, and we intend to work to make \ncertain that those efforts receive the Federal attention and credit \nthey deserve.\n  We will also work to build out broadband and the telecommunications \ntechnologies. We intend to work again in the Finance Committee to \ncreate appropriate tax incentives that will ensure broadband gets to \nthe four corners of our State, and, of course, to pick up on our theme \nthat what we are doing makes sense for Oregon and for our country.\n  I submit that the Smith-Wyden effort, as it relates to broadband, \ntechnology, and the Web, will be of great benefit to Alaska as well. We \nare fortunate to have had a good relationship with Senator Stevens as \nwell who chairs the Senate Commerce Committee.\n  The last point I make with respect to technology is as we try to \nbring all of those folks on to the Web and to be part of our Web-based \neconomy, we should not hit them with a variety of new taxes. The \nbipartisan Internet tax Freedom Act makes it illegal to level double \ntaxes or discriminatory taxes when one surfs the Web or makes Internet \npurchases. The two of us will be working on our committees, both the \nCommerce Committee and the Finance Committee, to make the Internet tax \nmoratorium permanent to preserve Web access and Web commerce for the \nfuture.\n  We want to work together with our colleagues, and we have come today \nto say we want to promote smart solutions, the kind Oregonians and \nAmericans should expect from the Senate.\n  I will yield back to Senator Smith so he can close out our joint \npresentation, and in yielding tell him that in addition to what we are \ntrying to do for our State and the impact I think our ideas will have \nfor the country in a variety of these areas, technology and health care \nand the issues we have mentioned, I hope what we are doing in the \nSenate today will be infectious and will cause other Senators to join \nin these kinds of efforts.\n  Very often colleagues have come up to Senator Smith and me and sort \nof said, what is in the water out there? What are you guys doing? I \nhave never heard of this. We always respond, try it, you will like it. \nIt is not going to be painful.\n  I see our friend from Oklahoma, Senator Inhofe, who has always been \nvery kind to me in working on infrastructure and other issues, and I \nwill say that in an acrimonious time, when there are certainly \ndivisions, let us try to find every possible way to come together. We \nrealize it is not always possible to do it, but what is exciting about \nAmerica is we debate issues in a vigorous way. Certainly Senator Smith \nand I do not agree on everything under the Sun, but we certainly agree \non a lot of critical matters. Even if we do not, we talk about them in \na way that we think is respectful and promotes to our citizens the \nreality that debate can be thoughtful, it can be contemplative, and it \ndoes not always have to be about scorched earth kind of politics. I am \nvery pleased that Senator Smith will conclude for both of us in our \njoint presentation. I thank him again for all of his efforts to work \nwith me.\n  When I had a chance to come to the Congress, and Senator Jim Inhofe \nand I were then Members of the House, I dreamed of having this kind of \nopportunity to work in a bipartisan way in representing our State, and \nI thank my colleague for doing so much to make that possible.\n  I yield to him to wrap up not just on behalf of himself but to wrap \nup on behalf of both of us.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. SMITH. Madam President, I thank the Senator.\n  I think he said it well. So much can be accomplished if colleagues \nwill focus on the possible instead of the polemic. When we do that, we \nfind that the people's business is moved forward in a positive way and \nour Nation makes progress.\n  I conclude with these words: I do not know how long Oregonians will \ngrant me the honor of representing them in the Senate, but I do know \nfor as long as I am in this Chamber and for as long as Senator Wyden is \nmy colleague, we will continue to look for ways to move beyond \npartisanship and to continue our partnership for Oregon.\n  We yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Let me inquire as to what is the regular order?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Senators are permitted to speak for \nup to 10 minutes in morning business.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent I be allowed to \nspeak for up to 20 minutes as in morning business.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/07/senate-section/article/S3346-1", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3346-S3349]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    FOUR PILLARS OF CLIMATE ALARMISM\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I am returning to the floor, as I have \nmany times in the last few years, to further address what I have \nconsidered to be probably the greatest single hoax ever perpetrated on \nthe American people, and that is this thing called global warming. As I \nnoted in my last speech, there is a perception, especially among the \nmedia and the environmental elitists, that the scientific community has \nreached a consensus on global warming. As Sir David King, the chief \nscience adviser to the British Government, recently said:\n\n       There is a very clear consensus from the scientific \n     community on the problems of global warming and our use of \n     fossil fuels.\n\n  Those problems amount to rising sea levels, floods, tsunamis, \ndroughts, hurricanes, disease, and mass extinction of species--all \ncaused by the ever-increasing greenhouse gas emissions. The alarmists \nconfidently assert that most scientists agree with this, and they \nvehemently dispute claims of uncertainty about whether catastrophes \nwill occur.\n  It is interesting that most of the people who are talking about gloom \nand\n\n[[Page S3347]]\n\ndoom on global warming are the same ones, just a few years ago, in the \n1970s, who were talking about global cooling, saying that a little ice \nage is coming and we are all going to die. But today, to question the \nscience of catastrophic global warming is considered illegitimate. \nConsider Dr. Daomi Oreskes, who wrote in the Washington Post last \nDecember:\n\n       We need to stop repeating nonsense about the uncertainty of \n     global warming and start talking seriously about the right \n     approach to address it.\n\n  Global warming, then, is no longer an issue for scientific debate. It \nappears to have soared into the realm of metaphysics, reaching the \nstatus of revealed truth.\n  Madam President, this is absurd. Since 1999, almost all scientific \ndata has shown that this whole thing is, in fact, a hoax. More then \n17,000 scientists have signed the Oregon Petition--ironically, after \nlistening to the two Senators from Oregon who had excellent \npresentations--stating that fears of catastrophic global warming are \ngroundless. These and other scientists who do not subscribe to the so-\ncalled consensus are condemned as skeptics and tools of industry. Now, \nin order to avoid professional excommunication, one must subscribe to \nthe four principal beliefs underlying the alarmist consensus. I am \ngoing to call these the four pillars of climate alarmism, all of which, \nit is said, provide unequivocal support for that consensus view.\n  What I am going to do is talk about all four pillars, but mainly only \none today, and then wait a week and let that soak in and then maybe \ncome back and talk about the other three. The four pillars are as \nfollows: The 2001 National Academy of Sciences report summarizing the \nlatest science of climate change, requested by the Bush administration. \nPillar No. 2, which we will be talking about later, is the scientific \nwork of the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, \nthe IPCC--we have heard a lot about that, most especially its Third \nAssessment Report, released in 2001. The third pillar is the recent \nreport of the international Arctic Climate Impact Assessment. No. 4 is \nthe data produced by climate models.\n  I will show over the next several weeks that none of these pillars \nsupport the consensus view. Today I will begin my four pillars series \nwith the NAS.\n  Before I delve into the NAS report, some historical CBO context is in \norder.\n  Back in 2001 the Kyoto Treaty was on the verge of collapse. President \nBush announced his rejection of the Kyoto Treaty, calling it ``fatally \nflawed in fundamental ways.'' Our friends in Europe expressed outrage, \neven shock, though it was never in doubt where the United States stood. \nWe have not changed our position.\n  In 1997, here on the floor of the Senate, we passed by a vote of 95 \nto nothing the Byrd-Hagel resolution. Primarily, the Byrd-Hagel \nresolution said if you come back from Kyoto with something that treats \ndeveloping nations differently from developed nations, then we will \nreject it, we will not ratify it. Of course, that is exactly what \nhappened. So we are supposed to do all these things, but not China and \nnot Mexico, not the other countries--yet that passed 95 to nothing. \nThere was not one dissenting vote.\n  On June 11, 2001, President Bush delivered a speech detailing Kyoto's \nflaws. He also provided an overview of the current state of climate \nscience as described in a report, which he requested, by the National \nAcademy of Science. Although the report offered very modest conclusions \nabout the state of climate science, as described in a report, which he \nrequested, by the National Academy of Sciences. Though the report \noffered very modest conclusions about the state of climate science, \nalarmists repeatedly invoke it as ironclad proof of their consensus. So \nlet's take a closer look at what the NAS had to say.\n\n  The 2001 NAS report was wide-ranging and generally informative about \nthe state of climate science. It stated that, ``Because there is \nconsiderable uncertainty in current understanding of how the climate \nsystem varies naturally and reacts to emissions of greenhouse gases and \naerosols, current estimates of the magnitude of future warming should \nbe regarded as tentative and subject to future adjustments (either \nupward or downward).''\n  Let me repeat that: ``Considerable uncertainty in current \nunderstanding.'' ``Estimates should be regarded as tentative and \nsubject to future adjustments.'' Does this sound like solid support for \nthe consensus view? Surely there must be more. Well, in fact there is.\n  Under the headline ``The Effect of Human Activities,'' the NAS \naddressed the potential impact of anthropogenic emissions on the \nclimate system. Here's what it said:\n\n       Because of the large and still uncertain level of natural \n     variability inherent in the climate record and the \n     uncertainties in the time histories of various forcing agents \n     (and particularly aerosols), a causal linkage between the \n     buildup of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere and the \n     observed climate changes in the 20th century cannot be \n     unequivocally established.\n\n  Again, that's worth repeating:\n\n       Because of the large and still uncertain level of natural \n     variability . . . [u]ncertainties in the time histories of \n     various forcing agents . . . cannot be unequivocally \n     established.\n\n  I read numerous press accounts of the NAS report, yet I failed to \ncome across reporting of this quote. Is this what the consensus \npeddlers have in mind when they assert that everything is ``settled''?\n  The NAS also addressed the relationship between climate change and \naerosols, which are particles from processes such as dust storms, \nforest fires, the use of fossil fuels, and volcanic eruptions. To be \nsure, there is limited knowledge of how aerosols influence the climate \nsystem. This, said the NAS, represents ``a large source of uncertainty \nabout future climate change.''\n  By any conceivable standard, this and other statements made by NAS \ncannot possibly be considered unequivocal affirmations that man-made \nglobal warming is a threat, or that man-made emissions are the sole or \nmost important factor driving climate change. It certainly cannot \nprovide the basis for the United States Congress to adopt economically \nharmful reductions of greenhouse gas emissions.\n  It would be a grand folly to do that, especially considering what the \nNAS had to say about global climate models. The NAS believes much of \nthe uncertainty about climate change stems from those models, which \nresearchers rely on to make projections about future climate changes. \nThese models, as the NAS wrote, contain serious technological \nlimitations that cast doubt on their ability to simulate the climate \nsystem:\n\n     [the models] simulation skill is limited by uncertainties in \n     their formulation, the limited size of their calculations, \n     and the difficulty of interpreting their answers that exhibit \n     as much complexity as in nature.''\n\n  Model projections, as the NAS pointed out, rest on a raft of \nuncertain assumptions.\n\n       Projecting future climate change first requires projecting \n     the fossil-fuel and land-use sources of CO2 and \n     other gases and aerosols,\n\nthe NAS found. ``However, there are large uncertainties''--please note \nthe phrasing again, ``large uncertainties''--\n\n     in underlying assumption about population growth, economic \n     development, life style choices, technological change and \n     energy alternatives, so that it is useful to examine \n     scenarios developed from multiple perspectives in \n     considering. strategies for dealing with climate change.\n\n  For this reason, simulations produced by climate models provide \ninsufficient proof of an absolute link between anthropoenic emissions \nand global warming.\n\n       The fact that the magnitude of the observed warming is \n     large in comparison to natural variability as simulated in \n     climate models is suggestive of such a linkage, [according to \n     NAS] but it does not constitute proof of one because the \n     model simulations could be deficient in natural variability \n     on the decadal to century time scale.\n\n  That last point demands further elaboration and emphasis. The NAS \nthinks climate models could be off by as much as a decade, or perhaps \n100 years. Why is this important? Global climate models constitute one \nof the Four Pillars. Alarmists frequently point to computer-generated \nsimulations showing dramatic, even scary, pictures of what might happen \ndecades from now: more floods, more hurricanes, more droughts, the Gulf \nStream shutting down. In many cases, the media eagerly report what \nthese models produce as pure fact, with little or\n\n[[Page S3348]]\n\nno explanation of their considerable limitations.\n  The NAS also addressed the work of the UN's Intergovernmental Panel \non Climate Change, another of the Four Pillars. The IPCC's 2001 Third \nAssessment Report, particularly its Summary for Policymakers, is \nfrequently cited as proof of the consensus view. But the NAS disagrees. \n``The IPCC Summary for Policymakers,'' the NAS wrote,\n\n       could give an impression that the science of global warming \n     is settled, even though many uncertainties still remain.\n\n  Here again, the NAS is saying the science is not settled.\n  The NAS also addressed the IPCC's future climate scenarios. These \nscenarios are the basis for the IPCC's projection that temperatures \ncould increase to between 2.7 to 10.4 degrees Fahrenheit by 2100. The \nNAS said:\n\n       The IPCC scenarios cover a broad range of assumptions about \n     future economic and technological development, including some \n     that allow greenhouse gas emission reductions. However, there \n     are large uncertainties in underlying assumptions about \n     population growth, life style choices, technological change, \n     and energy alternatives.\n\n  Once again, the NAS says ``there are large uncertainties in \nunderlying assumptions.''\n  The same is true, the NAS said, about future projections of \nCO2 emissions. As the NAS stated:\n\n       Scenarios for future greenhouse gas amounts, especially for \n     CO2 and CO4, are a major source of \n     uncertainty for projections of future climate.\n\n  To bolster the point, the NAS found that actual CO2 \nemissions contradicted the IPCC, stating that:\n\n       The increase of global fossil fuel CO2 emissions \n     in the past decade, averaging 0.6% per year, has fallen below \n     the IPCC scenarios.\n\n  There are those troublesome words again: ``Large uncertainties in \nunderlying assumptions.'' ``Major source of uncertainty.''\n  The NAS also expressed clear reservations about the relationship \nbetween carbon dioxide emissions and how they interact with land and \nthe atmosphere:\n\n       How much of the carbon from future use of fossil fuels will \n     be seen as increases in carbon dioxide in the atmosphere will \n     depend on what fractions are taken up by land and by the \n     oceans. The exchanges with land occur on various time scales, \n     out to centuries for soil decomposition in high latitudes, \n     and they are sensitive to climate change. Their projection \n     into the future is highly problematic.\n\n  Let me offer one final quote from the study before I turn to the \nmedia. Taking stock of the many scientific uncertainties highlighted in \nthe report, the NAS issued explicit advice to guide climate research--\nadvice, by the way, that alarmists reject:\n\n       The most valuable contribution U.S. scientists can make is \n     to continually question basic assumptions and conclusions, \n     promote clear and careful appraisal and presentation of the \n     uncertainties about climate change as well as those areas in \n     which science is leading to robust conclusions, and work \n     toward a significant improvement in the ability to project \n     the future.\n\n  I am concerned about the media. I will talk about that in a minute.\n  People are trying to say that the release of CO2 is the \ncause of climate change. These people have to understand that \nhistorically it doesn't work out that way. We went into a time right \nafter World War II when we had an 85-percent increase in CO2 \nemissions. What happened there was that precipitated not a warming \nperiod but a cooling period. Again, that is too logical for some of the \nalarmists to understand. They want so badly to feel a crisis is upon \nus.\n  It is kind of interesting. There is a well-known author, Michael \nCrichton, who wrote a book, ``State of Fear.'' I recommend that \neveryone read that. He is a scientist and a medical doctor who wrote \nthis about how horrible things could happen with global warming. After \nhe researched it, he came to the conclusion that it is a hoax. I \nrecommend everyone read that book. It is very revealing. It is very \naccurate in the way the media and Hollywood are treating things.\n  It's not surprising that the media distorted and exaggerated the NAS \nreport. The public was told that the NAS categorically accepted that \ncarbon dioxide emissions were the overwhelming factor causing global \nwarming, and that urgent action was needed. One factually challenged \nCNN reporter said the NAS study represented ``a unanimous decision that \nglobal warming is real, is getting worse, and is due to man. There is \nno wiggle room.'' The New York Times opined that the report reaffirmed \n``the threat of global warming, declaring fearlessly that human \nactivity is largely responsible for it.'' Of course, as the preceding \nquotes from the report show, this is not true.\n  This is the report we are talking about with all of the \nqualifications they have. Of course, the proceedings from this report \nshow it is not true. It is an outrageous lie.\n  Unfortunately, the media wasn't burdened with any actual knowledge of \nthe report. Rather, it seized on a sentence fragment from the report's \nsummary, and then jumped to conclusions that, to be charitable, cannot \nbe squared with the full report. That fragment from the summary reads \nas follows: ``Temperatures are, in fact, rising. The changes observed \nover the last several decades are likely mostly due to human \nactivities. . .'' There's the smoking gun, we were told then and even \nnow, proving a global warming consensus.\n  However, the second part of the sentence, along with much else in the \nreport, was simply ignored. The second part of the sentence reads: ``We \ncannot rule out that some significant part of these changes is also a \nreflection of natural variability.''\n  And as we have seen, it is amazing how one could conclude that the \nNAS ``left no wiggle room'' that ``global warming is due to man.'' Dr. \nRichard Lindzen, a professor of meteorology at MIT, and a member of the \nNAS panel that produced the report, expressed his astonishment in an \neditorial in the Wall Street Journal on June 11, 2001. Dr. Lindzen \nwrote that the NAS report showed ``there is no consensus, unanimous or \notherwise, about long-term climate trends and what causes them.'' Yet \nto this day, the media continues to report exactly the opposite.\n  As I noted earlier, raising uncertainties or questioning basic \nassertions about global warming is considered ``nonsense.'' I wonder if \nthe same applies to the NAS. For on just about every page of the 2001 \nreport, the NAS did exactly that.\n  But for the alarmists, global warming has nothing to do with science \nor scientific inquiry. Science is not about the inquiry to discover \ntruth, but a mask to achieve an ideological agenda. For some, this \nissue has become a secular religion, pure and simple.\n  Dr. Richard Lindzen has written eloquently and powerfully on this \npoint, so I will end with his words: ``Science, in the public arena, is \ncommonly used as a source of authority with which to bludgeon political \nopponents and propagandize uninformed citizens. This is what has been \ndone with both the reports of the IPCC and the NAS. It is a \nreprehensible practice that corrodes our ability to make rational \ndecisions. A fairer view of the science will show that there is still a \nvast amount of uncertainty--far more than advocates of Kyoto would like \nto acknowledge--and that the NAS report has hardly ended the debate. \nNor was it meant to.''\n  This is Dr. Lindzen. No one will question his credibility and his \nbackground.\n  We know the economic damage that will be done to America. We have all \ntalked about the report on the econometrics survey. That survey showed \nhow much energy would increase, should we have to comply with the Kyoto \nTreaty. It shows it would cost the average American family of four \n$2,175 a year. So we know how expensive that is. That is all \ndocumented.\n  You might say, Wait a minute. If this is true, if the science is not \nestablished and there is that much economic damage to the United \nStates, why are we doing this? I think the answer to that could be \ngiven from quoting two individuals. One is not exactly an American \nhero, Jacques Chirac from France, who said:\n\n       Kyoto represents the first component of an authentic \n     governance.\n\n  Then some of you may have heard of Margo Wallstrom, the Environmental \nMinister of the European Union. She said:\n\n       Global warming is not about climate. It is about leveling \n     the economic playing field worldwide.\n\n  I hope the first pillar has been discredited, and next week we will \nstart with pillar No. 2 in hopes that we can have a wake-up call for \nthe American\n\n[[Page S3349]]\n\npeople--that these same alarmists who were concerned about global \ncooling two decades ago will quit worrying so much about their own \nagenda and start looking at the science.\n  I feel an obligation as chairman of the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee to look at the science. Certainly the Presiding Officer is a \nvalued member of that committee. We have a commitment to look at sound \nscience, as unpopular as it may be.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. DeMint). The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I was pleased to hear the thought-provoking \ncomments of the chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee. \nI thank him much for the work he has done there. Some of the things he \nsaid reminded me of an analogy to a totally different situation. When \nsomebody was misusing some scientific facts, the comment was, They used \nthe facts like a drunk uses a light post--for support rather than for \nillumination.\n  But I look forward to reading the book ``State of Fear'' by Dr. \nCrichton.\n  We appreciate the ongoing discussions that we will have.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/07/senate-section/article/S3349-1", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3349-S3350]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    WATER RESOURCES DEVELOPMENT ACT\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, yesterday I introduced, along with Senators \nInhofe, Vitter, Warner, Voinovich, Isakson, Thune, Murkowski, Obama, \nLandrieu, Grassley, Harkin, Talent, Cornyn, Cochran, Domenici and \nColeman, the 2005 Water Resources Development Act, S. 728.\n  The programs administered by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers are \ninvaluable to this Nation. They provide drinking water, electric power \nproduction, river transportation, environmental protection and \nrestoration, protection from floods, emergency response, and \nrecreation.\n  Few agencies in the Federal Government touch so many citizens, and \nwith such little recognition by many, I might add, and they do it on a \nrelatively small budget. They provide one-quarter of our Nation's total \nhydropower output, operate 456 lakes in 43 States, hosting 33 percent \nof all freshwater lake fishing. They facilitate the movement of 630 \nmillion tons of cargo valued at over $73 billion annually through our \ninland system. They manage over 12 million acres of land and water; \nprovide 3 trillion gallons of water for use by local communities and \nbusinesses; and they have provided an estimated $706 billion in flood \ndamage within the past 25 years with an investment one-seventh of that \nvalue.\n  During the 1993 flood alone, an experience which I witnessed \nfirsthand, an estimated $19.1 billion in flood damage was prevented by \nflood control facilities in place at that time.\n  Our ports move over 95 percent of U.S. overseas trade by weight and \n75 percent by value.\n  Between 1970 and 2003, the value of U.S. trade increased 24-fold, and \n70 percent since 1994. That was an average annual growth rate of 10.2 \npercent, nearly double the pace of the gross domestic product growth \nduring the same period.\n  Unfortunately, the American Society of Civil Engineers has issued a \ngrade on our navigable waterways infrastructure. They gave it a D- with \nover 50 percent of the locks ``functionally obsolete'' despite \nincreased demand.\n  Recently, a story in the Wall Street Journal warned of the current \ncondition. It begins:\n\n       The nation's freight-bearing waterway system, plagued by \n     age and breakdowns, is saddling the many companies that rely \n     on the network with a growing number of supply disruptions \n     and added costs.\n       While some consider it an anachronism in the age of e-\n     commerce, the system remains vital to a broad swath of the \n     economy, carrying everything from jet fuel and coal to salt \n     and the wax for coating milk cartons. The network stretches \n     12,000 miles, mostly through the nation's vast web of rivers, \n     and relies on a series of dams and locks, which are enormous \n     chambers that act as elevators for moving barges from one \n     elevation of water to another.\n       Much of the infrastructure was built early in the last \n     century. It's showing the effects of time and, according to \n     some, of neglect. Old equipment takes longer to repair, and \n     it's more vulnerable to nature's extremes.\n\n  The bipartisan bill is one that traditionally is produced by the \nCongress every 2 years. However, we have not passed a WRDA bill since \n2000. The longer we wait, the more unmet needs pile up, the more \ncomplicated the demands upon the bill become, making it harder and \nharder to win approval. For some, the bill is small; for others, it is \ntoo big; for some, the new regulations are too onerous; and for others, \nthe new regulations are not onerous enough.\n  Nevertheless, I believe we have struck a balance here, largely on a \nbipartisan basis, that disciplines the new projects to criteria fairly \napplied while addressing a great number of water resource priorities.\n  With the new regulations, we have embraced a commonsense, bipartisan \nproposal by Senators Landrieu and Cochran, similar to the bipartisan \nHouse agreement that requires major projects to be subject to \nindependent peer review, and requires, if necessary, mitigation for \nprojects be completed at the same time the project is completed, or, in \nspecial cases, no longer than 1 year after project completion. This \ncompromise will impose a cost on communities, particularly smaller \ncommunities, but it is not as onerous as the new regulations proposed \nlast year which ultimately prevented a final agreement from being \nreached between the House and the Senate.\n  The commanding features of this bill are its landmark environmental \nand ecosystem restoration authorities. Nearly 60 percent of the bill \nauthorizes such efforts, including environmental restoration of the \nEverglades, coastal Louisiana, Chesapeake Bay, Missouri River, Long \nIsland Sound, Salton Sea, Connecticut, the Illinois and Mississippi \nRivers, and others.\n  Additionally, we have included the previously introduced bipartisan \nproposal to modernize the aging locks on the Mississippi and Illinois \nRivers, designed 70 years ago for paddlewheel boats.\n  We should do simply for the future what our predecessors did for the \npresent and build the systems designed to improve our competitiveness, \nour standard of living, and environmental protection. It does not \nhappen overnight and we have experienced far too much delay already. We \nspent 12 years and $70 million to complete what was supposed to be a 6-\nyear, $25 million study.\n  Without a competitive transportation system, the promise of expanded \ntrade and commercial growth is empty, job opportunities are lost, and \nwe will be unprepared for the challenges of this new century.\n  A lot of people don't appreciate the fact that one medium-sized river \nbarge tow carries the same freight as 870 trucks. That should speak \npretty significantly for the efficiency and environmental protection of \nwater transportation.\n  Eighty years ago, leaders in this Nation wanting to build a better \ntomorrow made investments in our productive capacity to help our \nproducers ship goods and hire workers. At that time, investments were \nexpensive and controversial. Some even said the investments were not \njustified. The Corps said they were not satisfied.\n  But Congress decided otherwise, that it was a better idea to shape \nthe future rather than to try to make unsound predictions of the \nfuture.\n  Eighty million tons of annual cargo later, it is clear Congress was \nright in that judgment. In the last 35 years, waterborne commerce on \nthe upper Mississippi River has tripled, but the system is not suited \nto this century. It is a one-lane highway in a four-lane world economy. \nIf we fail to act, we lose and our foreign competitors win, outsourcing \njobs by Government paralysis.\n  Last year, the United States Department of Agriculture chief \neconomist Keith Collins predicted corn exports through the Gulf would \ngrow 45 percent in 10 years. We asked him why he wasn't making a 50-\nyear prediction, which was asked of that ridiculous 12-year, $70 \nmillion study. He said nobody in their right mind could make a \nprediction 50 years in the future and it was taking a lot of \nassumptions to make a 10-year prediction. But we cannot see the exports \ngrow, we cannot get revenue for our farmers, we cannot strengthen our \nrural communities and improve our balance of trade if trade is \nconstrained by the transportation straitjacket we currently have.\n\n[[Page S3350]]\n\n  A good friend of mine from Alma, MO, Neal Bredehoeft, is a soybean \nproducer from Alma, MO, and president of the American Soybean \nAssociation. He said yesterday in St. Louis:\n\n       While U.S. farmers are fighting to maintain market share in \n     a fiercely competitive global marketplace, our international \n     competitors are investing in transportation infrastructure. \n     Argentina has invested over $650 million in their \n     transportation systems to make their exports more \n     competitive. Brazil is restructuring its water transportation \n     network to reduce the cost of shipping soybeans by at least \n     75 percent. Due in large part to these efforts, the two \n     countries have captured 50 percent of the total growth in \n     world soybean sales during the past three years.\n       Making the necessary upgrades to improve the Mississippi \n     and Illinois waterways would also protect jobs. Navigation on \n     the Upper Mississippi and Illinois Rivers supports over \n     400,000 jobs, including 90,000 high-paying manufacturing \n     jobs.\n\n  I appreciate the strong bipartisan support for this proposal and the \nsupport from labor, the Farm Bureau, the corn growers, soybean \nproducers, Nature Conservancy, the diverse members of MARC 2000, and \nother shippers and carriers fighting to protect and build markets in an \nincreasingly competitive marketplace while improving protection for \nthis vital resource.\n  It is important that we understand the budget implications of this \nlegislation in the real world. We are contending with difficult budget \nrealities currently. It is critical we be mindful of these realities as \nwe make investments in the infrastructure that supports the people in \nour Nation who make and grow and buy and sell things so we can make our \neconomy grow, create jobs, and secure our future.\n  This is an authorization bill. It does not spend $1. I repeat, \nregrettably, it does not spend $1. It merely authorizes the spending. \nWith the allocation provided through the budget, the Appropriations \nCommittee and the Congress and the President will fund such projects \ndeemed to be of the highest priority and those remaining will not be \nfunded because the budget will not permit. Strictly speaking, this bill \nprovides options, not commitments. I wish it were otherwise.\n  I thank my colleagues on the committee and their staff for the very \nhard work devoted to this difficult matter. I particularly thank \nChairman Inhofe for his forbearance. I believe if Members work \ncooperatively and aim for the center and not the fringe, we can get a \nbill completed this year. If demands exist that the bill be away from \nthe center, going to the fringe, imposing unreasonable restrictions, we \nwill go another year with Congress unable to complete our work as we \ndid last year, unable to move forward on the 60 percent of economic and \nenvironmental restoration and the 40 percent of building the \ninfrastructure we need to strengthen our economy and make sure we \nremain competitive in the 21st century.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I understand the State Department bill \nhas currently been laid aside. When it returns, I intend to offer an \namendment, and I wanted to take advantage of the opportunity today to \ntalk about it.\n  My amendment--we are calling it the OPEC Accountability Act--is \ncosponsored by Senators Durbin and Dorgan. It will bring some sanity \nand fairness to the world oil markets. It will help provide some relief \nto our citizens from soaring gas prices that punish American families, \nbusinesses, and the entire community.\n  My amendment will direct the U.S. Trade Representative to initiate \nWorld Trade Organization proceedings against OPEC nations. Under the \nrules of the WTO, countries are not permitted to set or maintain export \nquotas. It is illegal. But that is exactly what OPEC does. OPEC is a \ncartel. Everybody knows that. The whole point of the organization is to \nset quotas. Why set quotas? To control prices. The mission is often to \nhave countries beholden to them outside their little orbit, and they \nthen are able to outrageously set prices for commodities that are \nessential. They collude to set quotas for the export of oil, which \ncause gas prices to rise.\n  I say to people across America, if you are wondering why gas is so \nexpensive these days, a major part of that answer is OPEC. It is an \nillegal cartel, plain and simple. And we have allowed this cartel to \noperate for too long. Now it is time to put a stop to it. Every day \nAmerican families feel the effects of the OPEC cartel at the gas pump. \nLook at the spike in the price of gas since 2001. Gas prices have \nnearly doubled since 2001.\n  I am going to show another chart that more particularly shows the \nprecise prices for gasoline during those periods. In December of 2001, \na gallon of gas averaged in price at $1.15. That was 2001. Today a \ngallon of gas averages $2.30. That is a doubling of the price in just \nover 4 years. This spike in gasoline prices hurts American families.\n  We hear a lot of talk about tax relief for middle-income families. \nBut whatever tax cuts they received in that middle-income family in the \nlast 4 years are being eaten up by increased gas prices. When you look \nat the gas price in that period of time and compare it to the Bush tax \ncut, the tax cut would have been $659. But the cost for gasoline the \naverage family used in that year is $780, far more than the tax cut \nbrought home to families.\n  A middle-income family who uses one tank of gas a week is going to \npay an extra $780 a year because of rising gas prices eating up every \npenny and more that they received from the tax cut of the last 4 years.\n  When Americans drove up to the gas station on December 2001, this is \nwhat they saw: Regular gas $1.06 a gallon; the supreme, the high-test \ngas, $1.25 a gallon. Now after years of administration inaction, what \nwe are looking at is regular is $2.22 compared to $1.06; $2.31 compared \nto $1.15 for plus gas; and $2.40 for supreme compared to $1.25 just \nover 4 years ago. It is an outrage.\n  One of the things that always bothers me is when I look at the \nforecast for inflation and I see what we are paying. I can't think of \nanything that is cheaper than it used to be, whether it is food, \nenergy, or gasoline, no matter what it is. Here is the pressure. \nFrankly, I believe it has been administered poorly. I don't think we \nhave tried to figure out a way to keep these costs down.\n\n  Some of these countries that are members of OPEC are totally \ndependent on America for their security. Yet they are willing to impair \nour security, our economic well-being, our job creation, our business \nfunction. They don't mind that when they have the weapon that they \nconveniently use against us.\n  Most people live on a fixed income. They can't stop driving to their \njob or taking the kids to school or going to the doctor's office or the \ngrocery store. They have to pay the increased price for gas. That means \nthey have to cut back on other things, perhaps air-conditioning or heat \nor a visit to the doctor or perhaps foregoing a therapy session for an \ninjury. All of these are taken away by this outrageous increase in the \ncost of gasoline.\n  The soaring price of gas is already taking a toll on American \nfamilies. If something is not done soon, it could get a lot worse. This \nalso is rattling the prices of stocks on the stock exchange, \ninvestments, causing all kinds of dislocation there. It is led by the \nincreasing demand for oil.\n  Goldman Sachs, a very well known financial firm, one of the biggest \nin the world, predicts that oil could reach $105 a barrel by the end of \nthis year. It is now in the fifties, almost double the current price. \nWhile American families suffer, I don't hear anything coming from the \nPresident, the administration, to say anything about it. As a matter of \nfact, during the last campaign, it was frequently suggested that if \nJohn Kerry were President, he would be raising taxes on gasoline.\n  What are we looking at here? However we got here, it is on the watch \nof the Bush administration. Here are the prices again. Now it is $2.22 \nfor a gallon of gas. It used to be $1.06. That is a lot of money, \nparticularly since the type of vehicle that is frequently driven today \nis a gas-consuming vehicle. It costs a lot of money now to have that \ncar running and to take care of your family's needs.\n\n[[Page S3351]]\n\n  President Bush has repeatedly said that he would talk to his Saudi \nfriends in the oil business. Talk is cheap, but oil and gasoline isn't. \nThe American people want action. This amendment is a call to action. We \nhave to find a way to escape the grasp of these countries around our \neconomic well-being and our functioning as a society.\n  I have released a report explaining exactly how OPEC nations are \nviolating the rules of the WTO. This report is on my Web site. I invite \nmy colleagues and the public to read it. The report reaches a simple \nand straightforward conclusion. OPEC manipulates world oil markets by \nimposing export quotas on oil. You hear them brag about it. These \nquotas keep the price of oil artificially high. Just think about it. \nWho is the leader? Which is the country that called on us in 1990, come \nhelp us; the Iraqis are headed our way; They want to overtake our \ncountry. And we sent 540,000 people in uniform to fight off Iraq's \nattempt to overtake Saudi Arabia.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I didn't know there was any time \nlimit, but I ask unanimous consent to continue for 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate is in morning business.\n  Is there objection? Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, OPEC manipulates world oil markets \nwith their export quotas on oil, which keeps the price artificially \nhigh.\n  Without OPEC, market analysts have estimated that the free market \nprice of oil would be around $10 to $15 lower than today's price. So \nthe expectation is that oil would be lower in cost by $10 to $15 than \nit is today if it wasn't for this conspiracy out there by some so-\ncalled friends and avowed enemies. That includes Iraq and former \nantagonist of the United States, Libya; and it includes other \ncountries. There is no reason to continue to tolerate OPEC's \nanticompetitive behavior.\n  The administration has been lax in dealing with OPEC. In my view, \nPresident Bush's close ties to the Saudis and big oil companies have \nprevented him from sticking up for the American consumers.\n  Worse yet, high oil prices mean massive profits for countries such as \nSaudi Arabia and Iran--countries that frequently fund terrorism.\n  The administration's inaction is allowing tens of billions of dollars \nto flow into the hands of the mullahs in Iran--money that finds its way \nto Hamas, Hezbollah, Islamic jihad, and other terrorist organizations \nthat kill innocent Americans.\n  So while Iran, Saudi Arabia, and terrorists reap profits from OPEC's \nquotas, American families pay a terribly high price. It is time for us \nin this body to act. When the Senate returns to the State Department \nbill, I want to be able to see a vote taken on this issue so that we \ncan see whether my colleagues agree with me that the cost of gasoline \nis to high, the cost of heating a house is too high, the cost of \nrunning a vehicle is too high, and it robs us of revenues that could \notherwise go into more useful purposes.\n  With that, I hope my colleagues will support the Lautenberg-Durbin-\nDorgan amendment when this amendment is presented.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, one of my first responsibilities when I \narrived in the Senate was to recommend to the first President Bush a \nnominee for a district court seat. But while I was a relatively new \nSenator, this was in some respects a fairly easy task.\n  My predecessor in the Senate, Bob Stafford, had established a sound \nand fair process with Senator Leahy for choosing candidates for the \njudiciary, which we have continued to this day with the participation \nof Governor Douglas, a Republican.\n  Vermont is a small State, but it is one with an outsized capacity for \npublic service. Our best lawyers have been willing to accept the \nfinancial sacrifice that accompanies serving on the bench. And as a \nsmall State, I think it is fairly easy to agree on who the best \ncandidates might be, even though you invariably pass over many very \nqualified individuals.\n  Finally, I guess I should say that I was born to it. My father, Olin \nJeffords, was a judge the entire time I was growing up. In fact, he was \nchief justice of the Vermont Supreme Court. He was widely respected, \nnot just by his son, but by our community locally and by the legal \ncommunity throughout the State. That respect was entirely unremarkable. \nIt reflected the appreciation of the importance of an independent \njudiciary stocked with able and committed individuals.\n  My first job following the Navy and law school was as a clerk for \nJudge Ernest Gibson, Jr., of Vermont. Judge Gibson, a Republican, had \nresigned as Governor of the State of Vermont in order to accept Harry \nTruman's offer of nomination to the Federal bench. Judge Gibson could \nhave followed any path in life he wanted. He returned from service in \nthe South Pacific during World War II a hero, and with some fame \nstemming from having played a role in the rescue of Lieutenant John F. \nKennedy and the other survivors of PT-109.\n  As a young boy, I idolized him and the other heroes returning from \nthe Pacific. To work for him years later was an incredible honor.\n  So having been around the judiciary all of my life, it was not \nespecially daunting when it came time early in my Senate career to \nnominate an individual to the Federal district court. The late Fred I. \nParker was not only the best candidate for the job, he was also a man I \nhad hired to work with me when I served as attorney general and who had \nbecome a close friend over the years. To know Fred was to love him. \nYears later, when a vacancy on the Second Circuit Court of Appeals \nopened up, President Clinton nominated Fred to the position to which he \nwas confirmed and served with distinction until his passing.\n  These three men--a father, a mentor, and a friend--would probably be \nthe first to admit that they were more typical than exceptional of the \ncaliber of individuals that comprise the judiciary. Fred worked hard to \npay his way through school, often in the plumbing trade with his \nfather. He was forever mindful of his father's advice that whenever he \nstarted becoming convinced of his own importance, he should stick his \nfist in a bucket of water to see the kind of impression he would leave.\n  So I take it very personally when politicians seek to score points by \nattacking the judiciary. These men had and have families, just like \ntoday's judges in Florida and Georgia and Illinois. The only thing we \nshould be \ndoing is condemning violence directed against the judiciary, not \nrationalizing it or implicitly encouraging it.\n  Of course, my colleagues will not agree with every decision made by \nthe judiciary. My good friend Fred Parker struck down part of the Brady \nlaw that I had supported. I might have disagreed with him, but I never \nwould have questioned his motives or integrity.\n  The first lesson we teach children when they enter competitive sports \nis to respect the referee, even if we think he might have made the \nwrong call. If our children can understand this, why can't our \npolitical leaders? We shouldn't be throwing rhetorical hand grenades.\n  Vermonters are proud of their long history of smart, independent, \nforward-thinking judges. These men and women have shown the true spirit \nof the judiciary and upheld the law and Constitution, even if it was \nagainst what was the popular will at the time. This is what the \njudiciary was designed to be, a check and balance against the executive \nand legislative branches.\n  Our Founding Fathers were concerned that the legislative and \nexecutive branches of our Government could be too swayed by public \nopinion and not uphold the rights of Americans because of political \npressure. The judiciary was designed to be independent and make sure \nthat the law and the Constitution were followed even if it went against \npublic opinion.\n  I am also concerned with the threat of the majority to take what is \nthe so-\n\n[[Page S3352]]\n\ncalled nuclear option. Our form of government is founded on a system of \nchecks and balances, which serves to protect the rights of all \nindividuals. The right in the Senate to unlimited debate is an \nimportant part of our system of checks and balances and ensures that on \nimportant, critical issues a bipartisan consensus is reached of more \nthan a bare minimum majority of Senators.\n  I sincerely hope that cooler heads will begin to prevail and my \ncolleagues will tone down the rhetoric they have been using to smear \nthe integrity of the judiciary, and the Republican leadership will \nreject the divisive and unprecedented so-called nuclear option.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise to express my deep concern about the \nnegative impact the President's proposals that carve out private \naccounts will have on our Social Security system and also on our \nmounting Federal debt and the solvency of our Social Security Program \nin general and, ultimately, the economic prosperity of the Nation over \nmany years.\n  President Bush's plan to create private accounts within Social \nSecurity would lead to the following, I believe, very unfortunate \neffects:\n  It would require a massive increase in Federal debt.\n  It would weaken the Social Security solvency.\n  It would not increase national savings and could lower it. National \nsavings is a key function of our economy. Without national savings, we \ndo not have the pool of capital we need for investment, innovation, and \neconomic progress.\n  Finally, it would sharply cut the guaranteed Social Security benefits \nunder the President's preferred full plan.\n  Let me go into some detail on these issues, drawing upon the \nexcellent work of the Democratic staff of the Joint Economic Committee. \nI am very privileged to be the ranking member of the Joint Economic \nCommittee. We have assembled a staff of professionals who have looked \nat all of these issues in great detail. They have concluded, as I \nsuggested, that there are serious problems, not only in terms of \nsolvency of the fund, not only in terms of the increase in Federal \ndebt, but also large cuts in the guaranteed benefits of all of the \nbeneficiaries. That will be a very unfortunate and, indeed, unnecessary \nconsequence of any proposed reform of Social Security.\n  Let's take a look at this first chart. It lays out the debt issue \nwith respect to Social Security. First, the President has proposed that \nhis plan for private accounts and Social Security reform would begin in \nthe year 2009. He has put no money into his budget or his long-term \nbudget. Typically, when we budget, we at least look ahead 10 years.\n  In that first 10-year increment, which would be precisely from 2006 \nto 2015, there would be an increase of $754 billion as a result of \nthese private accounts. Again, beginning in 2009 and essentially \nstretching to 2015, you would accumulate almost $1 trillion, $754 \nbillion of debt.\n  But the real staggering number is the first 20 years of these \nprograms if the private accounts are made law. That increased debt \nwould be $4.9 trillion, an extraordinary amount of money. Again, I \nbelieve it is appropriate to look at least 20 years. We are talking \nabout solvency for the fund for 75 years. Just in the 20 years, we \nwould have almost $5 trillion in additional Federal debt.\n  The other issue that is important to point out is that this debt is \non top of existing debt. This chart just describes the rapid increase \nof Federal debt as a result of private accounts from the year 2010 to \nthe year 2060. By 2060, 35 percent of GDP will be equal to the debt we \nhave accumulated for private accounts. I think we will stop for a \nmoment: 35 percent of GDP; the debt will equal 35 percent of gross \ndomestic product in the year 2060, but add that to current debt, the \ndebt we are funding to operate our Government, and by 2060, the \nstaggering total of debt relative to GDP is 70 percent.\n\n  We have not run those debt levels since the end of World War II in \nwhich we all know we dedicated every resource we had to defeat the \nAxis. This is a much different world than 1945 and 1946. In 1945 and \n1946, we were at the sanctuary, if you will, of economic productivity \nfor the world. Our infrastructure had not been destroyed. We had tooled \nup to create the most technologically advanced military force in the \nworld. We quickly transitioned our tanks to Oldsmobiles and Chrysler \nautomobiles and washing machines. Now we are in a world of intense \ncompetition, global competition, and if we believe we can live with \ndebt equal to 70 percent of our gross domestic product, I think that is \na fanciful notion, but that is the consequence of the President's \nproposal for private accounts.\n  The other point we should note, too, is that this proposal for \nprivate accounts actually accelerates the insolvency of the Social \nSecurity fund. Again, the President's proposal is premised on saving \nSocial Security, of making it more solvent. His private accounts would \naccelerate the insolvency date. This chart shows current law. Again, it \nis a function of GDP, but it shows where the fund's assets cross the \nzero line, and that is about 2042. The President's proposal of private \naccounts would drive the funds into insolvency much earlier--about \n2030. It makes no sense to me, if your goal is to increase the solvency \nof the fund, to have a proposal that actually weakens solvency. In a \nsense, searching for an analogy, if the boat is leaking, don't break a \nbig hole in the bottom and have more water come in. That is not the way \nyou save a leaking ship.\n  Turning away from the charts, let's go to the mathematics of how this \nall works.\n  The current Social Security shortfall, an estimate by the trustees, \nthe actuaries of the Social Security Administration, is minus $4 \ntrillion. That is how much money we would have to have today to cover \nthe shortfall for the next 75 years.\n  Here is what the President's plan for private accounts does: First, \nit costs $4.7 trillion, so that is an additional $4.7 trillion. But \nwhat the President proposes is that there is essentially a \nprivatization tax, that those private account holders will have to pay \nback some money at the time they exercise their retirement benefits. \nThat is $3.1 trillion. Still we have a gap of $1.6 trillion, the net \ncost of the private accounts.\n  Add that to $4 trillion and now we have a shortfall of $5.6 trillion. \nWe have created a bigger problem; we have not solved the problem.\n  The next table also suggests the possible consequences on national \nsavings. Again, national savings is a key macroeconomic construct when \nit comes to progress in terms of our economy because it is from those \nnational savings which we draw the investment capital and resources to \ntrain people, to innovate new equipment, to invest in new plant and \nequipment.\n  This is what happens, and national savings is a simple function of \nprivate savings, what you and I, our households are saving, together \nwith public savings, what the Government is saving. We have stopped \nsaving. We were saving, which means we had a surplus, until 2000, 2001, \nand now we are in a huge deficit, about $450 billion a year.\n  Let us see what would happen with these private accounts. First, the \npublic borrows more money. Public savings go down. Private savings go \nup because we give that money back to people and say now put it into \nthe stock market. The net effect is zero at best, but it could even be \nworse than that because something could happen in terms of public \nbehavior.\n  First, they could reduce their current savings saying, well, I do not \nhave to save anymore for contingencies because now I have this private \nsavings plan. It is a possibility. To what extent it happens in \nreality, it is a projection, but that is a possibility.\n  The second is early retirements for these funds. My sense is, every \ntime we have constructed some type of retirement benefit we have found \nways to allow people to borrow from it for emergencies. We will \nprobably do the same here. But even if those factors do\n\n[[Page S3353]]\n\nnot take place, zero national savings at best. We need to develop \npolicies that encourage national savings. We should not be devoting \nhuge tax cuts for wealthy Americans. We should be devoting tax cuts to \nencourage average Americans to save more, and we cannot do both if we \nhave a deficit. My preference obviously would be to encourage average \nAmericans to save more.\n  Now, chart No. 5 walks through the effect on individuals. The \nPresident has not offered a plan yet. He has been talking about it \naround the country, but the suggestions, the intimations are that in \norder to help address the solvency problem he is going at benefit \npayments. Essentially, the Commission to Strengthen Social Security put \nout the blueprint, and this blueprint would suggest cuts in benefits. \nOne proposal was moving away from wage replacement to simple cost-of-\nliving increases in benefits. That would effectively be a cut over \ntime.\n  If we look at the combination of guaranteed benefits and the best \nestimates of the yield on private accounts, here is what happens over \ntime. This is from the Congressional Budget Office. The average earner \nretiring in the year 2005 is protected. I think we recognize that \nbecause we have not made a change yet. By 2015, however, if one is \nparticipating in private accounts, they are doing worse than this 2005 \nbeneficiary, and it goes down all the way. We can see as the guaranteed \nbenefits decrease, the private accounts do not make up the difference, \nand this is some of the work of CBO.\n  So we have a situation that, frankly, is not a good deal for the \nretirees and not a good deal for the country when the debt is increased \nso precipitously. More national savings are not encouraged. A situation \nis created in which the problem is not getting fixed but is being made \nworse in so many different dimensions.\n\n  When we look at this issue of benefit payments, many people fail to \nrecognize that this is not just about retirees. I have a retiree here. \nThere are a significant number of Americans who collect Social Security \nbecause they are disabled. They will not have the benefit of private \naccounts because by definition they cannot work. They are disabled. So \nthey are not going to be taking their paycheck each month and putting \nit into their private account. All the most vulnerable Americans are \ngoing to see is a benefit reduction, and that is not fair. It is not \nsmart either.\n  Moreover, there is a suggestion that this is just an issue for \nseniors and that is all. The Social Security Administration has an \ninteresting statistic, at least I found it very interesting. Their \nestimate is, of the cohort of 20-year-olds who are out there today just \njoining the workforce, who are healthy and running around, who have no \nimmediate cares for retirement like middle-aged people, that 3 out of \n10 will become disabled before they reach 65 years old. So I ask, where \nare they going to get the disability insurance to cover the benefits \nthat today Social Security pays to people who become disabled? They \ncannot afford it. They will not buy it. There will be some disability \nprogram, but it will not be the kind of program that today provides at \nleast some modicum of support for individuals who have been disabled \nthrough no fault of their own.\n  This is a topic that will be discussed again and again, but it is \nimportant to look at these issues and to make a practical and pragmatic \nassessment. That is what the American people are doing today. They are \nlooking at the proposal of private accounts. They are seeing it \njeopardize our economic future and seeing it eventually cut their \nprospects for retirement or for protection if they become disabled, and \nthey are rejecting it out of hand. I think they should.\n  We have to continue to keep the focus on this particular proposal.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I know we have a lot of things on our \nminds with some distractions, of course, but I will talk just a moment \nabout some of the things I believe we ought to have as priorities. We \nneed to establish our priorities so that we can work on the things we \ncollectively believe have the most impact and should really be acted \nupon. Obviously, there are all kinds of ideas among us, and as we talk \nto people who come to see us and our people at home, why, there are a \nmillion things, but there are some that seem to be in need of \nconsideration more quickly.\n  One of them is energy. We have talked about having an energy policy \nnow for several years. The evidence now is even stronger that we need \nan energy policy which gives us some kind of insight as to where we \nneed to be in 10 or 15 years so that as we approach the problems, we \ncan discover the things it takes to attain those goals.\n  Our energy policy has always been a broad policy, as it should be. It \nhas been a policy that talks about conservation, efficiency, \nalternative sources, renewables, as well as domestic production. \nCertainly, one of the things that is most important, that the \nadministration and the President has pushed, is to do some work to make \nsure coal fits into the environment satisfactorily. Coal is our largest \nfossil fuel, and we ought to be using coal for electric generation \nrather than some things other than coal, such as gas. Almost all of the \ngeneration plants over the last 20 years have been gas, largely because \nit is more economical to build a smaller plant closer to the market \nwith gas than coal. So not only do we need to do something about the \ncarbon and the exhaust from coal, but we also have to do something \nabout transmission so that we can economically create electricity at \nthe mine mouth and get it through our transmission system to the \nmarket.\n  We passed a highway bill a number of years ago, and we have never \nbeen able to get it completely passed, so we have just passed on the \nold one. It is certainly more than past time to get a highway bill. \nThere is probably nothing that has more impact on our economy, creates \nmore jobs, and allows for other things to happen in the economy than \nhighways. We certainly need to do that.\n  Additionally, one of the things that becomes clear, and even more \nclear as we spend time on Social Security, which we should, is personal \nsavings accounts that people can have for themselves. As I have gone \nabout talking about Social Security, I have always tried to remind \nfolks that Social Security was never intended to be a retirement \nprogram. It is a supplement. It is a supplement to the retirement \nprograms that we put together.\n  There are a number of ways, of course, where there are incentives for \nsavings, whether they be retirement programs or 401(k)s in which the \nemployers participate. Now we have a potential for savings that can be \nspent earlier than retirement, that could be used for almost anything. \nOne of the real issues is to have medical savings accounts so that we \ncan buy cheaper insurance policies with a higher deductible and, \ntherefore, have some money to pay for that.\n  There is nothing, perhaps, more important than to get ourselves into \na position of people preparing for their own retirement. This Social \nSecurity discussion has shown basically what young people could do by \nputting aside a relatively small amount of money every month and having \nit earn interest for them.\n  One of the things I recognize is a little bit regional is the \nEndangered Species Act. It has been in place for a very long time. In \nmy judgment, it has not been as effective as it could be. I am not for \ndoing away with the Endangered Species Act, but we have roughly 1,300 \nspecies listed as endangered and have only recovered about a dozen. So \nthe emphasis has been in the wrong place. We are going to have an \nopportunity to be able to do that, and it has great impact in many \ncases. It is kind of used as a land management tool so\n\n[[Page S3354]]\n\nthat we lose the multiple-use aspect of public and even private lands \nbecause of endangered species.\n  There are a lot of things I think we ought to be doing.\n  Finally, it seems to me that we ought to have a system that takes a \nlook at programs after they have been in place 10 years, or whatever--\nafter they have been there for a while. We should restudy those \nprograms, reanalyze those programs to see if, indeed, the need for them \nis still what it was when they started; to see if they could be made \nmore efficient after 10 years or, indeed, if they don't need to be \nthere anymore. I know it is very difficult. There gets to be a support \ngroup that forms around all the programs that are funded, of course. It \nbecomes difficult to change.\n  But it is too bad, when we think about it, to pass programs that are \nspending Federal money and have them out there when there is no longer \nany need for them or when the time has come where something different \nneeds to be done.\n  I am hopeful we can get something done. I am thinking about putting \nsomething in bill form that will provide a review or oversight of \nprograms that are in place to see if they are still important, to see \nif they are still being done efficiently, and to see if they could be \ndone a better way or, indeed, need to be done at all.\n  These are some of the things I think are very important. I hope we \ntry to set some priorities. I understand out of 100 people there are \ngoing to be many different ideas, but that is part of our challenge, to \nput 100 people together and decide what are the five most important \nissues that impact this country and impact our States.\n  I hope we can do that and I look forward to that opportunity.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Alexander).

I want \nto pay tribute to him on behalf of all the Missourians who are mourning \nhis passing this week.\n  The Pope left an indelible mark on the history of mankind and, \nindeed, of the world.

He called him ``A Witness To Hope.'' \nThe moral clarity his leadership provided helped spread democracy and \njustice around a world that desperately needed it.

One of the greatest honors I have had in all my \nyears in public life was the opportunity to meet him when he visited \nMissouri 6 years ago.\n  As we mourn the Pope's passing, we celebrate his spiritual \nleadership. I want to say, also, we should celebrate his qualities \nwhich most impressed me in the brief moment I had to meet him at that \ntime--I mean his humanness, his courage, his works. Those works for \nyears to come will continue giving people hope for the next world and \nbetter lives in this one.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise today, to join my colleagues and \nthe rest of the world in the remembrance of Pope John Paul II.\n  Since the passing of the Pope, it has often been noted that this Pope \nwas by far the most traveled of any in history--quite possibly the one \nperson seen live by the most people of all time.\n  We were fortunate in my State to receive the Pope twice, once in \nAnchorage in 1981 and then again in Fairbanks in 1984. During his \nAnchorage visit, the Pope celebrated Mass with more than 40,000 \nAlaskans in a downtown Anchorage park. It was the largest gathering of \nAlaskans up until that time, and beginning in the cold, wet, early \nFebruary morning, until his departure, crowds lined the streets and \nAlaskans strained to get a glimpse of the Pontiff. Always known for his \ncompassion and generosity, the Pope extended his visit in Anchorage \nmore than an hour to meet in private with 150 disabled Alaskans at Holy \nFamily Cathedral.\n  The Pope's visit to the Fairbanks International Airport was even more \nmomentous, and was transformed into the site of major diplomacy. It was \nan opportunity for the Pope to meet with President Ronald Reagan, who \nwas returning from overseas and, like the Pope, stopped in Alaska to \nrefuel his aircraft. The President, who had arrived the previous night, \nwas the first to greet the Pope. They visited briefly and then the Pope \nsurprised many by making an unexpected tour through the crowd that \nwaited outside the airport in the drizzling rain.\n  While in Alaska, the Pope spoke about the unity of faith that binds \nAlaska's diverse Catholic community--from Native Alaskans to people \nfrom all over the world. During his Anchorage stopover, John Paul II \neven enjoyed a brief ride on a dogsled.\n  Like many Americans and individuals all over the world, I grieve for \nthe loss of the Holy Father. From his humble beginnings to the \nprincipal voice for human rights for over two decades, Pope John Paul \nII will always be remembered. He was an extraordinary, inspirational \nand spiritual person and the world is a better place thanks to his \nservice and spiritual leadership.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I wish to submit for the Record today a \nstatement joining my colleagues and my countrymen and women in paying \ntribute to the departed and beloved Pope John Paul II. I join them in \nmourning his loss, and I extend my condolences to Roman Catholics in \nConnecticut and all over the world.\n  It is impossible to overstate the great sense of loss that is being \nfelt by the 1 billion Catholics worldwide, but a telling sign of the \nHoly Father's lasting legacy is that his life and death have touched \nbillions of non-Catholics as well. The Pontiff built bridges to non-\nCatholics and transformed forever the Church's perception of Jews in \nparticular from a separated people to ``older'' brothers and sisters in \nfaith.\n  Pope John Paul II's outreach to people of all faiths began when he \nwas a young man. Known to his friends and family as ``Lolek,'' the \nfuture Pontiff grew up in Wadowice, Poland, in the 1920s and 1930s. \nWadowice was a town of about 7,000, more than 20 percent of whom were \nJewish, including young Lolek's best friend, Jurek Kluger.\n  One of Lolek and Jurek's favorite pastimes was soccer. One day, Jurek \nwent to the Parish church to meet up with Lolek before heading to a \nsoccer match together. A woman in the church expressed her amazement at \nthe sight of a Jewish boy standing next to the altar. To the future \nPope, however, it was a natural and effortless interfaith communion. As \nthe young Lolek remarked to the amazed onlooker, ``Aren't we all God's \nchildren?''\n  Pope John Paul II worked to protect all of God's children as a \ncourageous champion of religious freedom and human rights and a \ntireless advocate for the poor and sick throughout the world. His \nfervent opposition to the brutal scourge of Nazism was matched by his \ntireless work to break Eastern Europe free from the oppressive grip of \ncommunism.\n  In June of 1979, 8 months after being elected to take the throne of \nSt. Peter, Pope John Paul II made a triumphant return to Poland. His \nbeloved nation was struggling to survive under the iron fist of Soviet \nrule. An adoring crowd of 1 million supporters gave him a hero's \nwelcome.\n  For his fellow Poles, who for decades were deprived of their freedom \nto worship, the Pontiff had a strong, clear and inspirational message. \n``You are men. You have dignity. Don't crawl on your bellies,'' he \nsaid. This visit was a crucial turning point in America's Cold War with \nthe Soviet Union.\n  Working together with the people of Poland and the United States, the \nPontiff transformed his homeland into the spiritual battlefront of the \nCold War. Forging an allegiance with Lech Walesa, the Pope provided \nreligious support for the anti-communist Solidarity movement. Over the \nnext decade, a tidal wave of the spirit overcame communism in Poland. \nOne by one, the dominoes of Communist oppression fell across Eastern \nEurope as faith and freedom triumphed. Stalin once mocked the power of \nthe papacy by asking, rhetorically, ``The Pope? How many divisions has \nhe got?'' In one of history's sweet ironies, it was indeed a\n\n[[Page S3355]]\n\nPope none other than Pope John Paul II who helped dismantle Stalin's \nempire, not with divisions of armed soldiers, but legions of faithful \nfollowers who yearned to be free.\n  In another historic trip 22 years later, the Pontiff made a \npilgrimage to the Holy Land. He visited Yad Vashem, the Holocaust \nmemorial, where he prayed and met with survivors. On his last day in \nJerusalem, he went to the Western Wall of the Temple. There, the Holy \nFather prayed silently before leaving a small written prayer stuffed \ninto a crack in the wall, surrounded by the thousands of notes and \nprayers people leave there every day.\n  During his Papacy, while much of the world could not resist the \ntemptation of moral compromise and material excess, Pope John Paul II \nremained steadfast in his morality and spirituality. He was a tower of \nintegrity, a role model for everyone who sought to defend their values \nfrom the growing culture of moral relativism. In an age of materialism \nand genocide, he was the world's most consistent advocate of spiritual \nand humanitarian values.\n  While the Pope's values remained traditional, his ability to \ncommunicate was progressive and modern. He forever revolutionized how \nthe church could spread its teachings. He masterfully used modern \ntechnology to bring the church to the world.\n  In each of the seven languages he spoke, he had a unique ability to \ntouch each one in his presence as if they were the only one to whom he \nwas speaking. The Pope was able to inspire those who came to hear his \nmessage to go forth and make the world a better place. On January 4, \n2001, he called upon a group of hundreds of believers gathered in St. \nPeter's Square--including a Roman Catholic member of my own staff, \nKenneth Dagliere--to make the most of their God-given potential. ``If \nyou are to be what you are meant to be, you will set the world \nablaze,'' he told them. Those words are as autobiographical as they are \ninspirational.\n  Much as he did in life, Pope John Paul II provided a life-affirming \nexample of dignity in his death. While we are saddened by his death, we \ntake solace in knowing that he left us peacefully and surrounded by \nthose closest to him in his Papal residence. Outside, in St. Peter's \nSquare, hundreds of thousands of adorers held constant vigil, praying \nfor a man who had touched their lives in a way few ever could. It was a \nspontaneous outpouring of love for a man who seemed to possess an \neternal capacity to spread strength and love wherever he went.\n  Mr. President, Pope John Paul II leaves behind a lasting legacy of \nfaith and leadership. He will be truly missed by hundreds of millions \nof God's children throughout the world. I thank the Almighty for giving \nus the gift of Pope John Paul II. And I thank Lolek, who became Pope \nJohn Paul II, for using those gifts to bringing us all closer to God.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/07/senate-section/article/S3355-1", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3355-S3356]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                First Lieutenant Dan Thomas Malcom, Jr.\n\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I rise today to honor U.S. Army 1LT Dan \nThomas Malcom, Jr., who was killed proudly fighting for his country in \nFallujah, Iraq, on November 10, 2004. A marine and Citadel graduate \nfrom McDuffie and Miller County, GA, Dan was 24 years old.\n  First Lieutenant Dan Thomas Malcom, Jr., the son of Dan and Cherrie \nMalcom, was born April 4, 1979, in Augusta, GA. His father, Dan Senior, \nwas a Marine Corps veteran of combat in Vietnam who tragically was \nkilled in a construction accident just prior to Dan junior's birth. \nFrom the earliest age, Dan junior wanted to ``be a Marine like my \nDaddy''. Raised in McDuffie, then later Miller County, GA, Dan attended \nMiller County High School where he was a star student.\n  Dan graduated from the Citadel in Charleston, SC, in 2001 where he \nwas Lima Company executive officer. Dan was well respected by his \nclassmates and known for his attention to his academic and military \nduties.\n  Dan was commissioned into the Marine Corps upon graduation. Dan was \nserving his second tour in Iraq when, on November 10, 2004, he was \nkilled by a sniper in Fallujah, a town infested with insurgents. The \ndetails of his death include the following: As the marines of 1st \nBattalion, 8th Infantry were clearing Fallujah of the insurgents, Dan's \nplatoon was sent to a rooftop to provide supporting fire to marines \nmaneuvering on the enemy. Dan's marines quickly found themselves under \nsniper attack from a nearby mosque. Dan left his safe position and led \nhis entire platoon down a stair case to safety. As the last one to \nclear the rooftop, Dan was hit by a deflected bullet which bounced off \nhis helmet. As Dan jumped down the stairwell, he was hit in the lower \nback by a second shot which killed him instantly.\n  Dan was buried at Arlington Cemetery on 23 November 2004, where he \nrested with our Nation's honored dead. Dan Thomas Malcom, Jr., was all \nthat America stands for. By his short life and through his bravery at \nthe end we are enriched. Dan is survived by his mother, Mrs. Cherrie \nMalcom, and sister, Mrs. Dana Killebrew. It is our hope that the memory \nof his life will serve as a beacon for others to honor and remember.\n  Dan Thomas Malcom, Jr., was a great American, a great marine, a great \nleader, and an outstanding young man. He and his comrades in Iraq \ndeserve out deepest gratitude and respect as they go about the \nextraordinarily challenging but extraordinarily important job of \nrebuilding a country which will result in freedom and prosperity for \nmillions of Iraqis. I join with Dan's family, friends, and fellow \nsoldiers in mourning his loss and want them to know that Dan's \nsacrifice will not be lost or forgotten, but will truly make a \ndifference in the lives of the Iraqi people.\n\n\n                         A Matter of Priorities\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I would like to bring an editorial from \nMonday's edition of the New York Times to the attention of my \ncolleagues. The editorial, titled ``Guns for Terrorists,'' is a logical \ncommentary on several potentially dangerous shortfalls in our Nation's \ngun safety laws that not only potentially allow individuals on \nterrorist watch lists to buy guns but also require that records related \nto the sale be destroyed within 24 hours of the purchase.\n  Under current law, individuals included on Federal terrorist watch \nlists are not automatically prohibited from purchasing firearms. A \nreport released by the General Accountability Office on March 8, 2005, \nfound that from February 3, 2004, through June 30, 2004, a total of 44 \nattempts to purchase firearms were made by individuals designated by \nthe Federal Government as known or suspected terrorists. In 35 cases, \nthe transactions were authorized to proceed because federal authorities \nwere unable to find any information in the national instant criminal \nbackground check system, NICS, that would prohibit the individual from \nlawfully receiving or possessing firearms. Current law also requires \nthat records, even in these cases, where known or suspected terrorists \nsuccessfully purchase firearms, be destroyed within 24 hours.\n  Learning about a suspected terrorist's purchase of a firearm could \npotentially be critical to counterterrorism investigators working to \nprevent a terrorist attack. Common sense tells us that the automatic \ndestruction of documents related to the successful purchase of firearms \nby individuals on terrorist watch lists would significantly hamper \nthese investigations. I have cosponsored the Terrorist Apprehension \nRecord Retention Act. The legislation would require that in cases where \na known or suspected terrorist successfully purchased a firearm, \nrecords pertaining to the transaction be retained for 10 years. The \nbill also requires that all NICS information be shared with appropriate \nFederal and State counterterrorism officials anytime an individual on a \nterrorist watch list attempts to buy a firearm.\n  We should be working to pass legislation to close loopholes that \nallow potential terrorists to buy dangerous weapons like the AK-47 \nassault rifle, the .50 caliber sniper rifle, and the\n\n[[Page S3356]]\n\nFive-Seven armor-piercing handgun. We should be working to provide our \nlaw enforcement officials with the tools they need to protect our \nfamilies and communities.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the April 4, 2005 New York Times \neditorial titled ``Guns for Terrorists'' be printed in the \nCongressional Record.\n  There being no objection, the editorial was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, Apr. 4, 2005]\n\n                          Guns for Terrorists\n\n       If a background check shows that you are an undocumented \n     immigrant, federal law bars you from buying a gun. If the \n     same check shows that you have ties to Al Qaeda, you are free \n     to buy an AK-47. That is the absurd state of the nation's gun \n     laws, and a recent government report revealed that terrorist \n     suspects are taking advantage of it. There are a few \n     promising signs, however, that the federal government is \n     considering injecting some sanity into policies on terror \n     suspects and guns.\n       The Government Accountability Office examined F.B.I. and \n     state background checks for gun sales during a five-month \n     period last year. It found 44 checks in which the prospective \n     buyer turned up on a government terrorist watch list. A few \n     of these prospective buyers were denied guns for other \n     disqualifying factors, like a felony conviction or illegal \n     immigration status. But 35 of the 44 people on the watch \n     lists were able to buy guns.\n       The encouraging news is that the G.A.O. report may be \n     prodding Washington to act. The F.B.I. director, Robert \n     Mueller III, has announced that he is forming a study group \n     to review gun sales to terror suspects. In a letter to \n     Senator Frank Lautenberg, the New Jersey Democrat, Mr. \n     Mueller said that the new working group would review the \n     national background check system in light of the report. We \n     hope this group will take a strong stand in favor of changes \n     in the law to deny guns to terror suspects.\n       In the meantime, Senator Lautenberg is pushing for \n     important reforms. He has asked the Justice Department to \n     consider making presence on a terrorist watch list a \n     disqualifying factor for gun purchases. And he wants to force \n     gun sellers to keep better records. Under a recent law, \n     records of gun purchases must be destroyed after 24 hours, \n     eliminating important information for law enforcement. \n     Senator Lautenberg wants to require that these records be \n     kept for at least 10 years for buyers on terrorist watch \n     lists.\n       Keeping terror suspects from buying guns seems like an \n     issue the entire nation can rally around. But the National \n     Rifle Association is, as usual, fighting even the most \n     reasonable regulation of gun purchases. After the G.A.O. \n     report came out, Wayne LaPierre, the N.R.A.'s executive vice \n     president, took to the airwaves to reiterate his group's \n     commitment to ensuring that every citizen has access to guns, \n     and to cast doubt on the reliability of terrorist watch \n     lists.\n       Unfortunately, the N.R.A.--rather than the national \n     interest--is too often the driving force on gun policy in \n     Congress, particularly since last November's election. Even \n     after the G.A.O.'s disturbing revelations, the Senate has \n     continued its work on a dangerous bill to insulate \n     manufacturers and sellers from liability when guns harm \n     people. If it passes, as seems increasingly likely, it will \n     remove any fear a seller might have of being held legally \n     responsible if he provides a gun used in a terrorist attack.\n\n\n                Omnibus Emissions Reduction Act of 2005\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today in support of S. 730, the \nOmnibus Emissions Reduction Act of 2005, that has been introduced by \nSenator Leahy of Vermont and myself. Our legislation is the only \ncomprehensive legislation that aims to control mercury emissions for \nall major sources of mercury pollution and stop releases of this toxic \npollutant into the environment.\n  Mercury is a liquid metal that damages the nervous system through \ningestion or inhalation, and is a particularly damaging toxic pollutant \nin the case of pregnant women and children. This is an alarming problem \nand I am pleased to note that our bill offers much greater protections \nfor the public's health than the recently released Environmental \nProtection Agency's mercury emissions rule that simply will not get the \njob done.\n  Our bill addresses the problem of how mercury pollution gets into our \nenvironment. Mercury, which is contained in coal and emitted up through \nsmokestacks into the atmosphere as the coal is burned, is then \ntransported through the air and carried downwind for hundreds and \nhundreds of miles where, unfortunately for Maine and every State along \nthe way, it falls to Earth in snow and rain. The mercury ends up in our \nlakes, rivers, and streams where it is then ingested by fish, and in \nturn by humans when they eat the fish from these freshwater sources.\n  The legislation directs the Environmental Protection Agency to \npromulgate mercury emissions standards for unregulated sources on a \nmuch more aggressive timetable to reduce mercury emissions as soon as \npossible. Our bill stops pollution at its source by requiring a ninety \npercent reduction of mercury emissions from coal-fired powered plants \nby 2010, rather than by 22 percent by 2010 as the administration's \nrecent rule calls for.\n  The Leahy-Snowe bill also addresses mercury releases from other \nsources as well, all the way from commercial and industrial boilers and \nchlor-alkali plants, to requiring labeling products containing mercury \nas simple as a mercury thermometer.\n  Mercury, as we have historically thought of it, brings to mind the \nancient Roman messenger of the gods, or the symbol that made us all \nproud, that of a small Mercury capsule carrying a lone astronaut into \nspace.\n  Mercury, as we are now coming to know it, is one of the most toxic \nsubstances in our environment, causing great neurologic damage if \ningested by humans. There is growing concern around the country about \nmercury contamination, especially in the freshwater lakes in the \nnortheast, and the risk it posses to those most vulnerable: young \nchildren, infants, and the unborn.\n  Mercury emissions are affecting our wildlife as well. In Maine, the \nbeautiful common loon with its haunting call has been known as a symbol \nof conservation--and even appears on license plates, the cost of which \nfunds conservation efforts. The haunting call is now coming from \nbiologists whose studies show that, besides the threats to humans, the \nloons and other birds, such as the bald eagle, may now be having \ntrouble reproducing or fighting diseases because of mercury ingestion.\n  The Leahy-Snowe Act also aims to reduce transboundary atmospheric and \nsurface mercury pollution by directing the EPA to work with Canada and \nMexico to inventory the sources and pathways of mercury air and water \npollution within North America. The bill dovetails nicely with the \nactions the State of Maine has taken and also the goals of the Mercury \nAction Plan of the Conference of Northeast Governors and Eastern \nCanadian Premiers.\n  This bill will go a long way towards developing a much needed \nsolution to the problem of mercury emissions in the environment, and I \nlook forward to the day when the fish advisories are lifted on all of \nour lakes in Maine so that its citizens can enjoy fuller use of their \nenvironment, and also reap greater economic benefits from its natural \nresources. This goal will not be easy to reach as our environment is \nalready impacted with past and current mercury pollution.\n  However, the Maine Legislature has already taken a significant step \ntoward this goal by establishing a state program to help Maine cities \nand towns keep mercury products out of the trash. Trash disposal, \nespecially incineration, is one of the primary ways we introduce \nmercury to the Northeast's environment.\n  Under Maine law, some mercury products such as thermometers and \nthermostats had to be labeled beginning in 2002. Also by 2002, \nbusinesses were required to recycle the mercury in these products. \nStarting this year, a similar requirement applies to homeowners.\n  Maine has taken an excellent step forward to decrease regional \nmercury pollution, but realistically no one State or region can solve \nits mercury pollution problems. What is needed is a nationwide \ninformation system and controls for mercury releases starting with the \nlargest polluters. We know that polluted air does not stop at State \nborders or even international boundaries. And, on the horizon is the \nfact that the burning coal continues to rapidly increase in developing \nnations around the globe.\n  I want to thank Senator Leahy for his hard work in highlighting the \nproblem of mercury emissions through the introduction of this \nlegislation. This introduction will bring the problem before Congress \nand the public, to spark debate, and to begin a dialogue, especially \nwith those industries that will be affected by any curbs in emissions \nand from those people most directly affected by the mercury emissions.\n  I look forward to working with Senator Leahy and my Senate colleagues \nto come up with a fair solution and one that will truly protect the \npublic's health from this pervasive toxic mercury pollution problem.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/07/senate-section/article/S3357-1", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3357]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S3357]]\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n            TRIBUTE TO ENSIGN JAMES RANDOLPH MOTLEY McMURTRY\n\n Mr. SANTORUM.

Ensign McMurtry \ntragically died while on vacation in February 2005. The McMurtry family \nhas suffered a tremendous loss, and I offer them my condolences and \ndeepest sympathy during this difficult time.\n  Ensign McMurtry grew up in Harrisburg, PA, attending the Harrisburg \nAcademy in Wormleysburg. He was an exemplary student and excelled in \nathletics. As he continued his education at the United States Naval \nAcademy in Annapolis, MD, he served as platoon commander, drill \nsergeant, and drill officer.\n  After graduating from the Naval Academy in 2003, Ensign McMurtry was \nassigned to the Joint Chiefs of Staff of the National Military Command \nCenter at the Pentagon. For all those who worked with Ensign McMurtry \nat the Pentagon, they knew him as quiet, purposeful, and respectful.\n  Ensign McMurtry had dedicated his life to protecting the freedom and \nliberties we hold dear as Americans. I value Ensign McMurtry's courage \nand patriotism. I am also inspired by this young man's conviction and \ndesire to spend his life serving our Nation. I am deeply saddened that \nhis life ended so tragically.\n  Ensign McMurtry leaves behind wonderful family, friends, and \ncoworkers. My thoughts and prayers are with those that were blessed to \nknow Ensign McMurtry.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/07/senate-section/article/S3357-2", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3357]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   25TH ANNIVERSARY OF VIETNAM VETERANS OF AMERICA'S FIRST CHAPTER, \n                            RUTLAND, VERMONT\n\n Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President. I rise before you in recognition \nof the 25th anniversary of the very first chapter of Vietnam Veterans \nof America, which was founded and nurtured in my home town of Rutland, \nVT.\n  A quarter-century ago, Vietnam veterans, their families and loved \nones were suffering the slings and arrows of anti-Vietnam war sentiment \nthat gripped our Nation. Scant recognition was given to the personal \nand professional sacrifices of these valiant American young men and \nwomen during their service to our country. Officially there was a great \ndeal of denial of the unwarranted price, both physical and emotional, \nthat had been paid by these veterans. It would be decades before post-\ntraumatic stress disorder, PTSD, would be a recognized condition. Many \nyears would also pass before the Federal Government would admit that \nuse of Agent Orange had left a terrible legacy of extreme suffering for \nour veterans and their families.\n  The founders of the Vietnam Veterans of America recognized an honor-\nbound duty as an organization to speak directly to these grave needs. \nThe outpouring of enthusiasm from the veterans themselves demonstrated \nto all Americans the depth of these convictions.\n  In 1979, during a trip to Vermont, Vietnam Veterans of America \nfounder Bobby Mueller met the late Don Bodette. Don supported the \nnotion of an organization of and for Vietnam-era veterans, but felt \nthat it would only be truly successful if they mobilized locally and \nestablished chapters. The power of Don's logic and commitment persuaded \nBobby Mueller to adopt this model. On April 13, 1980, Vietnam Veterans \nof America Chapter One was established in Rutland, VT. Taking up the \nchallenge, Don was joined by Jake Jacobsen, Albert and Mary Trombley, \nMike Dodge, Dennis Ross, Clark Howland and Mark Truhan, to name a few.\n  Over the years, Vietnam Veterans of America has won huge victories in \nthe fight for fair treatment for Vietnam veterans, and has helped \nensure that no other class of veteran will ever get that same \ntreatment. The Vietnam Veterans of America's legacy includes \nrecognition of the effects of Agent Orange and other chemical agents of \nwar, the growing body of science around PTSD diagnosis, and aggressive \nprograms to aid the veteran in the struggle to reintegrate after \nhostilities. All subsequent veterans benefit from the expertise that \nhas been developed by the staff of the Vietnam Veterans of America and \ntheir continuing effectiveness in pushing for better funding for VA \nhealth care, higher quality service delivery and respect in the \ncommunity.\n  In closing, I would like to add my thanks for the tremendous work \ndone by the Vietnam Veterans of America national and local \norganizations.

A bill to require imported explosives to be marked in the \nsame manner as domestically manufactured explosives; to the Committee \non the Judiciary.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today with Senator Hatch to introduce \nthe Imported Explosives Identification Act of 2005. This legislation \nwould require imported explosives include unique identifying markings, \njust like explosives made here at home.\n  Domestic manufacturers are required to place identification markings \non all explosive materials they produce, enabling law enforcement \nofficers to determine the source of explosives found at a crime scene--\nan important crime solving tool. Yet, these same identifying markings \nare not required of those explosives manufactured overseas and imported \ninto our country. Our legislation would simply treat imported \nexplosives just like those manufactured in the United States by \nrequiring all imported explosives to carry the same identifying \nmarkings currently placed on domestic explosives.\n  This is not a radical idea. We already have similar requirements for \nfirearms. For years, importers and manufacturers have been required to \nplace a unique serial number and other identifying information on each \nfirearm. This is a common sense security measure that we have imposed \non manufacturers and importers of firearms. There is no reason not to \ndo the same with respect to dangerous explosives.\n  These markings can be a tremendously useful tool for law enforcement \nofficials, enabling investigators to quickly follow the trail of the \nexplosives after they entered the country. According to the Bureau of \nAlcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, ATF, marked explosives can \nbe tracked through records kept by those who manufacture and sell them, \noften leading them to the criminal who has stolen or misused them. At a \nSenate hearing last year, even FBI Director Mueller recognized the \nusefulness of markings, saying they ``are helpful to the investigator . \n. . who is trying to identify the sourc[e] of that explosive.'' Failing \nto close this loophole unnecessarily impedes law enforcement efforts \nand poses a significant security risk, and closing it is simple. This \nbill fixes this problem by requiring the name of the manufacturer, \nalong with the time and date of manufacture, to be placed on all \nexplosives materials, imported and domestic.\n  ATF first sought to fill this gap in the regulation of explosives \nwhen it published a notice of a proposed rulemaking in November 2000. \nNow, more than 4 years later, this rulemaking still has not been \ncompleted. Just last week, ATF again missed its self-imposed deadline \nfor finalizing the rule.\n  Each year, thousands of pounds of stolen, lost, or abandoned \nexplosives are recovered by law enforcement. When explosives are not \nmarked, they cannot be quickly and effectively traced for criminal \nenforcement purposes. Each day we delay closing this loophole, we let \nmore untraceable explosive materials cross our borders, jeopardizing \nour security. Failure to address this very straightforward issue \nunnecessarily hinders law enforcement's efforts to keep us safe. \nBecause ATF and the Department of Justice have not closed this loophole \nin a timely manner, it is now incumbent upon us to act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BINGAMAN (for himself, Mr. Lugar, Mrs. Lincoln, Mrs. \n        Murray, Mr. Kerry, Ms. Cantwell, Mr. Kohl, Mr. Lautenberg, Mrs. \n        Boxer, and Mr. Corzine):\n  S. 740. A bill to amend title XIX and XXI of the Social Security Act \nto expand or add coverage of pregnant women under the medicaid and \nState children's health insurance program, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce bipartisan \nlegislation with Senators Lugar, Lincoln, Murray, Kerry, Cantwell, \nKohl, Lautenberg, Boxer and Corzine. This legislation, entitled the \n``Start Healthy, Stay Healthy Act of 2005,'' would significantly reduce \nthe number of uninsured pregnant women and newborns by expanding \ncoverage to pregnant women through Medicaid and the Children's Health \nInsurance Program, or CHIP, and to newborns through the first full year \nof life.\n  Today is World Health Day 2005 and the message this year is ``Make \nEvery Mother and Child Count''. I can think of no better way to honor \nour Nation's mothers and children than to increase their access to \nhealth care services and improve their overall health.\n  According to a recent report by Save the Children entitled ``The \nState of the World's Mothers,'' the United States fares no better than \n11th in the world. Why is this? According to the report, ``The United \nStates earned its 11th place rank this year based on several factors: \nOne of the key indicators used to calculate the well-being for mothers \nis lifetime risk of maternal mortality. . . . Canada, Australia, and \nall the Western and Northern European countries in the study performed \nbetter than the United States in this indicator.''\n  The study adds, ``Similarly, the United States did not do as well as \nthe top 10 countries with regard to infant mortality rates.''\n  In fact, the United States ranks 21st in maternal mortality and 28th \nin infant mortality, the worst among developed nations. We should and \nmust do\n\n[[Page S3360]]\n\nbetter by our Nation's mothers and infants.\n  There has been long-standing policy in this country linking programs \nfor pregnant women to programs for infants, including Medicaid, WIC, \nand the Maternal and Child Health Block Grant. Yet the CHIP program, \nunfortunately, fails to provide coverage to pregnant women beyond the \nage of 18. As a result, it is more likely that newborns eligible for \nCHIP are not covered from the moment of birth, and therefore, often \nmiss having comprehensive prenatal care and care during those first \ncritical months of life until their CHIP application is processed.\n  By expanding coverage to pregnant women through CHIP, the ``Start \nHealthy, Stay Healthy Act'' recognizes the importance of prenatal care \nto the health and development of a child. As Dr. Alan Waxman of the \nUniversity of New Mexico School of Medicine has written, ``Prenatal \ncare is an important factor in the prevention of birth defects and the \nprevention of prematurity, the most common causes of infant death and \ndisability. Babies born to women with no prenatal care or late prenatal \ncare are nearly twice as likely to [be] low birthweight or very low \nbirthweight as infants born to women who received early prenatal \ncare.''\n  Unfortunately, according to the Centers for Disease Control and \nPrevention, New Mexico ranked worst in the nation in the percentage of \nmothers receiving late or no prenatal care in 2003. The result is often \nquite costly--both in terms of the health of the mother and newborn but \nalso in terms of the long-term expenses for society since the result \ncan be chronic, lifelong health problems.\n  In fact, according to the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, \n``four of the top 10 most expensive conditions in the hospital are \nrelated to care of infants with complications (respiratory distress, \nprematurity, heart defects, and lack of oxygen).'' In addition to \nreduced infant mortality and morbidity, the provision to expand \ncoverage to pregnant women is cost effective.\n  The ``Start Healthy, Stay Healthy Act'' also eliminates the \nunintended federal policy through CHIP that covers pregnant women only \nthrough the age of 18 and cuts off that coverage once the women turn 19 \nyears of age. Certainly, everybody can agree that the government should \nnot be telling women that they are more likely to receive prenatal care \ncoverage only if they become pregnant as a teenager.\n  This bipartisan legislation has been supported in the past by: the \nMarch of Dimes, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American \nCollege of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the What to Expect \nFoundation, the American Academy of Family Physicians, the American \nAcademy of Pediatric Dentistry, the American Academy of Child and \nAdolescent Psychiatry, the National Association of Community Health \nCenters, the American Hospital Association, the National Association of \nChildren's Hospitals, the Federation of American Health Systems, the \nNational Association of Public Hospitals and Health Systems, Premier, \nCatholic Health Association, Catholic Charities USA, Family Voices, the \nAssociation of Maternal and Child Health Programs, the National Health \nLaw Program, the National Association of Social Workers, Every Child By \nTwo, the United Cerebral Palsy Associations, the Society for Maternal-\nFetal Medicine, and Families USA.\n  This legislation is a reintroduction of a bill that was introduced in \n2001 and 2003. Throughout 2001, the Administration made numerous \nstatements in support of the passage of this type of legislation, but \nunfortunately, reversed course in October 2002 after publishing a \nregulation allowing states to redefine a ``child'' as an ``unborn \nchild'' only and to provide prenatal care, but not postnatal care \nthrough CHIP in that manner. In a letter to Senator Nickles dated \nOctober 8, 2002, Secretary Thompson argued, ``I believe the regulation \nis a more effective and comprehensive solution to this issue.''\n  While a number of senators strongly disagreed with Secretary \nThompson's assertion and sent him letters to that effect on October 10, \n2002, and on October 23, 2002, we felt it was important to get the \ntestimony of our nation's medical experts on the health and well-being \nof both pregnant women and newborns. We called for a hearing in the \nSenate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee on October 24, \n2002. Witnesses included representatives from the March of Dimes, the \nAmerican College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the American \nAcademy of Pediatrics, and the What to Expect Foundation. They were \nasked to compare the regulation to the legislation and I will let their \ntestimony speak for itself.\n  Dr. Nancy Green testified on behalf of the March of Dimes Birth \nDefects Foundation. She said:\n\n       We support giving states the flexibility they need to cover \n     income-eligible pregnant women age 19 and older, and to \n     automatically enroll infants born to SCHIP-eligible mothers. \n     By establishing a uniform eligibility threshold for coverage \n     for pregnant women and infants, states will be able to \n     improve maternal health, eliminate waiting periods for \n     infants and streamline administration of publicly supported \n     health programs. Currently, according to the Department of \n     Health and Human Services' Centers for Medicare and Medicaid \n     Services and the National Governors' Association, 36 states \n     and the District of Columbia have income eligibility \n     thresholds that are more restrictive for women than for their \n     newborns. Encouraging states to eliminate this disparity by \n     allowing them to establish a uniform eligibility threshold \n     for pregnant women and their infants should be a national \n     policy priority.\n\n  Dr. Green adds:\n\n       Specifically, we are deeply concerned that final regulation \n     fails to provide to the mother the standard scope of \n     maternity care services recommended by the American College \n     of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) and the American \n     Academy of Pediatrics (AAP). Of particular concern, the \n     regulation explicitly states that postpartum care is not \n     covered and, therefore, federal reimbursement will not be \n     available for these services. In addition, because of the \n     contentious collateral issues raised by this regulation \n     groups like the March of Dimes will find it even more \n     difficult to work in the states to generate support for \n     legislation to extend coverage to uninsured pregnant women.\n\n  Dr. Laura Riley testified on behalf of ACOG. In her testimony, she \nstated:\n\n       ACOG is very concerned that mothers will not have access to \n     postpartum services under the regulation. The rule clearly \n     states that ``. . . care after delivery, such as postpartum \n     services could not be covered as part of the Title XXI State \n     Plan . . . because they are not services for an eligible \n     child.\n\n  On the importance of postpartum care, Dr. Riley adds:\n\n       When new mothers develop postpartum complications, quick \n     access to their physicians is absolutely critical. Postpartum \n     care is especially important for women who have preexisting \n     medical conditions, and for those whose medical conditions \n     were induced by their pregnancies, such as gestational \n     diabetes or hypertension, and for whom it is necessary to \n     ensure that their conditions are stabilized and treated.\n\n  As a result, Dr. Riley concludes:\n\n       Limiting coverage to the fetus instead of the mother omits \n     a critical component of postpartum care that physicians \n     regard as essential for the health of the mother and the \n     child. Covering the fetus as opposed to the mother also \n     raises questions of whether certain services will be \n     available during pregnancy and labor if the condition is one \n     that directly affects the woman. The best way to address this \n     coverage issue is to pass S. 724, supported by Senators \n     Bond, Bingaman and Lincoln and many others, and which \n     provides a full range of medical services during and after \n     pregnancy directly to the pregnant woman.\n\n  Dr. Richard Bucciarelli testified on behalf of the American Academy \nof Pediatrics. He said:\n\n       Recently, the Administration published a final rule \n     expanding SCHIP to cover unborn children. The Academy is \n     concerned that, as written, this regulation falls dangerously \n     short of the clinical standards of care outlined in our \n     guidelines, which describe the importance of covering all \n     stages of a birth--pregnancy, delivery, and postpartum care.\n\n  It is important to note that the regulation subtracts the time that \nan ``unborn child'' is covered from the period of continuously \neligibility after birth. Consequently, children would be denied \ninsurance coverage at very critical points during the first full year \nof life. As such, Dr. Bucciarelli expressed support for the legislation \nover the regulation because it, in his words:\n\n       . . . takes an important step to decrease the number of \n     uninsured children by providing 12 months of continuous \n     eligibility for those children born . . . This legislation \n     ensures that children born to women enrolled in Medicaid or \n     SCHIP are immediately enrolled in the program for which they \n     are eligible. Additionally, this provision prevents newborns \n     eligible for SCHIP from being subject to enrollment waiting \n     periods, ensuring that infants receive appropriate health \n     care in their first year of life.\n\n\n[[Page S3361]]\n\n\n  And finally, Lisa Bernstein testified as Executive Director of The \nWhat to Expect Foundation, which takes its name from the bestselling \nWhat to Expect pregnancy and parenting series that has helped over 20 \nmillion families from pregnancy through their child's toddler years. \nMs. Bernstein also supported the legislation as a far superior option \nover the regulation and make this simple but eloquent point:\n\n  . . . only a healthy parent can provide a healthy future for a \nhealthy child.\n\n  The testimony of these experts speaks for itself and I urge my \ncolleagues to pass this legislation as soon as possible.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 740\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Con. Res. 25\n\n       Whereas Airbus is currently the leading manufacturer of \n     large civil aircraft, with a full fleet of aircraft and more \n     than 50 percent global market share;\n       Whereas Airbus has received approximately $30,000,000,000 \n     in market distorting subsidies from European governments, \n     including launch aid, infrastructure support, debt \n     forgiveness, equity infusions, and research and development \n     funding;\n       Whereas these subsidies, in particular launch aid, have \n     lowered Airbus' development costs and shifted the risk of \n     aircraft development to European governments, and thereby \n     enabled Airbus to develop aircraft at an accelerated pace and \n     sell these aircraft at prices and on terms that would \n     otherwise be unsustainable;\n       Whereas the benefit of these subsidies to Airbus is \n     enormous, including, at a minimum, the avoidance of \n     $35,000,000,000 in debt as a result of launch aid's \n     noncommercial interest rate;\n       Whereas over the past 5 years, Airbus has gained 20 points \n     of world market share and 45 points of market share in the \n     United States, all at the expense of Boeing, its only \n     competitor;\n       Whereas this dramatic shift in market share has had a \n     tremendous impact, resulting in the loss of over 60,000 high-\n     paying United States aerospace jobs;\n       Whereas on October 6, 2004, the United States Trade \n     Representative filed a complaint at the World Trade \n     Organization on the basis that all of the subsidies that the \n     European Union and its Member States have provided to Airbus \n     violate World Trade Organization rules;\n       Whereas on January 11, 2005, the European Union agreed to \n     freeze the provision of launch aid and other government \n     support and negotiate with a view to reaching a \n     comprehensive, bilateral agreement covering all government \n     supports in the large civil aircraft sector;\n       Whereas the Bush administration has shown strong leadership \n     and dedication to bring about a fair resolution during the \n     negotiations;\n       Whereas Airbus received $6,200,000,000 in government \n     subsidies to build the A380;\n       Whereas Airbus has now committed to develop and produce yet \n     another new model, the A350, even before the A380 is out of \n     the development phase;\n       Whereas Airbus has stated that it does not need launch aid \n     to build the A350, but has nevertheless applied for and \n     European governments are prepared to provide $1,700,000,000 \n     in new launch aid; and\n       Whereas European governments are apparently determined to \n     target the United States aerospace sector and Boeing's \n     position in the large civil aircraft market by providing \n     Airbus with continuing support to lower its costs and reduce \n     its risk: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That--\n\n[[Page S3363]]\n\n       (1) European governments should reject Airbus' pending \n     application for launch aid for the A350 and any future \n     applications for launch aid;\n       (2) the European Union, acting for itself and on behalf of \n     its Member States, should renew its commitment to the terms \n     agreed to on January 11, 2005;\n       (3) the United States Trade Representative should request \n     the formation of a World Trade Organization dispute \n     resolution panel at the earliest possible opportunity if \n     there is no immediate agreement to eliminate launch aid for \n     the A350 and all future models and no concrete progress \n     toward a comprehensive bilateral agreement covering all \n     government supports in the large aircraft sector; and\n       (4) the President should take any additional action the \n     President considers appropriate to protect the interests of \n     the United States in fair competition in the large commercial \n     aircraft market.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/07/senate-section/article/S3363-1", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3363]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AUTHORITY FOR COMMITTEES TO MEET\n\n\n            committee on banking, housing, and urban affairs\n\n  Mr. INHOFE.

Reserving the right to object, and I will not object, I \nwill say that one of the things we are also working on, and I am \nwilling to go forward without this stage, we were moving along with the \ncolloquy of Senator Stabenow and Senator Lindsey Graham--I am quite \ncertain that was the cosponsor of the amendment--an amendment dealing \nwith international trade. I spoke to Senator Grassley. Senator Grassley \nindicated he would be willing to enter into a colloquy with her. That \nwas being prepared when the problem arose with the New York Senators \nand Senator Dodd. As a result of that, the colloquy was never \nfinalized--at least brought to the floor.\n  I hope when we return to that bill, whenever that might be, we can \ncomplete that colloquy because, in fact, what Senator Grassley said is \nthat if the amendment were not filed at this time he would be happy to \ntake a look at it. He has another amendment coming and he basically \nsaid he agreed with the content of her amendment, but he didn't agree \nit should be brought up on this bill. He felt his Finance Committee has \njurisdiction.\n  I want that spread on the record. This does not call for anyone \nagreeing or disagreeing with what I said, just in the future I hope we \ncan work that out.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, prior to the ruling, the proponents of \nthe legislation have also agreed they would withhold offering \namendments in committee or on the floor on the subject matter for the \nduration of this session of Congress as part of this understanding, as \nwell.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/07/senate-section/article/S3363-5", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3363-S3364]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ORDERS FOR MONDAY, APRIL 11, 2005\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Other votes are possible around that 5:30 \ntime in relation to the supplemental bill.\n  I say to all of our colleagues, this will be a busy week. This is a \nbig, important piece of legislation. We hope to finish it next week. \nBut in any event, whether we finish it then or not, we are going to \nhave a busy week, with lots of votes throughout the entire week, \nincluding the likelihood of night sessions.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/07/senate-section/article/S3364-2", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3364]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          ADJOURNMENT UNTIL MONDAY, APRIL 11, 2005, AT 2 P.M.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL.
