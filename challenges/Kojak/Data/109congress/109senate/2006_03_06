Mr. President, today, following my remarks and the remarks \nof the Democratic leader, we will start a period of morning business. \nWe are expecting that around 2 o'clock today we will begin \nconsideration of the lobbying reform bill. The two bills were reported \nlast week--one by the Rules Committee and the other by the Homeland \nSecurity and Governmental Affairs Committee. We will proceed to the \nRules Committee bill and offer a substitute amendment which is a \ncombination of these pieces of legislation. I hope Senators will take \nadvantage of the opportunity today to come down and give statements on \nlobbying reform.\n  This afternoon at 5:30 we have three votes on three district court \njudges. I am not certain we will need a rollcall vote on each of these. \nBut at this point Senators should anticipate up to three rollcall votes \nat 5:30.\n  I should remind our colleagues that we have a cloture motion filed on \nLIHEAP, which was introduced by Senator Snowe. That cloture vote will \noccur tomorrow morning. I hope cloture will be invoked and we can \ncomplete that bill as quickly as possible and then return to the \nconsideration of the lobbying reform legislation.\n  We will have votes over the course of the week. I anticipate it is \ngoing to be a busy week, requiring a lot of work on the lobbying \nreform, on LIHEAP, and other issues that come forward. There are 2 \nweeks remaining before our next recess. Another issue we will be \ndealing with in committee this week is the budget. We will be dealing \nwith that before we leave, and issues such as the debt ceiling as well \nwill be dealt with before we leave--a whole range of issues. It will be \na busy week as we go forward.\n  Let me turn to the Democratic leader--I have a brief statement on \nlobbying reform--if there are any thoughts or questions or comments \nabout scheduling or issues.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we believe it will not be necessary to have \na vote on the Puerto Rican judge. We will be able to do that by voice \nvote. There will be two votes. I am wondering if the leader has an \nindication as to tomorrow. What will happen after the cloture vote? Do \nwe know yet?\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, we do not know yet. We will have some idea \nby later today. But I hope cloture will be invoked and that we can \ncomplete it as rapidly as possible.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/03/06/senate-section/article/S1759-7", "month": "03", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1759-S1760]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            LEGISLATIVE TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY ACT\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, today the Senate is taking another step \nforward to make our Government more transparent and more accountable. \nIt will be a very important debate on very substantive issues, issues \nthat affect the operation of this body and our relationships to outside \ngroups.\n  We will begin debate on the comprehensive lobbying and ethics reform \nlegislation. Over the last few months, we have made steady progress.\n  The Senate was first to develop a plan. It was the first to establish \na working group to examine the issue. It was the first to hold \ncommittee hearings and to have a markup--two markups. And today we will \nbe the first to\n\n[[Page S1760]]\n\nbring a comprehensive lobbying reform package to the floor.\n  I wish to in particular thank our colleague from Pennsylvania, \nSenator Santorum, for his willingness to lead a lobbying reform working \ngroup. He has hosted numerous meetings over the last several weeks and \nspent countless hours on this issue. We are where we are today in large \npart because of his commitment and his leadership. I wish to recognize \nhim for that.\n  I also appreciate the work of the chairman and chairwoman of our \nRules Committee and Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs \nCommittee, Chairman Lott and Chairman Collins. They have worked \nexpeditiously, both in discussions and holding hearings and markups, so \nwe could in response to my request have available for floor \nconsideration today legislation that centers on commonsense reform. \nThere will be a lot of debate and there will be a lot of discussion, \nbut I think the issues have been laid out and laid out well. Those two \nchairmen will be comanaging the bill from our side of the aisle, since \neach of those committees brought forth that legislation from their \nrespective committees.\n\n  So that everyone understands how we expect to proceed, we will begin \ndebate on S. 2349, the Legislative Transparency and Accountability Act. \nThe first amendment offered will be a substitute, incorporating the \njoint text of both the bills reported by the Rules Committee and by the \nHomeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee.\n  I have asked the two managers to move forward in as efficient a way \nas we possibly can in order to achieve that goal of completing this \nlegislation this week. It is going to take a lot of hard work, a lot of \nworking together, and a lot of cooperation in order to accomplish that. \nChairman Lott and Chairman Collins are committed to this timeframe. I \nencourage all of our colleagues to work with them to ensure that we can \naccomplish this goal.\n  If Senators have amendments--and I recognize there will be a number \nof amendments--I urge them to discuss those amendments, the nature of \nthose amendments, and make the language available as soon as possible \nwith the managers. Let us keep amendments on the issue that is at hand, \nthe issues surrounding ethics and lobbying. Tying up the bill with \nunrelated amendments, which we call nongermane amendments, is not in \nanybody's best interest. So let us stay on the bill as much as we \npossibly can.\n  A final note. As we enter the debate--I think we will enter it--we \nare entering it in a tone of working together. It is not a partisan \nissue we are addressing. People expect us to work together to develop \nmeaningful, nonpartisan solutions but bipartisan solutions to the real \nproblems we know we will be addressing. Ethics is not a partisan issue. \nThe rules apply, as they should, to every Senator and every staff \nmember, regardless of party or stripe. No one gets a special exception.\n  That is the spirit in which we should approach this bill.\n  The rules we operate under are bipartisan. The reforms indeed are and \nshould be bipartisan as well. It is my firm belief that as public \nservants we are obligated to protect the integrity of this fantastic, \nmagnificent institution, and most importantly to represent the genuine \ninterests of the voters--which is our responsibility--who sent us here.\n  It is time for us to reexamine the rules so that bad apples are \nexposed before they spoil the whole lot. That is why I have brought \nthis bill to the floor now so we can address it right up front early on \nin this session. Taking these steps will go a long way to lifting the \ncloud that threatens to obscure all of our other efforts to offer \nmeaningful reforms and solutions to the problems we now face and that \nface all Americans.\n  The issue is something very personal to me. I still consider myself a \ncitizen legislator, coming here for a period of time and going back \nhome. It causes me to reflect on my first vote as a Senator. It was on \nthe Congressional Accountability Act, an act that ensures that Congress \nabides by the laws it passes.\n  I believe deeply that we serve the people--not the other way around, \nand that spirit will be the spirit I believe we will all put forth in \nthis debate over the next several days.\n  We have a real opportunity before us--an opportunity to make \ngovernment more transparent, more accountable, and to strengthen the \nAmerican people's confidence in our body. Once again, I ask my \ncolleagues to join together and deliver meaningful reforms, not only to \nfulfill our commitment to the American people but to protect and \npreserve the honor of this great institution we all have the privilege \nof serving.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/03/06/senate-section/article/S1760-1", "month": "03", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1760-S1761]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               HONEST LEADERSHIP AND OPEN GOVERNMENT ACT\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, in recent months, the public has been \nshocked and outraged over stories dealing with abusive and, I believe, \ncriminal practices--and so do various prosecutors--by lobbyists, senior \nadministration officials, Members of Congress, and even congressional \nstaff. A number of these participants in these schemes that breached \nthe public trust have pled guilty--Republican lobbyist Jack Abramoff, \nformer staffer for the recent House Republican Majority Leader Michael \nScanlon, Republican Member of Congress Duke Cunningham, and one of his \ncoconspirators, Michael Wade. Others are under indictment, including \nPresident Bush's political appointee David Safavian.\n  The guilty pleas, indictments, and documents released to date suggest \nwrongdoing or improper behavior by many others, including a former \nDeputy Secretary of the Interior, other former aides to the recent \nHouse Republican majority leader, former aides to Republican Senators; \nGrover Norquist, a close ally of the Bush White House; Ralph Reed, \nlong-time political operative for the Republicans--in fact, he has been \nState chair of at least one State party--and, of course, the heads of \ntwo other groups closely associated with the Republican Party.\n  The American people understand these are not one or two isolated \nincidents. They understand this is a clear pattern of wrongdoing--\nwrongdoing that can only be explained by an alarming sense of impunity. \nThe public understands these individuals felt that they were above the \nlaw. They felt they could ignore the rules. They felt government was \nnot there to serve the people's interest but to serve their own special \ninterests or the interests of some of their cronies.\n  The public has seen a Republican culture that has distorted \ngovernment priority and grown into the greatest government scandal \nsince Watergate. So as we begin this debate, it is important to realize \nthis wrongdoing often violated existing laws and congressional ethics \nrules. It is already illegal to offer or accept a bribe. It is already \nillegal to defraud your clients. It is already illegal to lie and \ncommit perjury. The rules already prohibit Members from taking trips \nthat have no real business purpose and are just excuses for a golf \nouting. So much of what went on was already criminal or certainly \nclearly unethical. The problem, in many cases, was not in the rules. It \nwas in the culture that allowed everyone to believe they could ignore \nthe rules.\n\n  But in some cases it was clear, the rules have shortcomings. So even \nthough a number of the things that people did clearly violated the \nrules we now have, in some of these cases it was clear that the rules \nhad shortcomings and we needed to beef them up. In these areas, we need \nto expand disclosure and tighten rules that have been abused. We also \nneed to find a way to restore public faith in the integrity of our \nFederal Government.\n  The best way to do this is to show the public we take this issue \nseriously and that we will act aggressively and swiftly to change the \nculture in the Nation's Capital.\n  That is why I am satisfied with what my Democratic colleagues have \nbeen able to do with this legislation that will shortly be before the \nSenate. As soon as we returned from the winter recess, we, as a caucus, \nacted decisively. We unveiled sweeping reform principles and backed \nthem with legislation. It is one thing to address this issue through \nquickly called press conferences that offer no details; it is another \nto put reform to paper and to use a reform bill that has supported \nvirtually the entire\n\n[[Page S1761]]\n\nDemocratic caucus. That is what we did.\n  The Honest Leadership Act fundamentally changed the debate on ethics \nand lobbying reform. It is hard to draft legislation. I called upon my \nstaff, one of my most senior persons, someone who was the chief of \nstaff of the Commerce Committee under Senator Hollings, Kevin Kayes. He \nhas worked hard. Saturday nights, Sunday nights, I have spoken to him. \nI acknowledge the hard work that he has done on this legislation. I \nappreciate it very much.\n  We put on paper what we thought was the best thing for this \ninstitution. The Honest Leadership Act, Open Government Act, \nfundamentally changed the debate on ethic and lobbying reform. \nDemocrats stood united. United we said: We are not going to let this \nprocess drag on and hope that people get distracted. We are going to \nseize the initiative and begin to change the culture that we find in \nWashington. Democrats established the baseline for reform by getting \ncaucus-wide support for a tough and comprehensively formed bill. \nDemocrats raised the stakes on this issue and forced the Senate to deal \nwith this in a meaningful way.\n  We have had a number of participants on the Democratic side of the \naisle. This is not in the order of how hard they have worked, but I \nexpress my appreciation--because they have all worked hard--to Senator \nDodd, Senator Lieberman, the ranking members of the Committee on Rules \nand Government Operations Committees. I appreciate the work of Senator \nFeingold who has been involved in these issues for many years. And a \nnew Senator, Mr. Obama, has done such a good job of expressing himself \nto the American public how we feel on this side of the aisle about the \nneed to change what is going on in Washington. Senator Levin has also \nbeen a stalwart, helpful from the very beginning. He, like Senator \nFeingold, has been involved in these issues for a long time.\n  It would not be fair to just list the Democrats. The work performed \nin the Committee on Rules was a hard job. It was the first body to take \nthis up. It showed the experience of Senator Dodd and Senator Lott. \nThey had a cordial relationship going into this which helped \nsignificantly in moving that bill out of the committee very quickly. \nSenator Lieberman worked very hard with Senator Collins. They came up \nwith another piece of legislation as a result of their ability to work \ntogether. I appreciate Senator Lott very much and Senator Collins for \ntheir work, working with Democrats. Their work did advance the reform \nproposals that we introduced.\n  It goes without saying I am glad we are here today. It is fair to say \nwe would not be here and certainly not with this strong piece of \nlegislation from the Committee on Government Operations and the Rules \nCommittee if not for the efforts of my caucus.\n  In fact, much of what Democrats supported in S. 2180 has been \nincluded in the bills that will come before the Senate today which will \nbe united into one bill. What are some of the things we have done? I \nwill not mention all of them, but I will mention some. Slow the \nrevolving door between government jobs and lucrative private sector \nemployment. Revoke floor privileges for former member lobbyists. A \nformer Member has to decide, if they want to come to the Senate, they \nare not going to be able to do their work here if they are lobbyists. \nThat is unfair to some who also are lobbyists who certainly never used \nthe floor in any negative way. I think I can say that for most all.\n  We have to do away with what is wrong and with what appears to be \nwrong. This legislation will be in the Senate in less than an hour and \nit eliminates gifts paid for by lobbyists, not just disclosure gifts. \nThere will be more disclosure and scrutiny of privately funded travel. \nThis legislation will stop dead-of-night legislating by making \nconference reports available on the Internet. This legislation will \nrequire more frequent and more detailed lobbyists' disclosure available \non the Internet. And there is increased civil rights penalties for \nviolations.\n\n  This legislation required ethics training. It will require ethics \ntraining for congressional staff and will require disclosure for \nstealth lobbying campaigns by business coalitions and other \norganizations that slipped under the radar screen in the past. They \nwill not any more.\n  Not all of what the Democrats sought is in this bill. I know that. In \nsome cases, the provisions included are weaker than what was in our \nproposal. But we will offer amendments to strengthen the bill in these \nareas.\n  I am pleased that so much of what we worked for as a caucus has now \ngained broad bipartisan support. We have tried very hard. There are \nsome groups, quite frankly, that there is not enough we could ever do, \nno matter what we do would never be enough. But it is important to \nrecognize while there may be some outside groups who think we have not \ndone enough, we have done a lot.\n  During this debate, I hope we remain honest with the American people \nabout an important point. When we approve this legislation--I am \nhopeful in conference we will--we will not have put the Abramoff \nscandal behind us. Indeed, it is likely that future indictments and \nadditional revelations will end any confusion on this point. The only \nway we put the Abramoff and other scandals behind us and restore the \npublic faith in government is by each and every one of us, all 100 of \nus, and our staffs, conducting ourselves and operating this institution \nwith the highest level of integrity.\n  This legislation will set parameters that will be easier to follow. \nThe costs of corruption are high, and it is the American people who pay \nfor it. What has happened in Washington has eroded the ability of our \nGovernment to meet the needs of our people.\n  Look at this administration's response to Hurricane Katrina and the \ngrowing national unease about our security, both here and abroad. Just \nimagine, if Duke Cunningham and his coconspirators had not succeeded in \nspending tens of millions of taxpayers dollars to give their cronies \nbogus contracts, that money could have been used to pay for body armor, \nport security, or some other critical need. This is only one example.\n  The culture of corruption distorts our priorities and frustrates \nefforts to address the real needs of Americans, these Americans who are \ntrying to cope with high natural gas prices to heat their homes, high \nfuel prices for the cars, concerns about their own retirement security, \nand a growing sense that they are having to work harder and harder to \nmaintain even their current standard of living. Each one of us came \nhere to serve the American people. We have been given a tremendously \ndifficult responsibility. But it is one we all sought. Of course, it is \na real privilege.\n  I am confident we can clean up the situation we now have in \nWashington so we can get on with the Nation's business. America \ndeserves a government as good as its people. Together, America can do \nbetter.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/03/06/senate-section/article/S1761-1", "month": "03", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1761]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

I think one of the important things to \nnote at the very beginning is that this legislation from both the Rules \nCommittee and the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee \nwas reported as bipartisan legislation, and it is legislation that will \nabsolutely ensure greater transparency and accountability in the \nlegislative process.\n  There are those in Washington--me included--who have been concerned \nof late by how much partisanship there is in Washington and in the \nlegislative process. I do think it has reached unprecedented levels. \nBut I believe it is also possible for us to not have everything be that \npartisan. So that is why I think the way these two bills have been \nreported is so remarkable because the Rules Committee had a full debate \nand amendments were offered. Some were passed, some were rejected, some \nwere accepted, and some were ruled out of order. When we got to final \npassage, Senators on both sides of the partisan aisle felt it was a \nfair process and there was not a single dissenting vote.\n  Also, the Governmental Affairs Committee--if I may refer to it that \nway in shorthand--reported it with only one ``no'' vote after having a \nfull discussion and some amendments that were not easy to deal with. So \nI hope the spirit of bipartisanship can carry to the floor when we take \nup the amendments.\n  This afternoon's proceeding will be somewhat abbreviated because we \nhave to take out some time for discussion about judicial nominees and \nvotes, and we do have some further action with regard to the low-income \nenergy assistance issue. However, when we get back to these bills \ntomorrow and are ready for amendments, I hope Senators will come over \nand we can get a time agreement and we will have a good discussion and \nvotes. Perhaps even some amendments can be accepted, depending on what \nthey are, and we can get this process completed before this week is \nover. I think that would be very good for the institution, and it needs \nto be done.\n\n  I do think this is an important effort. I have looked at what the \nRules Committee did and what came out of the Rules Committee in the \nlast week. This will be the third time I have been involved in a \nprocess of changing the rules or looking at what we might need to do \nafter a difficult time in our history. That was true back in the \nseventies after the Watergate matter. We took up campaign reform and \nethics reform and made some significant changes, some of them wise and \nsome of them turned out to be not so advisable. We had to address the \npeople's confidence in our institutions at that time.\n  Then again in the nineties we had some issues come up that caused \nproblems and concerns following the House banking scandal. Again, we \nwent through a process of looking at our ethics, looking at our rules, \nand looking at lobbying reform, and took action.\n  Here again we are looking at some changes in the rules and some \nimprovements or some additional requirements with regard to lobbying \nreform. I think it is needed.\n  Some people say: Why do you have to keep changing? Are your rules, \nyour ethics, are your lobbying requirements changing? Yes, they change \nwith time. When we wrote the Telecommunications Act in 1996 and 1997, \nwe thought phones were all going to be hard wired. We had no idea of \nall the technological advances that were going to occur. When we did \nimmigration reform in 1997, I thought we did a good job. Obviously, we \ndid a terribly inadequate job.\n  We need to take a look at what we have done in the past when it comes \nto laws, rules, ethics reforms, lobbying reform, and modernize it. For \none thing, with all the modern capability and technology, you can have \ninstantaneous disclosure; you can have fuller disclosure. It is easier \nnow to file reports with the Secretary of the Senate or to put it on \nyour own Internet to divulge and disclose to the American people and \nall who wish to look at those reports what you are doing in your role \nas a Senator and your service to the people.\n  I want to make it clear, I think this is an issue we should address. \nThat is why when the leader called on me to have a hearing in the Rules \nCommittee and to move forward, I moved forward on the issue \naggressively because I thought there are rules changes that we need, we \nshould do, could do, that would make common sense, and would be fair.\n  This is an issue where it is very easy to lose control emotionally or \nwe get involved in a tremendous process of self-flagellation and \ncondemnation. I don't want to do that, but there are some places where \nthere are legitimate concerns or appearances of impropriety which we \ncan improve.\n  Senator Dodd and I talked on the phone, we met, and we came up with \nsome important points, and I think we have come up with a pretty good \nbill. We need to go forward, have a full discussion, take up serious \namendments that will be offered, and get this job done. I look forward \nto working with Senator Collins and making this a bill with which both \ncommittees are comfortable.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that my section-by-section \nanalysis of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n    Section-by-Section Summary of the Legislative Transparency and \n                  Accountability Act of 2006 (S. 2349)\n\n(Reported by the Senate Committee on Rules and Administration, February \n                               28, 2006)\n\n       Section 1. Short Title: The Legislative Transparency and \n     Accountability Act of 2006.\n       Section 2. Out of Scope Matters in Conference Reports: New \n     Point of Order against\n\n[[Page S1763]]\n\n     out of scope matters in Conference Reports. Point of Order \n     can be waived by 60 votes. If the Point of Order is \n     sustained, the offending material is deleted from the \n     Conference Report and returned to the House for it's \n     concurrence.\n       Section 3. Earmarks: Creates a new Standing Rule (XLIV) \n     dealing with earmarks. Earmarks are defined as ``a provision \n     that specifies the identity of a non-Federal entity to \n     receive assistance. . . .'' ``Assistance'' is defined to \n     include budget authority, contract authority, loan authority, \n     and other expenditures including tax expenditures or other \n     revenue items.\n       This new Standing Rule requires that all Senate bills or \n     conference reports include a list of all earmarks in the \n     measure; an identification of the Member who proposed the \n     earmark, and an explanation of the essential government \n     purpose of the earmark. The bill or Conference Report, \n     including the list of earmarks, must be available to the \n     Senate and to the general public on the Internet for at least \n     24 hours before its consideration.\n       Section 4. Conference Report Availability: Provides for the \n     implementation of the requirement that Conference Reports be \n     available to the general public for at least 24 hours before \n     its consideration. Requires the creation of a new Senate \n     website capable of posting this information. The effective \n     date of this Section is set as 60 days after the date of \n     enactment of the Act.\n       Section 5. Floor Privileges for Former Members: Amends \n     Standing Rule XXIII of the Standing Rules of the Senate to \n     eliminate floor privileges for former Members, former Senate \n     Officers, and former Speakers of the House who are either \n     registered lobbyists or employed by an entity for the purpose \n     of influencing the passage, defeat or amendment of any \n     legislative proposal. Permits the Committee on Rules and \n     Administration to issue regulations allowing floor privileges \n     for such individuals for ceremonial functions or events \n     designated by the Majority and Minority Leader.\n       Section 6. Gifts and Meals: Amends Standing Rule XXXV to \n     ban gifts from registered lobbyists or foreign agents. An \n     exception is provided for meals, retaining the current \n     financial limits. A provision is added requiring that within \n     15 days of receiving a meal, Members post on their website \n     the value of such meals and refreshments provided to \n     themselves and their staff, and the person who paid for the \n     meal.\n       Section 7. Pre-Clearance of Trips and Disclosure: \n     Subsection (a) amends Standing Rule XXXV to require pre-\n     clearance approval by the Senate Select Committee on Ethics \n     to receive transportation or lodging provided by a third \n     party, other than travel sponsored by a governmental entity. \n     The person providing the transportation and lodging would \n     have to certify that the trip was not financed, in whole, or \n     in part by a registered lobbyist or foreign agent and that \n     the person sponsoring the trip did not accept directly, or \n     indirectly, funds from a registered lobbyist or foreign \n     agent earmarked to finance the trip.\n       A detailed trip itinerary would have to be provided to the \n     Ethics Committee along with a written determination by the \n     Senator that the trip is primarily educational; consistent \n     with official duties, does not create an appearance of use of \n     public office for private gain, and has a minimal, or no, \n     recreational component, before the Committee could approve \n     the trip.\n       Not later than 30 days after the trip is completed, the \n     Member would have to file with the Select Committee on Ethics \n     and the Secretary of the Senate a description of the meetings \n     and events attended during the trip and the name of any \n     registered lobbyist who accompanies the Member during the \n     trip. Such information would also have to be posted on the \n     Member's Senate website. Disclosure would not be required if \n     such disclosure would jeopardize the safety of an individual \n     or adversely affect national security.\n       Subsection (b) amends Standing Rule XXXV to require that a \n     Member or employee who is provided a flight on a private \n     aircraft, other than an aircraft that is owned, operated or \n     leased by a governmental entity, file a publicly available \n     disclosure report with the Secretary of the Senate \n     identifying the date, destination and owner or lessee of the \n     aircraft, the purpose of the trip and the persons on the trip \n     except the persons flying the aircraft. A similar disclosure, \n     without an exclusion for government flights, would be \n     required to be filed with the Federal Election Commission if \n     such a flight took place as part of a federal election \n     campaign.\n       Section 8: Post-Employment Restrictions: Amends Standing \n     Rule XXXVII to conform the post-employment registered \n     lobbyist restrictions on Senate staff earning 75 percent of \n     the rate of pay of a Member with the restrictions that are \n     imposed on former Senators. Such staff would be prohibited \n     from lobbying the Senate for one year after their employment \n     terminates. This provision would be effective 60 days after \n     the date of enactment.\n       Section 9: Public Disclosure of Employment Negotiations: \n     Amends Standing Rule XXXVII to require that a Member who is \n     engaged in prospective private sector employment \n     negotiations, prior to the election of the Senator's \n     successor, must file a public disclosure statement with the \n     Secretary of Senate regarding such negotiations within three \n     business days after the commencement of such negotiations.\n       Section 10: Lobbying by Family Members: Amends Standing \n     Rule XXXVII to provide if a Member's spouse or immediate \n     family member is a registered lobbyist or employed by a \n     registered lobbyist, staff employed by the Member are \n     prohibited from having any official contact with the Member's \n     spouse or immediate family member.\n       ``Immediate Family Member'' is defined as the son, \n     daughter, stepson, stepdaughter, son-in-law, daughter-in-law, \n     mother, father, stepmother, stepfather, mother-in-law, \n     father-in-law, brother, sister, stepbrother, or stepsister of \n     the Member.''\n       Section 11: Unlawfully Using Public Office to Influence \n     Hiring Decisions: Amends Standing Rule XLIII to prohibit a \n     Member from seeking to influence, on the basis of political \n     affiliation, an employment decision of any private entity by \n     taking or withholding or offering or threatening to take or \n     withhold an official act; or to influence or offer or \n     threaten to influence, the official act of another.\n       Section 12: Sense of the Senate on Scope of Restrictions in \n     The Act: A Sense of the Senate Resolution that any \n     restrictions imposed by this Act on Members and employees of \n     Congress should apply to the Executive and Judicial branches.\n       Section 13: Effective Date: Provides that the Act shall \n     take effect on the date of enactment except in those cases \n     where a different enactment date is provided.\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, let me go through the Rules Committee bill \nand talk about some of the more important aspects. I won't go into all \nthe details because Members will have a chance to review what we \nreported last Tuesday, and now it will be in the Record. When I \ncomplete my comments, Senator Collins or Senator Dodd will be ready to \nspeak. We will be able to make it very clear what we have done. Some of \nthese things do need to be explained a little bit.\n  First of all, with regard to earmarks, we do know that there has been \nan explosion of so-called earmarks. This is where you put provisions, \nmoney, language in an authorization, appropriations, or a tax bill. I \nremember a few years ago it was maybe a few hundred. I remember the \nhighway bill back in the eighties, I think, it had 157 earmarks, and \nthe bill we passed last year had thousands--I don't even know how many \nbut thousands.\n  I want to be the first to say I don't think that is totally \ninappropriate. I do think we need to have some better disclosure. I do \nthink we need to think about how we do these earmarks, have some rules \nthat make it clear who is doing what and for whom. So that is what we \nhave tried to do with this legislation.\n  Some people will come to the floor--and I presume somebody might even \noffer an amendment--and say that earmarks are prohibited. I will fight \nthat with every ounce of energy in my body. Some people might maintain \nthat should be better left to the executive branch. Why? Why should \nsome bureaucrat who lives in Maryland or Virginia--and I say that term \nlovingly--who works at HUD or the Department of Transportation or the \nDepartment of Defense--it doesn't matter what department--how do they \nknow more about what is needed in terms of roads or housing or National \nGuard in my State of Mississippi or more than the Senator from Maine \nknows about what the needs are in her State? So I think it is ludicrous \nto maintain only the executive branch is pure.\n  By the way, do you think the executive branch does not have earmarks? \nThe distinguished Presiding Officer noted an earmark for Pascagoula is \nnot really an earmark. It is something clearly understandable and \nidentifiable, and I am perfectly willing to identify it for the benefit \nof my constituents or anybody else who would like to take a look at it.\n  With regard to the executive branch, I have seen articles that point \nout some of the earmarks. For example, with the Department of Energy, \nthe Office of Management and Budget always picks their projects they \nlike, that the Corps of Engineers would do, but not others which might \ninvolve locks and dams or flood control projects. So it is OK for them \nto do it but not us.\n  What about what the Constitution says? Article I, section 9 of the \nConstitution, which deals specifically with spending, states:\n\n       No money shall be drawn from the Treasury, but in \n     Consequence of Appropriations made by Law. . . .\n\n  So it is not up to the President alone. Congress has always had the \nfinal say on this issue of appropriations, and I am sure Senator Byrd \nwould have something to say about this.\n  Again, there is a limit to what is reasonable, and I think we have \nkind of\n\n[[Page S1764]]\n\nlost a grip in that area. We do need to have some controls. It needs to \nbe open and fair. It needs to be identified in the record.\n  I have become more and more concerned particularly about the practice \nwhere items can be added in conference that were not considered by \ncommittee or in either body, whether it is language in a tax bill or \nappropriations bill or a highway project in an authorization bill, and \nthere is no way to really get at it. That is why in the Rules \nCommittee--I worked with Senator Feinstein in particular, and Senator \nHagel, and Senator Dodd--developed a procedure that will allow Members \nto remove items from conference reports that were never considered by \neither body.\n  Under the committee's bill, if a point of order regarding the item is \nsustained, the offending provision would be removed, but the entire \nconference report would not fail. It would then be sent back to the \nHouse, minus the offending provisions.\n  I emphasize again, think about what was happening. The Senate did not \ninclude a provision. The House did not include a provision. They go to \nconference. It is the end of a session, it is an omnibus appropriations \nbill, and, voila, all these things show up in a tax bill or an omnibus \nappropriations bill. If it comes back to the floor of the Senate on \nshort notice, with maybe a couple of hours to review it, if you make a \npoint of order and you succeed, the entire conference report is taken \ndown and it has to start over again, not just go back to the House for \nfinal action. That is a scary situation.\n  I remember attending a meeting one time where some language was being \ndiscussed that had not been in either bill that meant billions of \ndollars. I remember going back and saying to my then-chief of staff, \nDave Hoppe, that this is dangerous; we should not allow this sort of \nthing to happen. Under this provision, if you garner the supermajority \n60 votes, it cannot be taken out. I actually preferred a simple \nmajority. More and more around here everything takes a supermajority, \nnot a simple majority. I thought 51 votes would have been sufficient. \nBut in the committee, keeping the 60-vote test prevailed. I hope it is \nnot abused.\n  The bill also requires that committee and conference reports identify \nthe sponsor of all earmarks so the Senator from Kansas will have to \nfess up that he has a project in an authorization bill, a tax bill, or \nan appropriations bill. He will have to indicate the amount and what it \nis for. It will have to be disclosed in the bill that comes back.\n  Finally, to get greater transparency to the process, conference \nreports cannot be considered unless they are available within the \nSenate and on the Internet at least 24 hours before Senate \nconsideration. There are those who thought it should be 48 hours. When \nwe get to the end of a session, even 24 hours is a leap. We can always \nshorten that by unanimous consent. But to have some modicum, minimum \namount of time to review these conference reports, to me, makes sense, \nand it is fair.\n  So I think what we have done with regard to the so-called earmarks--\nand we define what an earmark is in the bill because my distinguished \ncolleague from Mississippi questioned what an earmark is, and the \nlanguage clearly did not apply to everything, excluding appropriations. \nWe clarified that. I think this is good language.\n\n  I have already spoken to our counterparts in the House. They think \nthis is progress. I think the idea that we are going to prohibit in \nsome way earmarks would be going way too far.\n  The next issue that our committee dealt with is the issue of gifts. \nUnder our language, no gifts will be allowed from registered lobbyists \nto Members or staff, or if it is from a foreign agent. The committee \ntook the suggestion of some of the witnesses who testified before the \ncommittee and excluded meals from the definition of gifts. You can \nstill have your meal, but you would have to disclose it.\n  The current rule is retained on the value of the meal, but Members \nwould have to disclose that meal within 15 days on the Senator's \nInternet site. They would have to say if they had a meal and with whom \nthey had a meal, or if you ordered in Dominos, you can mention that. \nThe last time I mentioned another restaurant, my son said: Dad, I do \nsell for Dominos; could you put in a plug for Dominos? You have to \ndisclose that on the Internet.\n  We can get into lowering the limit on gifts or meals or raise it? \nWhat are we doing here? Let's just go cold turkey. I don't want to have \nto be worrying about whether some cheap tie is worth $65 instead of \n$48. Let's say no gifts from lobbyists or registered agents. I don't \nknow Senators who get gifts. I really don't know any. And it is \npreposterous, by the way, that you would be getting gifts from a \nregistered lobbyist. So no gifts.\n  The bill also deals with third-party-funded travel. The committee \nrejected the idea of banning third-party-funded travel. I am sure there \nwill be amendments offered in this area. We believe there is a useful \neducational value associated with most of these endeavors. However, in \nrecognition that congressional travel can be abused, the committee \nadopted tough pre-clearance requirements for any such travel.\n  The committee bill requires that non-governmental third-party-funded \ntravel must be pre-cleared and approved by the Senate Ethics Committee. \nIt was alleged that this is no different from the current situation. \nNo, now it is advisory. It is permissible. They can review it. They \npretty much generally do review it and say this is OK. This would \nrequire pre-clearance and approval.\n  In order to qualify for Ethics Committee approval, the sponsor of the \ntrip will have to certify to the Ethics Committee that the trip is not \nfinanced, directly or indirectly, by lobbyists. In addition, a detailed \ntrip itinerary would have to be provided to the Ethics Committee, along \nwith a written determination by the Senator that the trip is primarily \neducational, consistent with official duties, does not create an \nappearance of use of public office for private gain, and has a minimal \nor no recreational component before the committee could approve the \ntrip. We are not saying they couldn't have a recreational component. If \na Member plays a round of golf, the Member would have to pay for that.\n  Not later than 30 days after the trip is completed, a Senator would \nhave to file with the Ethics Committee and Secretary of the Senate a \ndescription of the meetings and events attended during the trip and the \nnames of any registered lobbyists who accompanied the Senator during \nthe trip. Such information would also have to be posted on the \nSenator's Internet Web site.\n  Will it be a hassle? Sure. Is it something we can do and should do? \nYes. We are going to have to do this.\n  With regard to flights on private planes, in an effort to broaden \ntransparency, the committee bill requires that all official travel on \nprivate aircraft must be disclosed, along with the names of the people \ntraveling on the aircraft and the purpose of the trips. The disclosure \nrules will also apply when a Member uses a private aircraft in a \ncampaign for reelection.\n  We addressed the question of postemployment restrictions. The bill \ntightens postemployment restrictions for high-paid staff by conforming \nthe lobbying ban on senior staff with the ban on former Member \nlobbying. Therefore, senior staff will not be allowed to lobby the \nSenate for 1 year, and the current rules will continue to apply to the \nlower paid staff. Previously, just to show you what the difference is, \nI believe it was really only applied to senior leadership staff. This \nwas taken to all senior staff, and it would be only the 1-year limit. \nBut the language, as the Senate Rules Committee passed it, would limit \nit to 1 year on all Members lobbying.\n  With regard to floor privileges, the committee addressed an issue \nabout which some people have expressed concern: former Members lobbying \non the Senate floor. I don't think this is a real problem, and I have \nnever experienced it in my 16 years here. The committee believed that \nformer Members who are registered lobbyists should not be seen to have \nan advantage in meeting with Members on the floor of the Senate; \ntherefore, the committee bill bars former Members, ex-Secretaries of \nthe Senate, ex-Sergeants at Arms of the Senate, and former Speakers who \nare registered lobbyists access to the Senate floor. Exceptions could \napply for\n\n[[Page S1765]]\n\nceremonial events and events designated by the leaders. Again, I \nemphasize that former Members would be allowed to come, unless they are \nregistered lobbyists. If they are registered lobbyists, they would not \nbe able to come to the floor, and it would apply to the former officers \nof the Senate and Speakers of the House.\n  (Mr. CHAMBLISS assumed the Chair.)\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, would the Senator yield?\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I would be happy to yield to the \ndistinguished Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I wanted to explain this tie that the Senator from \nMississippi has maligned. I don't know if I could seek a parliamentary \nruling. Is that a violation of rule XIX, degrading the tie of a \nSenator?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. In the opinion of the Chair, it is not a \nviolation under the rules.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. This was a tie, if the Senator will continue to yield, \nthat was given to me by my wife.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, was this a gift?\n  Mr. ROBERTS. It was given to me by my wife, it did cost under $50, \nand it is the color of the ever-optimistic and fighting Wild Cats of \nthe Kansas State University, and I thought it was a pretty nice tie to \ngo with this dark suit. Should I change that under the banner of the \nbill?\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, recognizing the seriousness of the charges \nand the hurt feelings and the attitude of the Senator from Kansas, I \nask unanimous consent that my disparaging remarks about his tie be \nexpunged from the Record.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I would appreciate that, but it didn't cause me much of \na problem at all.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I hope this is not an indication of the \ntenor of the debate that is going to occur this week. I think that a \nlittle humor is fine, but I also think a little action is required in \nthis area, and I promise to patch up my friend's feelings as soon as I \nget through here before the Senate.\n  Speaking of public disclosure of employment negotiations, the \ncommittee addressed a potential conflict of interest situation where a \nMember is negotiating for a private sector job while still acting in \nhis official capacity. This was an amendment that I believe was offered \nby Senator Santorum in the Rules Committee, it was not in our committee \nchairman's mark, but the committee discussed it and agreed that this is \nan area which should be adopted. It requires public disclosure of any \nsuch negotiations. The rule would not apply if the Member's successor \nhas already been elected. Once an election has occurred for a \nsuccessor, even though you might be back in what we call a lameduck \nsession, you would be able to have such negotiation, but you wouldn't \nhave to fulfill the public disclosure statement. Obviously, as long as \nyou are in this body, you shouldn't be having negotiations with \nsomebody about employment when you are leaving. If you do, you may, of \nnecessity--it may happen accidentally, but if you do, you ought to at \nleast disclose it.\n  Lobbying by members of the Senator's family, has been in question and \nan issue in recent years. The committee adopted a rule that directly \nimpacts family members who are registered lobbyists. The rule bars a \nMember's spouse or any immediate member of the family from lobbying the \nMember's staff, and we have a definition of what ``immediate family \nmember'' is.\n  We also have a provision with regard to unlawfully using public \noffice to influence hiring decisions. The committee voted to amend the \nstanding rules to prohibit a Member from threatening to take or \nwithhold any official act in an effort to influence a private sector \nhiring decision. The committee approved this amendment, knowing full \nwell that in current law, 18 U.S.C. section 201, it makes it a felony \npunishable by as long as 15 years in jail for a Member to try to \ninfluence such a hiring decision by threatening to take or withhold an \nofficial act. But the committee believed that even though it might be \ncovered by law, that the Rules should be very clear in this particular \narea. I questioned, and others commented on the fact that if you \nrecommend a former staff member to an entity as a highly qualified, \ncapable young man or woman, certainly you can continue to do that. It \nis where you infer or suggest that you are going to withhold or do \nsomething as punishment if certain hiring actions are not taken.\n\n  In conclusion, I believe the committee acted and produced a fair and \nbalanced bill. I know some Members would like to ban all privately \nfunded travel. Others will want to talk more about whether we are \nsufficiently policing ourselves.\n  I believe our Ethics Committee over the years has done a good job. I \nserved several years on the Ethics Committee. Unfortunately, it was an \nextremely active time. During that period, we had the so-called Keating \n5; we had a couple of Senators who had unintentionally, but still very \nimportantly, leaked some information with regard to the Intelligence \nCommittee. We had a very active period of time, but we faced up to it. \nAnd there have been other examples. I have no doubt that the current \nmembers of the Ethics Committee, which is evenly divided, are doing a \ngood job. Part of their problem is us: our rules sometimes are not \nclear or they are ambiguous. They do need to be tightened up. We need \nto be more specific. And I am working with Chairman Voinovich to try to \nget some of those identified so that we can have some ethics rules \nchanged.\n  Mr. President, I have a little throat problem here, so let me stop at \nthis point and say that I hope we can go forward expeditiously and in a \nfair way this week and address this very important issue of rules \nchanges and lobby reform. I think we can do it in a bipartisan way and \nhave a bill ready to go to conference by the end of this week.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, let me begin these comments by thanking, \nfirst of all, my colleague from Mississippi, Senator Lott, who chairs \nthe Rules Committee, and the other members of the committee, Democrats \nand Republicans alike, who worked over the past number of days to put \ntogether a Rules Committee bill.\n  The Rules Committee, for those who are interested in following this \nin detail, has jurisdiction over a couple of matters: the conduct of \nMembers specifically and campaign finance reform issues. We don't have \njurisdiction over lobbyists per se, except to the extent they are \nengaged in business with Members of Congress, with Members of this \nbody. So our bill was specifically tailored to deal with Member conduct \nvis-a-vis lobbyists and, in some cases, spilled over a little bit into \nthe campaign finance reform area, which I will address in a couple of \nminutes.\n  I wish to underscore the points Senator Lott has made about the \ncooperative spirit with which the Committee dealt with its business. We \nworked, and we had a good working session. In fact, we had a number of \nsessions, actually, before the markup to try to come to some consensus. \nThe Democratic leader, Senator Harry Reid, when I asked him what sort \nof a bill he would like to put together, his first words were: A \nbipartisan bill. So we made that effort, and as a result of not an \nextensively long markup but one that went on for several hours where, \nas Senator Lott has pointed out, there were amendments that were agreed \nto and some disagreed to, and others made out of order, but we put \ntogether a bill that certainly was a major step forward, and it was \nsupported by all members of the Rules Committee, even by members who \nhad amendments that were rejected. We felt strongly that it was \nimportant that we try to act as unanimously as possible, and we did so.\n  So today we gather here in this Chamber for the full consideration of \nthat bill, plus the bill that was authored by the distinguished Senator \nfrom Maine, Ms. Collins, and my colleague from Connecticut, Senator \nLieberman. This may be a unique situation about to occur here where the \ncomanagers of this legislation will be the two Senators from the same \nState. My colleague from Connecticut, Senator Lieberman, is the ranking \nDemocrat on the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee. \nIn fact, I watched their markup the other day on C-SPAN, and it was \nvery healthy and productive and, I thought, a very comprehensive \ndiscussion of their jurisdiction of these matters, which clearly \ninvolves the role of lobbyists and their activities as they relate to \nMembers as well but a bit different from the Rules\n\n[[Page S1766]]\n\nCommittee. I congratulate them and members of their committee as well \nfor a very thoughtful conversation.\n  I also commend Tim Johnson and George Voinovich, who are the vice \nchairman and chairman respectively of the Senate Ethics Committee. It \nhas been said over and over again that there is no more thankless job \nin many ways than to be a member of the Ethics Committee, but they have \ndone a remarkable job, in my view. They don't advertise what they do. \nTheir meetings are not even necessarily publicized because they deal \nwith these sensitive matters of allegations raised against Members of \nthis body. But all of us who have watched them over the last number of \nyears, along with the other members of that committee and their \nprevious chairs, respect immensely the work they do. I suspect you are \ngoing be hearing from members of that committee during this debate and \ndiscussion as they report to this full body on their activities.\n  So today the full Senate begins the process of considering \nlegislation to bolster congressional accountability, make the \nlegislative process fair, more transparent, and to regulate more \ntightly the relationships between Members of Congress, the executive \nbranch officials, and lobbyists.\n  It is imperative that we act on this bill to help restore the \nconfidence of all Americans in the legislative process and in the laws \nwe write. That confidence has been eroded by recent lobbying scandals \ninvolving Members principally, if not exclusively, of the House of \nRepresentatives. It is important that we note that.\n  I commend as well our Democratic leader, Senator Reid, for his \nleadership in this effort. Without his focus and dedication to bring \nreal reform to the attention of the American people and to propose a \nvery comprehensive measure himself which, in large part, is the basis \nof the bill we are considering today, we would not be as far along as \nwe are. Senator Reid's bill is supported by 40 members of the \nDemocratic caucus and represents a tough but appropriate response to \nthe lobbying scandals of the other body.\n  We are still waiting for the majority of the other body to unveil \ntheir lobbying reform priorities. Had we waited for the response of the \nother body to lobbying scandals that affected the House, I believe we \nwould not be standing before the American people today in the U.S. \nSenate addressing this issue. I thank Senator Reid for his leadership \non this measure and for taking positions that were not necessarily well \nreceived here in Washington but are essential to the confidence of the \nAmerican people and the legislative process.\n  Bringing this bill to the floor is a next step in a longer process \nwhich has occupied directly two Senate committees--Rules and \nAdministration and Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs. These \nreform efforts will eventually involve both the Senate and the House of \nRepresentatives. We should also consider whether such reforms should \nextend to the executive and judicial branches as we consider changes to \nethics laws. Some of these matters clearly spill over, in my view. \nSince we are dealing with these matters, we ought not to necessarily \njust leave it to ourselves and the legislative branch to examine these \nissues but should consider whether they should apply to our colleagues \nwho serve in the executive and judicial branches as well.\n  So let us be clear from the very outset about why we are here. There \nhave been serious allegations made, and guilty pleas entered, regarding \nthe criminal activities of certain Members of the House of \nRepresentatives and former staff and the activities of Jack Abramoff \nand his violations of current lobbying gift and ethics rules. Some of \nthese abuses have involved spending earmarks or other special interests \nprovisions. One House Member has already been convicted of criminal \nwrongdoing, resigned his seat, and has been sentenced to 8 years in \nprison on corruption charges. Senior House staffers have pled guilty to \nvarious violations. Others, including a political appointee of the Bush \nadministration, have been indicted as well. I suspect more indictments \nwill follow. By their guilty pleas, these individuals have acknowledged \nthat they broke existing law, and I suspect that but for these \nactivities, we might not have been dealing with the legislation that \nnow brings us to the floor of this Chamber.\n  The Abramoff story suggests that he also engaged in activities that, \nwhile perhaps technically legal, were nonetheless clearly unethical. In \ngovernment, we must hold ourselves to a standard of accountability that \ninvolves not only doing what is legal but also what is right.\n  As my colleague from Connecticut has noted, with this bill we have a \nchance to make what is clearly wrong also clearly illegal. Stricter \nenforcement of current laws and rules will go a long way toward \naddressing abuses, but we must also look to further reforms to reduce \nthe risk of future wrongdoing. It is important to strengthen our \ncurrent rules and procedures where we can to avoid future problems. So \nthat is in a nutshell what we are about today and why we are here.\n  Let me share a little bit of history because, as my colleague from \nMississippi has pointed out, these are not events but rather a process, \nand they began a long time ago. As he pointed out, there are any number \nof efforts that have been made on so-called reform efforts.\n  Regulating the relationships between Members and lobbyists is not \nsomething new. In 1876, the House of Representatives tried to require \nlobbyists to register with its Clerk, but enforcement was weak and not \nmuch came of those efforts more than 125 years ago.\n  In the early 1930s, Congress held hearings on lobbying abuses with \nvery little result at all, and in 1938 the Foreign Agents Registration \nAct was enacted, followed by the 1946 Federal Regulation of Lobbying \nAct, the scope of which the Supreme Court soon narrowed. Additional \nreforms were implemented in the 1960s and then the Lobbying Disclosure \nAct of 1995 and the new Senate gift and travel rules followed.\n  I say this to try and place our efforts in historical context and to \nunderscore that reform is an organic and dynamic process, not an event. \nSo it is appropriate to review and reform existing lobbying laws, gift \nrules, earmarking, and other procedures periodically. It is especially \nnecessary today in light of the most recent scandals that have hit this \ntown.\n  Restoring the confidence of the American people in the legislative \nprocess requires it. If we fail here to come together to produce real \nreform, then we risk the further disillusionment of our fellow citizens \nand allow their confidence in Congress to erode further.\n  It is clear that real, enforceable ethics reforms do work. Ethics \nreforms have over the years worked to improve the way Congress \noperates. Conflict of interest rules, earned-income limits, lobbying \ndisclosure laws, the McCain-Feingold law and honoraria ban--in both of \nwhich I was privileged to play a role in--and other key provisions have \nhelped ensure greater transparency and accountability in the U.S. \nCongress. But we must do more, and we will in these coming days.\n  As the ranking member of the Rules and Administration Committee, with \njurisdiction over elements of this bill that affect the treatment and \nobligations of Members of Congress, I have worked with my good friend, \nChairman Lott, and committee colleagues on both sides to craft a bill \non issues within our jurisdiction. That bill has now been married on \nthe floor with legislation from the Homeland Security and Governmental \nAffairs Committee, chaired by the distinguished Senator from Maine and \nthe ranking member from my home State of Connecticut, Senator \nLieberman. These bills address the Lobbying Disclosure Act changes \nwithin its jurisdiction.\n  I hope ultimately we can craft an omnibus bill that will command \nbroad bipartisan support and will be signed into law by President Bush. \nI think we have already come a ways in that direction. I have \nappreciated the cooperative posture of Chairman Lott in developing this \nmeasure which was reported unanimously, as I mentioned earlier, by the \nRules Committee. There were a number of amendments offered in the \ncommittee to strengthen the measure, and some were accepted and some \nrejected.\n  My colleague went down this list, but it is important that my \ncolleagues know what we were able to include. I\n\n[[Page S1767]]\n\nmention some of the reforms here: the ban on gifts from lobbyists, the \nrequirements of additional reporting on meals as well. I might point \nout to my colleague from Mississippi, I suspect we may have already in \neffect, just established a ban on meals. Looking at the language in our \nown committee, the idea that people are going to be reporting every few \ndays a $20 meal--I suspect most may decide it is not worth going \nthrough that. In fact, I may offer, at some point, to just make that a \ntotal ban on the meals altogether and avoid going through the process \nof having to list them on the Internet, which is what in effect we have \naccomplished in that provision of the bill.\n  The bill would also prohibit travel paid for by lobbyists and require \nprior approval of travel by the Ethics Committee. The bill requires for \nthe very first time the disclosure of earmarks in bills, both \nappropriations bills and authorizing bills, and that imposes some \ncomplications, clearly, because an earmark authorizing bill may not be \nas clearly identifiable as one on an appropriations bill. In an \nappropriations bill you talk about Pascagoula, we talked about New \nLondon, CT. In an authorizing or tax bill it may describe ``some \nbusiness that employs a certain number of people located above the \nMason-Dixon line'' or something else. You would have to hire a scout or \nsomeone to go out and identify the specific entity that is being \nbenefitted by that earmark. I suspect we are going to hear some \nconversation from our colleagues about how we are going to have to \ntighten it up. But the point the Senator from Mississippi was making in \nthe Committee is this ought not be just appropriations matters. It \nought to cover the spectrum where people parachute in a provision, \nparticularly in a conference report, that had been neither considered \nby the House nor the Senate that ends up mysteriously in a bill.\n  If you try to take them out of that bill, by the way, when it comes \nback to the Senate, the entire bill in which they are located falls. \nNone of us necessarily wants that to occur. Therefore a lot of these \nprovisions have stayed in over the years. This is the reform being \ntalked about here.\n  Our colleague from California, Senator Feinstein, played a very \ncritical role, with Senator Lott, in drafting the provisions that \nincorporated the Rules Committee bill. I think most Members believe if \nthe matter was not in the House or Senate and ends up in the conference \nreport, that ought to be subject to a point of order and come out of \nthe bill. While we may disagree on this point--I have heard my \ncolleagues speak eloquently about it--we should be making sure the \npoint of order would prevail so you don't have just a simple majority \nbut require a supermajority vote to allow that to occur.\n  If it is that important, if the Member believes he had to put it in--\nand there may be such circumstances, by the way then the supermajority \nvote is appropriate. We have been around long enough to know what \nhappens. We will pass an appropriations bill here, the House will do \nit, and then some event will occur, a hurricane, and then all of a \nsudden that is the only bill moving. So you want to put something in \nthe bill. If it is on that level, then I suspect a supermajority of my \ncolleagues will approve it. Nonetheless, real efforts are being made \nand our Rules Committee bill certainly dealt with that.\n\n  We also include a new point of order against the out-of-scope \nprovisions. I mentioned that already. The bill would also require \nconference reports to be available 24 hours prior to the consideration \non the Internet.\n  Again, some of these conference reports are mammoth. They would make \n``War and Peace'' look like light reading when you see them. So having \nthem for 24 hours is certainly going to be of some help.\n  It may shock Members or others to find out that these bills in many \ncases were not even printed at all. In some cases I remember over the \nyears when we actually considered them. Nonetheless, I think that is a \ngood step forward as well.\n  We eliminate floor privileges for former Members, officers, and \nSpeakers of the House if they become lobbyists. It may be somewhat of a \nfine point, a piece of trivia. Members may not know this. Former House \nMembers are not allowed on the Senate floor, but a former Speaker of \nthe House is. That is the one former Member who is allowed in this \nChamber. Most of our former colleagues certainly are not lobbyists, and \nthose Members who have come back here do so infrequently, and it is \nalways a pleasure to see them. But if you are a lobbyist, that raises a \nconcern. I think the perception is such that we ought to keep people \noff the floor while they are engaged in that business--except under \nvery special circumstances.\n  We require the disclosure of employment negotiations by Members and \ntheir staff prior to their departure from the Congress--again, \nsomething that I think is a good step forward. We also make it clear \nthat efforts to influence employment practices of private entities on \nthe basis of partisan considerations are a violation of the Senate \nrules. Again, this is going back to the so-called K Street project.\n  My colleague from Illinois, Senator Durbin, raised this issue. There \nare already existing laws in the Criminal Code which prohibit certain \nof these activities. But my colleagues on the committee felt if it is \nalready existing law we ought to make it clear, as well, that part of \nthe rules of this place ought to be such that you cannot negotiate, on \nthe basis of partisan politics, employment for people. I congratulate \nmy colleague from Illinois for offering this language to address the K \nStreet project.\n  Finally, Senator Ben Nelson of Nebraska offered an amendment, which \nwas adopted, expressing the sense of the Senate that restrictions \nshould apply to the executive and judicial branches as well. My hope \nwould be we would do that.\n  My colleague from Mississippi has gone over a lot of this. The point \nbeing, we had an underlying bill. There were amendments offered. We \nstrengthened the bill. This is not a perfect bill, but it is a good \nbill. It is a major step forward. I think, with the efforts made with \nthe Homeland Security bill under the leadership of Senator Collins, we \nmade a major step forward.\n  I anticipate some of those amendments that were rejected in our \ncommittee or ruled out of order may by offered on the floor. I may \noffer one or two of those amendments myself.\n  The most comprehensive amendment offered in Committee was one I \noffered on behalf of the Democratic Leader, Senator Reid, which took \nkey elements of the sweeping reform bill he developed in consultation \nwith our Caucus, the Honest Leadership Act. That bill has served to \nhelp frame this debate thus far, and set a standard for real reform. It \nwas rejected by the Committee on a party-line vote, which I regret, but \nsome of its provisions were eventually adopted in Committee.\n  I know that additional key elements of this measure will be offered \nby various colleagues in the coming days. I suspect there will be some \namendments to the government affairs committee portion of this bill, \ntoo, some of which were rejected in Committee, some withheld for the \nFloor debate.\n  That is at it should be. Many Members will have ideas to improve the \nbill here on the Floor, and I am committed to working with colleagues \non our side to ensure their ideas get a full and fair hearing and, \nwhere necessary, a vote. Although the combined rules/government affairs \ncommittee bill offers a good framework, it is clear that the bill can \nand should be improved.\n  Efforts to strengthen this bill will be the focus of amendments by \nMembers on our side going forward, both here on the Floor and in \nconference.\n  I won't try to summarize in detail what is in the new bill, which \nmerges the provisions of the Rules Committee and Government Affairs \nbills. Our distinguished colleagues on the Homeland Security and \nGovernmental Affairs Committee Senator Collins, Chair of the committee, \nand my colleague from Connecticut, Senator Lieberman will be describing \nthe provisions of their bill in detail. I ask consent that a brief \nsection-by-section summary of the Rules Committee provisions be printed \nin the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. DODD. The Rules Committee bill deals with those issues governing \nconduct of Members, as per our jurisdiction. The bill includes reform \nof the\n\n[[Page S1768]]\n\ngift rule to prohibit gifts from lobbyists. The Rules Committee-\nreported bill exempts meals from this prohibition, but does require \nthat members and staff disclose any meals paid for by lobbyists, \naccording to existing dollar limits.\n  This provision does not go far enough, in my opinion. While I \nrecognize that much business is transacted over meals, members and \nstaff can afford to pay for their meals at such meetings. If we are \ntaking the step of banning coffee cups and candy from lobbyists, we \nshould also ban the coffee and desserts.\n  Finally, let me say a few things about what I think is the elephant \nin the room on reform efforts. And that is the need to enact \ncomprehensive reforms of the way we organize and finance campaigns in \nthis country.\n  As I have said, gift and lobby reforms do matter, and are important. \nBut while it is clear serious reform of the way some in Congress and \ntheir lobbying allies do business is needed, these changes alone won't \naddress the core problem: the need for campaign finance reform which \nbreaks once and for all the link between legislative favor-seekers and \nthe free flow of inadequately regulated, special interest private \nmoney.\n  This is a much more significant issue than lobbying, gift and travel \nrules, or procedural reforms on earmarks and conference procedures and \nreports.\n  As my colleagues know, under current controlling Supreme Court \nprecedents, including its landmark decision in Buckley v. Valeo, \ncomprehensive reform can be accomplished either through full or partial \npublic funding in return for a voluntary agreement by candidates to \nabide by spending limits. Failing that, an amendment to the \nConstitution to enable Congress and the States to impose mandatory \nspending limits is needed. The idea that we are going to adopt a \nconstitutional amendment is remote at best.\n\n  I have fond memories of our former colleague from South Carolina, \nSenator Hollings, eloquently, year after year after year, beseeching \nthis institution to adopt a constitutional amendment that would, I \nthink, say something as simple as: For the purpose of Federal \nelections, money is not speech. I think that was the entire language of \nthe amendment, or something like that.\n  I supported him on a couple of occasions because of the simplicity of \nus being able to regulate this without having to go to the alternative \nroute, which is what we are going to be left with if we want some \ncontrol, and that is public financing.\n  Some States have done that. Jody Rell, my Republican Governor, \noffered the language in Connecticut, adopted by the Democrat-controlled \nlegislature. The State of Arizona has done it. The State of New Jersey, \nI think, has done some as well. So it is not without precedent, and it \nis the only other alternative we have, without amendment to the \nConstitution, to make an effort to try to reduce the kind of campaign \nspending problems we have.\n  My preferred approach would include a combination of public funding, \nfree or reduced media time, spending limits, and other key reforms. \nOthers will have different views and approaches. I appreciate that \nChairman Lott has recently responded positively to my urging of a \nhearing in our Committee on comprehensive campaign reform.\n  I hope this will be the first step in a longer process of developing \na comprehensive reform bill, although it may be difficult to actually \nenact such reform in this election year. It took us years to enact the \nMcCain-Feingold law. Hopefully, it will not take as long to enact a \nmore comprehensive bill for public financing.\n  But let me offer a caution on this point. While I am equally \ncommitted to seeing Congress act to respond to the lobbying scandals of \nrecent months and address the role of special interest and lobbyist \nmoney in campaigns, I believe we must move these reforms and campaign \nfinance reforms on separate and independent tracks.\n  Real campaign finance reform is more complex than reform of lobbying \nrules. We must not slow lobbying reform by tacking on unrelated \ncampaign finance measures, which many on both sides would see as a \npoison pill.\n  Chairman Lott and I had a sort of tacit agreement that we would work \nto keep such campaign finance provisions off this bill in Committee. I \nwould hope we can adopt the same approach throughout this process.\n  I suspect that will be difficult to achieve, since there will be \nthose who seek to use this bill for partisan advantage. But I urge my \ncolleagues, in the interest of enacting bipartisan lobbying reform, \nthat we keep this bill relatively free of campaign finance provisions \nlike 527 organization reform, tribal contribution changes, and others.\n  For myself, I think there is a real risk of weighing down this bill \nwith so many campaign finance amendments that we will effectively kill \nit. I hope that does not happen, and I urge my colleagues to withhold \ncampaign finance-related amendments until we get to a more appropriate \nvehicle for them to offer their ideas.\n  Let us hope we can make some progress on the campaign finance front. \nBut I appeal to my colleagues on both sides, let us agree to do it \nseparately from this bill, since adding these provisions could kill the \nvery legislation that brings so many of us together.\n  Eventually, real campaign finance reform must address not just \ncongressional campaigns but also the urgent need to renew and repair \nour Presidential public funding system as well, which has served \nDemocratic and Republican candidates--and all Americans--for 25 years.\n  Some of us have pressed for comprehensive campaign reform for years. \nCurrent scandals offer a once-in-a-generation opportunity to address \nthis issue in ways which both meet public demands for reform and the \ntests laid out by the Supreme Court since the Buckley decision.\n  The American public is way ahead of us on this issue. Too many people \nbelieve the interests of average voters are usurped by the money and \ninfluence of lobbyists, powerful individuals, corporations, and \ninterest groups. Too many believe their voices go unheard, drowned out \nby the din of special interest favor seekers.\n  Our system derives its legitimacy from the consent of those we \ngovern. That is put at risk if the governed lose faith in the system's \nfundamental fairness and its capacity to respond to the most basic \nneeds of our society because narrow special interests hold sway over \nthe public interest.\n  Most Americans would agree that the price of funding campaigns with \nclean money--so-called ``disinterested'' money--is a small price to pay \nto restore the confidence in our system. Comprehensive campaign finance \nreform, along with efforts to address the recent lobbying scandals, is \nnecessary to return control of the process to the people to whom it \nbelongs. That is what government of the people, by the people, and for \nthe people has meant for over 200 years.\n\n  So, I end where I began, that is, with the concern about the \nconfidence of Americans in Congress, our credibility, and the \ncredibility of the legislative process being at stake. Let us not fool \nourselves that these issues will ultimately be resolved without a \nfundamental overhaul of our campaign finances. I know when we \neventually have this debate, the same tired arguments we have heard \nyear after year will be trotted out in defense of the current system: \nCitizen funding is ``welfare for politicians''; we spend more on toilet \npaper than we do on campaigns; and political money equals speech.\n  That is ridiculous.\n  Some will argue that we must not curtail the first amendment rights \nof citizens, including the wealthiest Americans, to engage in the \npolitical process. I say let us have that debate. I welcome it.\n  I think most Americans would agree that the price of public funding \nof campaigns with clean money, uninterested money, is a small price to \npay to restore that confidence in our political process, and to return \ncontrol of that process to the governed. It is time for the Senate to \ncome forward with fresh, bipartisan ideas on how we finance our \ncampaigns.\n  I thank the majority and minority leaders and the Chairs and ranking \nmember of both of these committees for their courtesies in bringing \nthis legislation forward. I certainly look forward to working with my \ncolleagues\n\n[[Page S1769]]\n\nover the next several days to conclude this process with a sound, \nstrong piece of legislation.\n  We are here because of scandals that have wracked this town over the \nlast number of days and weeks. We need to try to address those issues \nwith this legislation. I believe we can.\n  Again, my compliments to my friend and colleague from Mississippi for \nhis leadership, to Senator Collins of Maine, my colleague from \nConnecticut, Senator Lieberman, and the respective members of these two \ncommittees--and to Tim Johnson and George Voinovich for the wonderful \njob they have done as leaders of our Ethics Committee in this body over \nthe years.\n  With that, I yield the floor. I hope the chairman will maybe make \nsuch a proposal, but I suggest that we are going to be looking for \namendments quickly. We are prepared to have time agreements on these \namendments to allow for an adequate discussion of the proposal, and \nvotes, if they are so needed. But if you will let us know what they \nare, we will help move this process along.\n  I want this debate to end this week. I think it can be done by \nThursday. My goal is to have it done by Thursday. I ask the leaders to \nstay in session during the evenings, if we have to, to get the job \nfinished. I hope that is not necessary.\n  Let us get amendments offered. Let us know what is on your mind, and \nwe will line it up and see if we can't pass this bill by the end of the \nday on Thursday.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n\n  summary of s. 2349, rules committee-reported lobbying reform measure\n\n       Reported unanimously 11-0 (with remaining 7 members voting \n     in favor by proxy)\n       Sec. 1: Title: Legislative Transparency and Accountability \n     Act of 2006\n       Sec. 2: Out of Scope Matters in Conference Reports--\n       provides for a point of order to be made against individual \n     offending provisions, rather than the entire conference \n     report;\n       if the point of order is sustained, the Senate will recede \n     and concur with a further amendment (debatable question), \n     which if agreed to, shall return the bill to the House for \n     its concurrence;\n       provides that the point of order may be waived by a vote of \n     3/5 of the members (duly chosen and sworn) and that any \n     appeal of a ruling of the Chair also requires a 3/5 vote to \n     overturn.\n       Sec. 3: Earmarks (as amended by Sen.

The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, let me begin by applauding both Senator \nDodd and Senator Lott for their work on the membership part of this \nbill, and for the outstanding statements explaining the provisions and \nurging us to act.\n  Senator Lott mentioned that the Rules Committee bill was reported \nunanimously, and that the bill that came out of our Homeland Security \nCommittee was reported with only one dissenting vote. That is a \nremarkable show of bipartisanship. But to my colleagues in the Senate, \nit is probably more remarkable to see two Senate committees working \ntogether very carefully, outlining the jurisdiction of each committee \nand working in concert to produce a comprehensive and well-balanced \npiece of legislation.\n  Title I of this bill is the Rules Committee bill; title II is the \nHomeland Security bill.\n  Today the Senate begins consideration of the first significant \nlobbying reform legislation in a decade. The bills we are debating \ntoday and over the course of this week represent the good work of their \nsponsors, Senator McCain and Senator Lieberman--and Senator Lott and \nSenator Dodd as well--and the hard work of the two committees I have \nmentioned.\n  The committee I am privileged to chair, the Homeland Security and \nGovernmental Affairs Committee, marked up the Lieberman bill this past \nThursday. The committee reported out the\n\n[[Page S1770]]\n\nmeasure, as I mentioned, on a 13-to-1 vote.\n  The issue we take up today is serious, and it is pressing. Recent \nscandals involving Jack Abramoff and Representative Duke Cunningham \nhave brought to light Congress's need to strengthen the laws and rules \ngoverning disclosure, and to ban practices that erode public confidence \nin the integrity of government decisions. That is what this debate is \nall about.\n  We know that if we are to tackle the tough issues facing our country, \nwhether it is entitlement reform or other vital issues, the public must \nhave confidence that our decisions are not tainted by special interests \nand are not subject to undue influence.\n  I want to emphasize that all of us here today recognize that \nlobbying, whether done on behalf of the business community and \nenvironmental organizations or children's advocacy groups or any other \ncause can provide us with very useful information that aids but does \nnot dictate our decisionmaking process. Indeed, lobbying is a right \nguaranteed by our Constitution--the right to petition our government. \nBut, unfortunately, today the image of lobbying often conjures up \nimages of expensive paid vacations masquerading as factfinding trips, \nspecial access that the average citizen can never have, and undue \ninfluence that leads to tainted decisions. The corrosive effect of this \nimage--and in a very few cases the reality on the public's confidence--\nin the political process cannot be underestimated.\n  I think it is also important to emphasize, however, that the vast \nmajority of people in Washington, the vast majority of elected \nofficials care deeply about their constituents and this country, and \nare making decisions which they believe are in the best interests of \nboth. Nevertheless, we in Congress have an obligation to strengthen the \ncrucial bond of trust between those of us in government and those whom \ngovernment serves.\n  At the committee hearing last month on lobbying reform, we heard from \nseveral of our colleagues. We heard from business and labor \norganizations that engage in lobbying. We heard from a representative \nof a lobbyist organization, and from public policy experts. I mention \nthis because I want my colleagues to understand that we had a wide-\nranging hearing that reached out to people with various views on how we \ncould reform our lobbying disclosure laws. The package before the \nSenate, the comprehensive package of bills, represents the culmination \nof what we have learned.\n  Again, I thank Senators McCain and Lott for their leadership in the \ndevelopment of this bill, along with the ranking members of Homeland \nSecurity, Senator Lieberman and Senator Dodd. We have crafted a \nbipartisan package.\n  I also want to thank Senator Rick Santorum for convening a bipartisan \nworking group to help us find some common ground on the principles that \nunderlie both bills.\n  Before describing the details of the bill we reported last Thursday, \nI want to point out that the committees addressed only those issues \nwithin our jurisdiction--the Lobbying Disclosure Act and the Ethics in \nGovernment Act, and congressional organization. But here on the floor \nwe have married the two bills to produce a comprehensive package.\n  Let me quickly run through some of the major provisions of what is \nnow title II of the bill we are debating.\n  The first section of this bill, title II, will enhance the lobbying \ndisclosure provision. It will require quarterly filings rather than the \npresent semiannual filing, and it ensures that the information is made \navailable to the public on the Internet.\n  To facilitate this effort, it specifies that lobbyists must submit \ntheir filings electronically. This will ensure that the public \ninformation is widely available on a more timely basis. So our goal \nhere is to have an easily accessible, transparent, and searchable \ndatabase available on the Internet so the public is fully aware and \nable to access these reports.\n  To ensure timely disclosure, the substitute doubles the maximum \npenalty for noncompliance to $100,000.\n  To increase public confidence and enforcement, the legislation \nrequires disclosure of reports to the Justice Department for \nenforcement. The enhanced disclosures will make the process of lobbying \nfar more transparent to the public.\n  I note that the committee also adopted an amendment that would \nrequire the disclosure of so-called ``grassroots lobbying efforts.'' I \ndid not support this amendment because of my concern that we don't want \nto chill any effort to encourage citizens to contact their members of \nCongress, but I nevertheless appreciate the efforts of the sponsors of \nthe amendment--Senators Lieberman and Levin--to address some of the \nlegitimate concerns and to craft it in a way that is far more focused \nthan the original provisions in the underlying bill that was before our \ncommittee.\n  Section B of what is now title II focuses on enforcement of \ncongressional ethics. In some cases, there have been concerns about the \nenforcement effort.\n  We have included provisions that will include auditing and oversight \nof lobbyists' disclosure filings by the comptroller general who will \nalso provide recommendations on how compliance could be improved and to \nidentify needed resources and authorities.\n  This section of the bill would also provide for mandatory ethics \ntraining for Members of Congress and congressional staff. It also \nincludes a sense-of-the-Senate resolution that there should be greater \nself-regulation within the lobbying community. I am thinking of the \nkinds of self-regulatory organizations--SROs, as they are often \ncalled--such as the securities industry, for example, employs.\n  Subtitle C of our bill, now title II, addresses the revolving-door \nproblem, whereby Members of Congress and high-ranking staff leave \nGovernment for jobs focused on the institution they had once served in. \nWe made essentially two changes in this provision of the law.\n  First, we doubled the cooling-off period that applies to Members of \nCongress who become lobbyists. We require a 2-year cooling-off period \nrather than the 1-year that is in current law. The second important \nchange we make is we prohibit those high-ranking former congressional \nstaffers from lobbying the entire Senate--not just the office in which \nthey once worked. Those are two significant provisions strengthening \nthe revolving-door provisions of the bill that will help to promote \npublic confidence in the integrity of decisions by ensuring there is \nnot undue special access by people who have inside information. Those \nare important provisions.\n  I point out in response to a comment made by Senator Dodd that we do \nextend these provisions to high-ranking members of the executive branch \nwho are covered now by the revolving-door provisions of the Ethics in \nGovernment Act.\n  The next subtitle of the bill creates a commission to strengthen \nconfidence in Congress. This is a proposal included at the \nrecommendation of my friend and colleague, Senator Norm Coleman. It \nwould establish a commission to review and make some additional \nrecommendations if needed. The commission would report its initial \nfindings and recommendation to Congress by July 1, 2006. This is not a \nbig, longstanding commission. It is a commission that is expected to \nact quickly, where we take a look at the whole area and report back.\n  I am very proud of the hard work of the Senate Committee on Homeland \nSecurity and Governmental Affairs on this issue. We have produced a \nstrong bill, a strong bill that significantly increases the disclosure, \nthat toughens the revolving-door provisions, and that will make a real \ndifference in increasing the oversight of ethics and lobbying.\n  However, we need to take another look at a provision that did not get \nincluded in the bill that was included in the mark that Senator \nLieberman and I put forward but was deleted as a result of an \namendment. That is a provision to create an Office of Public Integrity \nwithin the congressional branch. I will be talking more about that \nlater, but let me say that proposal by no means is an indication of \ndisrespect for or lack of appreciation of the Senate Ethics Committee. \nWe know the Senate Ethics Committee has a very difficult job and does a \ngood job. The members who serve on it are individuals of great \nintegrity. It address a problem of perception.\n\n[[Page S1771]]\n\n  It is difficult for the public to trust us to set our own rules, \ninvestigate violations, act as jury and judge--which is what the \ncurrent system is now. So we carefully crafted a proposal intended to \nstrike a better balance while still recognizing and maintaining the \npreeminent role of the Ethics Committee. Regrettably, there was a lot \nof confusion about this provision in committee because it resembles a \nprovision that has been introduced on the House side. But Senator \nLieberman and I modified that provision and came up with our own \nproposal that ensured that the Ethics Committee was involved in every \nstep of the process. We will have a further debate on that issue, but I \nraise it now for the benefit of my colleagues.\n  Again, we can make a real difference by passing this bill which \nmarries the two bills that were reported by the Rules Committee and the \nHomeland Security Committee. The Senate has a very important \nopportunity to make Government more transparent and more accountable. \nAt the end of the day, the public is going to review this legislation \nand ask one question: Does it promote more public trust and confidence \nin the decisions we make? I hope when we have the final vote on this \nbill, we will see the same kind of strong, bipartisan support the \nlegislation enjoyed in both the rules and the Homeland Security \nCommittee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I ask I be permitted to speak as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. McConnell pertaining to the introduction of S. \n2370 are located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced \nBills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise to express my strong support for \nthe bipartisan Lobbying Transparency and Accountability Act which was \nreported out of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs \nCommittee last Thursday and which forms a significant part of the \ncombined Homeland Security Rules Committee bill that we are starting to \nconsider today.\n  It is a pleasure to join in an unusual foursome, co-managing these \ntwo bills. It is always a pleasure to work with Senator Lott and \nSenator Dodd of the Rules Committee. And I am also delighted to work \nwith the chairman of the Homeland Security Committee, Senator Collins.\n  With these two bills we now have the opportunity to vote on what I \nbelieve is the most significant lobbying and ethics reform in a \ngeneration. That means we in Congress now have a once in a generation \nopportunity to help restore our tattered reputation with the American \npublic by moving swiftly and strongly to enact these proposals into \nlaw.\n  By ensuring full transparency for the legislative process and those \nwho work within it, this legislation will directly answer many of the \nquestions that have been raised about the relationship between Members \nof Congress and lobbyists, about the role of money in public debate and \ndeliberations, and about whether results in Washington go to the \nhighest bidder or to the greatest public good.\n  This bill draws back the curtain to let the sun shine directly and \nbrightly on the lobbyist-lawmaker relationship for all to see, clearly \nand easily.\n  I thank my good friends, colleagues, and partners, Senators McCain \nand Collins, for the work they have done to bring the legislation to \nthe Senate. Senator McCain, along with his Committee on Indian Affairs, \nand its ranking member, Senator Byron Dorgan, conducted a hard-hitting \ninvestigation into the activities of the disgraced lobbyist, Jack \nAbramoff, helping to expose his criminal activities--in particular, his \nodious exploitation of Indian tribes. On the basis of that \ninvestigation, Senator McCain then introduced the Lobbyist Transparency \nand Accountability Act, which I proudly cosponsored. Then Chairman \nCollins took up the banner in our committee and, based on Senator \nMcCain's bill, we drafted legislation and quickly brought it before the \ncommittee for markup. The bill we debate today is the product of those \nefforts.\n\n  Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid and Senator Barack Obama of \nIllinois have played critical leadership roles in pushing reform \nforward by introducing very strong legislation, the Honest Leadership \nAct, which earned the support of 41 Members of the Senate and really \nhelped lay the groundwork for us here today. The backing of virtually \nthe entire Democratic caucus helped move this significant legislation \nto the floor, and I am proud of that. In fact, this proposal from our \ncommittee contains most of the proposals laid out in the Honest \nLeadership Act. I look forward to supporting amendments to restore \nother provisions of the Honest Leadership Act that were left out of the \nlegislation before us today.\n  Finally, thanks to Senator Russ Feingold of Wisconsin, who history \nwill note was the first in this 2-year session to introduce lobbying \nreform legislation. He did it last year. Senator Feingold is always a \nreliable ally when it comes to raising the public interest above \nspecial interests.\n  The abuses to which these bills respond, I want to stress, are the \nexception to the rule. Almost always lobbyists comply with the law and \nprovide Congress with valuable knowledge and expertise. Whether they \nrepresent corporations, unions, trade associations or nonprofits, or \nthe public interest groups that have actually lobbied us to pass this \nlegislation, lobbyists are instrumental to the work that goes on here \non Capitol Hill.\n  The Founding Fathers recognized the importance of such work when they \nenshrined, in the very first amendment to our Constitution, the right \nof all people ``to petition the government for redress of grievances.'' \nWe have to remember this when we legislate in this critically important \nand constitutionally elevated area. Lobbyists and the people they \nrepresent are exercising a constitutional right, and we have to, \ntherefore, be careful, as we have been in this bill, to respect that \nright.\n  Nothing in the bill that has come out of the Homeland Security and \nGovernmental Affairs Committee, or the Rules Committee, for that \nmatter, improperly intrudes on the people's right to be represented in \nWashington. But there is an equivalent right of the public to a \nfunctioning form of government, and that must also be respected.\n  That is precisely what our bill does, by building on previous efforts \nin this area. The Supreme Court, long ago, made clear that the first \namendment's guarantee of the right to petition the Government did not \nconfer a right to do so in secret. In the 1954 case of United States v. \nHarris, the Court upheld the constitutionality of lobbying disclosure \nrequirements and said those requirements were consistent with the first \namendment. Let me read a passage from that decision:\n\n       Present day legislative complexities are such that \n     individual members of Congress cannot be expected to explore \n     the myriad pressures to which they are regularly subjected. \n     Yet the full realization of the American ideal of government \n     by elected representatives depends to no small extent on \n     their ability to properly evaluate such pressures. Otherwise, \n     the voice of the people may all too easily be drowned out by \n     the voice of the special interest groups seeking favored \n     treatment while masquerading as proponents of the public \n     weal. This is the evil to which the Lobbying Act was designed \n     to help prevent.\n\n  Those words could not be truer today, when millions and millions of \nAmericans, whether they realize it, are represented in our Nation's \ncapital in some way by lobbyists, not just by those of us who are \nprivileged to have been elected as Members of Congress. Whether they \nare teachers or steel workers, whether they are law enforcement \nofficers or seniors, whether they are veterans or veterinarians, small \nbusiness owners or big business executives--and the list of categories \nin this richly and extraordinarily pluralistic society could go on--\npeople from all walks of American life--millions and millions of them--\nhave paid representation in this city. That is lobbying.\n  In fact, as I suggested before, some of the strongest proponents of \nlobbying reform are registered lobbyists themselves, lobbying Congress \nto enact reforms such as those we are discussing today for the honor of \ntheir profession and, I might say, for the honor of Congress.\n  The number of lobbyists in Washington has exploded over the last \ndecade. These are interesting numbers. The Congressional Research \nService reported that over 30,000 people were registered as lobbyists \nin 2004, and that is\n\n[[Page S1772]]\n\nan 86-percent increase over the number of registered lobbyists in 2000. \nThe industry receives and spends enormous sums of money.\n  According to the Center for Public Integrity, $3 billion--$3 \nbillion--was spent on lobbying activities in 2004. That is the last \nfull year for which records are available. And that is double the sum \nthat was spent 6 years before. That is big money. Add to these numbers \nthe recent scandals and the perception too many Americans have of \nbusiness in Washington as cash exchanging hands under tables or in back \nroom deals, and we have a public cynicism that weighs down on this \ninstitution of ours and lobbying as a profession. It is a reality we \nhave to recognize. And in these two measures brought before this \nChamber by these two committees, we have a way to lift that weight.\n  So we find ourselves in a place where the current lobbying disclosure \nrequirements are self-evidently inadequate, and ethics rules governing \nMembers' interactions with lobbyists need to be tightened, especially \nwith respect to gifts from lobbyists.\n  The Washington Post last December said that more than 80 Members of \nCongress and their staff were listed as having appeared to have \naccepted entertainment from a particular company, BellSouth, which \nexceeded congressional gift limits. Public knowledge of gifts exceeding \nthe limits is rare because no disclosure requirements exist at this \npoint. We are on a kind of honor system. And these provisions would \nchange that.\n\n  So let me take a moment or two to talk about the measure that is \nbefore us to deal with these shortcomings, not just to respond to the \ncynicism brought on by the latest lobbying scandal--the Abramoff \nscandal--but to respond thoughtfully to shortcomings in the law and the \nrules as they exist, and to respond to deficiencies identified by the \nmembers of the Rules Committee and the Homeland Security and \nGovernmental Affairs Committee.\n  The first thing the legislation from our committee would do is bring \nthe lawmaker-lobbyist relationship into the age of the Internet. We \nmandate that lobbyist disclosure statements be made publicly available \non a searchable Internet database, linked to the Federal Election \nCommission database of campaign contributions. We also require that \ndisclosures be made quarterly instead of semiannually, as is now the \ncase. Both of those measures will add significantly to the public's \nability to monitor lobbyist-lawmaker interactions.\n  When combined with the Rules Committee's bill, we virtually see the \nelimination of gifts from lobbyists to Members of Congress and ensure \nthat those small number that still are possible are fully disclosed. \nThe Rules Committee bill bans all gifts, other than meals, from \nlobbyists to Members of Congress and their staff and requires Members \nto disclose on their Web sites any meals they do consume through the \nhospitality of a lobbyist. We, in turn, through our committee, have \nprovided what might be called the ``belt'' to the Rules Committee's \n``suspenders'' by ensuring that lobbyists must, for the first time, \ndisclose all gifts over $20.\n  So the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee can \nregulate by law the behavior of lobbyists. The Rules Committee \nobviously regulates the Members of the Senate. These two bills together \nwill ensure a very significant curtailment of these gifts and clear \nknowledge for the public for those gifts that are still given--\nremembering that the current rules prohibits any Member from accepting \ngifts worth more than $100 a year from a lobbyist. But disclosure has \nnot been required up until this time for our gift rules.\n  The Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee bill will \nincrease transparency in a number of other ways. Lobbyists will, for \nthe first time, have to disclose when they play any role in arranging \ntravel for Members of Congress and executive branch officials. \nLobbyists would have to disclose the purpose and itinerary of any \ntrips, itemize expenses, and disclose all lobbyists and Members in the \ntraveling party.\n  Again, this is a reaction to the notorious trips sponsored by Mr. \nAbramoff. He did not necessarily pay for those trips, but he was \nclearly organizing them and using other entities to pay for them, while \navoiding the kind of detailed disclosure that our proposal would \nrequire.\n  We also require more disclosure about lobbyists' political campaign \nactivities. Contribution of $200 or more to candidates, leadership PACs \nor parties--as well as fundraising events hosted or sponsored by \nlobbyists--would have to be reported on an annual basis under the \nLobbying Disclosure Act. These disclosures are now available on FEC \ndatabases, but the data base is not easy to search. Chairman Collins \nand I believe this additional reporting requirement is a minimal \nrequirement justified by the additional public disclosure.\n  To those who had concerns that the initial formulation of this \nprovision unfairly forced employees who are registered lobbyists to \ntell their employers who they gave campaign contributions to, thus \nperhaps chilling their constitutional rights, let me assure you that \nthe committee heard your concerns and responded. We no longer require \nthat disclosure through employers but, instead, mandate direct \ndisclosure from each lobbyist. We also make clear that the \ncontributions that must be disclosed are the same ones already provided \nby campaigns to the FEC.\n  Our proposal takes another step forward to require lobbyists to \ndisclose payments for events that honor Members of Congress or \nexecutive branch officials. We do not prohibit such contributions, but \nin the public interest we require that they be disclosed. This would \ninclude payments to organizations, such as charities, that are founded \nor controlled by Members of Congress.\n  Our proposal would increase incentives to comply with the law by \ndoubling the civil penalty for noncompliance under the Lobbying \nDisclosure Act from $50,000 to $100,000. Also, for the first time, we \nprohibit lobbyists, by statute, from providing gifts or travel that do \nnot comply with congressional ethics rules. This is a critical reform \nbecause, until now, there has been nothing in the law to stop lobbyists \nfrom giving Members or staff gifts that skirt congressional limits, as \nlong as the Members and staff were willing to accept them. That is, the \nrules govern the behavior of Members and staff, but there is currently \nno law regarding the behavior of lobbyists. With this reform, lobbyists \nwould continue that kind of behavior at their own, very serious legal \nperil.\n\n  Our proposal would also make greater demands on those who move back \nand forth between public service and lobbying. To avoid conflicts of \ninterest, we would increase from 1 year to 2 the amount of time a \nformer Member of Congress or a former high-level executive branch \nofficial must wait before lobbying his or her former colleagues. For \ncongressional staff, we expand the 1-year cooling-off period to bar \nlobbying not just of the staffer's former office but of the entire \nHouse of Congress in which the staffer worked. Again, if the revolving \ndoor spins more slowly, so too will abuses.\n  I wish to take a few moments to address what has become a \ncontroversial portion of our legislation but, as Senator Collins \nindicated--though she did not support this amendment in committee--\nshould not be seen as quite that controversial. One may agree or \ndisagree, but I want people to understand clearly what we have done. \nOur committee, on a good, strong bipartisan vote accepted in markup an \namendment offered by Senator Levin and myself in direct response to the \nAbramoff scandal that ignited the reform drive that brings us together \ntoday. Mr. Abramoff directed his clients to pay millions of dollars, \nthe record shows, to grassroots lobbying firms controlled by himself \nand his associate Michael Scanlon, fees that were then in large part \ndirected back to Mr. Abramoff in the form of payments, fees--one might \nsay kickbacks. I believe if disclosure requirements had been in place, \nMr. Abramoff and Mr. Scanlon would not have been able to pull off this \nscam.\n  In the past decade, orchestrated, paid-for, so-called grassroots \ncampaigns have been a staple and important part of many lobbying \ncampaigns. There is nothing wrong with this. The question is whether we \nask for some minimal disclosure equal to the disclosure requirements on \nlobbyists other\n\n[[Page S1773]]\n\nthan grassroots lobbyists. Last year, for example, it was hard to miss \nthe ads paid for by lobbyists urging voters to contact their Members of \nCongress to vote either for or against Social Security privatization. \nIn the first 2 months of this year alone, 2006, candidates and interest \ngroups have already spent over $92 million on television advertising. \nThe nomination of Justice Alito, asbestos litigation reform, \nimplementation of the Medicare Part D, and proposals related to \ntelecommunications regulation all have generated massive media \ncampaigns aimed at inspiring constituent calls, letters, and e-mails to \nMembers.\n  Our proposal on this matter would, for the first time, require the \ndisclosure of money received and spent by professional grassroots \nlobbying firms--that is, grassroots efforts paid for by lobbyists to \ngenerate major media campaigns, mass mailings, and large phone banks \nwith the intent of influencing Members of Congress or the executive \nbranch.\n  Let me say that again because I want my colleagues particularly to be \nclear about what this provision does and does not do. It does not ban \nor restrict grassroots lobbying of any kind in any way. That would be \nwrong. Grassroots lobbying is another important way for people to get \ninvolved in the process and let us in Congress know how they feel. The \nprovision merely requires--in order to inform the public and prevent \nthe kinds of abuses that the record now shows Mr. Abramoff was involved \nin through grassroots lobbying firms--the disclosure of the amount of \nmoney spent on this type of lobbying when it is done in professional \ncampaigns. The controversy over this provision is, in my opinion, \nunreasonable because our bill will not inhibit any grassroots lobbying \nin any way. In fact, Senator Levin and I took extra steps from the \noriginal proposal to ensure that our proposal applies only to the \nlarger professional efforts involved in grassroots lobbying.\n  For example, if the grassroots lobbying effort spends under $25,000 \nper quarter--in other words, less than $100,000 a year--it will not \nhave to report at all. They are exempt. Money spent on communications \ndirected at an organization's own members, employees, officers, or \nshareholders is also exempt from disclosure. So, an organization could \nretain a firm to communicate with its own members around the country \nand that would not have to be disclosed. And 501 (c)(3) organizations \nthat already report grassroots expenses to the IRS will be allowed to \nreport that same number under the Lobbying Disclosure Act, minimizing \nany alleged paperwork or accounting burden on these organizations. And \nwhile this may be self-evident, we have added words in the amendment to \nmake clear that reporting is not required for voluntary efforts by the \ngeneral public to communicate their own views to Federal officials or \nencourage other members of the general public to do the same.\n  Ten years ago, when Congress passed the Lobbying Disclosure Act, \nSenator Levin unsuccessfully fought for a grassroots lobbying \ndisclosure provision. At that time he said such campaigns spend about \n$700 million per year. I would be surprised if that number hasn't at \nleast doubled since then, and Congress and the public have no accurate \npicture of who is spending what to influence others to lobby us. \nDisclosure of paid grassroots lobbying is a long time past due.\n  Let me stress again, the reform we are debating here does nothing to \nabridge the right of all the people to petition their government. Its \npurpose is simply to bring the grassroots lobbying community out of the \nshadows and to ask it to make the same simple disclosure that all other \nlobbyists are required to do--basically, two numbers: the amount of \nmoney received and the amount of money spent, nothing more and nothing \nless than all other lobbyists are required to disclose.\n  During the markup in our Homeland Security Committee, some Senators \nand members of the committee asked whether the so-called 527 groups \nwould be covered by this provision. The 527s are already required by \nlaw to disclose far greater amounts of information to either the IRS or \nthe Federal Election Commission. The 527 groups are required, for \nexample, to disclose the names of anyone who contributes more than $200 \na year, and they must state the purpose of any expenditure over $500. \nLet's put to rest the notion that we are doing something about 527 \ngroups here, because we already require far more of them than we are \nasking of grassroots lobbyists.\n  Another question raised in the committee was about whether a \nbroadcaster, in particular a leader of a religious group, would be \nsubject to grassroots disclosure requirements for urging his or her \naudience on radio or television to write or call Members of Congress \nabout a particular issue. Of course not. This bill requires disclosure \nonly by paid lobbyists acting on behalf of a client.\n  I have described what I think are very powerful provisions in this \nlegislation to increase disclosure, to increase the transparency of the \nlobbyist-lawmaker relationship, and to slow down the revolving door \nbetween government service and K Street. I have heard some people say \nthis legislation is not strong enough because our committee did strike \nfrom the bill a proposal Chairman Collins and I made for an Office of \nPublic Integrity that would have been a new, independent repository of \ndisclosure statements, with the power to investigate complaints and \nissue subpoenas. I want to talk about that in a moment. The fact is, \neven without that provision, which I still support, this is a very \nstrong, transformational lobbying reform proposal.\n  The enforcement provision Senator Collins and I advocated in the \ncommittee would have helped restore the confidence of the American \npeople. The ethics process, frankly, in the other body of Congress has \nbeen dysfunctional. I do believe we have a strong Ethics Committee in \nthe Senate, and that is not the reason we put forth our proposal. We \noffered our proposal to increase the staff and professional support of \nour Ethics Committee and to create an independent place where \ninvestigations of complaints can be made so the public has no lingering \nsuspicion that the ethics regulation of Members of Congress involves \nself-protection. That is the purpose of our proposal.\n  In addition to restoring public trust in the ability of Congress to \npolice itself, the Office of Public Integrity that we proposed was \ndesigned to act as a monitor, reviewer, and watchdog of filings under \nthe Lobbying Disclosure Act. Currently, lobbying disclosure forms are \nfiled with the Secretary of the Senate. That office has fewer than 20 \npeople to review filings--and they work hard; this is not to criticize \nthem at all--compared to the 400 employees of the Federal Election \nCommission, which many people believe is also understaffed.\n  Here is the point: It is very hard for 20 people to adequately \nsupervise and review the filings of over 30,000 lobbyists. That was \nanother reason why Senator Collins and I submitted the Office of Public \nIntegrity proposal. I believe this proposal is an important part of \nlobbying reform at this once-in-a-generation moment. We have put forth \nstrong measures, in the bills reported by the Senate from the Committee \non Rules and our committee, to enact increased disclosure, greater \ntransparency, the virtual prohibition on gifts to Members of Congress, \nand elimination of any gifts without full disclosure. But I believe a \nbetter enforcement mechanism is a critical last component of true \nlobbying reform legislation. That is why some of us in the Senate will \nbe offering amendments here on the floor along the lines of the \nproposal to create an Office of Public Integrity, which Chairman \nCollins and I offered in the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs \nCommittee. We will put forth amendments to strengthen the enforcement \nmechanisms of our proposed reforms to make sure those reforms are \nenforced.\n  I also intend to offer an amendment with Senator McCain and others to \ncurb privately funded travel. Currently when a Member of Congress or a \ncandidate for office uses a private plane instead of flying on a \ncommercial flight, the ethics rules require a payment to the owner of \nthe plane equivalent to a first-class commercial ticket price. Senator \nMcCain and I and others believe that the current rule undervalues \nflights on noncommercial jets and provides an end-run on limitations on \nwhat corporations or individuals can contribute to Members or give us \nas gifts.\n  We believe it is time to update our rules to close this loophole, to \nbase\n\n[[Page S1774]]\n\npayment on the fair market value of chartering a plane.\n  I want to stress again, notwithstanding my intention to join with \nother colleagues on a few of these amendments that I believe will \nstrengthen the measure, that the legislation before us from our \ncommittee and from the Rules Committee together present the Senate an \nopportunity to adopt a very strong bill, a bill with sharp teeth that I \nbelieve will reduce the influence of money in the legislative process \nand prevent the kinds of grotesque abuses to which Mr. Abramoff and \nCongressman Cunningham have now pleaded guilty. This legislation will \nnot only shine sunlight on what we are doing here but will restore the \nbalance of power where it belongs, in favor of the American people. I \nam confident that increased transparency, always described in this \ngreat democracy of ours as the disinfecting rays of sunshine, will \ndiscourage some of the abuses that have occurred. And when combined \nwith the bill reported out of the Committee on Rules, we will be \nwriting into law a near total ban on gifts.\n  Thus, to the extent that lobbyists do confer gifts or arrange for \ntravel for Members of Congress, our constituents will be able to follow \nthe activities of those Members of Congress on the Internet and will, I \nam sure, be kept well informed of these movements by our free and \nindustrious press.\n  It has been said that information is power, not just knowledge. \nInformation and, therefore, power is what we are providing the public \nin this legislation. These are dramatic and transformational steps that \nare included in both of these measures. I hope they will, together, \ngive our constituents a renewed sense of faith in this institution. I \nurge my colleagues to support the legislation.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine is recognized.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I commend the ranking member, the Senator \nfrom Connecticut, for his excellent statement and for his championship \nof this bill. He is a longtime champion of good government. It has been \na great pleasure to work with him on this legislation.\n  I see that the Senator from Ohio is in the Chamber. I believe he has \na unanimous consent request to speak as in morning business. As one of \nthe managers of the bill, I inform the Chair that I have no objection \nto that request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio is recognized.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to proceed as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. DeWine are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burr). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Parliamentary inquiry, Mr. President: We are still on the \nrules and lobby reform legislation?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I do feel a need to put some statement in \nthe Record about the issue of public financing of campaigns that was \nraised by my distinguished colleague from the Rules Committee, Senator \nDodd, earlier today. He talked about how he believes this is something \nwe need to do, and he wanted to have some hearings in the Rules \nCommittee on the public financing of campaigns issue, and I agreed that \nwe would find a time to do that. It is always good to have a hearing \nand see how laws that are on the books are actually working or not \nworking, so I will be glad to do that.\n  I thank Senator Dodd and other members of the Rules Committee for the \nfact that we held the line. There were two or three amendments that \nwere considered or were offered dealing with campaign finance law, and \nSenator Dodd spoke against them. I ruled them out of order, and then we \nwent on. So it was a cooperative effort, once again, that I am very \nproud of.\n  The day may come when we want to revisit campaign finance reform laws \nor the issue of public financing of campaigns, but this is not that \nday. I wish to make it clear that public financing of Senate and House \nraces is totally a nonstarter as far as this Senator is concerned. \nEvery year, the American people cast their vote on public financing \nwith a resounding no. Nine out of ten Americans--90 percent--refuse to \ncheck off contributing to the Presidential election campaign fund. So \nwhat makes us think they would check off or contribute in some way \nthrough the Tax Code to our campaigns?\n  Our campaign financing laws may not be the best. One of the most \ndifficult things about running for the Congress is you have to get out \nand raise a lot of money because it costs a lot to buy time on \ntelevision or radio or billboards and all that goes into a campaign. So \neverybody complains about how much money it takes, but they expect you \nto get your message out there, and if you don't, you certainly won't \nget elected. But one thing I have always noticed is good candidates, \nmen and women, all manage to raise enough money to get their message \nacross.\n  I still have faith in political entrepreneurs and people contributing \nto the candidate of their choice. But for us now to go to some sort of \na checkoff scheme for the public financing of congressional races, I \ndon't believe the American people are ready to do that. First of all, \nhow would you do it? How would you fund Independents and libertarians? \nIn my own race, I have a libertarian opponent this year, and we have \nIndependents who are running. I know the answer to that: the two \nparties would squeeze them out. They wouldn't have a credible chance, \nreally. But that is just one of many problems.\n  In the 13 States that have checkoff schemes for public financing, and \nsome of them were mentioned earlier today, participation has dropped \nfrom 20 percent to about 11 percent. That is nothing more than, in my \nopinion, welfare for politicians; one more thing that is expected to be \ncontrolled by, run by, funded by the Government, which is, after all, \ntaxpayers' money. So I just want to say that I believe this is one of \nthe all time worst ideas of the year.\n  I fought for 4 years against the McCain-Feingold legislation, but \neventually, when we temporarily lost our majority over here and we had \nDemocratic leadership, BCRA, campaign finance reform, McCain-Feingold, \nwas passed.\n  My attitude was, look, we fought the good fight, we held it off for \nyears, it finally passed, it is on the books, and it is the law. Let's \nat least see how it is going to work. It has only had one election \ncycle. I want to see how this system works.\n  I have joined with Senator McCain and Senator Feingold in a \nbipartisan way saying: Well, wait a minute, we just barely got this \nthing done, let's see how it really works. I think it is going to be \nbetter than I thought it would in some respects and worse in others. \nFor instance, what we have seen is that soft money that used to go to \nthe parties, which I believe is where it should have gone, has oozed \nover into other areas.\n  That is why the Rules Committee last year voted to do real campaign \nfinance reform when we adopted the 527 reform bill. That bill has \nlanguished on the calendar ever since because for some reason we can't \nget clearance to call it up, I guess. I don't know whether our \nleadership is really opposed to calling it up or whether the Democratic \nleadership has resisted, but the fact is that we reported it out of the \nRules Committee on a bipartisan vote and it is on the calendar, it is \nwaiting. So I hope that at some point we could consider that 527 \nfreestanding, or if we ever have a hearing on campaign finance reform, \n527 will be an important part of it. If we really want to do something \nthat would affect how our campaigns are conducted this fall and in \n2008, this is the place where we ought to do it.\n  These 527s involve a huge amount of money, mostly from rich people. \nThey wind up in our campaigns against Republicans or against Democrats, \nand almost always attacking, and with no real disclosure of where this \nbig money comes from. We know a lot of it on the Democratic side comes \nfrom I guess\n\n[[Page S1775]]\n\n``moveon.org,'' or George Soros. We also know that on our side of the \naisle, we have the Swift Boat Veterans that ran negative ads funded \nwith 527 money against Senator Kerry when he was running for President.\n  That is just the beginning. Both parties are going to do this more \nand more, the amount of money is going to go up, it is the worst kind \nof sewer money, and it is going to embarrass both of us. We need to get \na grip on this 527 area now because they are not reporting, they are \nnot disclosing, and they are not subject to any limits on \ncontributions. So I would hope that we would find a way to deal with \nthis, and I can assure my colleagues that I am going to withhold on \ncampaign finance reform, but if anybody offers a serious campaign \nfinance reform amendment, I will second degree it with 527 because I \nbelieve we ought to be doing this anyway.\n  What we will require is that you have to register with the FEC. If \nyou are involved with campaigns, why would you have to disclose what \nyou are doing in a campaign? Now, is that a tragedy?\n  We had some language in the Rules Committee bill that is on the floor \nnow that somebody said: Well, you know, if you require this group to \ndisclose, that is an unfair punishment. Excuse me? To disclose and \nreport your contributions or expenditures is punishment? I don't \nunderstand that. That is what I believe we ought to be doing here. The \nAmerican people have a right to know how we raise our money, where we \nraise our money from, how much it is, and it needs to be reported early \nand regularly. Let them decide. If they don't like the way you raise \nyour money, they can vote against you. That is the way to do it.\n  So these 527s are unregulated, not even registered with the FEC, and \nit also should be required that they be subject to hard money limits on \nwhat can be donated. So I believe the real danger is in this so-called \n527 area.\n  The bill we reported provides exceptions for 527s whose annual \nreceipts are less than $25,000, which consists solely of State or local \ncandidates or officials, or whose activities exclusively relate to \nState or local elections and ballot initiatives.\n  There is justification for these exceptions when small amount of \nmoney are involved in trying to encourage people to vote on ballot \ninitiatives and so forth. But these exceptions do not apply if a 527 \norganization transmits a public communication that promotes, supports, \nattacks, or opposes a Federal candidate in the year prior to the \nFederal election, or conducts any voter drive activities in connection \nwith an election in which a Federal candidate appears on the ballot.\n  The bill would also require that at least 50 percent of the 527 \norganization's administrative overhead expenses would have to be paid \nfor with hard money.\n  The time has come to put an end to this shift of power from political \nparties. By the way, what are they for? Political parties are \nlegitimate arms to encourage people to run for office, to encourage \npeople to get out and vote. They were getting soft money contributions \nwhich were not going directly to the candidates. We said, Oh, no, that \nis bad. Now it goes to these shadowy 527s that are setting the agenda \nin our election process.\n  I think this is a very dangerous area. I have told Senator Dodd, and \nI will keep my word, I do not intend to offer an amendment on this. I \nhope the leadership would take that legislation up freestanding, \nseparate from this bill. But if we get into a whole movement into the \ncampaign finance reform, instead of the rules of the Senate with regard \nto gifts and traveling and so forth, this would be one of the issues \nthat would come up. I wanted to put that into the Record.\n\n\n                           Hurricane Katrina\n\n  Mr. President, seeing no other Senator wishing to speak, I wish to \nswitch over to another area. I urge my colleagues to begin to think \nabout another issue that I think is very critical. This, once again, \nrelates to my part of the country and my home State with regard to \nHurricane Katrina.\n  I have a long experience in dealing with disasters--five hurricanes, \ntwo tornadoes with major consequences, two ice storms, and a flood. I \nhave been dealing with disasters since 1969 when Hurricane Camille hit \nmy home area. I thought it was the worst disaster I had ever seen or \nthe country would ever see. Yet we see now that Hurricane Katrina \ndwarfed Hurricane Camille.\n  Going back to 1969, we had not quite come to the thinking we have \nnow, where the Federal Government is going to do everything for us. \nPeople on the Mississippi gulf coast were on their backs. We had been \ndevastated by that hurricane. We didn't know how we were going to deal \nwith it. The President of the United States flew into Gulfport, MS, and \nsaid, We will not forget you. Then they called in the Office of \nEmergency Preparedness, an independent agency accountable only to the \nPresident of the United States and headed by a military officer. He \ncame down, set up offices, and it worked. Dealing with Hurricane \nCamille and the cleanup and the aftermath was the best after a disaster \nI have ever seen. The people in that area were awed and amazed, and \nappreciated what happened in the cleanup after that hurricane.\n  Now, 40 years later it is worse, not better. What happened? Why, 40 \nyears later, have we not learned the lessons from previous disasters \nand the cleanup after those hurricanes so we would do a quick, \nefficient, effective job after hurricanes? One of my very bright young \nstaff members said it is because it has been 40 years of accumulated \nbureaucracy. I fear maybe he is right. But I think it is maybe \nsomething more than that. Over the years we have evolved in emergency \npreparedness for natural disasters and the recovery afterward. We have \ngone through a number of changes in names and a number of changes in \nlocations. We have had some good heads of the emergency entity and some \nnot so good heads.\n  I remember the head of the emergency preparedness organization under \nPresident Clinton was a gentleman named James Lee Witt from Arkansas. \nHe was excellent. He did a wonderful job. My dealings with him after \none of the hurricanes in the 1990s could not have been any better. So \nit does partially depend on who the leader is at these entities.\n  But I remember sitting in the leader's conference room when we were \nsetting up this huge, new behemoth, the Department of Homeland \nSecurity. We were discussing how big was it going to be, what agencies \nand departments were we going to merge into that big, new department. I \nremember we had quite a lengthy discussion about the Coast Guard \nbecause they wanted to put the Coast Guard in Homeland Security and \nsome of us did not like that. Senators Inouye and Stevens and others \nput some language in there about how the Coast Guard would work in that \ndepartment, so eventually we went along with it. I am not sure it was a \ngood idea, but obviously the Coast Guard has done a good job since the \nhurricane and generally does a good job.\n  Then it came up how we were going to put the emergency management \nagency in this new Department of Homeland Security--FEMA. I remember I \nraised questions. I said wait a minute, I am not sure we want to wrap \nthis agency in this huge bureaucracy. I am afraid they will get pushed \naside or underfunded or neglected. Preparation for terrorist attacks \nand homeland security is very different from preparation for a natural \ndisaster and recovery after a disaster.\n  But I was told no, they are totally related. When you are working on \npreparation for terrorism, homeland security, it definitely relates to \nemergencies of a natural disaster and the aftermath.\n  I said OK. And we did it; we created this monstrous department now \nthat is so big, and has been going through the throes of organization \nand management. I think they have done a pretty good job. I thought Tom \nRidge was a good Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security. I \nhave not had a personal problem with Secretary Chertoff. It is \ndifficult to do what they have been doing. But I must say, we were \nwrong. We should not have put FEMA in the Department of Homeland \nSecurity.\n\n  What has happened is that some of the people with FEMA, who are \nexperienced heads, said: You know, we are going to get overrun. This is \nnot going to be good. So the more experienced, qualified hands--I think \na lot of them left. I found after Hurricane Katrina\n\n[[Page S1776]]\n\nthe agency was rife with bureaucracy. The chain of command--I don't \nknow where it is. I guess it is nonexistent.\n  It is underfunded. There are inadequate funds, and it is undermanned. \nI think six of the nine regional positions of leadership are ``acting'' \npeople; temporary.\n  I think we made a huge mistake when we moved FEMA into the Department \nof Homeland Security. I found repeatedly over the past 6 months they \ncouldn't deal with debris removal. The degree of bureaucracy is mind \nboggling. Congress has to act, Treasury has to release the money, OMB \nhas to say it is OK. The money goes to FEMA and then to the Corps of \nEngineers, and the Corps of Engineers gives it to the big contractor in \nFlorida who gives it to the local contractors who give it to the small \nguy. By the time it gets to the guy who is actually moving the debris, \nhe is getting $6 a cubic yard while the big contract is probably $21. \nIt is a totally unworkable situation.\n  I found also when you talked to the leadership here in Washington, \nthey may say the right thing and want to do the right thing, but it \ndoesn't get to the FEMA person on the ground. They don't get the word. \nOr if they get the word, they ignore it. I don't know who they work \nfor. I could cite so many horror stories you wouldn't believe it. It \nmakes me cry to even think about it.\n  I have introduced legislation to do what I thought we should have \ndone in the first place, and that is to have FEMA as a separate, \nindependent agency, reportable only to one person, and that person is \nthe disaster czar. It is the President of the United States.\n  For instance, I watched the talk shows on Sunday. There was some \ncomplaining that the head of FEMA was going around the head of the \nHomeland Security Department to talk directly to the President. Why, of \ncourse. Why not? Why would you have to report through layers and layers \nand layers, chain of command, to get to the big guy? It is ridiculous. \nThe guy in charge of the disaster situation and recovery and cleanup \nand all that should be talking to the President of the United States. \nHe should be directly involved--not in minutia, by the way, but in the \ngrand picture. When you are dealing with disaster, somebody has to be \nin charge, giving orders.\n  I think I am going to be joined in this effort by other Senators from \nthe region, including hopefully Senator Landrieu and Senator Vitter and \nmy colleague from Mississippi. I know Senator Clinton of New York has \nsimilar legislation. I invite my colleagues to take a look at it. It is \ncoming. I don't know whether it will come out of the Homeland Security \nand Governmental Affairs Committee, but if it doesn't in a reasonable \nperiod of time, the first time we have an opportunity to offer this \nlegislation, it will be offered as an amendment. I don't want to \nsurprise people with it. I want you to think about it.\n  Believe me, the current bureaucracy has not worked. You don't want to \nget hit with this if you are from a coastal area, or an area prone to \ntornadoes or earthquakes or forest fires. You are going to need quick, \ndecisive, unbureaucratic, adequately funded reactions where the chain \nof command is very short to make sure the job is actually done.\n  I will be back on the Mississippi gulf coast this coming weekend. I \nwill see how we are doing. But I think it is not enough to just \ncomplain about what has happened. I am not trying to fix blame; I want \nto know how it is going to be better next week. I want to know how it \nis going to be better next year. My house will not be rebuilt in my \nhometown this year, but I am going to rebuild it. And the next time we \nhave a hurricane, I hope we could get the Corps of Engineers to \nbulldoze the stranded houses that have effectively been destroyed in \nquicker than this time.\n  I wanted to put that on the record and encourage my colleagues to \nthink about this. At some point you quit complaining and start taking \naction. You start dealing with the problems. Quite often, you know what \nI have found, the problem is not the bureaucracy or the department or \nthe President or the Governor of some State--it is us. It is the way we \nwrite the laws--convoluted, unworkable laws that we put on the books. \nThis is one case where we made a mistake. Let's fix it.\n  This legislation will put back an independent, freestanding agency, \nand that would be the right thing to do.\n  Mr. President, I believe we do have some votes. We will have, two or \nthree votes, I believe the leader said, at approximately 5:30. I \nbelieve there will be some Senators who are coming over to speak on \nbehalf of these judicial nominations between now and then.\n  For now I observe the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Committee on the \nJudiciary wisely recommended that we consent to his nomination, and I \njoin the committee in urging a favorable vote by all of my colleagues \nin this body.\n  Mr. Batten was nominated by President Bush on September 29, 2005, \nafter Senator Isakson and I conveyed Mr. Batten's name for appropriate \nconsideration. Mr. Batten is a native of Georgia and a resident of \nAtlanta. He graduated with honors from the Georgia Institute of \nTechnology and cum laude from the University of Georgia School of Law. \nSince his graduation from law school, he has been with the Atlanta law \nfirm of Schreeder, Wheeler & Flint. He specializes in commercial \nlitigation representing both plaintiffs and defendants and has \nsubstantial trial experience.\n  Mr. Batten has distinguished himself among Atlanta lawyers and is \nheld in high regard by judges before whom he has appeared, as well his \ncolleagues at the bar, including opposing counsel.\n  Tim Batten is a devoted husband and father and brings to the Federal \nbench not only a wealth of legal experience but a dedication and \ncommitment to the rule of law which is an essential qualification for \nany person who would serve in the Federal judiciary.\n  I know Tim personally. I am as excited as I can be about Tim being \nnominated by the President, and I look forward to his confirmation. I \nurge my colleagues to support his nomination. I look forward to his \nservice on the Federal bench in the Northern District of Georgia.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I rise in favor of the confirmation of \nthe nomination of Mr. Timothy Batten, the U.S. district court for the \nNorthern District of Georgia.\n  In doing so, I give sincere thanks to our selection committee and \nreview committee in Georgia which interviewed all the potential \ncandidates for this judgeship. My three appointees: Jimmy Franklin, Dr. \nRon Carlson, and Mr. Ingram, have done a wonderful job in donating \ncountless thousands of hours to see to it that the very best nominees \nwere sent forward to the White House. I extend my thanks to them.\n  I extend my thanks to all those who submitted their names, and, in \nparticular, Mr. Tim Batten, who has been selected by the President of \nthe United States for this judgeship.\n  Over the last few years in terms of the judiciary confirmation \nprocess, offering oneself for a Federal judgeship in this country is \nnot a walk in the park.\n\n[[Page S1777]]\n\n  It is not a picnic. We are very fortunate in this country to have men \nand women of the caliber and the standing of Tim Batten who are willing \nto make the sacrifices for public service and offer themselves to serve \nthis country.\n  Tim and his beautiful wife Elizabeth and their six children are truly \nan American success story. With his confirmation and the vote by this \nSenate tonight, we will be adding to the U.S. district court a \ncompetent, dedicated individual, dedicated to the rule of law, the \nprinciples of this country, and the Constitution of the United States \nof America.\n  As the junior Senator from the State of Georgia, I am happy and \nhonored to commend to the entire Senate Mr. Timothy Batten as the next \ndistrict judge in Georgia.\n  Mr. Batten was born in Atlanta, GA, received his undergraduate degree \nat the Georgia Institute of Technology in 1981, and his juris doctorate \ndegree at the University of Georgia in 1984. He has practiced law in \nGeorgia his entire professional career at the firm of Schreeder, \nWheeler & Flint, and he and his wife Elizabeth have six children.\n  I know Mr. Batten is very well qualified and keenly aware of the \nresponsibilities he is about to undertake. I know that as the Members \nof this Chamber have considered his nomination they have learned that \nthat he will be a jurist who understands the value and the strength and \nthe power of the Constitution of the United States of America, and a \njurist who will rule based on the law, not legislate based on the \nposition. Mr. Batten has exceptional qualifications, and I have every \nconfidence that Mr. Batten is equal to the position he has been \nnominated for.\n  I ask unanimous consent that personal information on Mr. Batten be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                         Timothy C. Batten, Sr.\n\n       Birth: May 23, 1960, Atlanta, Georgia.\n       Legal Residence: Georgia.\n       Marital Status: Married, Elizabeth Parkman Batten, six \n     children.\n       Education: 1977-1981, Georgia Institute of Technology, B.S. \n     degree; 1981-1984, University of Georgia, J.D. degree.\n       Bar: 1984, Georgia.\n       Experience: 1984-present, Schreeder, Wheeler & Flint, LLP--\n     Associate, 1984-1993; Partner, 1993-present.\n       Office: Schreeder, Wheeler & Flint, LLP, 1600 Candler \n     Building, 127 Peachtree Street, NE, Atlanta, Georgia 30303-\n     1845, 404-681-3450.\n       To be United States District Judge for the Northern \n     District of Georgia.\n\n  Mr. ISAKSON. I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, very briefly, we are about to proceed to \na vote on three judicial nominees. In my judgment, they are all well-\nqualified. There is no contest. One of the nominees, Thomas Edward \nJohnston, currently serves as the U.S. Attorney for the Northern \nDistrict of West Virginia. He has been nominated for the District Court \nfor the Southern District of West Virginia and has an excellent \nacademic and professional background.\n  Timothy C. Batten has been nominated to be a judge for the District \nCourt for the Northern District of Georgia. He has been an active \npractitioner with the Schreeder, Wheeler & Flint law firm for the past \n22 years. Again, I believe this nomination is not controversial.\n  Aida M. Delgado-Colon has been nominated to be a judge on the U.S. \nDistrict Court for the District of Puerto Rico. She has been a \nmagistrate judge since 1993 and has served with the Department of Labor \nin Puerto Rico, the Office of the Federal Public Defender for Puerto \nRico, and as an adjunct professor at Pontifical Catholic University.\n  That is a very brief statement of these three nominees.\n  I yield to my distinguished ranking member, Senator Leahy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished senior Senator \nfrom Pennsylvania. I note that two of the nominees, one from West \nVirginia and another from Georgia, are represented in the Senate for \nWest Virginia with two Democratic Senators, both of whom support the \nnominee. Georgia has two Republican Senators, both of whom support the \nnominee. They have been moved very quickly.\n  I mention this because the nominees are the 229th, 230th, and 231st \nof the judges nominated by President Bush to be confirmed. It shows \nwhen the White House works with Members of both parties how quickly \nthey get filled. It is an indication when the White House takes time to \nwork with Members of both parties to fill the judgeships, they move \nrather quickly.\n  This evening we will see three more of President Bush's nominees for \nlifetime appointments to the Federal courts confirmed. With these \nconfirmations, the total number of the President's judicial appointees \nrises to 231, including the confirmations of Supreme Court Justices \nRoberts and Alito. This is an impressive number, considering the time \nthat was needed to devote to the Supreme Court vacancies over the last \nyear--President Bush made a series of three nominations for the \nsuccessor to Justice O'Connor--and the administration's slow pace of \nnominations for much of this year.\n  Tonight's nominees come from West Virginia, Georgia and Puerto Rico. \nThomas Johnston of West Virginia has the support of his two home-State \nDemocratic Senators. Thomas Batten of Georgia has the support of his \ntwo home-State Republican Senators. The nominee from Puerto Rico was \nnot opposed in the Judiciary Committee. These nominees, the 229th, \n230th and 231st judges nominated by this President to be confirmed, \nshow once again that when the White House works with Senators from both \nparties, vacancies on the Federal bench can quickly be filled. It is \nwhen the White House refuses to consult with the Senate, or having \nmentioned nominees' names, ignores the advice of the Senate, or chooses \nto pick a fight for partisan purposes, that we have trouble.\n  Considering how hard the Judiciary Committee has worked to uphold its \npart in the process of confirming judges, it is unfortunate that the \nPresident is not fulfilling the commitments he made to be a uniter and \nto complete his work in advance of vacancies. Even after these three \nnominees are confirmed, there will still be more than 50 vacancies in \nthe Federal circuit and district courts. Despite the fanfare with which \nthe President announced that he would be sending nominations for \nupcoming vacancies in advance and in no event later than 180 days after \na vacancy, there are at least 24 current vacancies, nearly half, for \nwhich there is no nominee at all. Some of those 24 vacancies have been \nsitting empty more than a year. Over and over the White House has \nmissed the deadline the President established for himself, and today, \nof the 24 vacancies waiting for nominees, 10 are already more than 180 \ndays old.\n  If the White House would eliminate its partisan political and \nideological litmus tests from the judicial nominations process, and \nfocus only on qualifications and consensus, the job of selecting \nnominees and our job of considering them for confirmation would be much \neasier. As tonight's confirmations demonstrate, Democrats in the Senate \nhave been cooperative.\n  I congratulate these nominees and their families on their \nconfirmations.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I believe we are scheduled to vote at \n5:30. My watch says 5:30.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the hour of 5:30 \nhaving arrived, the Senate will proceed to the vote on the nominations.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is, Will the Senate advise and consent to the nomination \nof Timothy C. Batten, Sr., of Georgia, to be United States District \nJudge for the Northern District of Georgia? The clerk will call the \nroll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. The following Senators were necessarily absent: the \nSenator from Texas (Mrs. Hutchison), the\n\n[[Page S1778]]\n\nSenator from Florida (Mr. Martinez), the Senator from Arizona (Mr. \nMcCain), the Senator from Alaska (Ms. Murkowski), and the Senator from \nVirginia (Mr. Warner).\n  Mr. DURBIN.

The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oklahoma [Mr. Inhofe] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2898.\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, this is simply what I have called the \nenergy price reduction amendment. Each year proponents of LIHEAP \nfunding complain that energy prices have increased and therefore more \nassistance is needed. Yet subsidizing high prices does nothing to lower \nprices. Increasing the funding for today's LIHEAP without acting to \nreduce the price of energy tomorrow is not an acceptable solution.\n  Home energy prices are excessively high because of two simple facts, \ntwo critical reasons: First, the demand for energy has increased along \nwith the economic output. However, because natural gas is regarded as \nan environmentally preferable fuel, demand for natural gas has \nincreased dramatically as more of it is used for electricity \ngeneration. We have gone through this with coal-fired plants. We have \ntried to have major advancements in clean coal technology, which we are \ndoing right now. But right now, the one thing that is environmentally \npure is natural gas and, for that reason, the demand is up. Second, \nwith the rise in demand, the market should have responded with a \ncorresponding increase in supply.\n\n[[Page S1779]]\n\n  I have here a chart, and this is from the Energy Information \nAdministration. Domestic production of natural gas has actually \ndeclined. Not many people understand this, that the supply has actually \ndeclined. So not only do we have an increase in demand, but the supply \nhas reduced, as is pointed out in this chart. I want my colleagues to \nrecognize that I am reporting clear facts. I am ignoring partisan \nrhetoric, relying on recognized, unbiased experts from the EIA, not \nfrom the New York Times, not from the industry representatives. The \nEIA's consumer guide, ``Residential Natural Gas Prices: What Consumers \nShould Know,'' states that:\n\n       One of the most significant factors why prices are so high \n     is due to weak production, noting that production decreased \n     by only .6 percent in 2004, declining below the 2002 level \n     and reaching the lowest production levels since 1999.\n\n  The fact is that demand has increased and production levels have not. \nAs a result, our constituents--the very same residents desperate for \nLIHEAP assistance--are facing artificially high natural gas prices.\n  This chart is from the EIA. It illustrates how much residents of each \nof our States are paying for natural gas. Now I would encourage my \ncolleagues to look and see what it is, and look at one of the higher \nelevations. It is from $16 in those regions there, all the way down \nto--I can't read it from here, but you can see it. It is such a \ndisparity as you go around the Nation, and I think people need to know \nwhat their constituents are being forced to pay.\n  EIA data has shown that production of natural gas has decreased \ndramatically. The National Petroleum Council, which is a nonpartisan \nentity charged by the Secretary of Energy, concluded that significant \ngas resources were effectively off limits for various reasons.\n  The American Gas Association, a strong supporter of increased LIHEAP \nfunding, came to the same conclusion. Both entities called for a \nbetter, more efficient process for producing natural gas.\n  My amendment provides a more certain process for energy-related \ndecisionmaking on public lands. It requires the Secretary to act on an \nenergy-related application within 120 days. If the application is not \napproved, then the Secretary must inform the applicant as to the \nreasons and allow the applicant to modify its application.\n  What is happening here is that these applications to produce on these \nlands, public lands, sit there and there is never any decision. \nCertainly it should be shorter than 120 days, but that should be \nadequate.\n  Further, it clarifies existing practice and requires that a reviewing \ncourt accord a rebuttable presumption to the Secretary's determination \nthat an energy project as mitigated does not have a significant \nenvironmental impact. The recently enacted Energy bill included \nsignificant energy efficiency improvements. In fact, it included so \nmany that EIA modified its energy projections in some ways to \nincorporate the new law.\n  My amendment would improve natural gas efficiency through the EPA's \nNatural Gas Star Program. This is a good program. It works, and it is \nbeing voluntarily complied with. Under my language, the EPA would be \nauthorized to provide grants to identify and use methane reduction \ntechnologies, and the Administrator would be required to conduct a \nseries of methane emission reduction workshops in oil and gas-producing \nStates. The less gas that is leaked means more gas is available to \nconsumers. It is a no-brainer.\n  The lack of sufficient domestic refining capacity has received \nsignificant media attention. The public understands that tight capacity \ntranslates to higher prices of motor fuels.\n  Yet some LIHEAP proponents might not realize that home heating oil, \nwhich the Northeast desperately needs, as you can see on this chart, is \na middle distillate along with diesel fuel. Therefore, according to the \nCongressional Research Service:\n\n       Because the residential and transportation sectors are in \n     potential competition for the same part of the barrel, any \n     unusual circumstances affecting the price and supply of one \n     of these fuels affects the supply and price of the other.\n\n  Increasing refining capacity not only lowers the price of motor fuels \nbut reduces the price of home heating oil as well.\n  Although States have a significant role in permitting existing or new \nrefineries, they face particular technical and financial constraints \nwhen faced with these extremely complex facilities. It wasn't long ago \nthat I authored the Gas Price Act, and it was one that never even made \nit out of my committee. Yet it would have dramatically reduced the cost \nof refining. Right now we are at 100-percent refining capacity in \nAmerica. Yet nothing is being done about it. Quite frankly, those \nindividuals who are feeling the heat the most, who are not getting the \nheat the most in the Northeast are the ones who objected to the Gas \nPrice Act.\n  This amendment does not have the same provisions as the Gas Price \nAct; it merely establishes a Governor opt-in program that requires the \nEPA Administrator to coordinate and concurrently review all permits \nwith the relevant State agencies. This program does not waive or weaken \nthe standards under any environmental law that seeks to assist States \nand consumers by providing greater certainty in the permitting process.\n  In fact, the Environmental Council of the States--an organization \nrepresenting the State environmental directors--stated in a letter of \nsupport for similar language that the language:\n\n       Does not weaken the standards and allows each State to \n     choose its best course.\n\n  This improved process does more than just increase the process for \nproduction of heating oil; it also redefines one's idea of a refinery. \nMy amendment provides Federal assistance to States for the permitting \nof ethanol plants or bio refineries, as well as facilities to produce \nultraclean diesel or jet fuel from coal.\n  Assisting the expansion of bio refineries and coal-to-liquids \nfacilities provides even more slack in the system that will lead to \nlower home heating oil prices in the future.\n  In its consumer guide, EIA points out that prices could even increase \nif there were disruptions to liquefied natural gas pipeline delivery \nsystems, two very real points, especially to my friends in the \nNortheast. Keep in mind that if you divide the country up into sectors, \nthe Northeast uses 31 percent--31 percent of the people residing in the \nNortheast use home heating oils, that in contrast with the Midwest, 3.2 \npercent; the South, 2.1 percent; and the West, 0.7 percent. That is a \nhuge disparity. They are the ones who are opposing the various things \nthat we can do to refine the home heating oils as well as diesel fuel.\n  Something has to be done. You can't say we want to have cheaper \nenergy, we want to have a LIHEAP program to make it more affordable for \npeople in the Northeast, and yet the legislators in the Northeast \noppose consistently any major changes in our refining capacity. As I \nsaid, we are already 100-percent refining capacity now, and that was \nbefore Katrina, I might add.\n  On the subject of liquefied LNG, I was astonished to learn that two \nmembers of the Massachusetts House delegation inserted a provision in \nthe transportation bill in the dark of the night--I know this, I was \nthe author of that bill--it happened in the middle of the night before \nit was taken up the next morning, to the detriment of the Northeast \nregion. They slipped in a provision that blocks the construction of an \nalready approved LNG terminal by maintaining an old bridge scheduled \nfor demolition because it has been classified as a navigational hazard. \nThis short-sighted stunt by a few Members means that the Northeast \nregion will be deprived of supply that would reduce wholesale natural \ngas prices by up to 20 percent--up to 20 percent. It was an LNG already \naccepted terminal in Massachusetts.\n  My amendment repeals that offensive provision so harmful to the \nentire Northeast. Bipartisan Members of this body, from the senior \nSenator from Maine to the senior Senator from New York, interested \nstakeholders from the AARP to the National Conference of Black Mayors, \nhave all expressed their concern over how high energy prices are \nhurting their constituents.\n  Members, voting for this amendment means you are voting to lower \nthose prices. A vote for this amendment means you are voting to help \nthe LIHEAP beneficiaries. This is something that makes so much common \nsense and something that is hard to understand here in Washington, DC. \nWe\n\n[[Page S1780]]\n\nhave to do something about increasing the supply of natural gas as well \nas home heating oils through the refining capacity as well as doing \nsomething to affect the supply.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Voinovich).

ERNEST FITZGERALD\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, a patriotic civil servant is going home. \nMr. A. Ernest Fitzgerald has finally called it quits. His 42-year \ncareer, including Navy service in World War II, came to a close on \nFriday, March 3. He has walked out of the Pentagon for the last time. \nHe has retired.\n  Although Mr. Fitzgerald's first name is Arthur, most of us know him \nfondly under the name of Ernie. Ernie is probably the most famous \nwhistleblower of all time, and I think of him as the father of all \nwhistleblowers, the chief whistleblower. He set an example for all of \nthe whistleblowers who have followed in his footsteps.\n  Ernie is a man of great courage and integrity.\n  I dreamed for a long time that someday some duly certified \nwhistleblower would be honored by a President, even this President, at \na Rose Garden ceremony. Ernie is a perfect candidate for such a Rose \nGarden ceremony, but I don't think that he is going to get that honor. \nIt may never happen. At least it may not happen in my lifetime. But of \ncourse I believe it should happen because that would be the right thing \nto do, to send a signal from the highest levels of Government all the \nway to the bowels of the bureaucracy that patriotic people who are \nwilling to blow the whistle on something that is wrong in Government \nwould be honored for being that patriotic person.\n  Courageous souls such as Ernie Fitzgerald make our Nation and our \nGovernment stronger and better. They help to strengthen and keep the \npublic trust. They help to make the Government transparent and \naccountable, and that is exactly what the citizens of this country want \nand what the citizens of this country ought to expect.\n  That is why we must always help whistleblowers such as Ernie \nFitzgerald. Being a whistleblower is a tough business. They need our \nconstant support and protection because within the bureaucracy they are \ntreated like a skunk at a picnic. Those, such as Ernie, who have \nstepped forward and put their careers and reputations on the line in \nthe defense of truth in Government deserve the highest honor.\n  Ernie did not make it to the Rose Garden, but he got pretty close. He \ngot the next best thing. He left the Pentagon with his dignity and \nhonor intact.\n  In a moment I want to explain how that happened. But first I wish to \nspeak briefly about what Ernie did because he was always a source of \ninspiration to this Senator. Early in my Senate career, I heard about \nErnie Fitzgerald. His work convinced me that I needed to get involved \nin oversight, generally, and at that time specifically oversight of the \nDefense Department, oversight of the Pentagon. Ernie's work, along with \nthat of a person by the name of Chuck Spinney, was a huge contribution. \nThey were the inspiration behind my historic amendment to freeze the \nDefense budget that was approved by the Senate in May of 1985. Ernie \nwas the inspiration behind my efforts to put the brakes on the spare \nparts overpricing.\n  Ernie was also the inspiration behind my efforts to expose and clean \nup the Department of Defense books of account and broken accounting \npractices. Ernie was the inspiration behind so many whistleblower \nprotection laws that are now on the books.\n  Ernie's unwavering devotion to saving the taxpayers' money has always \nbeen an inspiration to this Senator. Ernie never lost sight of this \nlofty and honorable goal, not for one second. And he would pursue it to \nthe end of the Earth, if that is where it took him. To Ernie, saving \nthe taxpayers' money was never just a goal. It was much more than that. \nIt was more like a calling to him. It was a matter of faith to him, \nkeeping faith with the taxpayers, stopping waste of taxpayers; money \nwas a religion to Ernie Fitzgerald.\n  Ernie had fellowship with the taxpayers.\n  He did everything in his power each day to ensure that not a penny \nwas wasted and every cent was properly accounted for.\n  Ernie followed his calling in a place called the Pentagon--not \nexactly what I would call a taxpayer-friendly environment. That is the \nplace that the world's most powerful generals and admirals call home. \nAnd the generals and admirals never looked kindly on the likes of a \nwhistleblower named Ernie Fitzgerald. But that didn't phase Ernie one \nbit.\n  The Pentagon brass is praising him today as he leaves the Pentagon \nfor good, but they hammered him relentlessly for what he was and for \nwhat he did. The Pentagon is the place where Ernie dug in his heels, \ntook his stand, and kept the faith.\n  The most fateful day in the life of Ernie Fitzgerald was November 13, \n1968. That was the day Erie appeared before Senator Proxmire's Joint \nEconomic Committee to testify on the C-5 transport aircraft program. He \nwas an official witness of the U.S. Air Force. And Ernie did the \nunthinkable--he ``committed truth.'' He told the Congress about a $12 \nbillion C-5 cost overrun. Back then, $2 billion was real money.\n  Ernie's truthful testimony about the C-5 cost overrun created a \nfirestorm of controversy, and that is what caused President Nixon to \nissue his famous order caught on those famous tapes. The quote was: \n``Get rid of that SOB.'' For speaking the truth, Ernie paid the \nultimate price: He got fired, he got blackballed, and he was put on the \nofficial hit list. His career was over. And that was November 13, 1968. \nFor speaking the truth--that is what it was all about, just speak the \ntruth--about a $2 billion cost overrun on an airplane that somehow \npeople wanted to cover up. As most of us know, though, Ernie got his \njob back, but it took him 12 years to get his job back. That is how \nmuch whistleblowers are appreciated in the bureaucracy at the Pentagon, \nor anyplace else. And when he did get it back, it was not given back \nwillingly; it had to be taken back. It took a court order signed by \nU.S. District Judge William B. Bryant on June 15, 1982. That is 14 \nyears after he appeared to talk about the C-5 $2 billion cost overrun.\n  Judge Bryant's order made Ernie the Management Systems Deputy of the \nAir Force. It was a high-sounding title with far-reaching \nresponsibilities. On paper, it looked like a perfect fit. \nUnfortunately, Ernie was never given the authority to perform the job \nspecified in the court order. The ``over-dogs,'' as Ernie Fitzgerald \ncalled them, effectively isolated him then and the 25 years since. As \nfar as I know, the only time Ernie was able to do his job was when he \nwas officially detailed to my staff for short periods of time.\n  The last such project was 1997-1998 when Ernie worked with my staff \non what we called the Joint Review of Internal Controls at the Defense \nDepartment. He and my staff examined several hundred invoices from an \noffice in the Pentagon where fraud had occurred. They followed those \ninvoices step by step through the entire cycle of transactions from \npurchase order to payment by the Treasury. They found overpayments, \nunderpayments, erroneous payments, and even potentially fraudulent \npayments. No one payment had been done correctly.\n  One of the biggest problems uncovered had to do with ``remit'' \naddresses. Remit addresses are so important because that is where the \nmoney goes. The staff found people who were handling invoices and \npaying bills also had authority to put addresses on checks going out \nthe door. That was a major violation of the separation-of-duties \nprinciple. It left the door wide open to fraud.\n  Ernie helped us close that door.\n  Despite constant bureaucratic roadblocks, Ernie went to his \ncubbyhole-\n\n[[Page S1781]]\n\nsize office day in and day out for all those 25 years. Each day, he did \nwhat he could to keep the faith and honor his commitment to those \ntaxpayers.\n  Then came another fateful day: September 12, last year. That was the \nday Judge Bryant, after 25 years, pulled the plug on Ernie's court \norder, precipitating another crisis in Ernie's life and bringing us to \nthis place in time.\n  I feel like we have arrived at a very important point in time. We \ndidn't make it to the Rose Garden this time, but we came pretty close. \nSo we are making progress. Maybe next time.\n  Earlier, I promised to explain how we came close to the Rose Garden. \nOn Monday, February 27, this year, the inspector general at the Defense \nDepartment presented our most famous whistleblower, Ernie Fitzgerald, \nwith the Distinguished Service Medal. I do not know if anything like \nthis has ever happened before. As I said a moment ago, Ernie is \nretiring with honor and dignity. One person has made all this happen: \nMr. Tom Gimble, acting inspector general at the Department of Defense. \nAfter Judge Bryant struck down Ernie's court order after those 25 \nyears, it was readily apparent that Ernie was in another tight spot. \nHowever, Ernie was willing to retire under the right conditions.\n\n  Tom Gimble, as acting inspector general, seized the initiative. He \ntook charge of the negotiations between Ernie and the Air Force. He \nkept them moving in the right direction. He did everything he could to \nensure that Ernie was treated fairly and given the full protection of \nthe law. Under his able leadership, those negotiations were brought to \na successful conclusion.\n  Mr. Gimble effectively brought Ernie in under the protective umbrella \nprovided by the Office of Inspector General. He gave Ernie a safe haven \nin the IG's building--a place to work. He had Ernie's entire collection \nof official records moved to that secure facility. With the help of a \nteam of document specialists provided by Mr. Gimble, Ernie was able to \nget the job done.\n  All of his records now have been shipped to the National Archives--\n400-plus boxes in all. In time, Ernie's papers will be open to the \nAmerican people. They will be able to judge Ernie's work for \nthemselves.\n  From the beginning of this process to the very end, all sorts of \nlittle kinks kept popping up all along the way. But Mr. Gimble was \nalways there ready to step in and help iron them out. Mr. Gimble is the \nfirst inspector general to personally reach out to Ernie and help him \nin such meaningful ways.\n  Mr. Gimble, I stand before all my colleagues and say thank you from \nthe bottom of my heart for what you did to help Ernie in these closing \ndays of his career--after 42 years working for the Federal Government. \nI thank you for doing what inspector generals should do. You did that.\n  And Ernie Fitzgerald, I thank you, too, for what you did and for your \ncourage and dedication to make our Government stronger and better and \nto help restore the public trust. I salute you as a person who more \nAmericans ought to follow, that one person determined to make a \ndifference can, in fact, make a difference.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, from the tender days of his youth growing \nup in Knoxville, Jack Hanna knew he was destined to work with animals. \nHis commitment seemingly knew no limits as he would eagerly climb \naboard public buses to nurture his budding interest by working at a \nlocal animal clinic for a meager $10 a week.\n  Yet back then, even he probably couldn't sense that his unique \npassion would one day blossom and inspire him to a career as an \nacclaimed author, television host and animal conservationist who would \ntouch the lives of millions.\n  After stops at Muskingum College and then Florida, it wouldn't be \nlong before the man now affectionately nicknamed ``Jungle Jack'' was \nserving as executive director of the Columbus Zoo in Ohio. When he \nfirst arrived, the zoo was in poor shape. Attendance sagged, and the \nanimal habitats were outmoded.\n  Yet over time, molded by his steady hand, the zoo was gradually \nrevitalized and restored. And with Hanna at the helm, the Columbus Zoo \ngrew into the world-class facility it is today.\n  He maintains a relentless travel schedule--wearing a beaten path to \nexotic locales all over the globe. But no matter whether he is visiting \nwith the bears and whales in the frigid arctic or the cheetahs in the \nlonesome wild of Africa, he remains fueled by a genuine love of animals \nand a deep passion for sharing the majesty of nature with children and \nadults in communities throughout the world.\n  No matter whether an animal prowls, stomps, slithers or crawls, Jack \nHanna craves the opportunity to share its unique importance with any \nand all who will listen. He is a fervent advocate for conservation, and \nhis efforts have broadened the horizons of untold millions of readers, \nlisteners and viewers.\n  While Jack Hanna is no stranger to big name stages--he is a regular \non mainstream media shows like ``Good Morning America'' and ``The Late \nShow with David Letterman''--it is not the fame or excitement that has \ndrawn him onto TV and into the homes of millions of Americans. Rather, \nit is the opportunity to educate people across the Nation about the \nmagic and wonder of the animal kingdom.\n  He rejects the notion of his celebrity, insisting he serves only as \nan ``ambassador for animals in the wild.''\n  Not surprisingly, Hanna's altruism extends far beyond animal \ninterests. He is passionate about addressing the needs of the human \ncondition as well. He has shown a true commitment to helping \ncommunities in some of the most impoverished and war-torn regions of \nthe world. During a recent taping in Rwanda, he reminded fans that ``if \nyou don't help the people first, you won't be able to help the animals, \neither.''\n  Just last December he made a point of halting his manic travel \nschedule to share his love of animals with patients at the Walter Reed \nMedical Center right here in suburban Washington, DC. His eager and \nyouthful style was a tremendous hit among the troops. The visit shared \nthe healing presence of animals and buoyed some of our Nation's finest \nmen and women's spirits.\n  The Knoxville News Sentinel aptly describes Jack as ``a whirlwind of \nactivity, always on the go.'' But looking beyond his busy exterior, it \nis clear to all that Jack Hanna is a man of deep humility and genuine \ncompassion.\n  His work has heightened appreciation for untold numbers of animal \nspecies from all regions of the world. And his efforts have enriched \nthe lives of humans and animals alike. He is a special individual and \nan embodiment of the Tennessee volunteer spirit.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/03/06/senate-section/article/S1781-4", "month": "03", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1781-S1782]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    NOMINATION OF JUDGE JACK ZOUHARY\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise today to speak in strong support of \nthe nomination of Judge Jack Zouhary, whom the President has nominated \nto be U.S. District Court Judge for the\n\n[[Page S1782]]\n\nNorthern District of Ohio. Judge Zouhary currently is serving on the \nLucas County Common Pleas Court. His service there has been outstanding \nand is an excellent indication of the type of judge he will be on the \nFederal bench.\n  I would like to share with my Senate colleagues just a few of the \nnumerous admirable qualities that make Judge Zouhary such an \noutstanding nominee. Both as a professional and as a person, he is \nexactly the sort of individual we want to be serving on the Federal \nbench.\n  Judge Zouhary grew up in Toledo. He is a first-generation American, \nwhose parents immigrated from Lebanon to the United States and \ninstilled in their son a respect for the values of education, religion, \nand community service. After graduating as the valedictorian of his \nhigh school, he attended Dartmouth College, where he received his \nundergraduate degree before returning to his hometown to earn his law \ndegree from the University of Toledo College of Law. Judge Zouhary then \nembarked on what would become a long and accomplished legal career--a \ncareer with 30 years of legal experience that has given him the \nbackground and understanding of our legal system to successfully take \non the role of a Federal judge.\n  He began his legal career with the law firm of Robison, Curphey & \nO'Connell, where he worked as an Associate and then as a Partner. \nDuring his 23 years there, he had a varied practice, representing \nindividuals and businesses on a range of legal issues, with an emphasis \non civil trial practice and corporate matters. In 2000, Judge Zouhary \nbecame the Senior Vice President and General Counsel for S.E. Johnson \nCompanies, Inc., a large highway contractor and asphalt producer.\n  In 2004, Judge Zouhary accepted a position as ``Of Counsel'' with the \nlaw firm of Fuller & Henry. He remained with Fuller & Henry until 2005, \nwhen Ohio Governor Bob Taft appointed him to the Lucas County Common \nPleas Court. In Ohio, the Common Pleas Court is the highest State trial \nbench and hears all major civil and criminal cases.\n  During his time as an attorney in private practice, Judge Zouhary \ndistinguished himself as an excellent litigator and was honored by \nbeing selected as a member of the prestigious American College of Trial \nLawyers. Membership in the American College of Trial Lawyers is by \ninvitation only and is limited to the best of the trial bar.\n  Judge Zouhary has long been committed to the ideals of civility and \nprofessionalism in the legal field. Friends and colleagues often \ndescribe him as ``a gentleman.'' I agree with that assessment. He is \nwell regarded for his honesty, his integrity, and his intelligence, and \nthose who have known and worked with him through the years speak warmly \nof his even-temper and cordial demeanor.\n  Not surprisingly, given his interest in preserving a less combative \napproach to the law, Judge Zouhary frequently has presented lectures \nfocusing on legal ethics and civility in the practice of law for \nContinuing Legal Education Seminars. His commitment to serving the \ncommunity as a professional also is exemplified by his membership in \nthe Toledo Rotary Club, as well as his participation in a broad array \nof other charitable activities, ranging from pro bono work for a local \nchurch to service at a community soup kitchen.\n  Judge Zouhary has certainly distinguished himself on the bench. He \nhas worked diligently to clear a very large backlog of cases from his \ncrowded docket and has made a good deal of headway in that effort. Most \nimportant, attorneys who have appeared before him--criminal and civil, \nprosecution and defense--speak in glowing terms of his talent, \nfairness, and excellent judicial temperament.\n  With Judge Zouhary's impressive record as a legal professional and \ncommunity leader, it should come as no surprise that the American Bar \nAssociation was unanimous in giving him its highest rating of ``well-\nqualified.'' Judge Zouhary is in every way an outstanding nominee, who \nwill serve the people of Ohio and of this country well.\n  Mr. President, I strongly support the nomination of Judge Jack \nZouhary as a Federal District Court Judge for the Northern District of \nOhio.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the Floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/03/06/senate-section/article/S1782-1", "month": "03", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1782-S1783]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                   marine corporal andre l. williams\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a fellow \nOhioan--an honorable young man who lost his life while protecting the \nfreedom of others. Marine CPL Andre L. Williams died on July 28, 2005, \nwhen his convoy came under attack with small arms fire from enemy \nforces in Western Iraq. He was 23 years old.\n  Mr. President, Corporal Williams was a brave Marine from the \nColumbus-based Reserves' Lima Company, 3rd Battalion, 25th Regiment \nunit. Born on August 9, 1981, in Galloway, OH, Andre--fondly referred \nto as ``Dray'' by his friends and family--lit up the lives of his \nfamily and friends with his shining smile. As his older sister Robyn \nWilliams recalled, ``His smile was angelic. There's no other way to \ndescribe it.''\n  Andre was friendly, level-headed, and sensitive to those around him. \nHe was always willing to help resolve disputes between the people he \ncared about. According to his friend Harry Cuccio, ``It didn't matter \nwhat kind of mood you were in, if he was smiling you were smiling.'' \nMany people described Andre as having infectious optimism. His mother, \nMary, recalled that her son ``loved to make other people laugh and make \nthem feel good.'' She also said that ``if there was anything he could \ndo to make someone's life better, that's what he would do.''\n  Mr. President, Andre Williams was an ambitious and determined young \nman, with a talent for drawing and a love for OSU football and the \nCincinnati Bengals. Graduating from Westland High School in 1999, he \nhoped to attend college after his service in Iraq, and one day open his \nown successful night club.\n  Andre's brave spirit and unwavering patriotism compelled him to join \nthe Marines after the September 11 terrorist attacks. He felt a strong \nduty to protect his country and his family--especially his young \ndaughter, Lea Lea, and young son Dominique Juan.\n  Andre was loved by his family and by many close friends, evidenced by \nthe over 300 people who attended his funeral service. It was standing \nroom only. As Andre's father, Robert, remarked, ``Seeing how many \npeople he touched [was] unbelievable.'' At the emotional ceremony, \nAndre's mother said that Andre was [her] hero before he ever joined the \nMarines, and now, he's the world's hero.\n  Andre's parents have two other sons in the military--Army SGT Robert \nLeslie and Air Force Technician SGT Robert Williams. Both were able to \ncome to their brother's funeral. Two of Andre's other brothers, Kevin \nand Joshua, chose to wear Andre's dog tags instead of neckties.\n  One of Andre's best friends with whom he served in Iraq was Sergeant \nJustin F. Hoffman, who was among 10 Ohio Marines killed just 3 days \nbefore Andre's funeral. Justin had hoped to fly home and pay his \nrespects to his close friend, but 5 days after Andre's death, Justin \nalso lost his life. Robert Hoffman, Justin's father, attended Andre's \nfuneral in his son's absence--a promise he made to Justin, just in case \nhe wasn't able to return home for the services.\n  Another good friend, Ron Cunningham, expressed his appreciation for \nAndre's friendship. This is what he had to say:\n\n       I would like to give thanks for Dray being such a good \n     friend to me and to so many other people. He was a great \n     person, and I am glad that he was a part of my life. He was \n     very close to me, my family, and to my cousin who served with \n     him in Iraq. You're a true hero my friend. It hurts that \n     you're gone, but I know you're in a good place and don't \n     worry, I'll see you again.\n\n  Teresa Norris, mother of one of Andre's best friends, Gary Norris, \nand his proclaimed ``second mother,'' offered thanks for Andre's heroic \nactions and reminisced about the special times they used to spend \ntogether. She has this to say:\n\n       Dray, you are a true Hero, and will always be my Hero. How \n     I will miss that beautiful smile, and our long talks. You \n     will never be forgotten, honey. I am honored to have been a \n     part of your life, and will keep you a part of mine forever. \n     We love you and always will.\n\n  Mr. President, I would like to conclude my remarks with a poem that \nwas posted on an Internet website in\n\n[[Page S1783]]\n\ntribute to Andre. It is written by Tinisha Tolber of Galloway, OH:\n\n     Though fallen, you are not forgotten.\n     Remembered . . .\n     In every American flag across the Nation.\n     In every tear that your battle brothers cry.\n     And, although freedom is supposed to be free, you have paid \n           the ultimate price for the people like me.\n     The government rewards you with a flag and a Purple Heart, \n           but we pray for your families that have been torn \n           apart.\n     Rest in peace, Dray, knowing you are remembered always.\n\n  Mr. President, Andre leaves behind a loving family to cherish his \nmemory: parents Mary and Robert; siblings Josh, Kevin, Rob, Robert, \nBrian, Robyn, and Roshonda; ex-wife Kirsten and children, Lea Lea and \nDominique Juan. My wife Fran and I continue to keep them in our \nthoughts and prayers.\n\n\n                 Marine Lance Corporal Nicholas B. Erdy\n\n  Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a valiant, young, \nWilliamsburg, OH, Marine named LCpl Nicholas B. Erdy, who was killed in \nIraq on May 11, 2005. He was 21 years old.\n  A 2002 graduate of McNicholas High School, Nicholas--Nick to family \nand friends--was dearly loved by all who knew him. They say that Nick \nwas special--that he was courageous, that he never complained, and that \nhe had a knack for making his friends and family laugh. He also just \nloved being a Marine.\n  Nick's father, Bill, says that his son used to help him with his \nlandscaping business, with talk of possibly working there full-time \nwhen he was older. But, after high school graduation, it was clear \nexactly what Nick wanted to do. He wanted to become a Marine.\n  A movie buff who loved his ``muscle'' car, Nick had always wanted to \nbe in the military. He built forts as a child and read books on weapons \nand war strategies. His high school football coach, John Rodenberg, \nsaid that ``Nick was a great kid, really focused on everything he was \ndoing. . . . He [always] had a plan. He knew he wanted to go into the \narmed forces. He was focused on serving his country.''\n  Indeed, Nick was unfalteringly devoted to the Marines and to our \ncountry. Even his favorite holiday, not surprisingly, was the Fourth of \nJuly. Nick joined the Marines after graduation in 2002 and was in Iraq \nby March 2005.\n  He was killed on May 11, 2005, when his armored vehicle hit a land \nmine.\n  After Nick's death, family friend and former football coach, Patrick \nMcCracken, reminisced about Nick, whom he first met when Nick was, as \nhe put it, a ``spindly-legged, somewhat awkward'' seventh-grade \nfootball player with the Titans football team. During one game, the \nTitans were losing 46-to-0 at halftime when Coach McCracken decided to \nput Nick in the game and see if he could turn things around.\n  He said Nick was calm, in control, and flawless. ``I'd stare straight \ninto his eyes . . . expecting perfection out of a seventh-grade, \neighth-grade kid--and I got it.''\n  On an Internet tribute website for Nick, Coach McCracken wrote a \nheartfelt letter to him shortly after Nick was killed. This is what he \nwrote:\n\n       Dear Nick:\n       We have started football. I think of you every day. . . . \n     You make me so proud. I need to find some quarterback who \n     knows all my crazy signals like you did. I think we may have \n     a couple. These new Titans are great kids, just like you. You \n     are always in my heart. I promise to help take care of your \n     mom, dad, Erin, Ashley, and other family members when they \n     need it. I wish I was half the Marine you and the other guys \n     are.\n       We owe so much to you guys. We will stay strong for you. \n     What is a Titan? He is a Marine--he is Nick Erdy. I love you, \n     Semper Fi.\n\n  Mr. President, when Nick's body was brought home, the funeral \nprocession--stretching two dozen vehicles long--passed under an arch \nformed by two ladder trucks from the Miami Township and Goshen fire \ndepartments. As the hearse rolled by, hundreds of people clapped and \nwaved American flags. Elizabeth Hoskins, of Milford, was holding a \nhomemade sign that read simply, ``Nick's Our Hero.''\n  Andrew Clements watched the funeral procession, as well. Though he \nnever met Nick, he was touched by him and had this to say:\n\n       I never had the privilege of meeting Nick, but over the \n     past few days I feel like I have. He's simply a hero to \n     everyone. I stood outside McNicholas High School while Nick's \n     funeral was happening. The faces on the people said it all. \n     Nick Erdy will never be forgotten.\n\n  Father Pat Crone of St. Xavier Catholic Church described well Nick's \nselfless nature and how his life made a difference to so many in so \nmany ways. This is what he said:\n\n       Nick is a blessing. We can celebrate this life, because it \n     so important--because Nick was doing things so important. \n     Freedom is important. A young man, who could have stayed back \n     here with all the blessings of this country, decided to go \n     and spread those blessings to those less gifted and lucky \n     than us.\n\n  A resolution by the Ohio House of Representatives aptly tells us \nabout Nick's life by stating:\n\n       It is certain the world is a better place, his having been \n     in it.\n\n  Without question, the world is a better place for Nicholas Erdy \nhaving been in it. Nick was the model of what we all hope our children \nwill become. He was a young man with a sparking personality, a \nwonderful sense of humor, a compassion for others, and a dedication to \nhis country.\n  A friend named Martin wrote the following in tribute to Nick and \nDustin Derga, a fellow Ohio marine and friend of both, who was killed \nin Iraq three days before Nick:\n\n       Derga and Erdy were the first guys I got to know when I \n     joined the unit. They were all about having fun and enjoying \n     life. Even in Iraq they seemed to make the worst situations \n     turn into great ones. Their character is what made our \n     platoon what it was. We were full of jokes, laughter, and \n     memorable experiences. 1st platoon will never be the same \n     without them and the others we lost. They were great guys, \n     and they will be remembered in our hearts forever.\n\n  Nick was very proud of what they were doing overseas. However, his \nzeal for the military was tempered by his desire to be home to start a \nfamily with his fiancee and high-school sweetheart Ashley Boots. On \nDecember 29, 2004, a week before his unit left Columbus for training in \nCalifornia, Nick proposed to Ashley. They made plans to wed this past \nNovember, sometime after Nick's expected return.\n  Another plan following Nick's return was to go to Disney World with \nAshley, fellow Marine Dustin Derga, and Dustin's girlfriend Kristin. In \nanticipation of the vacation, they had flipped through brochures and \neven watched a promotional Disney DVD. Back home in Ohio, their \ngirlfriends couldn't wait for the trip. Ashley said that they just \nwanted to go someplace fun and relax. Tragically, these plans were \nnever realized.\n  Dustin's girlfriend Kristin wrote the following to Nick:\n\n       Hey buddy . . . I miss you. . . . I wish that I could be \n     greeting you on Thursday so you, Ash, Dustin, and I could go \n     to Disney. . . . It would have been so great . . . but you \n     did your job. . . . You got your friends home safely and laid \n     to rest as a hero. . . . You are a hero Nicholas Erdy--and we \n     love and miss you every day. . . . You just better make sure \n     Dustin is being good up there!\n\n  Yes, Mr. President, Nick Erdy and Dustin Derga are certainly both \nAmerican heroes.\n  My wife Fran and I continue to keep Nick's parents Jane and Bill, his \nsister Erin, his fiancee Ashley, and the rest of his family in our \nthoughts and in our prayers.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/03/06/senate-section/article/S1783-1", "month": "03", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1783-S1784]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   THREE DECADES OF WATER LEADERSHIP\n\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, today is a significant day in the \nagriculture industry in southeast Idaho. Effective and judicious water \nmanagement is critical to communities in Idaho. Allocation of this \nscarce resource, particularly in the extended drought over much of the \nlast decade, requires a vision of the future, application of valuable \nexperience and lessons learned in the past, and an appreciation of the \nwide spectrum of water users. Today, Ron Carlson, Snake River \nWatermaster of District No. 1, is retiring after over 30 years of \nservice to southeast Idaho.\n  Ron revolutionized irrigated agriculture in Idaho, bringing it into \nthe 20th century with the introduction of computerized accounting and \ndata collection in 1978 and the creation of the Water Bank, a formal \nwater renting process. Ron ushered in technological advances into \nirrigated agriculture that gave water administrators the capability to \ncreate a model of river flows and reservoir capacity that compares \nbaselines of yearly conditions. This system allowed for unprecedented \nriver management and water supply projections for the Snake River \nsystem in Idaho. Ron's extensive knowledge and wisdom has helped \nmaintain a critical balance between the multiple demands on this system \nby all legitimate\n\n[[Page S1784]]\n\nwater users, from tribes to the State to local entities.\n  Ron not only has dedicated his life to managing critical natural \nresources in southeast Idaho, he has also carried on the tradition of \nhis parents in reaching out caring arms to disadvantaged youth. It is \nthis calling that he intends to pursue in retirement, managing the \nPearl House Project in Idaho Falls, a full-service residential youth \ncenter for children in crisis. I am certain that his vast management \nknowledge gained from years as watermaster will serve him well in this \nendeavor. I congratulate Ron and his family on his retirement and wish \nhim well. Idaho's agriculture community's loss is the youth of \nsoutheastern Idaho's gain.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/03/06/senate-section/article/S1784-1", "month": "03", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1784]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         WOMEN'S HISTORY MONTH\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, as Dean of the Senate Women, I rise on \nthis day in Women's History Month to honor the unique contributions \nwomen have made to America since its beginning and to pay my respects \nto all the forgotten women who have served this country. Women's roles \nin history are often overlooked and undervalued. But we have shaped, \nand continue to shape, society--not only in terms of battles fought and \nwon--but through great social movements.\n  Women were the driving force behind the abolitionists, who helped end \nslavery and fought for the fourteenth amendment. And, of course, women \nled the suffragist movement, which sought to curb domestic violence by \nending drinking and gave women control of their lives with the right to \nvote. The list goes on and on--and it is still growing.\n  Last month, we said goodbye to a true pioneer for women's rights--\nBetty Friedan. Ms. Friedan opened Americans' minds to the possibility \nof a new role for women in our country with her book, ``The Feminine \nMystique.'' She provided the spark in 1963 to launch another movement \nfor women's rights. And she kept that fire going--dedicating her life \nto fighting for equality, founding the National Organization for Women \nand NARAL, and cofounding the National Women's Political Caucus with \nGloria Steinem and myself.\n  Last month, Maryland and the world also said hello to another female \nstar in her own right--Kimmie Meissner of Bel Air, MD, who took sixth \nplace in Olympic women's figure skating. Every March, we point to those \nwomen who have come before us and who have paved the way for current \nadvances, but it is only right and proper that we also salute the ones \nwho are making history as we speak and inspiring other young women to \nfollow their dreams. This year, we salute Kimmie Meissner and the honor \nshe brought Maryland and our great Nation with her talent, skills and \nsportsmanship.\n  The passion that inspired both of these women is the same that helped \nme to realize my own dreams--giving me the courage to break the glass \nceiling as a social worker, a Baltimore City councilwoman, a U.S. \nCongresswoman and now as a U.S. Senator. That is why I sponsored \nlegislation as a Congresswoman in 1981 to establish a Women's History \nWeek and then in the Senate to expand the observance into Women's \nHistory Month in 1987.\n  As the first Democratic woman elected to the Senate in her own right \nin 1986, I have seen the Senate women grow to the nine Democratic women \nSenators and 14 total women we have now. Today, I am Dean of the Senate \nWomen--welcoming and guiding women Senators when they first take office \nand building coalitions to get things done once they are here.\n  Together, we have been working to add to the legacy of women's \nhistory, and every year during this month we are especially reminded of \nour ongoing fight for equality. Since 1992, women Senators have tripled \nfunding for domestic violence shelters, increased funding for child \ncare by 68 percent and small business lending to women by 86 percent. \nAnd we have passed such important legislation as the Family and Medical \nLeave Act, the Violence Against Women Act, and the Breast Cancer \nResearch Stamp Act.\n  One of the issues that has been most important to me is women's \nhealth. When I first came to the Senate, women's health wasn't a \nnational priority. But since then I have helped to establish an Office \nof Research on Women's Health at the National Institutes of Health, to \nincrease women's involvement in clinical drug trials, and to increase \nfunding for breast cancer research by 700 percent since 1992. I will \ncontinue to fight to make sure that women's health remains a priority \nin the Federal checkbook and that women are not left behind when it \ncomes to their survival.\n  This year in the Senate I have also been fighting to save American \nworkers' pensions. Women are more likely to have either lower pensions \nthan men or no private pension at all. That is why it is so important \nto make sure their retirement is secure. And that is why I fought with \nmy colleagues to improve retirement security for women by ensuring \nbetter survivor benefits and better rights for divorced women in the \nnew pension legislation.\n  Because women are less likely to have these private pensions, make \nless money than men on average, and are more likely to work fewer years \nthan men due to family responsibilities, Social Security is also of \nparticular importance to us. Last year, I successfully fought to \nprotect Social Security from privatization so that women and all people \nare guaranteed lifetime, inflation-proof Social Security. I truly \nbelieve that privatization of Social Security would have been a bad \ndeal for women and would have increased poverty among them. Whether \nmothers are at home raising children or in the workplace, Social \nSecurity must remain a guaranteed benefit, not a guaranteed gamble. \nThat is why I will continue to stand sentry to keep the `security' in \nSocial Security.\n  And I will continue fighting to close the wage gap between men and \nwomen. Women make this country run--we are business leaders, \nentrepreneurs, politicians, mothers and more. But even in 2006, women \nwho work full-time year round earn only 76 cents for every $1 their \nmale counterpart makes.\n  There are many terrific accomplishments we have made and are \ncontinuing to make in the ongoing struggle for women's equality. I am \nso proud of the women who I serve with in the Senate and the work that \nwe do, but I am reminded, especially during this month, that we can do \nmore. Betty Friedan, Kimmie Meissner, and millions of women past and \npresent serve as models for unwavering advocates for equality, justice, \nwomen and positive change. So during this Women's History Month I not \nonly honor their courage and hard work, I vow to carry on their legacy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/03/06/senate-section/article/S1784-2", "month": "03", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1784]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                           A PROUD TRADITION\n\n Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I would like to recognize two \noutstanding young Idahoans who are here this week, getting a little \ntaste of what it is like to work in and around the U.S. Senate. In the \ntop 1 percent of Idaho students, Kortnee Hurless and Tenaya Pina, both \nfrom Camas County High School, were selected to participate in the U.S. \nSenate Youth Program this week. Kortnee and Tenaya have been able to \nattend policy addresses by Members of this body as well as Cabinet \nmembers, officials from the Department of Defense, directors of various \nFederal agencies, and will meet with a Justice of the Supreme Court.\n  Kortnee and Tenaya were selected for this program because they have \ndemonstrated superior achievement and leadership at school and in their \ncommunity. Idaho is very proud of these young women. Vision, purpose, \ncommitment to challenging goals such as Tenaya and Kortnee have shown \ndo not typically remain hidden in the background. I wouldn't be \nsurprised to hear their names in leadership roles in the not too \ndistant future. Past graduates of this 44-year program include my \ncolleague, the distinguished Senator Susan Collins from Maine, \nPresidential advisers, and former Lieutenant Governor of Idaho, David \nLeRoy. Tenaya and Courtney carry on a fine tradition of Idaho's \ninvolvement in the leadership of our country at the high school level. \nI congratulate them on this tremendous achievement. They are shining \nexamples of the abilities and promise of Idaho's youth.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/03/06/senate-section/article/S1785-1", "month": "03", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1785]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S1785]]\n               RECOGNITION OF THE MORMON TABERNACLE CHOIR\n\n Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize and pay \ntribute to the Mormon Tabernacle Choir in recognition of their 4,000th \nbroadcast of ``Music and the Spoken Word.'' This is the longest \ncontinuous broadcast on network radio and television in the history of \nour country.\n  ``Music and the Spoken Word'' first aired on July 15, 1929, using a \nsingle microphone for the organ, choir, and announcer. The first signal \nwas given to the announcer and he began: ``From the crossroads of the \nWest, we welcome you to a program of inspirational music and spoken \nword.'' Now more than 75 years and 4,000 broadcasts later, those same \nwords are spoken each week to start the broadcast on more than 2,000 \nradio and television stations and cable systems.\n  ``Music and the Spoken Word'' is the hallmark program of a choir that \nhad very humble beginnings. The choir first began practicing and \nperforming in an adobe building. It was accompanied by an organ that \nwas shipped from Australia to California and then pulled by 12 mules \nacross rugged terrain to Salt Lake City. This choir has definitely come \na long way.\n  The list of accomplishments and honors the choir has accumulated is \nlegendary and well deserving including Grammy and Emmy Awards, five \ngold records and two platinum records, induction into the National \nAssociation of Broadcasters Hall of Fame, two Freedom Foundation \nAwards, and the National Medal of Arts. In addition, the choir has \nperformed in 28 countries and 71 foreign cities for millions of people.\n  The choir is truly ``America's choir'' as so aptly described by \nPresident Ronald Reagan. Members have sung for every President of the \nUnited States beginning with President William Howard Taft. The choir \nhas also performed at several Presidential inaugurations, including \nthat of our current President George W. Bush, and in arenas and concert \nhalls throughout America. The choir first made history when it \nparticipated in an experiment with Dr. Harvey Fletcher of Bell \nTelephone Laboratories in the first recording of his newly developed \nstereophonic, or multiple-track process. This was later demonstrated in \n1940 at Carnegie Hall.\n  The Mormon Tabernacle Choir is comprised of 360 singers who are \naccompanied by an orchestra of 110 musicians--all volunteers. Choir \nmembers come from all walks of life and range in age from 25 to 60. \nThey practice and perform weekly, and all share a love for music, \nfaith, and service. The perfect blending of magical voices with the \naccompaniment of supremely talented musicians has provided inspiration \nand solace to millions and left a lasting imprint on souls throughout \nthe globe. Choir members willingly give of their time and talents each \nweek to brighten the lives of others.\n  Perhaps the most popular and requested song of the choir is its \nrendition of ``The Battle Hymn of the Republic.'' The choir first \nrecorded this in 1959 with the Philadelphia Orchestra and received a \nGrammy Award for its performance. You cannot listen to the choir sing \nthis powerful song without feeling to the depth of your soul its \nmajesty and power. It has stirred feelings of patriotism and love for \nAmerica among audience members in every corner of our nation.\n  As you can see, the Mormon Tabernacle Choir is an extraordinary \norganization. Its members are wonderful Americans who voluntarily share \ntheir talents for the betterment of our society. Sir Thomas Beecham \nonce said, ``Great music is that which penetrates the ear with facility \nand leaves the memory with difficulty. Magical music never leaves the \nmemory.'' I truly believe this choir has been creating magical music \nthat will leave a lasting imprint on the fabric of America forever. I \ncongratulate all of the staff, directors, and members of the Mormon \nTabernacle Choir once again on their 4,000th broadcast and wish them \ncontinued success and majesty for many more years. May God bless the \nMormon Tabernacle Choir.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/03/06/senate-section/article/S1785-2", "month": "03", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1785]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    ON THE 125TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE FOUNDING OF SOUTH DAKOTA STATE \n                               UNIVERSITY\n\n Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise today to celebrate the \n125th anniversary of the founding of South Dakota State University. In \na society where education is an essential asset, SDSU has been \nproviding students with a high-quality, affordable education for \ngenerations. Graduates have gone on to be extraordinary community and \nprofessional leaders.\n  Founded in 1881 in Brookings, SDSU is South Dakota's only land grant \nuniversity, and enrollment has now grown to more than 11,000 students. \nCharged with advancing agricultural and biological sciences, SDSU has \nconstructed six biodiverse experiment stations, 14 interactive \ntechnology centers throughout the State, and extension specialists and \neducators in all 66 counties. SDSU is on the cutting edge of research \nin such important fields as agriculture, children's health, ethanol, \nand other renewable fuel sources.\n  SDSU is driven by a core of dedicated professionals. More than 70 \npercent of the instructors have doctorate or terminal degrees, and nine \nout of ten classes are taught by full-time professors. There are nearly \n200 student clubs and organizations active on campus. In the sporting \narena, SDSU recently made the jump to Division I athletics, competing \nwith nationally recognized sports programs. Additionally, SDSU was the \nfirst university in the region to offer $4,000 over 4 years to any \nfirst-time student who scored 24 or higher on the ACT; this scholarship \nwas termed the ``Jackrabbit Guarantee.''\n  In the arts, agriculture, sciences, and a score of other areas, SDSU \nis at the forefront of academic and cultural achievement. For 125 \nyears, the university has helped students realize their potential \nthrough quality education and a positive social environment. SDSU \nstudents are equipped to succeed in a competitive world, delivering \ncountless benefits to organizations and communities close to home and \naround the globe. With alumni as accomplished and varied as former \nSenate Majority Leader Tom Daschle to New England Patriots field goal \nkicker Adam Vinatieri, SDSU continues to live up to its motto: ``You \ncan go anywhere from here!''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/03/06/senate-section/article/S1785-3", "month": "03", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1785-S1786]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 CONGRATULATIONS TO MICHIGAN OLYMPIANS\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I take this opportunity to \ncongratulate all of the athletes who competed in the 2006 Winter \nOlympic games in Torino, Italy. The Olympics provides an opportunity \nfor athletes from many different disciplines and from around the world \nto display their skill and determination on a world stage. It was truly \ngratifying to see so many athletes from across the globe come together \nin peaceful competition.\n  Throughout the Olympics and in the many years leading up to the \ngames, athletes must make many personal sacrifices and embody the \nattributes of perseverance, hard work, and determination in pursuit of \npersonal goals and Olympic medals. Michigan was represented by a strong \ngroup of athletes competing in seven different sports, winning five \nmedals for the United States, including one Gold, two Silvers and two \nBronze Medals. The accomplishments of these men and women are \nimpressive and an inspiration for all of us. I am extremely proud of \nthe men and women with ties to Michigan who competed in the 2006 Winter \nOlympics in Torino.\n  Michigan continued its long tradition of sending world-class athletes \nto the Winter Olympic games by sending more than three dozen athletes \nwith ties to Michigan, many of whom benefited from spending time at the \nOlympic Education Center, OEC, at Northern Michigan University, NMU, in \nMarquette. The OEC, which currently trains athletes in boxing, short \ntrack speed skating, greco-roman wrestling, and weightlifting, has been \nan integral part of the success of many athletes since its inception in \n1985. This year, 28 athletes who utilized these facilities represented \nthe United States in these games.\n  One of the games' most memorable and historic moments was provided by \nNorthern Michigan University speed skater Shani Davis, who earned the \ndistinction of being the first African American to medal in an \nindividual Winter Olympic event when he secured Gold in the 1,000 meter \nand Silver in the 1,500 meter. Continuing our strong\n\n[[Page S1786]]\n\nspeed-skating tradition, Alex Izykowski and fellow USOEC athletes J.P. \nKepka, Apolo Anton Ohno, and Rusty Smith won the Bronze Medal in the \n5,000 meter relay. Also representing the United States on the speed-\nskating track were Kip Carpenter and Anthony Lobello in the 500 meters \nand Kimberly Derrick in the 3,000 meter relay and the 1,000 meter. \nDerrick competed courageously in the 1000 meter after losing her \ngrandfather the day before that event.\n  Tanith Belbin and Ben Agosto provided an especially gratifying moment \nin securing the first medal in ice dancing for the United States since \n1976. Belbin and Agosto, skating in their first Olympics, won the \nhighest medal the United States has ever received in ice dancing. Jamie \nSilverstein and Ryan O'Meara also represented the United States with \ngrace and an abundance of pride. Training in Michigan at the same rink \nas Belbin, Agosto, Silverstein, and O'Meara were Canadian ice dance \npair Megan Wing and Aaron Lowe. The U.S. pairs skating team of Marcy \nHinzmann and Aaron Parchem from Bloomfield Hills demonstrated the skill \nand talent necessary to compete in this challenging sport.\n  The U.S. cross-country ski team included four Northern Michigan \nUniversity alumni. First-time Olympians Chris Cook, Abby Larson, \nLindsey Weier, and Lindsay Williams each took on the challenge of \nmultiple events in one of the most grueling disciplines in the Winter \nOlympics. The Luge and Bobsled teams were led by Olympic veterans from \nMichigan. Waterford native Jean Prahm competed as the driver for the \nbobsled with partner Vonetta Flowers. Four-time Olympian and two-time \nmedalist Mark Grimmette competed in the doubles luge.\n  The U.S. women's hockey team won the Bronze Medal by defeating \nFinland by a score of 4 to 0. Angela Ruggiero, a three time Olympian \nfrom Harper Woods, played in all five games as a defensemen, scoring \ntwo goals and tallying four assists to help the U.S. win the Bronze.\n  In men's hockey, Team U.S.A. was represented by Chris Chelios and \nMathieu Schneider of the Detroit Redwings and by several other U.S. \nplayers with ties to Michigan, including John-Michael Liles, Derian \nHatcher, Mike Knuble, Mike Modano, Brian Rafalski, Doug Weight, and \nBrian Rolston. Nine other Detroit Redwings participated in the Olympic \ngames representing their home countries. Thomas Holmstom, Niklas \nKronwall, Nicklas Lidstrom, Stefan Liv, Mikael Samuelsson, and Henrik \nZetterberg provided the nucleus of the Sweden team that won the Gold. \nRobert Lang assisted the Czech Republic team to a Bronze Medal finish. \nIn addition, Pavel Datsyuk represented Russia, and Kris Draper \nrepresented Canada.\n  I know I speak for all Michiganians in expressing appreciation and \ncongratulations to all of the Michigan athletes, coaches, and \nadministrators who took part in the 2006 Winter Olympic games. The \ngames last a few short weeks, but the memories will be ingrained in the \nminds of all who saw them and shared vicariously in the efforts of \nthese great athletes. For their commitment, drive, and competitive \nspirit, I congratulate all the athletes of the 2006 Olympic games, but \nit is with particular pride that I salute the athletes from \nMichigan.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/03/06/senate-section/article/S1786-1", "month": "03", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1786-S1787]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           TRIBUTE TO OFFICERS FIGHTING AGAINST METH EPIDEMIC\n\n\n                       Captain Thomas M.

In the past 4 years alone, the \ntask force has accounted for the seizure of over 300,000 cold tablets \nthat were undoubtedly going to be used in the manufacture of \nmethamphetamine. These cases have led to nearly a thousand arrests and \nhundreds of State and Federal cases. The members of the task force work \ndaily to identify meth cooks as they shop at hundreds of stores \nthroughout St. Louis County for common household items used to \nmanufacture meth. Because of their dedication, these officers have been \nable to locate hundreds of clandestine labs in Missouri and Illinois.\n  Mr. President, the efforts of Captain Jackson and Sergeant Murley \nhave been essential in fighting the proliferation of methamphetamine in \nMissouri and throughout the United States.

Mr. President, I wish to honor and celebrate the \naccomplishments and service of an outstanding civic organization, the \nRocky Flats Coalition of Local Governments. Having accomplished its \ntask of working with Federal and State officials to transform Rocky \nFlats from a nuclear weapons facility to a wildlife refuge, the \ncoalition will cease to exist on March 6, 2006. It is fitting that we \npause to reflect on and to learn from the record of service and success \nof the governments and people of this coalition.\n  The Rocky Flats Coalition of Local Governments was established in \nFebruary 1999 by agreement of the seven local governments that \nneighbored the Rocky Flats nuclear production site in central \nColorado--Boulder County, Jefferson County, the city and county of \nBroomfield, the city of Arvada, the city of Boulder, the city of \nWestminster, and the town of Superior. The coalition was formed to \nserve as the representative of these local communities and to advise \nthe State and Federal governments in the cleanup and closure of Rocky \nFlats and the future use of the site.\n  Since its inception, the coalition has provided an effective vehicle \nfor communities to work together on issues such as workforce safety, \noutreach, and advocacy, as well as future use and long-term stewardship \nof the site. The Rocky Flats Coalition of Local Governments created a \nforum for governments and elected officials to come together to \nproactively discuss and address extremely complex issues and \ncontributed to a rapid, successful, and cost effective resolution. The \nRocky Flats Coalition of Local Governments has shown us by example what \ncan be accomplished through effective advocacy expressed in a spirit of \ncooperation.\n  As Colorado's attorney general, I worked closely with the coalition \nto refine cleanup standards to better match community interests. \nTogether, we developed strategies to address long-term management needs \nof Rocky Flats, issues concerning mineral rights, and other concerns \ncentral to the protection of Rocky Flats as an asset for future \ngenerations. The coalition also worked with Senator Allard and \nCongressman Udall in developing and securing the passage of The Rocky \nFlats National Wildlife Refuge Act of 2001, one of their most \nsignificant achievements, and a milestone in the history of the Rocky \nFlats cleanup.\n  I rise today not only to recognize the Rocky Flats Coalition of Local \nGovernments but also to celebrate the successful completion of its work \nand to acknowledge the significance of the coalition's accomplishments \nto the State of Colorado and to the Nation. The site has come a long \nway since the closure of the weapons plant that once stood there. After \nyears of cleanup, hazardous material disposal, and rehabilitation, the \nRocky Flats nuclear weapons facility is well on its way to becoming the \nRocky Flats National Wildlife Refuge.\n\n[[Page S1788]]\n\n  The dissolution of this coalition coincides with the completion of \nthe physical cleanup and the beginning of the process to transfer \noversight over much of the site from the Department of Energy to the \nU.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. As the focus of efforts shifts from \ncleanup to future management, the members of the coalition now join \nwith other local governments, organizations, and individual \nrepresentatives to form the Rocky Flats Stewardship Council, which will \ncontinue local oversight of postclosure plans for the site. The \nStewardship Council will facilitate ongoing discussion between Federal \nand local officials and will ensure that the best interests of Colorado \ncitizens will be served as Rocky Flats makes its transition to wildlife \nrefuge.\n  For their devoted advocacy of the interests of fellow citizens, for \nthe work they have done to ensure the safe and thorough cleanup of the \nRocky Flats weapons facility, for the example that they have given us \nof what can be accomplished when governments work together, and for the \ntremendous success they have helped to achieve at Rocky Flats, I offer \nmy sincere thanks and congratulations to the members of the Rocky Flats \nCoalition of Local Governments.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/03/06/senate-section/article/S1788-1", "month": "03", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1788]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            RECOGNITION OF MICHIGAN'S ALEX ``IZY'' IZYKOWSKI\n\n Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I rise today in recognition of \nMichigan's own Alex ``Izy'' Izykowski and to pay tribute to his recent \naccomplishment in winning a bronze medal in the 5,000-meter short track \nrelay at the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin, Italy.\n  I join my colleagues and everyone across the great State of Michigan \nin honoring Izy's outstanding representation of his team, his State, \nand his country. Izy's medal winning performance on behalf of Team USA \nwas the culminating achievement of an athlete's career that has \nembodied the finest in both the American spirit and the Olympic ideal.\n  From his earliest days as a member of the Bay County Speedskating \nClub, Izy's career has stood as an example of excellence. His hard \nwork, dedication, and focus have resulted in success at every level of \nhis sport, leading to Izy's stellar performance last week in the \npinnacle of athletic contests, the Olympic Games.\n  It is not just Izy's success on the speedskating track, though, that \nI stand to pay tribute to today. Izy's journey to the Olympic medal \npodium has been one that makes us all proud. The manner in which this \nfine young man has conducted himself should stand as an example to all \nof us and as a tribute to the support and love of his family. The \nIzykowski family, and the extended family of Bay City, should take \nspecial pride in knowing that they played an essential role in molding \na young man who truly embodies the Olympic creed: ``The most important \nthing in the Olympic Games is not to win but to take part, just as the \nmost important thing in life is not the triumph, but the struggle.''\n  I rise today in honor of Alex Izykowski's bronze medal winning \nperformance at the 2006 Winter Olympics. Success in a sport as \nphysically and mentally demanding as short track speedskating requires \nyears of dedicated and regimented training focused into intense bursts \nof incredible effort. The personal sacrifice, self discipline, and \ncompetitive spirit required to earn an Olympic Medal are attributes to \nwhich we should all aspire and Izy clearly embodies all of these \nqualities. It is because of young men and women like Izy that I remain \nconfident in the continued success of our great State and Nation. I \nhonor Izy for representing the values that are so essential to our \nMichigan way of life on the world stage.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/03/06/senate-section/article/S1788-2", "month": "03", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1788]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nDRAFT OF PROPOSED LEGISLATION ENTITLED ``LEGISLATIVE LINE ITEM VETO ACT \n                            OF 2006''--PM 42\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on the Budget:\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  In my State of the Union Address, I asked the Congress to give the \nPresident a line item veto. Today, I am sending the Congress a \nlegislative proposal to give the President line item authority to \nreduce wasteful spending. This legislation will help to limit spending \nand ensure accountability and transparency in the expenditure of \ntaxpayer funds.\n  Although the Congress achieved significant spending restraint this \npast year, appropriations and other bills that are sent to my desk \nstill contain spending that is not fully justified, is a low priority, \nor is earmarked to avoid the discipline of competitive or merit-based \nreviews. When this legislation is presented to me, I now have no \nability to line out unnecessary spending. In 1996, the Congress gave \nthe President a line item veto--an important tool to limit wasteful \nspending--but the Supreme Court struck down that version of the law in \n1998.\n  My proposed legislation, the ``Legislative Line Item Veto Act of \n2006,'' would provide a fast-track procedure to require the Congress to \nvote up-or-down on rescissions proposed by the President. There has \nbeen broad bipartisan support for similar proposals in the past. Under \nthis proposal, the President could propose legislation to rescind \nwasteful spending, and the Congress would be obligated to vote quickly \non that package of rescissions, without amendment. The same procedure \nwould apply to new mandatory spending and to special interest tax \nbreaks given to small numbers of individuals.\n  Forty-three Governors have a line item veto to reduce spending. The \nPresident needs similar authority to help control unjustified and \nwasteful spending in the Federal budget. I urge you to promptly \nconsider and send me this legislation for enactment to reduce \nunnecessary spending and help achieve my goal of cutting the deficit in \nhalf by 2009.\n                                                      George W.

A bill to require a more reasonable period for delayed-\nnotice search warrants, to provide enhanced judicial review of FISA \norders and national security letters, to require an enhanced factual \nbasis for a FISA order, and to create national security letter sunset \nprovisions; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to offer \nlegislation which would amplify the PATRIOT Act, which we expect to be \npassed by the House of Representatives tomorrow, with these amendments \nto restore the provisions of the PATRIOT Act to the provisions of the \nSenate bill which was passed unanimously by the Judiciary Committee on \nwhich the Presiding Officer sits, as do I, and was then adopted by \nunanimous consent by the Senate.\n  The PATRIOT Act has had a complex procedural history where the House \npassed a version which was substantially different from the Senate \nversion. Then we hammered out a conference report which, in my view, \nwas an acceptable compromise. It did not have all of the provisions \nwhich I would have preferred. It did not have the provisions of the \nSenate bill. But in a bicameral legislature, we learn to work with the \nart of the possible. That was accommodation.\n  We worked closely with Chairman Sensenbrenner in the House and \ncrafted a bill which was acceptable. There were certain key concessions \nmade to the Senate which I believed were important, perhaps \nindispensable, the leading one being the sunset provision which was \nfinally established at 4 years. That had been the provision in the \nSenate bill. And by sunset, for anyone who may be watching on C-SPAN2, \nthat is the provision which terminates the bill, and then it has to \ncome back to Congress for reevaluation to see if we want to give the \nexpanded powers to law enforcement officials. The House bill had 10 \nyears; the Senate bill had 4 years. The House wanted a compromise at 7 \nyears, and the Senate held fast. And the compromise was reached so we \nfinally put a provision in at 4 years.\n  The PATRIOT Act was passed shortly after the terrible tragedies of 9/\n11, when the United States was victimized by a terrorist attack. It was \nan effort to give law enforcement officials more power to deal with \nterrorism. There is always a balance to be struck between civil \nliberties on the one hand and sufficient power for law enforcement on \nthe other. There came into a coalition representatives of both extreme \nends of the political spectrum, the so-called far left, the so-called \nfar right, joining together with the insistence on more civil \nliberties. It seemed to me that the point was well taken.\n  The legislation I am introducing today, I introduce on behalf of \nmyself, Senators Leahy, Murkowski, Sununu, Feingold, Craig, Hagel, \nDurbin, Salazar, Feinstein, Obama, and Kerry. The cosponsors are the \nfour Republicans who did not vote for cloture when the bill was before \nthe Senate. They had decided not to vote to cut off debate, which might \nhave given us the leverage at that time to pass the conference report, \nbut insisted on some modifications. With the leadership of Senator \nSununu, those modifications have been enacted in a companion bill which \nis going to the House of Representatives for House action tomorrow. It \nis my expectation that the legislation will be passed. There is an \nenrolling ceremony set by the Speaker of the House and the majority \nleader for Wednesday morning, so that is a pretty good sign that we are \nen route to having the PATRIOT Act enacted.\n\n  I do not think that ought to be the ending point. That is why I am \nintroducing this supplemental legislation today. What this legislation \ndoes is reinstate provisions of the original Senate-passed bill. For \nexample, on the delayed notice search warrants, the\n\n[[Page S1792]]\n\nHouse bill had called for 180 days. The Senate bill had called for 7 \ndays' notice. The conference report compromised out at 30 days, which I \nthought was acceptable, while not as good as I would have liked it. So \nin this new bill, the delayed notice provision is set at 7 days. That \nmeans that when a search warrant is authorized, where the subject of \nthe search warrant is not told--ordinarily if you have a search and \nseizure, law enforcement officials come in and in broad daylight make \nthe search and seizure. The resident, the owner of the residence knows \nabout it. But a delayed notice search warrant is structured so that the \nrecipient does not know about it, where there is cause shown that the \ninvestigation would be impeded if the recipient were to be told at that \ntime. This cuts the time to 7 days.\n  There had been considerable controversy over the provisions of \nsection 215 where the Senate bill had a three-part test, and a fourth \nprovision was added to the conference report where the judge had the \ndiscretion to grant the order if there was adequate showing in the \nopinion of the court to pursue a terrorist investigation. But the new \nbill comes back to the three-part test of the original Senate bill so \nthe records sought must, first, pertain to a foreign power or an agent \nof a foreign power; second, are relevant to the activities of a \nsuspected agent of a foreign power who is the subject of an authorized \ninvestigation; or, three, pertain to an individual in contact with the \nsuspected agent of a foreign power.\n  The third provision provides for a judicial review of national \nsecurity letters. It would eliminate the conclusive presumption with \nrespect to national security letters that the court would automatically \nuphold nondisclosure--that is, a gag order--upon the Government's good \nfaith certification that disclosure may endanger the national security \nof the United States or interfere with diplomatic relations. The bill \nintroduced today would allow the judge to review all of the factors and \nwould not be controlled by this conclusive presumption.\n  The bill introduced today also makes a change on judicial review of \nsection 215, which eliminates both the conclusive presumption which was \nadded in on the legislation sponsored by Senator Sununu, and it \neliminates the mandatory 1-year waiting period.\n\n  The sunset on national security letters is an additional provision \nwhich adds a 4-year sunset to national security letters, which is the \nsame sunset in the balance of the conference report. National security \nletters had not been subjected to the PATRIOT Act but were included in \nthe Senate version this time. That provision is added.\n  We are having an oversight hearing with the Director of the FBI later \nthis month. It is my intention, as chairman of the Judiciary Committee, \nto include in that oversight hearing these provisions. We want to see \nexactly how important they are, what the FBI is doing with them. We \nwant law enforcement to have the tools it needs.\n  I know this is a subject near and dear to the heart of the Presiding \nOfficer who was the U.S. attorney in Alabama for law enforcement and \nattorney general, and something of which this Senator has very \nsubstantial concern based in part on my tenure as district attorney of \nPhiladelphia. So we want law enforcement to have the tools which are \nneeded. At the same time we want to achieve an appropriate balance with \ncivil liberties.\n  The statement has been made that it is not anticipated that the House \nwill act on such legislation this year. It is a long year. We will wait \nand see. We will see what the developments are. We will see how our \nfight against terrorism goes. We will see what the oversight provisions \nare. But this bill will be useful as a marker to promote further \nreconsideration of that original Senate bill that passed last year. It \nwas a significant occasion, if not monumental, to have all 18 members \nof the Judiciary Committee agree on a bill which, as the Presiding \nOfficer knows, as do I and people who are familiar with the Judiciary \nCommittee, we have representatives at opposite ends of the political \nspectrum. That is what is attractive about the Judiciary Committee. \nNotwithstanding our divergence of views, we have had remarkable success \nin the past 14 months passing the bankruptcy bill, the class action \nbill, and the asbestos bill out of committee.\n  We stumbled a little. We are one vote short on the budget point of \norder. That is going to be coming back.\n  We are taking a look at some of the provisions I am personally \ntalking to Senators about on an individual basis. There is a recognized \nneed for asbestos reform. There is only disagreement as to what it \nought to be. I am asking Senators to take a look at the bill and tell \nme what it is they would like to see done in order to have the bill \nreceive the requisite support here to overcome the budget point of \norder--I think we have the votes already there--but to overcome cloture \nand to have a bill that can be enacted.\n  Then our committee led the way in the confirmation of the new Chief \nJustice of the Supreme Court, Chief Justice Roberts, and Justice Alito. \nWe are now in the midst of working on immigration. I think the renewal \nof the PATRIOT Act is a significant step forward--something the \nPresident has been anxious to have done and something which will give \nlaw enforcement the tools it needs with appropriate balance.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of this new bill be printed in \nthe Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                                S. 2369\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, the PATRIOT Act reauthorization legislation \nthat the Senate may vote on this week still has serious flaws and \ntroubling omissions. I have spent several months working closely with \nMembers from both parties in an attempt to improve these defects. Even \nafter the Bush administration and congressional Republicans hijacked \nthe House-Senate conference, I tried to get this measure back on the \nright track. Working with a bipartisan group of Senators, we were able \nto achieve some improvements. I regret that the final package is not \nbetter and that the intransigence of the administration has prevented a \nbetter bill with better protections for the American people.\n  I remain committed to working to provide the tools that we need to \nprotect the American people. That includes working to provide the \noversight and checks needed on the uses of Government power and to \nimprove the current reauthorization of the PATRIOT Act. I am therefore \npleased to join Senator Specter, Senator Sununu, Senator Craig, Senator \nFeingold, and others in introducing a bill to improve the \nreauthorization legislation in several important respects.\n  Most importantly, the Specter-Leahy bill corrects one of the most \negregious ``police state'' provisions regarding gag orders. The Bush-\nCheney administration used the last round of discussions with \nRepublican Senators to make the gag order provisions worse, in my view, \nby forbidding any court challenge for 1 year. There is no justification \nfor this mandatory waiting period for judicial review, and our bill \neliminates it. Our bill also eliminates provisions that allow the \nGovernment to ensure itself of victory by certifying that, in its view, \ndisclosure ``may'' endanger national security or ``may'' interfere with \ndiplomatic relations. These un-American restraints on meaningful \njudicial review are unfair, unjustified, and completely unacceptable.\n  I sought to make these changes to the gag orders provisions in an \namendment I filed to Senator Sununu's bill, S. 227l, which modified the \nconference report in various respects. Senator Feingold filed other \namendments aimed at bringing the conference report more in line with \nthe bipartisan reauthorization bill that every Member of the Senate \napproved last year. Regrettably, the majority leader chose to prevent \nany effort to offer amendments to S. 227l and effectively stifled open \ndebate.\n  In addition to fixing the gag order provisions, the Specter-Leahy \nbill adopts the Senate-passed standard for obtaining secret court \norders under section 215 of the PATRIOT Act. Under this standard, the \nGovernment can obtain private, confidential records such as library and \nmedical records only if there is some connection between those records \nand a suspected terrorist or spy. The Specter-Leahy bill also restores \nthe pre-PATRIOT Act rule, adopted by the Senate, that notice of ``sneak \nand peek'' searches may be delayed for no more than 7 days unless \nextended. The conference report sets a 30-day rule for the initial \ndelay, more than three times what the Senate, and pre-PATRIOT Act \ncourts, deemed appropriate. Finally, the Specter-Leahy bill adds a 4 \nyear sunset to the national security letter authorities created in the \nconference report. This sunset provision, like those included in the \noriginal PATRIOT Act at the insistence of myself and House Majority \nLeader Dick Armey, would facilitate oversight and ensure accountability \nfor the use of these administrative subpoena authorities.\n  Reauthorization of the PATRIOT Act has been a more difficult and far \nmore painful process than it should have been. Under the leadership of \nChairman Specter, the Judiciary Committee managed in just a few weeks \nto produce a bipartisan bill that passed the Senate unanimously. The \nHouse-Senate conference took a different course and produced a bill \nthat Members on both sides of the aisle found unacceptable. It has been \nimproved, but critical problems remain. The Specter-Leahy bill corrects \nthe worst of these problems, and I will work with the chairman to enact \nthese commonsense reforms before the end of the year.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. McCONNELL (for himself, Mr. Biden, Mr. DeMint, Ms. \n        Mikulski, Mr. Martinez, Mr. Nelson of Florida, Mr. Hagel, Mr. \n        Nelson of Nebraska, Mr. DeWine, Mr. Talent, Mr. Allen, Mr. \n        Frist, Mr. Burns, Mr. Thune, Mr. Reid, Mr. Salazar, Mr. Kerry, \n        Mr. Bunning, Mr. Lieberman, and Mrs. Boxer):\n  S. 2370. A bill to promote the development of democratic institutions \nin areas under the administrative control of the Palestinian Authority, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, today, along with my friend, the senior \nSenator from Delaware, Mr. Biden, I send to the desk the Palestinian \nAnti-Terrorism Act of 2006 and ask that it be referred to the \nappropriate committee.\n  Senator Biden and I are joined in our efforts today by Senators \nDeMint, Mikulski, Martinez, Senator Nelson of Florida, Hagel, Senator \nNelson of Nebraska, DeWine, Talent, Allen, Frist, Burns and Thune, all \nof whom are original cosponsors of this legislation. This is a \nbipartisan bill, and I thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle \nfor their leadership on the important issue of how the United States \naddresses the challenges posed by the new Hamas-dominated government in \nthe West Bank and Gaza.\n  The Palestinian elections of January 25 produced a majority of Hamas \nsupporters in the Palestinian parliament. Perhaps the Palestinians were \nfrustrated with the corruption of the ruling Fatah Party, or perhaps \nthey were tired of the slow pace of reforms. Either way, the \nPalestinian people cast their ballots for an organization that supports \nterrorism and rejects Israel's very right to exist. That is \nantithetical to our security interests in the Middle East, and it \nshould be unacceptable to this Senate.\n  In light of the recent election, Senator Biden and I are submitting \nthis legislation for the Senate's consideration which we hope will send \nan unequivocal message to the Hamas leadership: renounce terror, \nrecognize Israel and live up to the commitments made by the previous \nPalestinian government.\n  In short, this legislation urges the Palestinian people to take \nanother step toward joining the community of peaceful nations and a \nstep away from the ranks of terrorism.\n  Our bill would do the following: it would restrict assistance to the \nPalestinian Authority, PA, unless it is determined that no PA \ngovernment ministry is controlled by terrorists, that the PA publicly \nacknowledges Israel's right to exist, that the PA has recommitted \nitself to all its prior agreements with Israel, that the PA has made \nprogress toward dismantling terrorist infrastructure, and that the PA \nhas instituted fiscal transparency. This bill would essentially deny \nvisas to certain PA officials and restrict their travel to the United \nStates. It also limits diplomatic interaction with Palestinian \nterrorist groups. Finally, this bill contains rigorous audit and \noversight requirements to ensure compliance with its provisions.\n  Let me also tell you what this bill does not do. It does not cut off \nassistance to the Palestinian people with respect to food, water, \nmedicine, sanitation and other basic human needs. Thus, humanitarian \nassistance that does not go through the Palestinian government will \ncontinue. Moreover, funding for democracy programs will also be \ncontinued. Both Senator Biden and I appreciate the need not to punish \nthe Palestinian people for actions its future government may take. Our \nconcern is with the new regime taking power and in giving them the \nproper incentives to embrace peace and to abandon the pro-terror stance \nthey have taken up until now.\n  Democracy is about more than just elections, it is also about \nresponsible, accountable governance. The Palestinian elections a few \nweeks back reflect this fact. International observers indicate that the \nPalestinian elections were essentially free and fair--which in and of \nitself is certainly a good thing.\n  I strongly support democratic elections. That said, any right-minded \nperson deplores the result of those elections.\n  A key part of democratic governance is that elected officials are \nresponsible for the actions they take. If Hamas\n\n[[Page S1794]]\n\ntakes power and persists in sponsoring terror, rejecting Israel's right \nto exist and refusing to accept prior commitments made to Israel, then \nthey should be held accountable for their actions and for the foreign \naid investments in the West Bank and Gaza paid for by American \ntaxpayers. The PA's budget is supported in large part by foreign \nassistance, and Hamas has been put on notice by the United States and \nmany in the donor community about the steps it must take in order to \nreceive assistance in the future.\n  Along these same lines, I must say I am somewhat mystified at the \nrecent diplomatic efforts undertaken by Russia. Russia broke from the \nMiddle East Quartet and hosted representatives from Hamas in Moscow.\n  In so doing, the Russians granted Hamas a measure of international \nlegitimacy Hamas had hitherto lacked, while the Russians appear to have \nreceived no meaningful concessions in return. I am afraid I fail to see \nthe benefit in Russia's actions other than emboldening other nations to \nfollow a similar course of dealing with a terrorist organization. I \nsuspect the Russians would be less than elated if Israel hosted Chechen \nseparatists in Jerusalem.\n  Foreign aid is not an entitlement. It is assistance from the American \npeople to other nations, and it should be conducted in furtherance of \nU.S. interests and those of our allies. It is not to be given to \norganizations that actively work against those interests. Hamas, as it \nnow stands, is just such an organization.\n  The ball is squarely in Hamas' court. It can either work for the good \nof its citizens as an accountable democratic government should, or it \ncan continue to act as a revolutionary group to the profound detriment \nof its citizens.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN.

Mr. President, I am pleased to join the Senator from \nKentucky as the lead cosponsor of the Palestinian Anti-Terrorism Act of \n2006.\n  This bill sends a clear message: The United States will not provide a \nsingle penny to a Hamas-led government unless it renounces violence, \nrecognizes Israel, and accepts past agreements between Israel and the \nPalestinian Authority. These requirements are clear, and they reflect \nthe will not just of the United States, but of the international \ncommunity, including the so-called Quartet of the United States, the \nEuropean Union, Russia and the United Nations.\n  Simply put, Hamas must choose between bullets and ballots, between \ndestructive terror and constructive governance. It cannot have it both \nways.\n  The bill affirms support for a two-state solution to end the Israeli-\nPalestinian conflict, an objective that Hamas rejects. The bill also \nrequires the administration to report on steps it is taking to urge \nother nations to refrain from providing financial assistance to Hamas. \nIn addition, it places restrictions on diplomatic contacts and \nmovements by representatives of Hamas.\n  At the same time, the bill makes clear that we want to continue to \nsupport the basic needs of the Palestinian people. Assistance to the \nPalestinians for things such as food, water, medicine, and sanitation \nthrough non-governmental organizations will be permitted under this * * \n*\n  Instead of moving urgently, we dithered. Several months into last \nyear, the President made a smart move by appointing Jim Wolfensohn the \nQuartet's special envoy to the Middle East, but he failed to strongly \nsupport his efforts. It wasn't until November that Secretary Rice got \ndirectly involved by brokering a breakthrough agreement on Gaza. That \nwas welcome, but it was too little, too late.\n  I don't want to dwell on the past, but I think it's important that we \ntry to learn from it.\n  It's also well known that Israel had deep misgivings about proceeding \nwith these elections. Their views should have been considered more \nclosely--after all, the consequences affect them directly.\n  Overall, I think this Administration has made the mistake of \nconfusing democracy with elections. Elections are necessary but not \nsufficient--they do not a democracy make. Democracy is about building \ndurable institutions--including political parties, transparent and \neffective government, civil society and a strong private sector.\n  We see what happens in the Middle East when you have elections with \nweak institutions--including in Egypt, Muslim Brotherhood, Lebanon, \nHezbollah, Iraq, SCIRI, and now the Palestinian Authority. All of us \nsupport the spread of democracy, but we should also support the hard \nwork and investments it takes to build it.\n  Regarding the Palestinian vote, what should we do now? Obviously, \nHamas's victory casts a pall on the future of the peace process.\n  First, Israel cannot be expected to negotiate with a party that calls \nfor its destruction, engages in terrorism and maintains an armed \nmilitia.\n  Second, we should build international support for the position of the \nQuartet--no assistance to a Hamas-led government until it agrees to \nrecognize Israel, renounce violence, and accept past agreements.\n  Third, we need to press the Arab Gulf states not to rush in and \nfinancially support a Hamas-led government. That would take the \npressure off Hamas, and it would reveal the hypocrisy of the Arab \ngovernments who say they support peace, but were unwilling to be more \ngenerous with Abbas's government.\n  Hamas is now ``the dog that caught the car.'' It must respond to \ninternational demands and, even more importantly, it must be responsive \nto the Palestinian public which wants reform, but doesn't want \nisolation, poverty, and radicalism.\n  The legislation I have introduced with my colleague, the senior \nSenator from Kentucky, is our attempt to clarify the choices for Hamas, \nand to make clear our rejection of a group that is committed to terror.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By. Mr. KERRY:\n  S. 2372. A bill to amend the Congressional Budget and Impoundment \nControl Act of 1974 to provide for the expedited consideration of \ncertain proposed cancellations of appropriations, new direct spending, \nand limited tax benefits; to the Committee on the Budget.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President. I am pleased to introduce legislation today \nthat establishes a constitutional line item veto, which would allow the \nPresident to reduce pork barrel spending and save taxpayers billions of \ndollars. Congress has an opportunity this week in our debate on \nlobbying reform to take ethics reform seriously and take action to rid \nthe federal budget of special interest projects. Giving the President \nthe ability to target projects placed in the budget at the last minute \nat the request of a single lawmaker is a step in the right direction \nand a critical move toward needed transparency.\n  It is no secret that President Bush and I do not agree on many policy \nmatters, but I fully support giving him this line item veto authority \nand I applaud the President's comments earlier today. I hope that \nCongress immediately takes up and passes this legislation, and I hope \nthat President Bush will be able to use this new veto authority soon to \nget tough on wasteful spending.\n  Under the Republican-led House and Senate, pork-barrel spending has \nskyrocketed. Nearly $30 billion a year is being spent on projects that \nhave never even been debated. For fiscal year 2005, appropriators added \n13,997 projects into the 13 appropriations bills, an increase of 31 \npercent over last year's total of 10,656. In the last two years, the \ntotal number of projects has increased by 49.5 percent. The cost of \nthese projects in fiscal year 2005 was $27.3 billion, or 19 percent \nmore than last year's total of $22.9 billion. Billions of taxpayer \ndollars are being wasted on things like research to enhance the flavor \nof roasted peanuts and the infamous ``bridge to nowhere.'' We have the \nlargest deficit in American history and Congress and the President must \ntake action to get spending under control.\n  In 1996, the Congress passed and President Clinton signed into law \nthe ``Line Item Veto Act'', P.L. 104-130. Two years later, however, in \nClinton v. City of New York the Supreme Court concluded that the method \nused to give the President line item veto authority was \nunconstitutional. The Court noted that presidents may only sign or veto \nentire acts of Congress. The Constitution does not authorize them to \nenact, to amend, or to repeal statutes.\n  We can restore the line item veto and be consistent with the \nConstitution.\n\n[[Page S1797]]\n\nThe key difference between what I am proposing and what the Supreme \nCourt struck down is the legal effect of the President's actions. The \n``Line Item Veto Act'' allowed the President to cancel provisions in \ntheir entirety, but the Supreme Court rejected this arrangement. The \nLine Item Veto Act of 2006 is different. It will empower the President \nto suspend provisions until the Congress decides to approve or \ndisapprove of that suspension with an up or down vote. The provisions \nare not cancelled out of the legislation. I believe this change \naddresses the Supreme Court's concerns.\n  I agree with President Bush's comments earlier today, it is indeed \n`time to bring this important tool of fiscal discipline to Washington, \nD.C.' I look forward to working with my colleagues on both sides of the \naisle to pass the Line Item Veto Act and I look forward to President \nBush using this authority to reign in pork-barrel spending.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. COLEMAN:\n  S. 2374.

In countless hours of selfless work, volunteers \ntruly do make a difference every day, and in passing this resolution, \nthe Senate will be applauding the tireless efforts of the thousands of \ndedicated volunteers across the nation for their many contributions to \nthe youth of our nation through Project Safe Place.\n  Events of the day may turn our attention overseas, but it is \nessential to remember those who are fighting an ongoing battle right \nhere at home. This battle has been raging for generations and consists \nof fighting to protect this Nation's most valuable resource: our \nchildren. Young people are the future of this Nation; they need to be \nboth valued and protected. Sadly, however, as my colleagues know, this \nprecious resource is threatened daily.\n  I come to the Senate today to talk about a tremendous initiative \nbetween the public and private sector that has been reaching out to \nyouth for over 20 years. Project Safe Place is a program that was \ndeveloped to assist our Nation's youth and families in crisis. This \npartnership creates a network of private businesses trained to refer \nyouth in need to the local service providers who can help them. Those \nbusinesses display a Safe Place sign so that young people can easily \nrecognize a ``safe place'' for them to go to receive help.\n  The goal of National Safe Place Week is to recognize the thousands of \nindividuals who work to make Project Safe Place a reality. From trained \nvolunteers to seasoned professionals, these dedicated individuals are \nworking together with the resources in their local communities and \nthrough their ties across the Nation to serve young people. Because of \nProject Safe Place, this\n\n[[Page S1805]]\n\nall happens under a well-known symbol of safety for in-crisis youth.\n  Project Safe Place is a simple program to implement in any local \ncommunity, and it works. Young people are more likely to seek help in \nlocations that are familiar and non-threatening to them. By creating a \nnetwork of Safe Places across the Nation, all youth will have access to \nneeded help, counseling, or a safe place to stay. However, though the \nprogram has already been established in 42 States, there are still too \nmany communities that don't know about this valuable youth resource.\n  If your State does not already have a Safe Place organization, please \nconsider facilitating this worthwhile resource so that young people who \nare abused, neglected, or whose futures are jeopardized by physical or \nemotional trauma will have access to immediate help and safety in your \ncommunity. To create more Project Safe Place sites in Idaho, the staff \nin several of my State offices have completed the training to make them \nSafe Place sites, and now have the skills and ability to assist \ntroubled youth. In the coming years, Project Safe Place hopes that \nevery child in America will have the opportunity to connect with \nsomeone who can provide immediate help by easily recognizing the Safe \nPlace sign.\n  Mr. FRIST. I ask unanimous consent the resolution be agreed to, the \npreamble be agreed to, and the motion to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. 390) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                               S.Res. 390\n\n       Whereas the youths of today are vital to the preservation \n     of the United States and will be the future bearers of the \n     bright torch of democracy;\n       Whereas youths need a safe haven from various negative \n     influences such as child abuse, substance abuse, and crime, \n     and they need to have resources readily available to assist \n     them when faced with circumstances that compromise their \n     safety;\n       Whereas the United States needs increased numbers of \n     community volunteers acting as positive influences on the \n     youths of the Nation;\n       Whereas the Safe Place program is committed to protecting \n     the youths of the United States, the country's most valuable \n     asset, by offering short term safe places at neighborhood \n     locations where trained volunteers are available to counsel \n     and advise young people seeking assistance and guidance;\n       Whereas the Safe Place program combines the efforts of the \n     private sector and nonprofit organizations to reach young \n     people in the early stages of crisis;\n       Whereas the Safe Place program provides a direct way to \n     assist programs in meeting performance standards relative to \n     outreach and community relations, as set forth in the Runaway \n     and Homeless Youth Act (42 U.S.C. 5701 et seq.);\n       Whereas the Safe Place placard displayed at businesses \n     within communities stands as a beacon of safety and refuge to \n     at-risk youths;\n       Whereas more than 700 communities in 40 States make Safe \n     Place available at nearly 15,000 locations;\n       Whereas more than 87,000 youths have gone to Safe Place \n     locations to get help when faced with crisis situations and \n     88,000 youths received counseling by phone as a result of \n     Safe Place information they received at school;\n       Whereas, through the efforts of Safe Place coordinators \n     across the United States, each year more than 500,000 \n     students learn in a classroom presentation that Safe Place is \n     a resource they can turn to if they encounter an abusive or \n     neglectful situation, and 1,000,000 Safe Place information \n     cards are distributed; and\n       Whereas increased awareness of the Safe Place program will \n     encourage communities to establish Safe Places for the youths \n     of the United States: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates the week of March 13 through March 19, 2006, \n     as ``National Safe Place Week''; and\n       (2) calls upon the people of the United States and \n     interested groups to promote awareness of and volunteer \n     involvement in, the Safe Place programs, and to observe the \n     week with appropriate ceremonies and activities.\n\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/03/06/senate-section/article/S1805-1", "month": "03", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1805]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n           AUTHORIZING REPRESENTATION BY SENATE LEGAL COUNSEL\n\n  Mr. FRIST.

Mr. President, this resolution concerns a civil action \nfiled by a former employee of the Architect of the Capitol against an \nemployee of the Senate along with various employees of the Architect of \nthe Capitol and a Capitol Police Officer. The plaintiff in the case \nclaims that the defendants conspired to retaliate against him in his \nemployment because he had tried to report misconduct in the operations \nof the Architect of the Capitol. The plaintiff seeks damages from the \ndefendants in this case for allegedly violating his constitutional \nrights.\n  The claims against the Senate employee, whose involvement in this \nsuit arises solely out of her oversight role as a staff member on the \nAppropriations Committee, are subject to dismissal on numerous legal \ngrounds, including failure to state a claim upon which relief can be \ngranted, and legislative and qualified immunity from suit. This \nresolution authorizes the Senate Legal Counsel to represent the Senate \nemployee in this case and to move to dismiss the claims against her.\n  Mr. FRIST.

Mr. President, before closing, I am going to make a brief \ncomment--and there will be a lot more to say later in the year--on my \nfriend and colleague Chairman Bill Thomas in the House of \nRepresentatives.\n  He has an old saying: ``I came here to make law.'' Well, when he \nretires at the end of his 14th term serving the 22nd District of \nCalifornia, Chairman Thomas will be able to look back on an illustrious \npublic career that not only made law but made history.\n  Bill Thomas is smart. He is tenacious. He is steeped in the \ntraditions of the House. He knows an awful lot about the traditions in \nthe Senate as well. He has worked hard for over 25 years to deliver \nmeaningful solutions to the American people.\n  As chairman of the powerful Ways and Means Committee, the chairman \nhas authored and managed some of the most significant legislation to \ncome before the House. His skillful leadership has led to major \nvictories in reducing trade barriers, cutting taxes, stimulating the \neconomy, and protecting the interests of all Americans.\n  During the Medicare modernization debate, I spent 6 months in the \nchairman's Capitol office hammering out intricate, complex, tough, \nchallenging policy details. I think it is fair to say that in those 6 \nmonths I had more than my lifetime's share of pistachios, which he \nalways had sitting on that table and which habitually you could not \nhelp but dive into, as we talked about those many issues.\n  A former political science professor, he is known on both sides of \nthe aisle for his keen intellect and also his political savvy. He is \nknown for what has been called his ``singular personality.''\n  Over the years, he has been, at times, passionate; he has been \nemotional; he has been outspoken; he has been headstrong--all qualities \nthat have propelled him even beyond the national stage.\n\n[[Page S1806]]\n\n  He leaves behind a huge legacy, a storied legacy. And his presence \nwill be missed when he retires.\n  Back in 1995, Chairman Bill Thomas told the Los Angeles Times:\n\n       People say I'm not as touchy feely as I should be. But I \n     never ran for the job to be touchy feely.\n\n  I salute the chairman for his commitment to principle and his \nunflagging service to his country.\n  I wish him and his lovely wife Sharon all the best as they embark on \nthe journey ahead.\n  I had the opportunity to meet with him at the end of last week, and \nwe talked about the future, we talked about the short-term future. He \nmade it very clear he has a lot to do over the next several months \nright here in the Congress.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/03/06/senate-section/article/S1806-1", "month": "03", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1806]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ORDERS FOR TUESDAY, MARCH 7, 2006\n\n  Mr. FRIST.
