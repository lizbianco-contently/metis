Unlike many people \nwho would be content with the trappings of their ecclesiastical office, \nshe actually has lived with the homeless in New York, Rhode Island, and \nPhiladelphia. She endured what they endured, she saw their suffering. \nShe bore witness to their suffering not only in her experiences but her \nwork in Rhode Island. She is a remarkable woman who leads by example \nliterally and constantly reminds us of our obligations not just to \nourselves but to our neighbors. We are very proud to have her as our \nEpiscopal bishop.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/06/09/senate-section/article/S6243-6", "month": "06", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6243]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Following that vote, \nwe will turn to the consideration of the two Sixth Circuit nominations \nthat are pending on the Executive Calendar, with the time allotted for \nthe Griffin and McKeague nominations totalling 10 hours. However, it is \nmy hope and expectation that much of that time can be yielded back and \nthat we can have those votes either very late this afternoon or early \nthis evening. On Monday, we will debate the nomination of Tom Griffith \nto be judge for the D.C. Circuit Court, with that vote occurring Monday \nevening.\n  That is an overview of today, pretty much as we have agreed earlier \nin the week, and the expected votes. We will update Members over the \ncourse of the day of changes in the schedule and definitely what the \nschedule will be on Monday. And then we will follow that with the \nenergy legislation. Following the remarks from the Democratic leader, I \nhave a short statement on energy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/06/09/senate-section/article/S6243-8", "month": "06", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6243]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, as the Chair and distinguished majority \nleader know, I am sorry we have spent so\n\n[[Page S6244]]\n\nmuch time on judges, but the fact is I wish to express my appreciation \nto Democratic Senators for being so cooperative. Since the agreement \nwas made a week or two ago, my Senators have been so cooperative. \nSenator Leahy has had to change his whole schedule around this Monday \nto take care of the Griffith nomination. There has been an agreement \nmade that we are not going to use all the time on Pryor.\n  I also express my appreciation to Senators Levin and Stabenow for \nallowing us to move forward on the Michigan judges. In spite of the \nfact that there are some hurt feelings as a result of the way the \nMichigan Senators were treated, they have agreed to set those aside and \nmove forward on these two individuals. From all I have been able to \ndetermine, the two Michigan judges coming before us are well qualified, \nand there will not be any rancorous debate about either one of them. \nBut I just want the majority leader to know that we have moved forward \non these matters as expeditiously as possible, in spite of the \nrelatively difficult time we have had arriving at this point.\n  I look forward next week to a vigorous debate on the Energy bill. It \nis great that we are going to be legislating here for a change. This is \nan extremely important piece of legislation. I am also indicating to \nall those within the sound of my voice how appreciative--I don't think \nthe word ``proud'' is right but how appreciative--I am of the work of \nSenators Bingaman and Domenici to get the bill to this point.\n  We haven't had such cooperation on this committee in many years. We \nhave a bill now that was reported out by a heavy margin of the \ncommittee, and I think as a result of that we will have some vigorous \ndebate. There are some things on this side we believe should be done \ndifferently, but that is what legislation is all about. Again, having \nspent most of my life as a legislator, I look forward to the Senate \nreturning to what it does best.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I think this 4-week period does demonstrate \nthe Senate responding to the American people and what they expect, the \nfact that this week we are moving forward on judges, which people know \nhas been very contentious over the last several weeks, months, and even \nthe last couple years. We are making great progress working hand in \nhand on both sides of the aisle and delivering what the American people \nwant and expect. As the Democratic leader said, we will be returning to \nan issue I know we care extremely about. We have not been able to make \nprogress in several years. Because of the work of the two leaders, \nSenators Domenici and Bingaman, they have delivered an energy bill in a \nbipartisan way that will come to the Senate floor and be fully debated. \nWe will be spending next week, week and a half, 2 weeks on the bill for \ndebate, offering amendments, and we will start that process in the \nearly days of next week.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/06/09/senate-section/article/S6244-1", "month": "06", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6244-S6245]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          ENERGY INDEPENDENCE\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I do wish to comment just a bit further on \nenergy, really as a prelude to what we will be spending a lot of time \non beginning hopefully Monday and then spending the course of that week \ninto the next week, and that is the issue surrounding gasoline prices, \nnatural gas prices, concerns that individuals think about every single \nday as they turn on the lights in their home, as they go to work, on \nthe way filling up the gas tank of their automobile with gasoline, as \nthey use energy sources over the course of the day in the activity of \ntheir small business, and that is the energy challenges that are before \nus, have been before us. Now is the time to address them, and that we \nwill.\n  With gasoline now averaging over $2 a gallon, anyone who has gone to \nthe pump lately feels that impact, they feel that squeeze of higher \nenergy prices. It is costing families who have driven to work this \nmorning more and more just to get to work, over the last several years \ncosting them more to go pick up their kids from school in the \nafternoon, or as many people prepare for summer vacations costing them \nmore because of this increase in energy prices. It is not just the \ngasoline prices that are climbing. We have rising natural gas prices \nthat have been driving up electric bills in the last 4 months, higher \nelectric bills for everybody, especially families and small businesses.\n  As energy costs take a bigger and bigger bite in the family budgets, \nfamilies are able to spend less on other necessities in their lives, \nwhether it is food or shelter or health care. As electric bills consume \nmore and more of the small companies' assets or their bottom lines, \nthey invest less, they invest less in inventory or in capital \nexpenditures, or they invest less in how much they can pay employees \nworking for that small business. In order to keep our economy strong, \nand it does translate down into jobs, making others' lives more \nfulfilling every day, we must rely on a reliable and affordable and \nsecure supply of energy, reliable, affordable, and secure. That is the \npurpose of the Energy bill that will be brought to the floor of the \nSenate early next week.\n  Right now, we face enormous challenges, huge challenges. We have not \nhad a comprehensive national energy policy or energy strategy, cohesive \nstrategy in over 10 years. This has contributed to the higher prices. \nIt has threatened our ability to maintain a reliable, affordable, and \nsecure supply of energy for the future. The fact is that--and it is \nprobably the easiest thing to remember when you start talking about \nenergy other than the impact it has on everybody in everyday life--we \nare too dependent on foreign sources of energy. We have to look to a \nmore diverse energy series of sources. We have to look to new \ntechnologies here at home. Yes, absolutely we need to conserve more, \nand we also need to produce more in order to enhance our energy \nindependence and to enhance our energy security.\n  One of the primary energy challenges we face is this reliance on \nforeign oil. In the 1960s and early 1970s, the United States produced \nalmost as much oil as we consumed, and during that period of time \nimports were very small. In 1972, however, U.S. oil production began to \ndecline, and that production has been declining steadily ever since. \nThe U.S. consumption of oil has been steadily increasing. So we have \ndeclining production and increasing consumption.\n  As a result, our reliance--this I would say irresponsible reliance \nthat we have today on foreign oil, on imported oil--is growing. Ten \nyears ago, in 1995, we were 47 percent dependent on foreign sources of \noil. Today, that 47 percent has grown to a 56-percent dependence on \nforeign sources of oil. If you project that out, by 2025, if we do \nnothing, we will be 68-percent dependent on foreign oil; much of it, as \nwe all know, coming from countries that do not necessarily have our \nbest interests at heart.\n\n  Today we import most of our oil from Canada, Venezuela, Saudi Arabia, \nand Mexico. However, as we look forward, the Department of Energy's \nEnergy Information Administration did project more and more of the oil \nwe need will come from the OPEC countries in the Middle East.\n  We must take steps to reduce our dependence on foreign countries and \nenhance our energy security at home. When we rely on other nations for \nmore than half of our oil supply, we simply put ourselves at greater \nrisk.\n  While there is no silver bullet that can make us 100-percent energy \nindependent in the near future, there is a lot we can do right now to \nreduce our dependence and enhance our security. Much of it will be \naddressed on the floor in the next 2 weeks.\n  Everything should be on the table, including increasing conservation, \nenhancing energy efficiency, investing in new technologies that will \nallow us to both use energy more wisely and tap new sources of energy, \nand finally, increasing domestic production of energy sources at home. \nThe transportation sector is a prime example. Nearly 70 percent of the \noil we use goes to power the cars and trucks we drive every day. If we \nare serious about reducing our dependence on foreign oil, we must look \nfor new ways to fuel our vehicles. We are already doing this with the \nhybrid cars--they are becoming more and more popular, as we all know--\nand with alternative fuels, such as ethanol and biodiesel.\n  We must continue to move in this direction by continuing to invest in \nhydrogen fuel cell research. President Bush has stressed this again and \nagain, and he has said his goal is that today's\n\n[[Page S6245]]\n\nchildren will take their driver's test in a zero-emission vehicle. That \nwould go a long way toward helping to reduce our dependence and enhance \nour security.\n  Natural gas is another energy source we depend on heavily and is \nanother area in which we are, unfortunately, becoming increasingly \nreliant on foreign imports. Because natural gas is clean burning and \nrelatively cheap, it has been the fuel of choice for new electric power \ngeneration in recent years. Sixty percent of American homes are now \nheated and cooled with natural gas. But while that demand has been \ngrowing, domestic supply has remained essentially flat. In 2003, we \nimported 15 percent of the gas we used. By 2025, that number will \nnearly double.\n  We simply cannot continue on this path, and that is why we are \nbringing this bill to the floor next week. We need to take bold action \nin the Senate. It is what the American people expect; it is what they \ndeserve. This is exactly what we will do. We will take that action in \nthe Senate to address these energy challenges head on.\n  The bill that was reported out of the Energy Committee last month was \ndone so on a bipartisan basis, and it is a step in the right direction. \nIt likely will be amended and improved on the floor of the Senate next \nweek. I, again, thank Chairman Domenici and Senator Bingaman for their \ntremendous work and for the cooperative spirit with which they \napproached these issues. I hope that same bipartisan spirit will \nprevail on the floor and that we can get this important legislation to \nthe President as quickly as possible.\n  Several of us had the opportunity to meet with the President \nyesterday, and this was at the very top of his list of issues that he \nexpects us to address. Our goal is to get that legislation to his desk \nfor his signature as soon as we possibly can.\n  America needs a policy that keeps our families safe, strong, and \nsecure, a policy that keeps America moving forward.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Martinez). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/06/09/senate-section/article/S6245-1", "month": "06", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6245]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the Senate will \nproceed to executive session to resume consideration of Calendar No. \n100, which the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read the nomination of William H. \nPryor, Jr., of Alabama, to be United States Circuit Judge for the \nEleventh Circuit.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the time from now \nuntil 10:30 shall be under the control of the majority leader or his \ndesignee.\n  The Senator from Alabama is now recognized.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I am delighted to be able to speak on \nbehalf of William Pryor--Judge William Pryor now--for the position of \nU.S. Circuit Judge for the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals. He is an \nextraordinary individual, a wonderful human being, a brilliant lawyer, \na man of the highest integrity, who has won the respect and support and \nconfidence of the people of Alabama to an extraordinary degree. \nDemocrats, Republicans, African Americans--the whole State of Alabama \nknows and respects him for the courage and integrity and commitment he \nbrings to public service.\n  He was appointed attorney general to fill my seat after I was elected \nto the Senate, and he has done a superb job as attorney general. \nPresident Bush gave him a recess appointment to the Eleventh Circuit \nCourt of Appeals after his nomination had been blocked here now for \nover 2 years. So it has been a burden for me to feel the frustration \nthat I know he and his family must endure as a result of the \nuncertainty of his nomination process. I could not be more pleased that \nhe was one of the nominees who was agreed upon to get a cloture vote, a \nsuccessful cloture vote and an up-or-down vote here in the Senate. That \nis a good decision by the 14 Senators who reached a consensus on how \nthey would approach this process of confirmations. I could not be more \npleased and proud that Judge Bill Pryor was part of the group that was \nagreed upon by those Members of the Senate to get an up-or-down vote.\n  Bill Pryor is the kind of judge America ought to have. He grew up in \nMobile, AL, my hometown. He was educated in the Catholic school system. \nHis father was a band director at McGill-Toolen High School, a \nvenerable, large Catholic high school there. His mother taught in \nAfrican-American schools. He went to law school at Tulane University \nwhere he graduated with honors, magna cum laude. He was editor-in-chief \nof the Tulane Law Review. I know the Presiding Officer, the Senator \nfrom Florida, is a lawyer and understands that editor-in-chief of the \nLaw Review is the highest honor a graduating senior can have. To be \nselected as that in a fine law school such as Tulane is a great \nachievement.\n\n  After he left law school, he clerked for Circuit Judge John Minor \nWisdom, a well-known champion of civil rights in the Federal court \nsystem--at that time in the old Fifth Circuit. Now it has been divided \nto become the Eleventh Circuit. Judge John Minor Wisdom was a circuit \ncourt judge in the 1950s and 1960s when much of segregation was brought \nto an end by Federal court action. Bill Pryor was positively impacted \nby his experiences, working with Judge Wisdom, and is a passionate \nbeliever in equal rights and equal justice, and he has a record to \ndemonstrate that commitment.\n  He practiced law with one of Alabama's fine law firms before becoming \nassistant attorney general when I was elected attorney general. He \nhandled the constitutional issues in our office. He was smart, hard \nworking, courageous, intelligent, fair and, more than anybody I know in \nthe legal business today, was committed to the rule of law, to doing \nthe right thing. That is his very nature. That is the way he was \nraised. That is what he believes in and he will stand in there and do \nthe right thing, no matter what others might say, time and time again. \nHis record demonstrates his overriding belief that the law is \npreeminent and it should be obeyed, even if he might disagree and would \nlike to see it different. I want to show some of the things that \ndemonstrate that.\n  I say this because it was alleged when his nomination came up that \nsomehow he had strongly held beliefs, or deeply held beliefs, and those \ndeeply held beliefs were so powerful that, yes, he might be smart, he \nmight be a good lawyer, he might be an honest man and all of these \nthings people said he was, but because he had strongly held beliefs and \nbelieved something and had some convictions and had some moral \nprinciples, that somehow that couldn't be trusted. Maybe he wasn't \nsmooth enough. Maybe his beliefs were so strong this would manipulate \nor cause him to manipulate the law and not be a fair adjudicator of the \nlaw.\n  I will share some thoughts about that because I think what that \noverlooks is his fundamental belief and great strength as a judge and a \nlawyer, which is his belief in the law and the primacy of the law. He \nunderstands, fundamentally, the greatness of our country, more than \nmost people realize, is founded upon our commitment to law. We were \ngiven a great heritage from England. We have built upon that legal \nheritage. As I age and see the world, I know this legal system is what \nmakes our country great. A person can go into any court, a company can \ninvest in any State, and expect in this country they will get a fair \nday in court. You don't have to bribe the judge; you don't have to \nbribe the jury. You can expect a fair, just result, day in, day out, \nand it occurs in our courtrooms all over America. It is a heritage of \nunparalleled\n\n[[Page S6246]]\n\nvalue and we must uphold that heritage. We must adhere to the ideal \nthat law can be ascertained by a good judge and enforced consistently \nwhen litigants come before that judge. That is what we pay judges to \ndo.\n  I want to say the first and foremost legal principle of Judge William \nPryor is that a judge should follow the law, and he has a record to \ndemonstrate it, even when it disagrees with his personal views.\n  First, on the issue of abortion, Judge Pryor has made clear he \npersonally does not believe in abortion. He does not believe it is \nright. He believes it is wrong. It is not just because he is a \nCatholic, it is not just that his views are consistent with the Pope's \nor the Catholic Church of which he is a part, or many other churches \nand leaders in our country, but he has thought about this issue \npersonally and deeply. He has given it serious consideration. He has \nmade a judgment that, in his view, life and freedom and liberty in our \ncountry are diminished if the unborn are not given protection. That is \na legitimate position in America, held by tens of millions of people \nand many leaders in this country. Certainly no one can deny that. \nCertainly, because someone believes the pro-life way is the best way, \nthey should not be disqualified from being a judge.\n  He has concluded Roe v. Wade was not a principled constitutional \ndecision. Ruth Bader Ginsburg, the ACLU lawyer who President Clinton \nnominated to the Supreme Court of the United States, has also raised \nquestions about the constitutional integrity of Roe v. Wade. That is \nhis view about it.\n  What does that mean, though, when it comes to court? Someone's \npersonal views on those matters obviously cannot be the test of whether \na person will go on the bench. Personal views are not the answer here. \nWe cannot look at someone's religious faith or their personal views and \nsay: I disagree with your religious values here, I disagree with your \ntheology there, therefore you cannot be a judge in the United States of \nAmerica.\n  Are we going to ask Muslim nominees to reject their faith before we \nallow them to be confirmed, or some other religious entity with views \ndifferent than I may have or someone else may have? Of course not. That \ncannot be. The test for nominees always must be: Do they respect the \nlaw and will they follow it?\n  Judge Pryor's record shows he will. In August of 1997, not long after \nI had been elected to the Senate and he had become attorney general, \nAlabama passed a partial-birth abortion ban to ban partial-birth \nabortion--a particularly heinous act, in my view, there is strong \nfeeling that this is not a good and decent procedure and that it ought \nto be eliminated.\n  Judge Pryor certainly opposes partial-birth abortion. But as attorney \ngeneral he exercised his supervisory power over the district attorneys \nof the State of Alabama, as given to him as attorney general, and on \nhis own initiative--nobody made him do this--he wrote the district \nattorneys in Alabama a letter and he instructed them--gave them \ninstructions--to utilize only a restrictive interpretation of that \nstatute, because he concluded that portions of the statute were \noverbroad and unconstitutional. The pro-life forces in Alabama were \nangry with this pro-life attorney general because he had followed the \nlaw. He had restricted by his opinion the breadth of that statute; one \neven said he gutted the statute. But he did the right thing in 1997, \nlong before he was ever considered for a Federal judgeship.\n\n  Three years later, the Supreme Court, in the Stenberg case, struck \ndown further the partial-birth abortion statutes of many States. Judge \nPryor, then-attorney general, wrote the district attorneys another \nletter and told them the statute banning partial-birth abortions in \nAlabama was unconstitutional. He did not have to do that. He believed \npersonally that abortion was wrong. He believed that partial-birth \nabortion was certainly wrong. But he wrote them a letter and told them \nnot to even attempt to enforce the Alabama statute, because it had been \nheld unconstitutional by the Supreme Court of the United States.\n  I don't know that attorneys general do that often. They do not have \nto do that. They can let the district attorneys make their own \ndecision. But he felt that was the right thing to do and he did so. In \nhis letter he said: ``You are obligated to obey Stenberg.'' That is a \nclear directive to them.\n  When there were threats on abortion clinics, Judge Pryor held a high-\nprofile press conference in the State warning of prosecutions for those \nwho participated in those attacks. He said those attacks on abortion \nclinics--although he certainly did not favor abortion clinics--were \n``despicable crimes'' against our fellow citizens that would not be \ntolerated and that he would prosecute people who did so.\n  There are some who said his views on church and state are incorrect. \nI will dispute that. I will show he has been courageous in following \nthe law of the United States in this area, as well.\n  Former Gov. Fob James of Alabama, a strict constructionist, \nconservative, and independent Governor if there ever was one--and he \nappointed Judge Pryor to be the attorney general--wanted Judge Pryor to \ndefend prayer in schools. He thought that schools had a right to have \nprayer. He wanted his attorney general, whom he just appointed, to \ndefend it and go to court and to argue in court that the First \nAmendment says ``Congress shall make no laws respecting the \nestablishment of a religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.'' \nIn Governor James's view, that meant Congress could not pass any such \nlaws, but the State of Alabama could and that the Constitution did not \napply to the State of Alabama with regard to those rights under the \nFirst Amendment. Many have tried to make that argument, but the Supreme \nCourt has held otherwise.\n  Though Judge Pryor had just been appointed attorney general by \nGovernor James, he had the courage and followed his duty and just said \nno to the Governor. He told the Governor he could not argue that the \nEstablishment Clause did not apply to the States, because the Supreme \nCourt had already held that it did. The Governor then had to hire his \nown lawyer to promote his idea of the First Amendment.\n  In Attorney General Pryor's brief to the Federal court, he wrote, \ncorrectly, that as attorney general, he spoke for the State of Alabama \nand not Governor James who had just appointed him. Judge Pryor followed \nthe rule of law again when Judge Roy Moore asked him to make certain \narguments in defense of the Ten Commandments statue that Judge Moore \nhad placed in the Alabama Supreme Court building. Attorney General \nPryor considered the request and refused to make those arguments. He \ndid not believe they were consistent with Supreme Court precedent and \ndid not believe that the attorney general for the State of Alabama \nought to make arguments that the Supreme Court had already rejected.\n  When Judge Moore ultimately refused to remove that statue of the Ten \nCommandments, as ordered by a Federal judge, Attorney General Pryor was \nresponsible for prosecuting Judge Moore before the Judicial Inquiry \nCommission. It was his duty as attorney general under the law to \nprosecute and present that case. He did so with fidelity to duty and \neffectiveness. The Commission made a decision and removed Chief Justice \nMoore duly elected by the people of the State of Alabama from office as \nchief justice.\n  They said he is some sort of religious extremist. It is just not so. \nHe is committed, as you can see, to what the law says. In fact, after \nthis controversy over the prayer in schools with the Governor, Attorney \nGeneral Pryor felt it was his duty to clarify for school boards and \nschool principals all over the State what the law actually was, so he \nwrote them a letter defining what could be done with student-led \nprayers in school and what could not be done and what had been held \nunconstitutional by the Supreme Court.\n  The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, a liberal newspaper in Atlanta, \npraised him for his letter and his definition of the appropriate and \ninappropriate expressions of religious faith in schools. And, in fact, \nthe Clinton administration not long thereafter issued their own \nguidelines for schools incorporating much of what Attorney General \nPryor had put in his letter.\n  Some have said, in attacking him, that he does not believe in racial \nequality; that he does not believe in voting rights; and that he is out \nof the mainstream with regard to those issues in\n\n[[Page S6247]]\n\nthe State. Nothing could be further from the truth. For example, on the \n40th anniversary of former Gov. George Wallace's infamous speech in \nwhich he said, on his inauguration, ``segregation today, segregation \ntomorrow, segregation forever,'' Bill Pryor was inaugurated as attorney \ngeneral. He won by 60 percent of the vote. In his inaugural speech he \nchanged those famous words to his own philosophy. This is how he began \nhis inaugural speech: ``Equal justice under the law today, equal \njustice under the law tomorrow, equal justice under the law forever.'' \nThat is his view. That is his belief. That is who he is. It is \nabsolutely unfair, wrong, and even worse, really, to suggest otherwise.\n  One of the things that was an issue in the State raised by a State \nrepresentative, an African American, Alvin Holmes, was that Alabama's \nConstitution still had language in it that banned interracial marriage, \nan old segregationist provision. It was unconstitutional, could not be \nenforced, but the words were still in that constitution. Mr. Holmes \nbelieved it ought to be taken out.\n\n  Attorney General Bill Pryor agreed with him. He did not think that \nwas right. He thought that was a blot and a stain on Alabama's \nConstitution and it ought to be removed. He took action to do so. He \nmentioned it in his inaugural address as one of his priorities, and he \nled the fight to remove it from Alabama's Constitution. That has \nresulted in the steadfast support for his confirmation by State \nrepresentative Alvin Holmes, who said more than any other person--White \nofficeholder in the State--Judge Pryor stood up to remove this stain \nfrom our constitution.\n  He said: ``I'll call anybody you want me to. I'll come to Washington \nto speak on his behalf. This is a good man.'' Alvin Holmes was arrested \nduring the civil rights marches for standing up for freedom. No one in \nthe State of Alabama will deny that he does not believe in equal \njustice and civil rights and in progress for African-American citizens.\n  I have another example of Bill Pryor's fairness in handling issues \nbefore the State. Republicans challenged a State redistricting plan \nwhich, in fact, is quite favorable to the Democrats. It was a \ngerrymandered plan that favored the Democrats. For example, five out of \nthe seven Congressmen in Alabama are Republican. The Governor and both \nSenators are Republicans. But only a third of the legislature are \nRepublicans. Part of that is the way they drew the lines. Republicans \nwere not happy with it. They challenged it on a number of grounds. But \nBill Pryor who is the attorney general for the State of Alabama. He is \nthe lawyer for the State of Alabama. He is a Republican. He felt it was \nhis responsibility to defend the duly enacted laws of the State \nlegislature. He represents the State. The State passed the \nredistricting plan. It was his responsibility to defend it. He did not \nmake some of his friends, and some of my friends, happy. They did not \nlike that.\n  He defended it on a number of grounds. One was a technical procedural \nbasis of standing. He said the plaintiffs did not have standing. They \nwent to the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals, on which he now sits as \na result of an interim recess appointment, and they ruled against him. \nSo the Republicans said: Boy, this is over now. We will win this thing. \nHe said: No, the court of appeals made an error. I believe that you do \nnot have standing to bring this suit. I believe your appeal is not, \ntherefore, well taken. I believe I have a duty as attorney general to \ndefend the duly enacted laws of the State of Alabama.\n  He appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court and won in the U.S. Supreme \nCourt defending a legislative reapportionment plan that clearly favored \nDemocrats and African Americans. They appreciated that. They knew he \nwas a man of principle and integrity and decency. They have appreciated \nthose kind of acts they have seen him carry out.\n  He has taken a strong lead on rights for women as well as minorities. \nWhile he has been attacked in the Senate for an argument he made \nregarding a technical flaw that was in the Violence Against Women Act \npassed by this Congress, his true record on women's issues is reflected \nin his history of fighting to protect women from domestic abuse.\n  He is a supporter of Alabama's Penelope House and participates in \ntheir yearly luncheon where they recognize the importance of partnering \nwith law enforcement to eradicate domestic abuse. He testified before \nCongress in 2003, stressing the importance of the Violence Against \nWomen Act. He championed a bill in Alabama to increase the penalties \nfor repeat violations of protection from abuse orders by judges for \nordering people to cease abusing their spouses. This is the true record \nof Bill Pryor. He has been a leader in the fight against domestic abuse \nthroughout the State. He has incredibly strong support by all the \nwomen's groups who advocate that, including Judge Sue Bell Cobb on the \nAlabama Court of Criminal Appeals, who is a Democrat and who has fought \nfor these women's issues for years.\n  What about other people in the State? How do they think of him? Judge \nPryor has won the support of people such as Joe Reed, probably the most \npowerful political person in the State who is an African American. He \nis on the Democratic National Committee. He chairs the Alabama \nDemocratic Conference. He strongly supports Judge Pryor.\n  Another Pryor supporter is Congressman Artur Davis, an African-\nAmerican Congressman and Harvard Law School graduate. Alvin Holmes, I \nmentioned earlier, is one of the most outspoken African-American \nleaders in the legislature. Yesterday, I had him in my office, an \nAfrican-American State senator who has been in the Senate for many \nyears. I said: ``Senator, do you know an African American--I asked him, \ndid he know of a single elected public official in the State who was \nopposed to Judge Pryor for this appointment?'' He said: ``No, I don't \nknow of a single one. They know he has given them a fair shake, \nsometimes even to the point of taking serious criticism for it. He has \nbeen courageous and steadfast in standing up for equal justice under \nthe law, which is his guiding principle as a judge and as attorney \ngeneral.''\n\n  There is almost, in fact, universal support for Judge Pryor. Former \nDemocratic Governor Don Siegelman, Jerry Beasley, the State's top trial \nlawyer, one of the top trial lawyer Democrats in America, and virtually \nevery newspaper in the State supports Judge Pryor. The very liberal \nAnniston Star newspaper, which supports the filibuster of judges here \nby Democrats, a fine newspaper, but they have been very much a \nDemocratic newspaper--they have supported the filibustering of judges, \nwhich I certainly do not agree with--but they support Judge Pryor. They \nsay he ought to be confirmed. ``He is the kind of person we ought to \nhave on the bench,'' the Anniston Star said. They know his record of \nindependence and courage. They know he is the kind of person we need on \nthe bench.\n  So in closing, I want to say that I believe Judge Pryor has \ndemonstrated time and again the kind of courage and commitment to \nprinciple that are the very values we need judges to possess. We do not \nwant people on the bench who do not have any beliefs. We do not want \npeople who do not have any values.\n  As Lamar Alexander, our colleague, once said, ``Judge Pryor has shown \ncourage in a Southern State unlike anyone he has ever seen before.'' He \nsaid it has almost looked like political suicide, some of the things he \nhas done. But regardless of the cost, he has always done the right \nthing. That is what makes him an ideal candidate for the Eleventh \nCircuit.\n  He is brilliant. He loves the law. He studies it. He cares about it. \nHe wants to see it be better and better and better. He will give his \nlife to that, and you can take it to the bank. He will treat everybody \nbefore him fairly.\n  I thank the Chair, yield the floor, and suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Ensign). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I thought it would be important to share\n\n[[Page S6248]]\n\nin more detail some of the broad bipartisan support that exists in the \nState of Alabama by those who know Judge Pryor. These are Democratic \nleaders, people who are African Americans, who have been involved in \nthe State for many years, who are sensitive to good judgment and good \nleadership. I want to share some of the comments some of these people \nhave written on behalf of Judge Pryor.\n  First, Congressman Artur Davis of the 7th Congressional District \nwrote this letter. Congressman Davis is a Harvard Law graduate and a \nvery fine young Congressman. He said this:\n  I understand that the President may be considering Attorney General \nBill Pryor for a seat on the Eleventh Circuit. I have the utmost \nrespect for my friend Attorney General Pryor and I believe if he is \nselected, Alabama will be proud of his service.\n  Alabama House of Representatives member Alvin Holmes wrote this:\n\n       As one of the key civil rights leaders in Alabama who has \n     participated in basically every major civil rights \n     demonstration in America, who has been arrested for civil \n     rights causes on many occasions, as one who was a field staff \n     member of Dr. Martin Luther King's SCLC [Southern Christian \n     Leadership Conference], as one who has been brutally beaten \n     by vicious police officers for participating in civil rights \n     marches and demonstrations, as one who has had crosses burned \n     in his front yard by the KKK and other hate groups, as one \n     who has lived under constant threats day in and day out \n     because of his stand fighting for the rights of blacks and \n     other minorities, I request your swift confirmation of \n     Bill Pryor to the 11th Circuit because of his constant \n     efforts to help the causes of blacks in Alabama.\n\n  Is that a credible voice? I submit to you it is.\n  The Honorable Sue Bell Cobb, a judge on the Alabama Court of Criminal \nAppeals for quite a number of years, who has been involved in the \nChildren's First Program in Alabama, who has been involved in women's \nissues in Alabama over a number of years, and who has had occasion to \nwork with Attorney General Bill Pryor, wrote this:\n\n       I write, not only as the only statewide Democrat to be \n     elected in 2000, not only as a member of the Court which \n     reviews the greatest portion of General Pryor's work, but \n     also as a child advocate who has labored shoulder to shoulder \n     with General Pryor in the political arena on behalf of \n     Alabama's children. . . . Bill Pryor is an outstanding \n     attorney general and is one of the most righteous elected \n     officials in this state. He possesses two of the most \n     important attributes of a judge: unquestionable integrity and \n     a strong internal moral compass. . . .\n\n  High praise, I submit. She goes on:\n\n       Bill Pryor is exceedingly bright, a lawyer's lawyer. He is \n     as dedicated to the ``Rule of Law'' as anyone I know. I have \n     never known another attorney general'' I guess that includes \n     this one standing before you ``who loved being the `people's \n     lawyer' more than Bill Pryor. Though we may disagree on an \n     issue, I am always confident that the position is a product \n     of complete intellectual honesty. He loves the mental \n     challenge presented by a complex case, yet he never fails to \n     remember that each case impacts people's lives.\n\n  I share with you another statement by Joe Reed, an African American, \na leader in the State for 30 or more years, probably the preeminent \nAfrican-American leader in the State over the last 35 years. He chairs \nthe Alabama Democratic Conference. He is a member of the Democratic \nNational Committee. He is a vice chairman of the Alabama Education \nAssociation. Dr. Joe Reed has always understood the importance of \nFederal courts. He has understood that the civil rights and liberties \nof African-American citizens were enhanced and provided in large part \nby actions of Federal courts. There is no mistaking in his mind on this \nquestion. This is what he said:\n\n       [Attorney General Pryor] is a person, in my opinion, who \n     will uphold the law without fear or favor. I believe all \n     races and colors will get a fair shake when their cases come \n     before him. As Attorney General for Alabama during the past \n     six (6) years, he has been fair to all people. . . .For your \n     information, I am a member of the Democratic National \n     Committee and, of course, Mr. Pryor is [a] Republican, but \n     these are only party labels. I am persuaded that in Mr. \n     Pryor's eyes, Justice has only one label--justice!\n\n  Mr. President, those are just some of the comments we have received \nfrom prominent Alabama leaders of a different party, a different race, \nwho care about justice in America, who have a record of fighting for \nit, and who believe Judge Pryor shares their values in that regard.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Presiding Officer and yield the floor. I \nsee my colleague from Georgia has arrived. We appreciate and look \nforward to hearing from him.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia is recognized.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, first, if the Senator from Alabama will \nremain for a minute, I took the occasion, last week or 2 weeks ago, to \nspend a rather extensive time on the floor, on 2 days, talking about \nJanice Rogers Brown of Alabama, whose appointment was confirmed by this \nSenate. I had the pleasure to meet Justice Brown and meant every word I \nsaid.\n  But I rise today to talk about Judge Pryor because of my tremendous \npersonal admiration for a man whom I have not met but know so much \nabout because of the way he has conducted himself as a human being and \nas an attorney general.\n  I know he succeeded the distinguished Senator from Alabama as \nattorney general; is that not correct?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Correct.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. So he obviously had a good role model to follow. Senator \nSessions' leadership, obviously, contributed greatly to Judge Pryor's \ndistinguished service.\n  But the reason I rise on the floor of the Senate for a second and \nconfirm the reason I am so positively going to cast my vote for his \nconfirmation to the Eleventh Circuit is because he has a magna cum \nlaude degree in law from Tulane University, but he has a master's \ndegree in common sense. He has a Ph.D. in courage.\n  If you study Judge Pryor's record, over and over again, he continues \nto lead himself to decisions based on the fundamental principle, \nbelief, that in all cases you do what is right.\n  I listened to nearly all of the speech of the distinguished Senator \nfrom Alabama. He recited so many examples of where a statement that \nJudge Pryor might have made in the past did not guide him to a decision \nwhen it differed with the law, that he always followed the law to its \nfullest extent, not to interpret it as he saw fit but to execute it as \nhe knew it was intended.\n  I am not a lawyer. I am a real estate guy and a politician. \nObviously, we deal a lot in words but not nearly the discipline of the \nspecifics of the law. I am a citizen of the United States, a father, \nand a businessman. I care deeply about the men and women who will sit \non the bench of our highest courts. If we can have a man with common \nsense and a commitment to right and doing what is right, then we have \nprovided a great service to the people.\n  I also rise as an extension of a great Georgian who has submitted a \nletter, on behalf of Judge Pryor, from which I would like to quote.\n  I also ask unanimous consent that the entire letter be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                            Department of Law,\n\n                                      Atlanta, GA, March 31, 2003.\n     Hon. Richard Shelby,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Jeff Sessions,\n     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators: I have had the great pleasure of knowing and \n     working with Bill Pryor over the past five years. Through the \n     National Association of Attorneys General, Bill and I have \n     worked together on matters of mutual concern to Georgia and \n     Alabama. During that time, Bill has distinguished himself \n     time and again with the legal acumen that he brings to issues \n     of national or regional concern as well as with his \n     commitment to furthering the prospects of good and responsive \n     government.\n       During his tenure as Attorney General, Bill has made \n     combating white-collar crime and public corruption one of the \n     centerpieces of his service to the people of Alabama. He \n     joined the efforts of Attorneys General around the country in \n     fighting the rising tide of identify theft, pushing through \n     legislation in the Alabama legislature making identity theft \n     a felony in Alabama. Bill has fought to keep law enforcement \n     in Alabama armed with appropriate laws to protect Alabama's \n     citizens, pushing for tough money laundering provisions and \n     stiff penalties for trafficking in date rape drugs.\n       Time and again as Attorney General, Bill has taken on \n     public corruption cases in Alabama, regardless of how well-\n     connected the defendant may be, to ensure that the public \n     trust is upheld and the public's confidence in government is \n     well-founded. He has worked with industry groups and the \n     Better Business Bureau to crack down on unscrupulous \n     contractors who victimized many of Alabama's more vulnerable \n     citizens.\n       From the time that he clerked with the late Judge Wisdom of \n     the 5th Circuit to the\n\n[[Page S6249]]\n\n     present, though, the most critical asset that Bill Pryor has \n     brought to the practice of law is his zeal to do what he \n     thinks is right. He has always done what he thought was best \n     for the people of Alabama. Recognizing a wrong that had gone \n     on far too long, he took the opportunity of his inaugural \n     address to call on an end to the ban on inter-racial \n     marriages in Alabama law. Concerned about at-risk kids in \n     Alabama schools, he formed Mentor Alabama, a program designed \n     to pair volunteer mentors with students who needed a role \n     model and an attentive ear to the problems facing them on a \n     daily basis.\n       These are just a few of the qualities that I believe will \n     make Bill Pryor an excellent candidate for a slot on the 11th \n     Circuit Court of Appeals. My only regret is that I will no \n     longer have Bill as a fellow Attorney General fighting for \n     what is right, but I know that his work on the bench will \n     continue to serve as an example of how the public trust \n     should be upheld.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Thurbert E. Baker.\n\n  Mr. ISAKSON. The attorney general of the State of Georgia is my dear \nfriend, Thurbert Baker. He is a Democrat, an African American, and a \nclose friend with whom I served in the Georgia House of \nRepresentatives. On March 31, 2003, Thurbert Baker wrote to Senator \nRichard Shelby and Senator Jeff Sessions his personal feelings about \nthe nomination of Judge Pryor. I want to read a few excerpts from that \nletter.\n\n       During his tenure as Attorney General, Bill has made \n     combating white-collar crime and public corruption one of the \n     centerpieces of his service to the people of Alabama. He \n     joined the efforts of Attorneys General around the country in \n     fighting the rising tide of identity theft, pushing through \n     legislation in the Alabama legislature making identity theft \n     a felony in Alabama. Bill has fought to keep law enforcement \n     in Alabama armed with appropriate laws to protect Alabama's \n     citizens, pushing for tough money laundering provisions and \n     stiff penalties for trafficking and in date rape drugs.\n\n  The importance of that quote is how consistent that is with what our \nattorney general, Thurbert Baker, has done in Georgia; in particular, \nin his fights on white-collar crime, on trafficking, on drugs, and his \nconfirmation of Judge Pryor's commitment to the same.\n  I continue to quote:\n\n       Time and again as Attorney General, Bill has taken on \n     public corruption cases in Alabama, regardless of how well-\n     connected the defendant may be, to ensure that the public \n     trust is upheld and the public's confidence in government is \n     well-founded. He has worked with industry groups and the \n     Better Business Bureau to crack down on unscrupulous \n     contractors who victimized many of Alabama's more vulnerable \n     citizens.\n\n  The operative words in that quote refer to the courage I mentioned \nearlier; Judge Pryor, as attorney general, courageously and without \nfear took on anyone, regardless of stature and political standing, in \norder to see to it the people of Alabama were protected, their rights \nwere protected and right itself was done and any wrong, regardless of \nthe perpetrator, was prosecuted.\n  I continue to quote:\n\n       From the time he clerked with the late Judge Wisdom of the \n     5th Circuit to the present, though, the most critical asset \n     that Bill Pryor has brought to the practice of law is his \n     zeal to do what [is the right thing to do]. He has always \n     done what he thought was best for the people of Alabama. \n     Recognizing a wrong that has gone too far [and too long], he \n     took the opportunity in his inaugural address to call on an \n     end to the ban on inter-racial marriage in the State of \n     Alabama. Concerned about at-risk kids in schools, he formed \n     Mentor Alabama, a program designed to pair volunteer mentors \n     with students who needed a role model and an attentive ear to \n     the problems facing them on a daily basis.\n\n  As a member of the legislature in Georgia, one who worked on kids' \nprograms, I know so much about the value of mentoring and the programs \nestablished such as Mentor Alabama that fundamentally change lives. For \na man whose job it is to prosecute the law on behalf of the people of \nAlabama, to illustrate his desire for the future by, at the same time, \ndeveloping a mentoring program so that the youth of Alabama would go on \nthe right track in life--not the wrong--shows his absolute commitment \nto right, his absolute commitment to his fellow man, his absolute \ncommitment to those who have been less fortunate.\n  I close with one last quote from this letter:\n\n       My only regret is that I will no longer have Bill as a \n     fellow Attorney General, fighting for what is right, but I \n     know that his work on the bench will continue to serve as an \n     example of how the public trust should be upheld.\n\n  Bill Pryor has been waiting for this day for some time. I am grateful \nto Senators who allowed the cloture vote to take place and voted in \nfavor of giving a chance for Judge Pryor to receive an up-or-down vote \non his confirmation to his nomination to the Eleventh Circuit Court of \nAppeals. I am confident that later today when we cast our vote--and I \nwill cast mine in favor of Judge Pryor--the majority of this Senate \nwill confirm a man whose record is impeccable, whose commitment is to \ndoing what is right, whose belief is in the people of this country, in \nthe fundamental foundations of the law and its strict interpretation \nand application. I commend to all Members of the Senate Judge Bill \nPryor of Alabama for his confirmation.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, is the Senate in morning business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate is on the nomination of William \nPryor. The majority controls the time until 11:30 a.m.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I yield myself 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise today to address the nomination \nof William H. Pryor, Jr., to be a U.S. circuit judge for the Eleventh \nCircuit.\n  Many of my colleagues know that I am Catholic by religion and belief. \nAs such, I have watched the debate over Judge Pryor, an acknowledged \ndevout Catholic, with much interest.\n  I start by saying, and I want to be very clear about this point, that \nI do not believe any of my colleagues are anti-Catholic. However, I am \nbecoming increasingly concerned about the apparent creation of some \nkind of religious litmus test for nominees. I would like to provide a \nsample of some of the questions posed to Judge Pryor during his \nconfirmation process that I think justify my concern that a nominee's \nreligion is becoming some kind of a central part of the confirmation \nprocess.\n  It concerns me when, in the Judiciary Committee, statements such as \nthese are made:\n\n       Judge Pryor's beliefs are so well known, so deeply held, \n     that it is very hard to believe, very hard to believe, that \n     they are not going to deeply influence the way he comes about \n     saying, ``I will follow the law.''\n\n  Another:\n\n       I think the very legitimate issue in question with your \n     nomination is whether you have an agenda, that many of the \n     positions which you have taken reflect not just an advocacy \n     but a very deeply held view and a philosophy.\n\n  Third:\n\n       Virtually in every area you have extraordinarily strong \n     views which continue and come out in a number of different \n     ways. Your comments about Roe make one believe, could he \n     really, suddenly, move away from those comments and be a \n     judge?\n\n  It concerns me that these questions continued despite the fact that \nJudge Pryor's record in Alabama as attorney general shows that he can \nand has separated his personal beliefs from his professional \nobligations.\n  As Alabama's attorney general, Judge Pryor argued that there should \nbe no school-sponsored, government-sponsored religious activity, but \ngenuinely student-initiated religious expression was protected by the \nFirst Amendment. I believe he expressly stated the view that the \nSupreme Court has held in that regard, regardless of his beliefs.\n  Second, he issued an opinion stating that Alabama's partial-birth \nabortion law was unconstitutional and could not be enforced. I believe \nhe followed the law.\n  Third, he personally prosecuted charges against Alabama's Justice \nMoore for refusing to obey a court order to remove the Ten Commandments \nfrom a display in the Alabama State courthouse.\n  The quotes I have referenced and the fact that some Democrats have \npersisted with this line of questioning despite clear evidence that \nJudge Pryor is committed to both religious freedom and separation of \nchurch and state concern me not because I am accusing anyone on the \nother side of being anti-\n\n[[Page S6250]]\n\nCatholic or anti-religion; rather, statements such as these make me \nfear that we are creating some kind of a religious litmus test for \nnominees. A nominee's religious beliefs have no connection to fitness \nto serve on the Federal bench.\n  It seems to me that such questions suggest that anybody who is an \nOrthodox Jew, deep-seated Christian, Protestant, Muslim, or devout \nCatholic should be rigorously questioned about their religious beliefs. \nBut I believe their beliefs should not in any way affect them becoming \nFederal judges. These type of questions effectively say to people in \nthe United States: Perhaps if you have deeply held religious beliefs, \nyou cannot serve on the Supreme Court, you cannot serve in the Federal \njudiciary.\n  I believe we should rid the record of any such inferences, and I am \njust trying to do that today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I ask for 1 additional minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, this is an alarming prospect. The Senate \nshould consider the nominee on his professional record, not on his \npersonal beliefs. I believe this distinguished nominee should be \nconfirmed.\n  I yield the floor. I thank the Senate for listening.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sessions). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, what is the regular order?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority controls the time until noon, but \nthe Senator may be recognized.\n  Mr. GREGG. I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed to speak as in \nmorning business for 10 minutes, and if some member of the minority \nappears I will be happy to yield to allow them to proceed under their \ntime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Ensign). Without objection, it is so \nordered. The Senator is recognized.\n  (The remarks of Mr. GREGG and Mr. SESSIONS are printed in today's \nRecord under ``Morning Business.'')\n  Mr. GREGG. I thank the Senator from Alabama. I obviously enjoy \nworking with him because he is a voice of reason around here.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, what is the order of business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority controls the time until noon.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, it is a few minutes to 12. I ask \nunanimous consent that I be able to speak in morning business. If any \nof my colleagues from the other side come to the floor, I will be \npleased to yield to them.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, we have spent over 2 years on the Bill \nPryor nomination for the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals. He is an \nextraordinary man and an extraordinary jurist, now that he is holding \nthat seat as a recess appointment. But a number of allegations have \nbeen made against him that I think caused some in this body to form an \nimpression of him early on that was not correct.\n  One of the most prominent was an allegation that he was insensitive \nto the disabled. People For the American Way, who issued their attack \nsheet report--and I hope our colleagues will begin to look far more \ncritically at their work than they have in the past--stated it this \nway:\n\n       Of particular concern are Pryor's views on the limits on \n     Congress' authority to enact laws protecting individual and \n     other rights, and how he would seek to implement those laws \n     if confirmed. Pryor is one of the architects of this movement \n     and has been a leading activist in these damaging efforts. He \n     personally has been involved in key Supreme Court cases that, \n     by narrow 5 to 4 majorities, have hobbled Congress's ability \n     to protect Americans' rights against discrimination and \n     injury based on disability, race, or age.\n\n  That is part of their report and part of their complaint. At the time \nhe was originally nominated, a number of people from the disabled \ncommunity were told Judge Pryor is against them and that they should \ncome. They came and spoke out against him. But truly I do not think \nthey understood what the complaint was all about.\n  Let me share with you what happened. One of the State universities in \nAlabama was involved in a lawsuit about disability rights. The case was \nUniversity of Alabama at Birmingham v. Garrett. It goes up for \nlitigation. The Attorney General of the State of Alabama was Bill \nPryor. It is his duty as a lawyer to defend his client. As an entity of \nthe State, the university is a client of the State of Alabama, so he \ndid so. One of the defenses he raised, and raised brilliantly, dealt \nwith this act, the ADA. Only 3 percent of the people in Alabama work \nfor the State of Alabama. So the defense he raised impacted only State \nemployees, that is 3 percent of the people, although repeatedly \nannouncements were made that he was gutting the ADA. That is the first \npoint.\n  Second, what the attorney general of Alabama argued was that, yes, if \na person were to be dismissed or otherwise not handled fairly as a \nresult of a disability, they could sue the State under the Americans \nwith Disabilities Act, they could get an injunction, a court order to \nensure that they were treated fairly by the State of Alabama, they \ncould get back wages if they had been terminated--but that provision of \nthe act that allowed individuals to sue for money damages against \ncorporations--and 97 percent of the people work for private employers \nand corporations and not State governments--that provision could not be \nenforceable because a State has sovereign immunity protection against \nsuits for money damages. States can only be sued on grounds that they \nagree to be sued on, because the power to sue is the power to destroy. \nThat is constitutional history. And States do not allow themselves to \nbe sued except under certain circumstances, and he argued that the \nCongress could not abrogate that historic constitutional principle of \nsovereign immunity by passing a statute--without giving any thought to \nthe issue. Anyway, they passed it focusing mainly on private employers, \nnot States. He appealed that to the U.S. Supreme Court and won the case \nin the U.S. Supreme Court.\n  Now they say what he was doing was an indication that he is \ninsensitive to people who are disabled. I raise that issue because it \nis not fair to him, and it demeans our entire process.\n\n  I see the Senator from Tennessee is in the Senate, Senator Alexander. \nI know he is interested in this nomination. I am pleased to yield to \nthe Senator from Tennessee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. GRAHAM). The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Alabama. I am \ndelighted to have a chance to join him in support of Judge Pryor. I \nwill take a few minutes on that, and when I finish, I will ask \nunanimous consent to speak for up to 5 minutes as in morning business \non another matter.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, none of us, if we end up in court, want \nto go before a judge who has already decided the case before we get \nthere. There is an old story from the Tennessee mountains about the \nlawyers who showed up in court and the judge says: ``Fellas, this \nshouldn't take long. I had a phone call last night, and I know most of \nthe facts. Just give me a little bit on the law.'' I don't think those \nlitigants felt very good about their appearance before that judge.\n  We do not want judges who decide the case before they hear the \nargument, either because they got a phone call the night before or \nbecause they bring some personal or political agenda to the case. We \nwant judges who are fair. We want judges who are independent. We want \njudges who are intelligent, who have good character, who\n\n[[Page S6251]]\n\nknow the law, and who are willing to apply it in a fearless way.\n  As Governor of Tennessee, I appointed about 50 judges. I appointed \nmen and women, Democrats and Republicans. I appointed the first \nAfrican-American Supreme Court justice, the first African-American \nchancellor in our State who happened to be a Democrat. I never asked \nhow they felt about abortion. I never asked them how they were going to \ndecide cases. I tried to assess their reputation for intelligence and \nfairness, their demeanor, and whether they would treat those who \nappeared before them with respect. That turned out to be a pretty good \nformula.\n  If we are looking for a member of the U.S. appellate court who has \ndemonstrated before he takes the bench that he can make decisions \nindependent of his personal views, then Judge William Pryor ought to be \nexhibit A, No. 1. As has been pointed out many times, Judge Pryor has \nbeen very honest with the committee and all who question him. He is \npro-life. He opposes partial-birth abortion. But as attorney general of \nAlabama in August of 1997, on his own initiative, he wrote the district \nattorneys general of Alabama and instructed them to use a restrictive \ninterpretation of the partial-birth abortion bill in Alabama, gutting \nthe statute, some said, in Alabama. Three years later, General Pryor, \nafter further Supreme Court cases, wrote the Alabama district attorneys \ntelling them that the Alabama partial-birth abortion law was \nunconstitutional. He was pro-life, but the law said it was \nunconstitutional. He followed the law.\n  When there were threats of attacks against abortion clinics in \nAlabama, the attorney general could have waited for something to \nhappen. He did not. He held high-profile press conferences to condemn \nwhat he called ``despicable acts.'' He warned there would be \nprosecutions if those acts actually occurred.\n  William Pryor told the committee he is a religious man. He, \nobviously, is a deeply religious person. But he told the Governor, who \nhad just appointed him attorney general of Alabama, to get himself \nanother lawyer when the Governor wanted him to argue a prayer-in-the-\nschools case that General Pryor thought compelled him to take a \nposition contrary to the U.S. Supreme Court's interpretation of the \nConstitution.\n  He prosecuted the chief justice of the Alabama Supreme Court for his \nrefusal to take actions to remove the Ten Commandments, not because he \ndoes not believe in the Ten Commandments, which he does, but because he \nbelieves in the law, and his job was to enforce the law.\n  He has proven his sensitivity toward civil rights, which for those \nwho have grown up in the South is even more important. In his inaugural \naddress, he pledged to remove the ban on interracial marriage and led \nthe fight to pass a constitutional amendment to do it. One might say, \nOf course he should have done that. Well, go down to Alabama and make \nthat your first announcement in a new public position at that time in \nour Nation's history. It took courage and it took principle to do it. \nHe did it.\n\n  He is a Republican, but he appealed the Alabama reapportionment plan \nto the U.S. Supreme Court, to the dismay of the Republican Party, and \nhe won it for the Democrat Party.\n  It is fair to say that Judge William Pryor has compiled for himself \nat a relatively young age a record that would make it virtually \nimpossible for him to win a Republican primary in Alabama but a record \nthat ought to make him a perfect candidate for the U.S. court of \nappeals.\n  Of course, there is always the question with these men and women who \ncome before the Senate of whether they are qualified. We can look at \nthe facts. William Pryor is a magna cum laude graduate of Tulane law \nschool, one of the great law schools of our country. He was editor and \nchief of the Tulane Law Journal.\n  My favorite example of his competence is that he was a law clerk to \nthe Honorable John Minor Wisdom, perhaps the greatest appellate court \njudge of the last 50 years, whose 100th birthday would have been May \n21. I know about his birthday because I knew the judge very well. I was \nhis law clerk, too. I hasten to add that I didn't quite qualify to be a \nlaw clerk in 1965 and 1966. He already had a smart graduate from \nHarvard. But he said: I need two, and I will hire you as a messenger. \nIf you work for $300 a month, I will treat you like a law clerk.\n  Judge Wisdom is the one who ordered James Meredith to be admitted to \nOle Miss, and he, with Judge Tuttle and Judge Rives, presided other \ndesegregation of the South. He hired as his law clerks some of the most \ndistinguished men and women now in the private practice of law anywhere \nin the America. I know many of them.\n  Judge Pryor was in New Orleans on May 21 to celebrate Judge Wisdom's \n100th birthday, along with about 40 other law clerks, even though Judge \nWisdom himself is not still living. I know the respect Judge Wisdom had \nfor Judge Pryor's competence. He has demonstrated his independence, he \nhas demonstrated his intelligence, and he has demonstrated he will be \nan extraordinary judge.\n  I was disappointed at what I heard when the Presiding Officer and I \ncame to the Senate a little over 2\\1/2\\ years ago. I was preparing to \nmake my maiden address on American history and civics, and we found \nourselves in this terrible debate about Miguel Estrada. I was \nastonished by it, to tell the truth. I found myself feeling the same \nway about discussions of Judge Pickering in Mississippi, a man whose \nreputation I knew. When I studied that reputation, I found a man out \nfront in the civil rights debate of the 1960s and 1970s, putting his \nchildren in public schools in Mississippi in the 1960s when everyone \nelse was sending them to what they called segregation academies, and \ntestifying against the grand wizard of the Ku Klux Klan in the mid-\n1960s when that was a dangerous thing to do.\n  I heard some of my colleagues questioning his commitment to civil \nrights. Where were they in 1965, 1966, and 1967? What was going on?\n  I was very disappointed when I heard these comments about Judge \nPickering. And he withdrew. I heard the comments about Miguel Estrada, \na tremendous American success story. And he withdrew. So I pledged, \nthen and there, I would never filibuster any President's judicial \nnominee, period. I might vote against them, but I will always see they \ncame to a vote.\n  I am glad to see--and the Presiding Officer had something to do with \nit--that the logjam has been broken. Maybe we can get back to business \nas usual in the Senate where the President, after consulting with us, \nsends us good nominees, we look them over and take as long as we want \nto talk about them, and then we vote on them. I am glad we have a \nchance to vote on Judge Pryor.\n  We do not want judges whose views are decided by a political agenda \nor by a phone call that comes in the night before. Judge Wisdom had \nabsolute confidence in William Pryor when he appointed him as his law \nclerk. He was proud of his service as attorney general of Alabama. He \nis not here today to say what he thinks of him, but I am glad that I am \nhere today to say I will be proud to cast my vote for William Pryor for \nU.S. circuit judge.\n  Mr. President, I received permission to speak on another subject as \nif in morning business, and I would like to proceed to that.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Alexander pertaining to the introduction of S. \n1208 are located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced \nBills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Alabama for \nhis time, and I join him in my enthusiasm for the nominee for the U.S. \ncourt of appeals from his home State, William Pryor.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Tennessee for \nhis very important remarks on the Pryor nomination. He is wise in \nanalyzing the realities of being an attorney general in America and the \ndifficult choices and political pressures that are on attorneys \ngeneral.\n  He is absolutely correct that Attorney General Bill Pryor has \ndemonstrated he has the courage to do the right thing regardless of \nshort-term complaints that might arise. That is so fundamentally \nobvious to people who get a fair look at it and I am amazed it has not \nbeen clear to some of our colleagues.\n  I thank the Senator from Tennessee for sharing his thoughts.\n\n[[Page S6252]]\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the distinguished \nmajority whip and I be allowed to engage in a colloquy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I say to my friend from Alabama, I \nunderstand that Judge Pryor has been criticized because he has \nsincerely held beliefs against abortion and has also criticized the \nruling in Roe v. Wade?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. That is correct. He answered questions about that, \nclearly and directly.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. But it is also true, is it not, I say to my friend \nfrom Alabama, that Judge Pryor swore under oath--under oath--at his \nhearing that he would faithfully apply the law, and included in that, \nof course, is Supreme Court precedent?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. As a matter of fact, he was asked explicitly about that \nin the Judiciary hearings. I am a member of that committee, and the \nphrase he used, I say to you, Senator McConnell, was ``Senator, you can \ntake it to the bank.'' And he is the kind of man who, when he says it, \nhe means it.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Well, he has had an opportunity to demonstrate that, \nhas he not, I say to my friend from Alabama, with respect to the laws \nregulating abortion? He has been in a position to demonstrate that he \nis willing to set aside his personally held views and apply the law as \nit is, has he not?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. He really has. I think that is so important for us here \nas we consider a nominee. Surely, we can't vote for or against a \nnominee on whether they agree with us on any number of a host of moral \nand religious issues. But these are the facts on it. Although he is a \npro-life individual--in 1997, Alabama banned partial-birth abortion by \nState statute. As attorney general, Judge Pryor was aware that parts of \nthat statute had gone too far under the current state of the law, so he \nissued a letter, a directive, to the district attorneys throughout the \nState of Alabama telling them that they could only construe that \nstatute narrowly because it would violate, otherwise, the Constitution \nas defined by the U.S. Supreme Court.\n  As a matter of fact, the ACLU praised him at that time in 1997 for \nhis directive. And, as a matter of fact, one of the pro-life leaders \nsaid he gutted the statute.\n  Then, I say to you, Senator McConnell, a few years later, in 2000, \nwhen the Supreme Court ruled on the Stenberg case, in which they really \noverruled many State statutes involving the partial-birth abortion law, \nAttorney General Pryor recognized and advised the district attorneys \nthat statute was not sound and called on the State legislature to craft \na statute consistent with the Supreme Court. And when he wrote the \nState officials, he said that they ``are obligated to obey [the \nStenberg decision].''\n  Mr. McCONNELL. The attorney general of Alabama is an elected \nposition; is it not?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. It is an elected position.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. So Judge Pryor did not have the protection of a \nlifetime appointment or even a lengthy term. Here is an official in \nAlabama basically telling a bunch of Alabama local officials they ought \nto comply with a Supreme Court decision that was overwhelmingly \nunpopular in Alabama; is that correct?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. That is exactly correct, I say to the Senator, \nabsolutely correct. People in Alabama, I think as most Americans, \nbelieve that partial-birth abortion, at any rate, is a particularly \ngruesome procedure, and he had a lot of pressure on him to declare \notherwise. In fact, he was criticized by friends who thought he had not \nbeen supportive of their view.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. It would have been very politically convenient for him \nto do that; would it not?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Absolutely. I think the point is that he understands \nthe importance of adhering to the rule of law even though it may \ndisagree with positions you feel strongly about.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. With regard to his criticism of Roe v. Wade, I ask my \nfriend from Alabama, is it not also the case that some very prominent \nliberals in this country, who probably no doubt liked the outcome of \nRoe v. Wade, were, nevertheless, highly critical of the Supreme Court's \nreasoning and rationale for issuing that particular judgment?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. That is correct.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. So there is nothing particularly unusual or unique \nabout a good lawyer, or certainly a lawyer in a prominent position like \nattorney general, at the time, Bill Pryor, critiquing the decision, \nwholly aside from what their personal views were, because a number of \nprominent liberals, I think, have done the same thing; have they not?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. That is exactly right. And the attorney general is an \nelected person in Alabama. He has a right to comment on decisions of \nthe Supreme Court. I think attorneys general and lawyers and laymen all \nover the country do that on a daily basis. The question is, Will you \nfollow it even if you do not agree?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. In fact, Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg \ncriticized the Supreme Court's approach in the Roe case. I bet many of \nour colleagues would be surprised to learn that she described Roe as a \n``breathtaking'' decision whose ``[h]eavy-handed judicial intervention \nwas difficult to justify.'' That is Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who, no doubt, \nliked the outcome in Roe, but found the decision, as she put it, \n``breathtaking'' and a ``[h]eavy-handed judicial intervention [that] \nwas difficult to justify.''\n  So here was someone whose personal views were probably opposite of \nJudge Pryor's, but who reached the same conclusion as Judge Pryor did \nabout the rationale for the decision, the basis of the decision.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I think that is a very good point, I say to you, \nSenator McConnell. I know that, for example, Justice Ginsburg was an \nACLU, American Civil Liberties Union, lawyer. Yet she was troubled by \nthe reasoning and rationale in some of the matters in Roe v. Wade. And \nshe did not mince words about it in terms of the public policy result \nin Roe, nor did she condemn people who criticized Roe. She fully \nunderstood it was legitimate to discuss that important Supreme Court \ncase. In fact, she wrote:\n\n       I appreciate the intense divisions of opinion on the moral \n     question and recognize that abortion today cannot fairly be \n     described as nothing more than birth control delayed.\n\n  So I think she was expressing real sympathy and respect for those who \nmay disagree with the decision, even as she expressed concern with the \ndecision.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I ask my friend from Alabama if he is aware that \nliberal constitutional scholar and current Harvard law professor, \nLaurence Tribe--often quoted by Members on the other side as the \nauthority on many issues of constitutional law--described Roe as a \n``verbal smokescreen,'' and noted that ``the substantive judgment on \nwhich it rests is nowhere to be found.'' This is Laurence Tribe \ncommenting on Roe v. Wade. Even though, no doubt, he likes the result \nof Roe v. Wade, he is nevertheless criticizing the rationale for it.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Well, the Senator is exactly correct. Conservatives and \nliberals alike have raised questions about different aspects of Roe v. \nWade. It is perfectly natural that they would do so, I think.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I believe liberal law professor Cass Sunstein from the \nUniversity of Chicago--who was reported to have advised our Democratic \ncolleagues on the need to ``change the ground rules'' on judicial \nnominations, which led us into the impasse we were in last Congress--\nnoted that there are ``notorious difficulties'' with Roe v. Wade. Is my \nfriend from Alabama familiar with that, as well?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Yes, I am.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I could go on with a list of liberal scholars and \ncommentators who criticized Roe very directly, but I think my friend \nfrom Alabama and I hope all of our colleagues get the drift.\n  I do have just one more question for the Senator from Alabama. Does \nhe remember President Bush's nomination of Michael McConnell to the \nTenth Circuit?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Yes, I do. I believe he was confirmed by unanimous \nconsent.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Unanimous consent. Out here on the Senate floor, \npassed on a voice vote.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Yes.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Although I am not on the Judiciary Committee now, I \nwas\n\n[[Page S6253]]\n\nat the time of the McConnell nomination. I recall that Judge McConnell \nwas then a law professor who had criticized Roe frequently and at great \nlength; is that correct?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. That is correct.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. But just like Judge Pryor, he swore to uphold Supreme \nCourt precedent; did he not?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. He did.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. So I want to make sure I have this correct. Both Judge \nPryor and Judge McConnell criticized Roe v. Wade, both swore under oath \nthey would follow Supreme Court precedents, including those they may \npersonally disagree with, but unlike Judge McConnell, who was a law \nprofessor at the time of his nomination and did not have the \nopportunity as an academic to enforce the law, Judge Pryor has been a \npublic official who has had the chance, on repeated occasions, to put \nhis money where his mouth was, and he has consistently followed the \nlaw?\n  Our Democratic colleagues confirmed Judge McConnell by unanimous \nconsent but are vigorously objecting to Judge Pryor; is that the case?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. That is the case.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I am puzzled. On this record, our friends' objections \nto Judge Pryor seem inconsistent and arbitrary.\n  I thank the Senator from Alabama for his time and remind our \ncolleagues that we have confirmed Democratic nominees who have had deep \npersonal objections to Supreme Court precedent. I recall we confirmed \nJanet Reno 98 to 0, even though her personal views on the death penalty \nwere at odds with Supreme Court precedent. We ought not have a double \nstandard. We should applaud Judge Pryor for his forthrightness and his \ncommitment to the rule of law, and we ought to confirm this \ndistinguished nominee.\n  I also want to say to my friend from Alabama, I know he probably \nknows Judge Pryor better than anybody else in the Senate and has had a \ngreater opportunity to evaluate his integrity, his intellect, and has \nreally seen him in action. I think our colleagues ought to listen to \nthe junior Senator from Alabama because he really knows Bill Pryor and \ncan attest to the fact that Bill Pryor took actions much like Judge \nPickering did in the 1960s, to which Senator Alexander was referring, \nthat took extraordinary courage given the climate of public opinion in \nthe State of Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The 30-minute segment has expired.\n  The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, today the Senate is considering the \nnomination of William Pryor for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the \nEleventh Circuit. This is a nomination which I have considered many \ntimes in the Senate Judiciary Committee and outside the regular \nbusiness of Congress. Senator Jeff Sessions and I occasionally get up \nearly in the morning and go to the Senate gym. And on several occasions \nhe has raised with me his heartfelt support for William Pryor. I have \nexpressed to him my reservations and concerns about Mr. Pryor, and he \nhas tried to assure me, in different ways, that the public image of \nthis man is much different than who he really is. I struggle with this \nbecause I do count Senator Sessions as a friend despite our many \npolitical differences. I would like to give him the benefit of the \ndoubt on this nominee who is so important to him personally.\n  Unfortunately, the debate that leads up to today's consideration on \nthe floor has raised a myriad of questions that need to be resolved, \nquestions which go to the heart of this nomination.\n  Mr. Pryor was recess-appointed by President Bush when both he and \nJudge Pickering of Mississippi were not approved by the Senate. It was \nhistoric. It was a decision by the President to use his recess \nappointment power to put Mr. Pryor on the bench, despite the Senate's \ndecision on his nomination. I agree with Senator Kennedy that Mr. \nPryor's recess appointment, which occurred during a brief recess of \nCongress, could easily be unconstitutional. It was certainly \nconfrontational. Recess appointments lack the permanence and \nindependence contemplated by the Framers of the Constitution. To \nconfirm Mr. Pryor now would validate the President's regrettable \ndecision to defy the Senate.\n  I am afraid that many aspects of the debate, relative to the Pryor \nnomination, mark a low point in Congress. Many of Mr. Pryor's \nsupporters allege that those of us who questioned his nomination or \nopposed him did so because of his religious beliefs. The same ugly \nallegation was raised more broadly at the recent Justice Sunday event \nwhich took place in a church in Kentucky and featured remarks by \nMajority Leader William Frist. The allegation that any Member of the \nSenate is opposing this nomination because of the nominee's religious \nbeliefs is just wrong. In fact, it is not only wrong, it is outrageous.\n  Article 6 of the Constitution, which we keep at hand here on the \nfloor, makes it clear that it is unconstitutional to use any form of \nreligious test for a person who is seeking an office of public trust. \nTo suggest that those of us who oppose Mr. Pryor--or any of the \nPresident's judicial nominees--are violating this article of the \nConstitution is out of line.\n  I am troubled, too, by the logic of this position. It appears that \nMr. Pryor's supporters believe that if he can answer any of our \nquestions about public policy, if the position he takes is based on his \nreligious belief, then at that point we can't pursue the question, that \nit is a matter of his personal conscience. But think about that for a \nmoment. I am a member of the Catholic Church. Some Catholics do not \nsupport the death penalty. The late Pope John Paul II himself strongly \nopposed capital punishment. Some Christian Scientists do not support \nmany aspects of medical treatment. Some Quakers do not support war. \nSome people because of their religious beliefs have strong views on the \nrole of women in society, strong views on divorce, on sexual \norientation. I can't believe it is the position of Mr. Pryor's \nadvocates that Senators could not raise legitimate concerns about \npositions on public issues if there is any nexus to a nominee's \nreligious belief.\n  Think of all of the areas where we would, frankly, be unable to even \nask a question because the person could say: I am sorry. That is my \nreligious belief, and you can't ask about that.\n  The reality is that certain important issues at the center of legal \nand legislative activity are public issues and religious issues. To \nsuggest the Senate cannot ask a nominee questions about these public \nissues would prohibit us from fulfilling our constitutional obligation. \nIt is not Mr. Pryor's religious affiliation that is troubling. It is \nhis history of putting his own personal beliefs ahead of the \nConstitution. He is a staunch judicial activist. Maybe he doesn't reach \nthe level of Janice Rogers Brown, who was approved yesterday--the most \nradical nominee sent to us by the Bush White House--but, sadly, some of \nhis public comments are close.\n  William Pryor believes it is the job of a Federal judge to carry out \nthe political agenda of the President. How else could you interpret his \ncomment about the Bush v. Gore case in 2000, when he said:\n\n       I'm probably the only one who wanted it 5-4. I wanted \n     Governor Bush to have a full appreciation of the judiciary \n     and judicial selection so we can have no more appointments \n     like Justice Souter.\n\n  These are the words of William Pryor. Does that suggest to you that \nhe is looking for a nonpartisan judiciary? Sadly, it suggests the \nopposite. He is looking for a bench filled with partisans of his \nstripe, and he used that case as a lesson to the White House: Be \ncareful, if you pick someone who is independent, they may just rule \nagainst you on a political issue. Those are hardly the kind of words \nyou want coming from the mouth of a man who wants to ascend to the \nsecond highest court in America.\n  On another occasion, Mr. Pryor stated:\n\n       [O]ur real last hope for federalism is the election of Gov. \n     George W. Bush as president of the United States, who has \n     said his favorite justices are Antonin Scalia and Clarence \n     Thomas.\n       Although the ACLU would argue that it is unconstitutional \n     for me, as a public official, to do this in a government \n     building, let alone at a football game, I will end my prayer \n     for the next administration: Please God, no more Souters.\n\n  He was referring again to Justice Souter on the Supreme Court. I \nasked\n\n[[Page S6254]]\n\nMr. Pryor, a Federalist Society member, whether he agrees with the \nmission statement of the Federalist Society, where he pays his dues and \nattends meetings. It reads:\n\n       Law schools and the legal profession are currently strongly \n     dominated by a form of orthodox liberal ideology which \n     advocates a centralized and uniform society.\n\n  I have asked this question of almost every Federalist Society member \nnominated by President Bush, and there have been quite a few. Mr. Pryor \nis the only person who gave me a one-word answer: ``Yes.''\n  I appreciate his honesty, but I am troubled by his beliefs. Mr. Pryor \nis just over 40 years old. If confirmed, he will have the chance to put \nthis philosophy into practice well into the 21st century with a \nlifetime appointment.\n  It is not just law and politics that Mr. Pryor has problems keeping \nseparate. He has problems with the separation of church and State. I am \nconcerned about his blurring of a very important line when it comes to \nthe conduct of government vis-a-vis religion. He is so ideological \nabout this issue that he has confessed:\n\n       I became a lawyer because I wanted to fight the ACLU.\n\n  The ACLU is one of the main defenders of the separation of church and \nState. I asked Mr. Pryor if he would be willing to recuse himself in \ncases involving the ACLU because he has made his views very clear that \nhe cannot be objective. He said no. But he pledged:\n\n       As a judge, I would fairly evaluate any case brought before \n     me in which the ACLU was involved.\n\n  It is hard to believe that he could follow that pledge. This is a man \nwho, by his own admission, became a lawyer so that he could ``fight the \nACLU.'' Now he tells us he will be objective on their cases.\n  Many of you remember Alabama Chief Justice Roy Moore and his midnight \ninstallation a few years ago of a 6,000-pound granite Ten Commandments \nmonument in the middle of the Alabama State courthouse. Mr. Pryor and \nhis supporters like to point out that Mr. Pryor criticized Chief \nJustice Moore for defying a Federal court order to remove the monument. \nWhat they don't like to talk about nearly as much or nearly as openly \nis the fact that Mr. Pryor was an early supporter of Chief Justice Roy \nMoore. He represented Moore vigorously in the litigation of this issue.\n  The Eleventh Circuit ruled that the display was patently \nunconstitutional, and a district court subsequently issued an \ninjunction to have the monument removed. Had Mr. Pryor continued to \nside with Moore and refused to comply with this injunction, he would \nhave exposed the State of Alabama to substantial monetary sanctions and \npossible criminal liability. This is what Mr. Pryor and his supporters \noffer as proof that he understands and respects the venerated, \nhistoric, and traditional wall between church and State.\n  Mr. Pryor's advocates call him a ``profile in courage'' for enforcing \nthe Eleventh Circuit decision that the monument must be removed from \nthe Alabama State courthouse. I call it doing your job.\n  Let me provide another example of his insensitivity. At Mr. Pryor's \nconfirmation hearing, Senator Feinstein asked him to explain his \nstatement that ``[t]he challenge of the next millennium will be to \npreserve the American experiment by restoring its Christian \nperspective.'' He ducked the question.\n  If you are going to serve this Nation and its Constitution, you have \nto have some sensitivity to the diversity of religious belief in \nAmerica. Many of us are Christians. But to impose a so-called Christian \nperspective on everything is to, frankly, take a position which many of \ndifferent religious faiths would find offensive and intrusive by their \nGovernment.\n\n  Our Founders may have been mostly Christian, but America today is a \nnation of religious diversity and this diversity is protected by the \nConstitution. Judge Pryor has difficulty in grasping this concept.\n  On the issue of federalism, Mr. Pryor has been a predictable, \nreliable voice for those who seek to limit the people's rights in the \nname of States' rights. It is an old ploy in America. As the Alabama \nAttorney General, he filed brief after brief with the U.S. Supreme \nCourt arguing that Congress has virtually no power to protect State \nemployees who are victims of discrimination. Under his leadership, \nAlabama was the only State in the Nation to challenge the \nconstitutionality of parts of the Violence Against Women Act. Thirty-\nsix States filed briefs urging this important law be upheld in its \nentirety, while William Pryor, attorney general of Alabama, was the \nonly one who used his position to try to tear down the Violence Against \nWomen Act.\n  Mr. Pryor also filed a brief in the Supreme Court case Nevada v. \nHibbs. In it, he argued that Congress has no power to ensure that State \nemployees have the right to take unpaid leave from work under the \nFamily Medical Leave Act. Think about it. Mr. Pryor, as Alabama \nattorney general, said Congress had no power to enforce a Federal law.\n  The Supreme Court rejected his argument and said: Mr. Pryor, this \ntime you have gone too far.\n  On the issue of women's rights, he clearly opposes a woman's right to \nchoose. He once called Roe v. Wade ``the worst abomination of \nconstitutional law in our history.'' At Mr. Pryor's hearing, Senator \nSpecter asked him if he stood by his statement. He said he did. He went \non to say that Roe v. Wade is ``unsupported by the test and structure \nof the Constitution'' and ``has led to the slaughter of millions of \ninnocent unborn children.''\n  We are not talking about a nominee who made an overheated statement \n30 years ago as a college student. Mr. Pryor said this at his own \nconfirmation hearing.\n  Understand the constitutional principle that underlies Roe v. Wade. I \nknow abortion is an issue that is very divisive. People feel very \nstrongly one way or the other. But most people concede that underlying \nthat Roe v. Wade decision is the right to privacy, a right which was \nenshrined in the Supreme Court case of Griswold v. Connecticut 40 years \nago this week.\n  The State of Connecticut, urged by religious groups, had banned the \nsale of contraceptives and family planning to anyone in the State of \nConnecticut. If you purchased any family planning--a birth control \npill, for example--it was a violation of the law, and the pharmacist \nwho filled that prescription could be arrested and prosecuted.\n  Think about it. Only 40 years ago that was the case. There was a \ngroup who believed that their religious beliefs were so compelling \nabout birth control that they installed it as a State law.\n  The law was challenged. It came before the Supreme Court. The Supreme \nCourt came down with what has now become a time-honored decision that \nsaid, no, built into this Constitution there may not be the word \n``privacy,'' but the concept of privacy. There are certain things that \nwe, as individuals, should be protected to make decisions about--the \nintimacy of marriage, the privacy of our personal life.\n  What I hear in the language of Mr. Pryor, and many others of his \npoint of view, is really questioning this fundamental concept of \nprotecting individual, personal privacy. It is their belief, many of \nthem, that the Government should rule on these decisions.\n  On the issue of voting rights, Mr. Pryor has urged Congress to take \nsteps that would undermine the right of African Americans to vote. \nWhile testifying before the Judiciary Committee in 1997, he urged \nCongress to ``consider seriously . . . the repeal or amendment of \nsection 5 of the Voting Rights Act.'' This is a key provision that \nguarantees the right of African Americans and other racial minorities \nto achieve equal opportunity in voting.\n  Section 5 requires certain States to obtain preapproval before \nchanging their voting rights standards, such as redistricting or the \nlocation of polling places. It is clearly a vestige of America in \ntransition from racial division and discrimination to a more open, \nequal policy.\n  Mr. Pryor, as attorney general of Alabama, raised questions as to \nwhether or not the Federal Government should continue to try to meet \nthat standard. I strongly disagree with that sentiment. He called \nsection 5 ``an affront to federalism and an expensive burden that has \nfar outlived its usefulness.''\n  I say to Mr. Pryor and others who are white Americans that we cannot \npossibly understand how much this means,\n\n[[Page S6255]]\n\nwhat it means to an individual to have the right to vote, particularly \na person of color, a minority in America, and section 5 is there to \nguarantee it.\n  As attorney general of Alabama, Mr. Pryor testified that it had \noutlived its usefulness. I disagree with his sentiment. Thankfully, so \ndid the Supreme Court and most Members of Congress.\n  There are so many other issues. Tobacco is another one. When it comes \nto tobacco, Mr. Pryor has been one of the Nation's foremost opponents \nof a critical public health issue--compensation for the harms caused by \ntobacco companies. He has ridiculed lawsuits against tobacco companies \nsaying:\n\n       This form of litigation is madness. It is a threat to human \n     liberty, and it needs to stop.\n\n  Remember, those are the lawsuits against tobacco companies that had \nopenly deceived Americans into believing their product was safe, \nleading to addictions, disease, and death. And when lawsuits were \nbrought by attorneys general across America against the tobacco \ncompanies, they settled, knowing they would lose in court, and paid \nbillions of dollars, confessing, in the process, their own wrongdoing.\n  Despite that, Attorney General Pryor, in Alabama, said this was a \nthreat to human liberty to bring these lawsuits against tobacco \ncompanies. What was he thinking?\n  His fellow State attorneys general have been highly critical of him \nfor his comments on these tobacco lawsuits. Former Mississippi Attorney \nGeneral Michael Moore said:\n\n       Bill Pryor was probably the biggest defender of tobacco \n     companies of anyone I know. He did a better job of defending \n     the tobacco companies than their own defense attorneys.\n\n  Former Arizona Attorney General Grant Woods, a Republican, said this \nof Mr. Pryor:\n\n       He's been attorney general for about 5 minutes, and already \n     he's acted more poorly than any other attorney general.\n\n  These are his colleagues commenting on his view of the law and his \npersonal philosophy.\n  Gun control is another issue where Mr. Pryor has demonstrated \ndisregard, if not downright hostility, to even reasonable firearm \nrestrictions.\n  In United States v. Emerson, he filed an amicus brief with the \nSupreme Court, arguing the man who was the subject of a domestic \nviolence restraining order should be allowed to possess a firearm.\n  I can tell you, from my life experience and legal experience, that is \na very bad position to take. We know that if someone has a restraining \norder against them because they are going to commit domestic violence, \nthe last thing we want to give them is a gun. That is what the case is \nabout. Mr. Pryor in that case said, no, they have a right to have a \nfirearm, even if they have a domestic abuse restraining order against \nthem.\n  He called the Government's position a ``sweeping and arbitrary \ninfringement on the second amendment right to keep and bear arms.''\n  I will stand here and defend to the end the right of an individual to \nown a firearm legally in America, to use it for legitimate purposes--\nfor self-defense, for hunting, for sport--but to think Mr. Pryor \nbelieves the second amendment right is so absolute that we should give \nguns to men who batter their wives, I just do not understand it. It \ndoes not show common sense, let alone an understanding of the law.\n  Incidentally, he was the only attorney general in the United States \nof America who took that position.\n  Mr. Pryor once called those who exercised their legal rights against \ngun dealers and manufacturers ``leftist bounty hunters.'' The list goes \non and on.\n  On environmental protection, Mr. Pryor was the only State attorney \ngeneral in the country to file a brief with the U.S. Supreme Court \narguing that the Constitution does not give Congress the authority to \nprotect waters that provide a habitat for migratory birds.\n  In another case, he was the only State attorney general to file a \nbrief urging the Supreme Court to declare unconstitutional Federal \nefforts to protect wildlife on private lands under the Endangered \nSpecies Act.\n  He has written that his ``favorite victory of the 2000 term'' was the \nSupreme Court ruling in Alexander v. Sandoval, an infamous decision \nthat made it more difficult to bring environmental justice cases under \ntitle VI of the Civil Rights Act.\n  Judge Pryor has served as a recess appointment on the Eleventh \nCircuit for about a year now. Senator Specter, chairman of the \nJudiciary Committee, whom I respect very much, has now tried to make \nthe case that he would be a moderate, fairminded judge based on 1 year \nof service, under the glare of spotlights, as people watched every \ndecision handed down. He suggests he is going to change, he is not \ngoing to be the old William Pryor, if we give him an appointment to the \nEleventh Circuit. He will be less political. Chairman Specter said he \nwill be less of an activist.\n  I am not persuaded. He has not really had an opportunity to rule on \nthe full spectrum of issues he will face in a lifetime on the bench.\n  There have been only so many cases which he has considered. Some you \ncan consider liberal in his decisionmaking, some conservative, but to \ntake this 1 year of a probationary period, with this close scrutiny, \nand say that is what he is all about, I think is to overstate the case.\n  Mr. Pryor and his supporters have a simple strategy to try to \nconvince the Senate to grant him a lifetime position as a Federal \njudge. Rather than talk about his troubling record or radical views, \nthey focus on his religious affiliation and accuse anyone who questions \nhim of religious discrimination. I think that is wrong.\n  We should take care and understand what the Constitution says very \ndirectly about religion. There are three references, and the three \nreferences have really done a good job for America in over 200 years. \nThe first is each person is entitled to his or her religious beliefs. \nBelieve what you want to believe in the name of religion or do not \nbelieve anything. That is your right, your freedom of conscience to \nmake that decision.\n  Secondly, this Government will not establish a church. We are not \ngoing to say this is a Christian nation and everything we do will be \nhandled by the standards of Christ's teachings. We cannot do that under \nour Constitution. We should not do that because of diversity of \nreligious belief.\n  Finally, that there be no religious test under the Constitution for \nanyone seeking office, as I mentioned earlier.\n  I think we have to be careful here about the use of religion in the \ndebate about William Pryor and careful about it as we speak on the \nfloor. It is not Mr. Pryor's ideas about religion that trouble me. It \nis his views and record on women's right, voting rights, inmates' \nrights, consumers rights, the constitutional principle of separation of \nchurch and State. Time and again, as Alabama attorney general, Mr. \nPryor has taken extreme positions, made extreme statements on such a \nwide range of issues that the 25 to 30 minutes I have spoken here \ncannot possibly cover it.\n  He and his supporters say he will be a changed person. He will go \nthrough the so-called confirmation conversion. This will be the new \nWilliam Pryor. Sadly, I believe, given a lifetime appointment, he will \nrevert to form. He will follow the pattern of his life, the pattern of \nhis statements, and the pattern of his beliefs.\n  Based on review of his record, it is a risk I cannot, in good \nconscience, take, and I will vote against Mr. Pryor's nomination.\n\n\n                              Big Tobacco\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, on a separate subject, there was a \ndecision reached this week by the Department of Justice which was very \ntroubling. A lawyer sold out his client. It happens all the time. It is \nwrong, but it happens. What makes this case unique is the lawyer is the \nAttorney General and the client is the people of America. In a lawsuit \nthat had been brought against the tobacco companies, there was expert \ntestimony to the fact these tobacco companies should pay up to $130 \nbillion over 25 years for lying to the American people and for all the \nmedical expenses their deadly product created. A similar lawsuit was \nbrought by the States not that long ago. So the Department of Justice, \nslow to begin this process, was taking the tobacco companies to court.\n  Then, out of the blue, came the following, and this was reported in \nthe press:\n\n       After 8 months of courtroom argument, Justice Department \n     lawyers abruptly upset a\n\n[[Page S6256]]\n\n     landmark civil racketeering case against the tobacco industry \n     yesterday by asking for less than 8 percent of the expected \n     penalty.\n\n  Suing for $130 billion, the lawyer for the people of the United \nStates walked into the courtroom this week and said: Oh, we just want \n$10 billion. The story goes that this Justice Department lawyer, \nStephen Brody, even shocked the tobacco company representatives by \nannouncing that he only needed $10 billion over 5 years. The \nGovernment's own expert said $130 billion over 25 years. What a \ndiscount. Here is the lead from the story:\n\n       Government lawyers asked two of their own witnesses to \n     soften recommendations about sanctions that should be imposed \n     on the tobacco industry if it lost a landmark civil \n     racketeering case, one of the witnesses and sources familiar \n     with the case said yesterday.\n\n  Matt Myers, a person I know and worked with in the past, said he was \nasked to basically change his testimony to lighten up on the tobacco \ncompanies. He confirmed in this article. The second witness declined \ncomment, but four separate sources familiar with the case said the \nJustice Department asked the same of him.\n  By the time the Government opened its racketeering case against \ntobacco companies last September, it had already spent $135 million to \ndevelop its case. Why, at the 11th hour, would the Government's own \nlawyers, the people's own lawyers, fold under the pressure of the \ntobacco companies and give away so much potential recovery for the \ntaxpayers of America?\n  Why would they ignore the advice of their own expert witness to seek \na penalty of $130 billion and reduce their demand to $10 billion over 5 \nyears?\n  Even the lawyer for Philip Morris tobacco company coordinating the \ncase said as follows:\n\n       They've gone down--\n\n  Meaning the Government, your lawyer, the attorney--\n\n     from $130 billion to $10 billion with absolutely no \n     explanation. It's clear the Government hasn't thought through \n     what it's doing.\n\n  End of quote from Dan Webb, the lawyer from the tobacco company, who \ncould not believe what he had heard when the Department of Justice \nwalked into the courtroom and said: We are going to deeply discount the \namount we are trying to recover.\n  Why is this money important? There are 45 million smokers in America. \nMany of them want to quit. The money was going to be used for cessation \nprograms, reducing disease and death in America, and the Bush \nadministration walked away from it, walked away from the vast amount \nalready established in court as the amount necessary to move these \nprograms forward.\n  In court yesterday, a Philip Morris lawyer tried to explain away the \nreduced fine by claiming that the Government's case was in disarray. \nThe judge in the case interrupted the tobacco lawyer who was trying to \nput some credibility into the new position of the Bush administration \nby saying that was not true.\n  So what is the reason? Sadly, it is because there is too much \npolitical impact by the tobacco lobby on this administration, \nparticularly on Associate Attorney General Robert McCallum, Jr.\n  Who is he? This is what the L.A. Times said about him:\n\n       Before his appointment in the Justice Department . . . he \n     had been a partner at Alston & Bird, an Atlanta-based firm \n     that had done trademark and patent work for R. J. Reynolds \n     Tobacco. In 2002, McCallum signed a friend-of-the-court brief \n     by the administration urging the Supreme Court not to \n     consider an appeal by the Government of Canada to reinstate a \n     cigarette smuggling case against R. J. Reynolds that had been \n     dismissed. The Department's ethics office had cleared \n     McCallum to take part in the case.\n\n  Let me point out, in fairness to Mr. McCallum, that he is not the \nonly friend of the tobacco industry in the Bush administration. There \nare many.\n  Does this have something to do with the surprise announcement \nyesterday that the Justice Department was selling out its client, the \nAmerican people, those addicted to tobacco? That is why Senators \nLautenberg, Kennedy, Wyden, and I have sent a letter to the inspector \ngeneral of the Justice Department, asking him to investigate this \nreversal of position by the Attorney General.\n  Just why in the world has the Attorney General of the United States \nthrown in the towel, given up, when he was supposed to be fighting for \npeople across America who need this public health assistance?\n  I think that is a critical and unanswered question, which I hope the \ninspector general will address.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I rise today to express my strong support \nfor the nomination of Bill Pryor, to serve on the United States Court \nof Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit.\n  I have known Bill for many years and have the highest regard for his \nintellect and integrity. He is an extraordinarily skilled attorney with \na prestigious record of trying civil and criminal cases in both the \nFederal and State courts. He has also argued several cases before both \nthe Supreme Court of the United States and the supreme court of the \nState of Alabama.\n  As the Attorney General of the State of Alabama, Judge Pryor \nestablished a reputation as a principled and effective legal advocate \nfor the State and distinguished himself as a leader on many important \nState issues. During his tenure as Attorney General, it was his duty \nand obligation to represent and defend the laws and interests of the \nState of Alabama. And while he may not have always agreed with those \nlaws, he consistently fulfilled his responsibility dutifully and \nresponsibly.\n  Long before being nominated to the Eleventh Circuit, Judge Pryor made \nit a priority to be open and honest about his personal beliefs, which \nis what voters expect from the persons whom they elect to represent \nthem. Yet he has shown again and again that when the law conflicts with \nhis personal and political beliefs, he follows the law as articulated \nby the Constitution and the Supreme Court.\n  Despite his detractors, I believe it is important to note that \nactions speak louder than words, and certainly, Judge Pryor's actions \nsince joining the Eleventh Circuit speak volumes about his fairness and \nimpartiality. During his brief tenure on the Court, Judge Pryor has \nauthored several opinions that effectively demonstrate his willingness \nto protect the rights of those often overlooked in the legal system.\n  In light of all of the information that has been presented here \ntoday, I believe that we must confirm Judge Pryor. Bill Pryor is a man \nof the law and that is what we need in our Federal judiciary. Whether \nas a prosecutor, a defense attorney, the Attorney General of the State \nof Alabama, or a Federal judge, he understands and respects the \nconstitutional role of the judiciary and specifically, the role of the \nFederal courts in our legal system. Indeed, I have no doubt that he \nwill make an exceptional Federal judge because of the humility and \ngravity that he brings to the bench. I am also confident that he will \nserve honorably and apply the law with impartiality and fairness--just \nas he has done during his brief tenure on the Eleventh Circuit.\n  I again encourage my colleagues to support Judge Pryor's nomination \nbecause I believe it is what is right for our people, and it is what is \nright for our country.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the \nnomination of Judge William Pryor to the Eleventh Circuit Court of \nAppeals.\n  I would like to respond to the accusations by some of my colleagues \nconcerning Bill Pryor's comments related to Section 5 of the Voting \nRights Act. Judge Pryor has an outstanding record on civil rights and a \ndemonstrated commitment to seeking equal justice for persons of all \nraces.\n\n[[Page S6257]]\n\n  Nevertheless, some of my colleagues on the other side have tried to \ncharacterize Bill Pryor as ``out of the mainstream'' because, as you \nhave heard, he has called for the amendment of Section 5 of the Voting \nRights Act.\n  Judge Pryor is not out of the mainstream on this issue, and I'll \nexplain why.\n  After you hear who agrees with Judge Pryor on his reasoning here, I \nthink you will agree with me that if Bill Pryor is ``out of the \nmainstream'' on his critiques of Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act, \nhe's ``out there'' with some great Americans.\n  First, let me explain what Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act is \nabout. Section 5 requires any ``covered States''--States that are \nsubject to the Voting Rights Act--to pre-clear any decision to change \n``any voting qualification or prerequisite to voting, or standard, \npractice, or procedure with respect to voting.''\n  The Supreme Court in Allen v. State Board of Elections has made it \nclear that the:\n\n     legislative history on the whole supports the view that \n     Congress intended to reach any State enactment which altered \n     the election law of a covered State in even a minor way.\n\n  In practice, this means that Section 5 requires Federal officials at \nthe Department of Justice to approve even very minor practices related \nto voting.\n  For example, if a State moved a polling place from one side of a \nstreet to another, this action would have to be pre-cleared by the \nJustice Department pursuant to Section 5.\n  Bill Pryor has called the Voting Rights Act ``one of the greatest and \nmost necessary laws in American history,'' but he has taken to task \nFederal courts that have ``turned the Act on its head and wielded . . . \npower to deprive all voters of the right to select . . . public \nofficers,'' even though the Act ``was passed to empower minority voters \nin the exercise of the franchise.''\n  As Alabama Attorney General, Bill Pryor was by no means alone in his \ncriticisms of the Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act.\n  In a brief before the Supreme Court in the case of Georgia v. \nAshcroft, Thurbert Baker, our State Attorney General in Georgia, who \nhimself is a Democrat and African-American, called Section 5 an \n``extraordinary transgression of the normal prerogatives of the \nstates'' and ``a grave intrusion into the authority of the states.''\n  General Baker also stated that:\n\n       Section 5 was initially enacted as a ``temporary'' measure \n     to last five years precisely because it was so intrusive.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have a copy of a letter \nthat General Baker wrote back in 2003 to Senators Shelby and Sessions \nof Alabama, in which General Baker describes Bill Pryor as ``an \nexcellent candidate for a slot on the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals,'' \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                            Department of Law,\n\n                                      Atlanta, GA, March 31, 2003.\n     Hon. Richard Shelby,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Jeff Sessions,\n     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators: I have had the great pleasure of knowing and \n     working with Bill Pryor over the past five years. Through the \n     National Association of Attorneys General, Bill and I have \n     worked together on matters of mutual concern to Georgia and \n     Alabama. During that time, Bill has distinguished himself \n     time and again with the legal acumen that he brings to issues \n     of national or regional concern as well as with his \n     commitment to furthering the prospects of good and responsive \n     government.\n       During his tenure as Attorney General, Bill has made \n     combating white-collar crime and public corruption one of the \n     centerpieces of his service to the people of Alabama. He \n     joined the efforts of Attorneys General around the country in \n     fighting the rising tide of identity theft, pushing through \n     legislation in the Alabama legislature making identity theft \n     a felony in Alabama. Bill has fought to keep law enforcement \n     in Alabama armed with appropriate laws to protect Alabama's \n     citizens, pushing for tough money laundering provisions and \n     stiff penalties for trafficking in date rape drugs.\n       Time and again as Attorney General, Bill has taken on \n     public corruption cases in Alabama, regardless of how well-\n     connected the defendant may be, to ensure that the public \n     trust is upheld and the public's confidence in government is \n     well-founded. He has worked with industry groups and the \n     Better Business Bureau to crack down on unscrupulous \n     contractors who victimized many of Alabama's more vulnerable \n     citizens.\n       From the time that he clerked with the late Judge Wisdom of \n     the 5th Circuit to the present, though, the most critical \n     asset that Bill Pryor has brought to the practice of law is \n     his zeal to do what he thinks is right. He has always done \n     what he thought was best for the people of Alabama. \n     Recognizing a wrong that had gone on far too long, he took \n     the opportunity of his inaugural address to call on an end to \n     the ban on inter-racial marriages in Alabama law. Concerned \n     about at-risk kids in Alabama schools, he formed Mentor \n     Alabama, a program designed to pair volunteer mentors with \n     students who needed a role model and an attentive ear to the \n     problems facing them on a daily basis.\n       These are just a few of the qualities that I believe will \n     make Bill Pryor an excellent candidate for a slot on the 11th \n     Circuit Court of Appeals. My only regret is that I will no \n     longer have Bill as a fellow Attorney General fighting for \n     what is right, but I know that his work on the bench will \n     continue to serve as an example of how the public trust \n     should be upheld.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Thurbert E. Baker.\n\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. General Baker goes on in his letter to my colleagues \nfrom Alabama to say:\n\n       My only regret is that I will no longer have Bill as a \n     fellow Attorney General fighting for what is right, but I \n     know that his work on the bench will continue to serve as an \n     example of how the public trust should be upheld.\n\n  Judge Pryor's concerns about Section 5 have been borne out in \nGeorgia, where the State appealed to the Supreme Court in Georgia v. \nAshcroft to have a recent redistricting plan approved following the \n2000 decennial census, and after a Federal district court found that \nGeorgia's plan violated Section 5.\n  During the litigation in the district court, Congressman John Lewis, \na hero of the civil rights movement, testified on behalf of the State \nof Georgia in support of the plan, noting that Georgia:\n\n     is not the same state it was. It's not the same state that it \n     was in 1965 or in 1975, or even in 1980 or 1990. We have \n     changed. We've come a great distance.\n\n  John Lewis knows that thoughtful review of Section 5 could be of some \nbenefit.\n  According to the New York Times, Georgia's plan, pushed by both \n``white and black Democrats,'' represented an attempt:\n\n     to reverse [a] trend in Georgia and elsewhere by \n     redistributing some of the black voters and re-integrating \n     suburban districts to gain a better chance of electing \n     Democrats.\n\n  That is a quote from a New York Times article of January 18, 2003 at \nA12.\n  The New York Times further notes that Georgia currently has:\n\n     some safe Democratic districts with large black majorities, \n     along with a sharply increased number of Republicans elected \n     from suburban districts that had become increasingly white.\n\n  In his brief in Georgia v. Ashcroft, Georgia Attorney General \nThurbert Baker cited his own election as an example of how African-\nAmerican candidates can take ``the overwhelming majority of the total \nvote against their white opponents'' without the benefit of \nsupermajority districts.\n  The Federal Government opposed Georgia's plan on the ground that \nSection 5 does not give Georgia the power to eliminate supermajority \nminority legislative districts, even in the name of increasing overall \nminority voting power.\n  Section 5 has not only placed a burden on covered States, but also on \nthe Justice Department, which has wasted time by being forced to pre-\nclear a huge number of changes in voting practices that have nothing to \ndo with minority voting rights.\n  Section 5 requires covered states to pre-clear any decision to \nchange:\n\n     any voting qualification or prerequisite to voting, or \n     standard, practice, or procedure with respect to voting.\n\n  Again, the Supreme Court has made it clear that the:\n\n     legislative history on the whole supports the view that \n     Congress intended to reach any state enactment which altered \n     the election law of a covered State in even a minor way.''\n\n  That statement is included in Allen v. State Board of Elections, 393 \nU.S. 544, 566.\n  For example, if a State moved a polling place from one side of a \nstreet to another, this action would have to be pre-cleared by the \nJustice Department pursuant to section 5, which indicates that ``any \nchange in the boundaries of voting precincts or in the location of \npolling places'' requires pre-clearance.\n  Another great American, the late U.S. Supreme Court Justice Lewis\n\n[[Page S6258]]\n\nPowell also criticized section 5 of the Act.\n  President Clinton has called Justice Powell ``one of our most \nthoughtful and conscientious judges'' and a Justice who reviewed cases \n``without an ideological agenda.''\n  In 1973, in another case styled as Georgia v. United States, Justice \nPowell wrote in a dissenting opinion that:\n\n     It is indeed a serious intrusion, incompatible with the basic \n     structure of our system, for federal authorities to compel a \n     state to submit its [reapportionment] legislation for advance \n     review [under section 5].\n\n  The most important point I would like to stress is that despite Mr. \nPryor's well-documented concerns about Section 5 of the Voting Rights \nAct, he has vigorously enforced all provisions of the Act.\n  Let me give you two examples. First, when Alabama state legislator \nJ.E. Turner died and the new candidate wanted to use stickers to place \nhis name on the ballot, Attorney General Pryor issued an opinion \nstating that the use of stickers required pre-clearance under Section 5 \nof the Act. Certainly this illustrates that Bill Pryor was able to \nseparate his personal disagreement with the requirements of Section 5 \nfrom his duty as Alabama's Attorney General to enforce the provision \ndespite his personal views.\n  A second example involved Mr. Pryor's successful defense of several \nmajority-minority voting districts, approved under Section 5, from a \nchallenge by a group of white Alabama voters in the Sinkfield v. Kelley \ncase. The voters, who were residents of various majority-white voting \ndistricts, sued the State of Alabama in Federal court, claiming that \nAlabama's voting districts were the product of unconstitutional racial \ngerrymandering.\n  The districts were created under a state plan whose acknowledged \npurpose was the maximization of the number of majority-minority \ndistricts in Alabama. Attorney General Pryor personally defended the \nmajority-minority districts all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court, \nwhich held that the white voters could not sue because they did not \nreside in the majority-minority district and had not personally been \ndenied equal treatment.\n  When some of these provisions of the Voting Rights Act are up for \nrenewal, we should review and consider them in a very deliberative, \nbipartisan manner to make sure that the law today reflects the \nrealities of our society here in the 21st Century.\n  Thurbert Baker and Bill Pryor, as attorneys general of two \nneighboring states in the South, know this to be the case one is \nAfrican-American and one is white; one is a Democrat and the other is a \nRepublican, but together they share a vision of making the voting \nrights laws of our country effective and enforceable in today's times.\n  To sum up, Bill Pryor has established an impressive record as a fair, \ndiligent, and competent public servant. Two of my fellow Georgians, \nJohn Lewis and Thurbert Baker, have expressed concerns with Section 5 \nof the Voting Rights Act, just as Bill Pryor did and just as the late \nJustice Lewis Powell did.\n  This is not out-of-the-mainstream thinking; it's thoughtful and \nsincere analysis.\n  Even the liberal New York Times had to concede as much in its \ncomments regarding Georgia's redistricting plan.\n  Bill Pryor's nomination to the Eleventh Circuit enjoys strong \nbipartisan support in his home State of Alabama, and in my home State, \nwhich is also part of the Eleventh Circuit.\n  A month ago, I visited with a number of my district court judges, all \nof whom said that in their contact with the Eleventh Circuit Court of \nAppeals, they had nothing but great things to say about the job Bill \nPryor is doing as an interim appointee to the Eleventh Circuit. I urge \nmy colleagues to vote in favor of his confirmation today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I am here to speak on the nomination of \nWilliam Pryor to the Eleventh Circuit. Bill Pryor's nomination is the \nlast of the three covered by the deal worked out by 14 of our \ncolleagues to avoid meltdown in the Senate.\n  Yesterday was the vote on Janice Rogers Brown. It was a sad vote. Not \na single Republican Senator broke with his or her party to vote against \na nominee whom even the National Review, George Will, and others \nsingled out for her judicial activism and radicalism. It showed again \nthat the other side is willing to march in almost total lockstep with \nthe President. If they had their way, the Senate would be a complete \nrubberstamp for any nominee the President proposes--totally against \nwhat the Founding Fathers intended this Senate to be.\n  The count is 2,921 to 2. Out of almost 3,000 votes on appellate court \nnominees, 44 in all, only twice have Republican Senators dared to \ndeviate from the party line. Is that the kind of independent thinking \nthat an up-or-down vote entails? It is a sad day, indeed. For sure, \nJanice Rogers Brown's views do not mirror those of most of my \ncolleagues or even come close.\n  In a moment, I will go through all the reasons I am opposed to Judge \nPryor's nomination and all the things he said with which I strongly \ndisagree. Here is one I agree with. In his testimony before the Senate \nin 1997, Judge Pryor told Senators, ``Your role of advice and consent \nin judicial nominees cannot be overstated.'' On this point, Judge Pryor \nand I see eye to eye.\n  As we await a slew of new nominations from the President, as we await \nthe possible retirement of a Supreme Court Justice, and as we vote on \nthe current nominees in the wake of an agreement that specifically \nurged President Bush to consult the Senate in advance of nominations, I \nagain plead with the President and my colleagues to look to the future. \nLook to a future where harmony can replace acrimony in the Senate, \nwhere bipartisanship can replace one-upmanship, and where discourse can \nreplace demagoguery. How can that be done? It is very simple. The \nPresident can, as he said he would in a recent press conference, \nconsult meaningfully with Senators before trying to jam extreme \nnominees down our throats.\n  The renomination of Bill Pryor was the most breathtaking example of \nthe President's ignoring checks and balances and bypassing the Senate's \nrole in the nomination and confirmation process. The President stuck a \nthumb in the eye of bipartisanship when he renominated people like \nJanice Rogers Brown, Priscilla Owen, and Richard Myers after they were \nrejected by the Senate.\n  But the President did not get his way with William Pryor, and then he \ntook the truly extraordinary step of making a recess appointment. While \nthe renomination of rejected judges was a thumb in the eye to \nbipartisanship, the recent appointment of Bill Pryor was a punch in the \nface. This was particularly outrageous because not only is Bill Pryor \none of the most ideologically driven nominees we have ever seen but \nalso because there were questions about his credibility with the \ncommittee, and there was an unfinished investigation regarding the \nRepublican Attorney General Association that he founded.\n  It is not enough for him or any other nominee to simply say: I will \nfollow the law. His views are too well known. His record is clear about \nhow he will vote as a judge. We all know that judging is not a rote \nprocess. We all know our own individual values and thoughts influence \nhow we interpret the law. If it were just by rote, we would have \ncomputers on the bench instead of men and women in black robes. There \nis a degree of subjectivity, especially in close cases and \ncontroversies on hot-button issues. It is hard to believe that the \nincredibly strong ideological bent of this nominee will not have an \nimpact on how he rules.\n  As my colleagues know, I have no litmus test when it comes to \nnominees. I am sure most of this President's judicial nominees have \nbeen pro-life, but I voted for so many of them because I have been \npersuaded they are committed to upholding the rule of law. I, for one, \nbelieve a judge can be pro-life and yet be fair and balanced and uphold \nthe woman's right to choose. But for a judge to set aside his or her \nown personal views, the commitment to the rule of law must clearly \nsupersede his or her personal agenda. That is a trick some can pull \noff. Not everybody can.\n  Let's take a moment to review some of the more radical remarks \nWilliam Pryor has made and some of the more polemical positions he has \ntaken. On criminal justice issues, I tend to be conservative. I tend to \nagree with most\n\n[[Page S6259]]\n\nof my Republican colleagues. But there are lines which should not be \ncrossed.\n  William Pryor defended his State's practice of handcuffing prisoners \nto hitching posts in the hot Alabama Sun for 7 hours without even \ngiving them a drop of water to drink, and then he criticized the \nSupreme Court--hardly a liberal court--when it held this practice \nviolated the eighth amendment ban on cruel and unusual punishment. We \ndo have standards. We are not a medieval society, even for those of us \nwho believe in tough punishment. What Pryor did, he goes far, too far, \nto say the least. In criticizing the Supreme Court's decision, he \naccused the Justices of applying their own subjective views on \nappropriate methods of prison discipline. The Supreme Court, which I \nbelieve was unanimous--or maybe 8 to 1--in rejecting William Pryor's \nview, was far more appropriate than he was.\n  He also called the Supreme Court's decision in Miranda--something \nthat is part of judicially accepted law--one of the worst examples of \njudicial activism.\n  He has vigorously opposed the exemption of retarded defendants from \nbeing executed. He submitted an amicus brief to the Supreme Court in \nAtkins v. Virginia, and he argued that mentally retarded individuals \nshould be subjected to the death penalty like anyone else.\n  When issues have been raised about the fair and just administration \nof punishment, particularly in some of these cases, Mr. Pryor's \nreaction has been to scoff.\n  When asked what steps Alabama would take to ensure that the death \npenalty was fairly applied--and I have supported the death penalty--\nregardless of the defendant's race, he said:\n\n       I would hate for us to judge the criminal justice system in \n     a way where we excuse people from committing crimes because, \n     well, we have imposed enough punishment on that group this \n     year, and that's precisely what you are being asked to think \n     of with that kind of analysis.\n\n  It is ridiculous. The analysis simply said, don't take race into \naccount. This is a judge who will be fair and impartial and open to \nadvocates' positions on both sides of an issue?\n  How about States rights? Mr. Pryor has been one of the staunchest \nadvocates of efforts to roll back the clock, not just to the 1930s but \nto the 1890s. He is an ardent supporter of an activist Supreme Court \nagenda cutting back Congress's power to protect women, workers, \nconsumers, the environment, and civil rights.\n  As Alabama's attorney general, Mr. Pryor filed the only amicus brief \nfrom among the 50 States. Only 1 attorney general out of all 50 filed a \nbrief urging the Supreme Court to undo significant portions of the \nViolence Against Women Act. I am a proud author of that act. I carried \nthe bill in the House when I was a Congressman. And to be so opposed to \npreventing women from being beaten by their husbands and taking \nremedies to deal with women who are so beaten makes no sense to me.\n  In commenting on that law, Pryor said:\n\n       One wonders why [VAWA] enjoys such political support, \n     especially in the Congress.\n\n  One wonders why it enjoys such support when, for the first time, we \nin Washington, hailed by Republicans and Democrats, started trying to \nhelp women who were beaten by their husbands? When they used to go to \ncertain police stations, they were told--not out of malice but out of \nignorance--go home, it is a family matter; whose children had watched \nthem be hit? And he cannot understand why it enjoys such political \nsupport? He is not the kind of man I want on the court of appeals.\n  How about child welfare? Bill Pryor's ardent support of States rights \nextends even to the realm of child welfare. At the same time he was \nconceding that Alabama had failed to fulfill the requirements of a \nFederal consent decree regarding the operation of a child's welfare \nsystem, he was demanding his State be let out of the deal.\n  On environment, we have more of the same concerns. Pryor was the lone \nattorney general to file an amicus brief arguing the Constitution does \nnot give the Federal Government power to regulate interstate waters as \na habitat for migratory concerns.\n  When it comes to disabilities, contrast Mr. Pryor's approach with the \napproach he took in Bush v. Gore. Bill Pryor was the lone State \nattorney general to file an amicus brief supporting the Supreme Court's \nintervention in Florida's election dispute. Every other attorney \ngeneral, Democrat and Republican, had the sense to stay out of this \ndispute. Not Mr. Pryor.\n  Yet when it came to the ADA, the disabilities act, Mr. Pryor was the \ndriving force behind the case in which a nurse contracted breast \ncancer, took time off to deal with her illness, and when she returned--\nin violation of the ADA--she found that she was demoted.\n  In conclusion, Mr. Pryor is extreme. Again, why is he, over and over \nagain, 1 of the 50 attorneys general--there are a lot of conservative \nattorneys general--to file these briefs? Why is he, on things that are \npart of the mainstream of American feelings and jurisprudence--\nenvironment, Americans With Disabilities Act--way over?\n  Why did he say:\n\n       I will end with my prayer for the next administration. \n     Please, God, no more Souters?\n\n  That is what he said before the Federalist Society, a Republican \nappointee to the bench. The man is clearly an ideologue. The man does \nnot respect the rule of law in too many instances.\n  As I have said before, Bill Pryor is a proud and distinguished \nideological warrior. But ideological warriors, whether from the left or \nfrom the right, are bad news for the bench. They tend to make law, not \ninterpret law. That is not what any of us should want from our judges. \nIdeological warriors, whether from the left or the right, do not belong \non courts of appeals.\n  I will suggest that you do not need to take my word for it. Here is \nwhat Grant Woods, the former attorney general of Arizona, and a \nconservative Republican, said of Mr. Pryor: While I would have great \nquestion of whether Mr. Pryor has an ability to be nonpartisan, I would \nsay he was probably the most doctrinaire and partisan attorney general \nI have dealt with in 8 years. So I think people would be wise to \nquestion whether or not he is the right person to be nonpartisan on the \nbench.\n  I could not have said it better myself.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chambliss). The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I am here to speak again, as so many \nbefore me, on the nomination of William Pryor to the Eleventh Circuit \nCourt of Appeals.\n  Now, we have heard many concerns and complaints about Mr. Pryor. We \nhave heard that Mr. Pryor cost his State millions of dollars when he \nrefused to join litigation seeking to hold tobacco companies \naccountable for the cost of smoking because he believes that ``smokers, \nas a group, do not impose the cost of their habit on the government'' \nand, listen to this, that the premature deaths of smokers actually save \nthe Government the cost of ``Social Security, pensions, and nursing \nhome payments.''\n  We have heard about Mr. Pryor's vigorous defense of Alabama's use of \nthe hitching post as a punishment, a practice the Supreme Court held to \nbe cruel and unusual punishment.\n  So there has been a lot of talk about different things about Mr. \nPryor and what he has stood for, but I am here specifically to talk \nabout Mr. Pryor's persistent, repeated efforts to eliminate the ability \nof people with disabilities to receive equal treatment in our society. \nI am here to talk about this nominee's hostility toward the Americans \nwith Disabilities Act.\n  Most of my colleagues know that I had a brother who was deaf. Through \nhis eyes, my family and I saw firsthand what discrimination against \npersons with disabilities looks like. It was, and still is, very real.\n  When we in Congress sought to remedy this history of discrimination, \nwe spent years laying out, piece by piece, a legislative record fully \ndocumenting the overwhelming evidence that discrimination against \npeople with disabilities in America was rampant. At the time we passed \nthis bill, we took care to make sure that this important civil rights \nlaw had the findings and the constitutional basis to pass muster with \nthe Supreme Court. The signing of the ADA was the culmination of a \nmonumental bipartisan effort that sought to right decades worth of \nwrongs.\n  So what did William Pryor have to say about this bill that was signed \nby\n\n[[Page S6260]]\n\nPresident Bush in 1990, supported overwhelmingly by the American \npeople, supported overwhelmingly by both Republicans and Democrats in \nthe Senate and the House? What did he have to say about it? In the case \nof Board of Trustees of the University of Alabama v. Garrett, he argued \nthat Congress did not identify ``even a single instance of \nunconstitutional conduct'' to support the Americans with Disabilities \nAct.\n  This is complete and utter nonsense. We documented it, hundreds and \nhundreds and hundreds of cases of unconstitutional discrimination \nagainst people with disabilities--cases of the forced sterilization of \npeople with disabilities, the denial of educational opportunities, \nunnecessary institu- tionalizations, among others.\n  Mr. Pryor has made no secret of the fact that he does not believe we \nin Congress have the power to pass laws to protect people from \ndiscrimination. He has worked hard to find cases with which to \nchallenge the power of Congress to protect victims of domestic \nviolence, victims of age discrimination, and women seeking to take \nmaternity leave under the Family and Medical Leave Act. He has also \nrepeatedly filed cases challenging Congress's authority to allow \nAmericans with disabilities to live full and productive lives under the \nAmericans with Disabilities Act.\n  Now, some of my colleagues may remember that 2 years ago I stood on \nthis floor and asked Senators to oppose the nomination of Jeffrey \nSutton because Mr. Sutton had devoted a significant portion of his \nlegal career to trying to have the Americans with Disabilities Act and \nother laws designed to protect Americans from discrimination declared \nunconstitutional. At that time, many of my colleagues on the other side \nof the aisle argued that Jeffrey Sutton should be confirmed because he \nwas simply doing the work on behalf of his client. Well, guess who his \nclient was. The client was William Pryor, then-attorney general of \nAlabama.\n  It is hard to imagine any other nominee with such a record of \naggressive negative activism. Given the record of William Pryor, it is \nimpossible to imagine that someone with a disability rights or civil \nrights claim will get a fair decision by him.\n  So I cannot support putting someone on a Federal circuit court who \nhas gone out of his way and worked hard affirmatively to undermine the \nAmericans with Disabilities Act.

The disability community \n     is opposed to the confirmation of Alabama Attorney General \n     William Pryor because we do not believe a person with a \n     disability would receive a fair hearing from a ``Judge \n     Pryor.''\n       Pryor has demonstrated a commitment to extremism rather \n     than to justice. Pryor's right-wing ideology is far outside \n     the mainstream of American legal thought. Pryor has led the \n     battle to undo the work of a democratically-elected Congress \n     to legislate federal protections for American citizens. \n     Despite widespread bipartisan support for the\n\n[[Page S6261]]\n\n     Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), Pryor said he was \n     ``proud'' of his role in weakening the ADA and ``protecting \n     the hard-earned dollars of Alabama taxpayers when Congress \n     imposes illegal mandates on our state.\n       William Pryor, nominated to the U.S. Court of Appeals for \n     the Eleventh Circuit, has been a leader in the effort to \n     limit congressional power to enact laws protector civil \n     rights.

Pryor, Jr. to U.S. \n               Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit\n\n       The National Association of the Deaf (NAD) is opposed to \n     the confirmation of nominee William H. Pryor, Jr., to the \n     U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit.\n       Currently the Attorney General for the State of Alabama, \n     Pryor is a ``states' rights'' and ``federalism'' ideologue, a \n     leader in the movement to limit the authority of Congress to \n     enact laws protecting individual civil rights. Pryor has \n     fought aggressively against the Americans with Disabilities \n     Act (ADA) and other laws that protect Americans with \n     disabilities and other minorities.\n       The NAD is opposing Pryor because of his outspoken activism \n     against federal civil rights protections for people with \n     disabilities and other minorities. His commitment is to \n     ideology, not to justice.\n       Established in 1880, the NAD is the nation's oldest and \n     largest nonprofit organization safeguarding the accessibility \n     and civil rights of 28 million deaf and hard of hearing \n     Americans across a broad range of areas including education, \n     employment, health care, and telecommunications.\n       The NAD is a dynamic federation of 51 state association \n     affiliates including the District of Columbia, organizational \n     affiliates, and national members. Primary areas of focus \n     include grassroots advocacy and empowerment, policy \n     development and research, legal assistance, captioned media, \n     information and publications, and youth leadership.\n     Kelby N.

We strongly \n     feel that Mr. Pryor and his record as the Attorney General in \n     Alabama does NOT support nor represent the millions of people \n     with disabilities or their basic civil rights. Please know \n     that we will do all we can to see that his nomination is \n     stopped! Thank you for your cooperation and help!\n     Susan A.

Our opposition is based on his record \n     as an attorney, as an Attorney General and on his comments \n     made publicly which represent his personal views.\n       Mr. Pryor's professional position in cases such Garrett v. \n     Alabama, and Alexander v. Sandoval, to name a few, indicate a \n     distinct inclination toward the protection of states from \n     individual's attempt to protect themselves under federal \n     civil rights laws. The results of cases like these seriously \n     weaken the enforcement of laws like the Americans with \n     Disabilities Act and therefore seriously affect the \n     independence and quality of life of American citizens with \n     disabilities.\n       Mr. Pryor's publicly declared notion that the ADA was not \n     needed, that there was no pattern of discrimination by the \n     states, that Congress therefore had no authority to enact its \n     protections, flies in the face of the thousands of cases of \n     discrimination identified by Congress. His attitudes are a \n     slap in the face of American citizens who were forced to be \n     sterilized, institutionalized and otherwise denied access to \n     places and things that able-bodied people take for granted. \n     The passage of the ADA opened doors, literally and \n     figuratively, to thousands of individuals to live, work and \n     play when and where they chose. Unfortunately there continues \n     to be defiance and ignorance of employers, businesses and \n     government entities regarding the right to access and \n     opportunity granted to all citizens. The ADA, and other civil \n     rights legislation, is the only defense people with \n     disabilities can call on to realize their independence and \n     potential. There is no other protection or defense.\n       The Ability Center asks that you oppose this nomination as \n     a statement that the civil rights of all U.S. citizens are a \n     priority above all else. Oppose the nomination to send a \n     message that any judicial candidate who demonstrates, in word \n     and deed, extreme ideology is not an appropriate choice for \n     the judicial bench. Oppose the nomination because it is a \n     lifetime appointment and that such an appointment represents \n     a serious and real threat to millions of citizens with \n     disabilities. Appoint individuals to the federal court system \n     who have demonstrated an ability to interpret the law without \n     bias and extreme ideologies. This is not William Pryor.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Susan Hetrick,\n     Advocacy Director.\n                                  ____\n\n                                           Heightened Independence\n\n\n                                                 and Progress,\n\n                                    Hackensack, NJ, July 14, 2003.\n       Heightened Independence and Progress (hip) Center for \n     Independent Living strongly opposes the confirmation of \n     William Pryor to the U.S. Court of AppeaIs for the Eleventh \n     Circuit.\n       People with disabilities have worked long and hard to bring \n     about the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and rely on \n     the Act's protections to ensure that employers, schools, \n     governmental entities and business both large and small do \n     not discriminate against anyone because of a disability.\n       William Pryor has taken positions about ADA related cases \n     that cause disability advocates to have serious concerns \n     about his ability to be objective in such cases.

Just last month, for \n     example, the Court, in an opinion by Chief Justice Rehnquist, \n     rejected Pryor's argument that the states should be immune \n     from lawsuits for damages brought by state employees for \n     violation of the federal Family and Medical Leave, Act.\n\n     Victoria Wolf,\n       Assistive Technology Specialist, Disability Resource Agency \n     for Independent Living.\n                                  ____\n\n                                        Eastern Paralyzed Veterans\n\n\n                                                  Association,\n\n                               Jackson Heights, NY, July 14, 2003.\n     Hon. Orrin G. Hatch,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Orrin G. Hatch: The Eastern Paralyzed Veterans \n     Association strongly opposes the confirmation of William \n     Pryor to the Eleventh U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. In the \n     past, Mr. Pryor's attempts to limit Congressional authority \n     in the area of disability rights have directly undermined the \n     protections given to people with disabilities through the \n     Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and other disability \n     rights laws.\n       In Board of Trustees of University of Alabama v. Garrett, \n     Mr. Pryor formulated the argument that Congress did not have \n     the authority under the Constitution to apply the ADA to \n     States in employment discrimination suits for damages. \n     Additionally, Pryor successfully persuaded in 5-4 majority of \n     the Supreme Court in Alexander v. Sandoval that individuals \n     cannot sue to enforce regulations under Title VI of the Civil \n     Rights Act of 1964. Since the decision was issued states have \n     begun to use its reasoning in efforts to persuade the courts \n     that people with disabilities should not be allowed to \n     enforce regulations under the ADA and Section 504 of the \n     Rehabilitation Act requiring reasonable accommodations, \n     integration of individuals with disabilities, and accessible \n     public housing.\n       Mr. Pryor's positions in these and other cases (i.e., \n     Pennsylvania Department of Corrections v. Yeskey and \n     California Board of Medical Examiners v. Hason) clearly \n     represent an interpretation of the Equal Protection Clause, \n     Spending Clause, and Commerce Clause that would dramatically \n     restrict Congress's authority and hinder its ability to pass \n     laws protecting the rights of Americans with disabilities, \n     older workers, and others under the Constitution. For this \n     reason, Eastern Paralyzed Veterans Association strongly urges \n     you not to confirm Mr. Pryor to the court.\n       People with disabilities have fought long and hard to \n     achieve the protections afforded by the ADA and like-minded \n     laws. We must continue the fight to ensure that an activist \n     court does not abridge these rights and protections. Please \n     vote against William Pryor's confirmation.\n       Thank you.\n           Sincerely.\n                                                     Jeremy Chwat,\n     Director of Legislation.\n                                  ____\n\n                                      Independent Living Center of\n\n\n                                    Southern California, Inc.,\n\n                                                    July 14, 2003.\n       To Whom It May Concern: This letter is written on behalf of \n     the Independent Living Center Of Southern California, to \n     oppose the nomination of Mr. William Pryor, to the U.S. Court \n     of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit.\n       Please note that this nomination would gravely affect the \n     civil rights of persons with disabilities.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      Peter Huard,\n     Client Assistance Program.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                      The Freedom Center, Inc.\n\n                                     Frederick, MD, Ju1y 21, 2003.\n     Jim Ward,\n     Executive Director, ADA Watch Coalition, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Jim: I am the Executive Director for the Freedom \n     Center, a center for independent living in Frederick, MD. We \n     empower persons with disabilities to lead self-directed, \n     independent, and productive lives in a barrier-free \n     community. We work to ensure the removal of physical and \n     attitudinal barriers that are faced by Americans with \n     disabilities.\n       We, on behalf of the disability community, are strongly \n     opposed to the nomination of Alabama Attorney General William \n     G. Pryor. We are strongly opposed to the confirmation of his \n     appointment to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh \n     Circuit. This is a lifetime appointment which could \n     eventually lead to an appointment to the Supreme Court. \n     Attorney General Pryor's right-wing ideology is far outside \n     the mainstream of American legal thought. He is responsible \n     for the weakening of the ADA in recent Supreme Court battles. \n     He took a position against Patricia Garrett in her case \n     against the State of Alabama when she was wrongly \n     discriminated against because of her disability. He followed \n     her to the Supreme Court and was responsible for influencing \n     the Supreme Court by hiring an extreme Federalistic, right \n     wing, and a State's Rights activist lawyer to represent the \n     State of Alabama. Because the Supreme Court ruled in favor of \n     the State of Alabama against Ms. Garrett, the ADA has been \n     weakened. One can no longer sue a state government or entity \n     under the Federal ADA. It is Attorney General Pryor's belief \n     that the ADA is unconstitutional. In this respect, he has \n     undermined Congress's effort to protect all Americans \n     regardless of what state they live in. He has attacked \n     Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, the Individuals with \n     Disabilities Educational Act, and all basic civil rights \n     against people with disabilities. gender and race. He not \n     only has held a position in the University of Alabama v. \n     Ganett case but has filed Amicus Briefs in Pennsylvania Dept. \n     of Corrections v. Yeskey and Medical Board of California v. \n     Hason. He also took opposition to the Alexander v. Sandoval \n     case. All of his oppositions also include running amok in his \n     own state using the state laws to his own belief. It is \n     because of his ideology that we have laws such as the Federal \n     ADA, IDEA, Civil Rights, etc. The laws were implemented to \n     protect Americans from individuals like him. Because of his \n     track record, he cannot be a Federal Judge. A Federal Judge \n     must be unbiased and have full understanding of the total \n     law. A Federal Judge cannot interpret Federal laws to fulfill \n     his own beliefs as a State's Rights activist. A Federal Judge \n     cannot use his position to further his own cause. It is \n     imperative that we do all that we can do to help our \n     legislators to understand the importance of approving a \n     nomination that is nonpartisan of any individual who would \n     take his position seriously and for the good of the American \n     people and not for his own beliefs or reasons.\n       You may sign our name to any petition or letter that \n     opposes the confirmation of Alabama Attorney General William \n     G. Pryor. You have permission to use our letter to give to \n     members of Congress to help them to be our voices and \n     understand why we are so opposed to his confirmation to the \n     U.S. Court of Appeals to the Eleventh Circuit. Thank you very \n     much for your attention to this very urgent matter. Let's all \n     work together to prevent deteriorization to the ADA and other \n     disability civil rights.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Jamey George,\n     Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n                                       Independent Living Resource\n\n\n                                        Center--San Francisco,\n\n                                   San Franciso, CA, July 3, 2003.\n     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,\n     San Francisco, CA.\n       Dear Senator Feinstein: I am contacting you with great \n     concern about the possible appointment of an anti-ADA \n     judicial activist to the 11th Circuit Federal Court of \n     Appeals, Alabama Attorney General Bill Pryor. I am asking \n     you, on behalf of the over 150,000 people with disabilities \n     in San Francisco that our agency represents to firmly oppose \n     Mr. Pryor's appointment.\n       Attorney General Pryor has proved on many occasions that he \n     is an opponent not only of the ADA, but of other civil rights \n     legislation as well. Mr. Pryor did not support the passage of \n     an Alabama State disability rights law; has opposed \n     enforcement of ADA Title II to state prisons (arguments that \n     were rejected by the U.S. Supreme Court); has supported \n     denial of patients' rights for Medicaid recipients; among \n     other affronts to civil rights. This is hardly a neutral \n     judicial appointment.\n       We are concerned, Senator, that you hear the voices of your \n     constituents with disabilities. We find it ironic on the eve \n     of our country's `independence day' that such an opponent of \n     independence for people with disabilities should be a nominee \n     to such a key judicial post. Please oppose this nomination.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Pamela S. Fadem,\n                                      Information Manager, ILRCSF.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Here are 68 different disability groups from all over the \nUnited States.\n  This is from the National Association of the Deaf:\n\n       The National Association of the Deaf is opposing [Mr.] \n     Pryor because of his outspoken activism against federal civil \n     rights protections for people with disabilities and other \n     minorities. His commitment is to ideology, not to justice.\n\n  Here is the Illinois/Iowa Center for Independent Living:\n\n       We strongly feel that Mr. Pryor and his record as the \n     Attorney General in Alabama do NOT support nor represent the \n     millions of people with disabilities or their basic civil \n     rights.\n\n  The National Disabled Students Association stated the nomination of \nJudge Pryor would be ``devastating to the rights of over 54 million \nAmericans with disabilities protected by the Americans with \nDisabilities act. . . .''\n  So, Mr. President, there may be a lot of reasons that people have for \nopposing this nominee to go on the circuit court. I want to make it \ncrystal clear that my major objection to this person going on the \ncircuit court is his open, consistent, and persistent opposition to the \nAmericans with Disabilities Act. He has made no secret of it. He does \nnot think we had the power to pass it.\n  He said, in his own opinion, that we did not even document one single \ninstance of unconstitutional conduct against people with disabilities. \nWell, I am sorry, courts have held differently: forced sterilizations \nof people with disabilities, forced institutionalizations of people who \ndid not need to be institutionalized, denying people with disabilities \neducational opportunities. Maybe he never heard of the case of PARC v.\n\n[[Page S6263]]\n\nPennsylvania. Perhaps he did not know that courts had held there was a \nrecord, a strong record, of discrimination in public education against \nkids with disabilities, not letting them go to school, denying them \neducational opportunities.\n  The courts held that as long as a State provides a free public \neducation, just as they could not discriminate on the basis of race, or \nsex, or national origin, they cannot discriminate on the basis of \ndisability either. So the courts held that there is a constitutional \nright for kids in our country to get a free, appropriate public \neducation, as long as the State is providing that. The kids with \ndisabilities have to be allowed in the public schools, also.\n  But for Mr. Pryor, no. He says, no, not even one instance do we have \nof an unconstitutional discrimination. I do not know where Mr. Pryor \nwent to law school. I did not even look it up. It does not make any \ndifference to me. But whatever he learned there he must have forgotten. \nIt seems to me, here is an individual with an ideological perception \nthat he is right and everyone else is wrong, that only he knows what is \nconstitutional and not--not the Congress, not the Senate, not even the \nSupreme Court. He alone has a right to decide that. He alone has a \nright to decide whether people with disabilities are protected under \nthe Americans with Disabilities Act.\n  We have come too far in our country. We spent years developing the \nAmericans with Disabilities Act. When President Bush signed it in 1990, \nwe had accumulated a voluminous record of discrimination, from the \nearliest childhood to the latter stages of life, with people with \ndisabilities being discriminated against. We sought to remedy that with \nthe Americans with Disabilities Act.\n\n  When it passed the Senate, I said it was the proudest day of my \nlegislative career, and it still is--when the ADA passed the Congress \nand was signed into law. And we have not looked back. We look around \nour country now and we see people with disabilities in education, \ntraveling, going out to eat, holding down good jobs, getting the civil \nrights that all the rest of us enjoy.\n  But for Mr. Pryor, people with disabilities do not have those rights. \nThey only have the right--these are my own words--it seems to me Mr. \nPryor has said, in his decisions and in his writings and in his \nperceptions of the Americans with Disabilities Act, that people with \ndisabilities only have the right to be pitied, they only have the right \nto get whatever it is that those of us who are not disabled choose to \ngive to them.\n  Well, I am sorry, that is not enough. People with disabilities have \nevery right, Mr. President, that you and I have. So it is for that \nreason, that he has gone out of his way--I could see if a judge made \none mistake and maybe made a decision but came back and rectified it, \nlooked at the law, looked at the history, but Mr. Pryor did not do \nthat. He did not go back and look at the history of the ADA. He did not \ngo back and find out all these examples that we had come up with that \nis in the record. He just simply said: I know what is best. I know what \nis best for people with disabilities.\n  Well, people with disabilities have been hearing that for far too \nlong in our country: We know what is best for you--that paternalizing \nattitude. People with disabilities said: No, we are going to be on our \nown. We are going to have our own civil rights. We are going to decide \nour own future. We are going to decide how we want to live, not how \nyou, the Government, or you, society, want us to live.\n  Well, we have come a long way in 15 years since the ADA was signed. \nThis is one circuit court judge who would turn the clock back. And he \nwill get these cases. He will get them. And people with disabilities \nwill be on the short end of the stick.\n  So for that reason, and perhaps a lot of other reasons but for that \nreason alone--for that reason alone--Mr. Pryor should not be confirmed \nfor this circuit court position.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence \nof a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the nomination \nof William Pryor to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit \nor, to put it more precisely, I rise to support the permanent \nappointment of Judge William Pryor to the Eleventh Circuit.\n  Judge Pryor's credentials, his character, and commitment to judicial \nrestraint already make a compelling case for his appointment. His \ncontinuing service on the Eleventh Circuit only adds to that compelling \ncase.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote for confirmation so Judge William Pryor \ncan continue to be a valuable member of the U.S. Court of Appeals.\n  Debate about this nomination did not just begin. President Bush \nnominated William Pryor more than 2 years ago. During a lengthy hearing \nbefore the Judiciary Committee in June 2003, he answered more than 185 \nquestions. It has now become common practice for Senators to deluge a \nnominee with post-hearing written questions. Judge Pryor answered \nnearly 300 of those as well. The Judiciary Committee debated this \nnomination during three different business meetings and favorably \nreported it twice here to the Senate floor where we have already \ndebated it in the context of two previous attempts to invoke cloture.\n  Here we are debating the Pryor nomination again. I am one of many \nSenators who believes we should have confirmed this nomination a long \ntime ago. Yesterday more than one of our Democratic colleagues \ncomplained that we are debating judicial nominations when, they said, \n``we should be doing legislative business.'' That is exactly what we \nwould be doing were it not for the confirmation obstruction campaign \nled by those very same Democratic Senators. They are the ones who met \nin 2001 to change the confirmation ground rules. They are the ones who \ndemand dozens and dozens of unnecessary rollcall votes that have eaten \nup literally days of floor time. They are the ones who launched this \ncampaign of outrageous and unprecedented judicial filibusters.\n  Our Democratic colleagues have changed the way we do judicial \nconfirmation business in the Senate, and that has changed the way we do \nlegislative business. They have no one to blame but themselves. To come \nin here and complain that we are not doing the business of the people \nwhen one-third of the separated powers in this country involves judges \nis pretty much out of line.\n  Under the standards the Senate traditionally applied to judicial \nnominations, we would already have confirmed the nomination before us. \nAlthough some across the aisle have attempted to change the ground \nrules, I am pleased we have now invoked cloture and are in the final \nstretch of debate on this very important nomination. There is light at \nthe end of the confirmation tunnel.\n  We have become accustomed to the pattern of attack by those who \noppose President Bush's judicial nominees. They equate a nominee's \npersonal views with that nominee's judicial views. They create the most \nwretched and distorted caricature of a nominee, turning him into some \ncreature one might see on ``Law and Order'' or ``America's Most \nWanted.''\n  What it boils down to is the wrongheaded notion that no one who \nthinks for himself, who does not toe the leftwing line, whose \nperspective or values did not turn the liberal litmus paper the right--\nor left--color, or who as a judge may fail consistently to deliver \npolitically correct results is acceptable. These advocates of an \nactivist judiciary are not foolish enough to attack every nominee. They \nwill remind us of how many of this President's judicial nominees they \nhave supported. But the circumstances that have brought us here today \ndemonstrate the confirmation ground has shifted.\n  I urge my colleagues not to be persuaded by the caricatures created \nby Washington-based lobbyists and leftwing groups which need to send \nout the next fundraising appeal. Instead I urge my colleagues to listen \nto those who actually know William Pryor, who have worked with William \nPryor, because they are among his strongest supporters.\n\n[[Page S6264]]\n\n  Dr. Joe Reed, chairman of the Alabama Democratic Conference--yes, \nthat is right, the Alabama Democratic Conference, the State Democratic \nParty's African-American caucus--knows William Pryor. He has worked \nwith William Pryor, and he strongly supports William Pryor. Note what \nDr. Joe Reed has to say about this nominee.\n  He says that William Pryor:\n\n     will uphold the law without fear or favor. I believe all \n     races and colors will get a fair shake when their cases come \n     before him. I am a member of the Democratic National \n     Committee and, of course, General Pryor is a Republican, but \n     these are only party labels. I am persuaded that in General \n     Pryor's eyes, Justice has only one label--Justice!\n\n  Any of us would certainly be hard pressed to come up with a better \nendorsement or a more substantive compliment for any judge on any court \nanywhere in America.\n  Listen to Alvin Holmes, an African American who has served in the \nAlabama House of Representatives for nearly three decades. He \nintroduced a bill to remove the State Constitution's ban on interracial \nmarriage. Representative Holmes says that while white political leaders \nin the State, Democrats and Republicans, either opposed the bill or \nkept quiet, then-Attorney General William Pryor spoke out. William \nPryor urged Alabamans to vote for removing the ban on interracial \nmarriage and then, when it passed, he defended the measure in court \nagainst legal challenge.\n  Representative Holmes knows William Pryor. He has worked with William \nPryor, and he strongly supports William Pryor. Listen to what \nRepresentative Holmes says about this nominee, this African-American \nleader of the Alabama House of Representatives:\n\n       I request your swift confirmation of Bill Pryor to the 11th \n     Circuit because of his constant efforts to help the causes of \n     blacks in Alabama.\n\n  Or consider the opinion of Judge Sue Bell Cobb who sits on the \nAlabama Court of Criminal Appeals. This is what she says:\n\n       I write, not only as the only statewide Democrat to be \n     elected in 2000, not only as a member of the Court which \n     reviews the greatest portion of General Pryor's work, but \n     also as a child advocate who has labored shoulder to shoulder \n     with General Pryor in the political arena on behalf of \n     Alabama's children. It is for these reasons and more that I \n     am indeed honored to recommend General Pryor for nomination \n     to the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals.\n\n  That is the Honorable Sue Bell Cobb, judge of the Alabama Court of \nCriminal Appeals.\n  Think about that. These are people who know William Pryor. These \ntestimonies--and there are many more like them--describe a man who \ncares deeply about what is right and who has the character to do what \nis right, no matter what the political cost. People such as these are \nin the best position to know the real William Pryor. If this were a \ncourt of law, their testimony would be deemed especially credible. \nTheirs is not hearsay testimony such as we are hearing from some with \nthe other side. They are not repeating someone's talking points. They \nare not offering generalities or cliches.\n  Talking points, generalities, and cliches, however, are all that \nJudge Pryor's opponents have to offer. The far left-wing Washington-\nbased lobbyists who appear to make their living opposing President \nBush's judicial nominations repeat the same rhetoric about nominee \nafter nominee. Sometimes I wonder whether they put together their press \nreleases and action alerts simply by cutting and pasting in the name of \na new nominee.\n  They use the same mantra now, saying Judge Pryor is hostile to civil \nrights, hostile to virtually every right under the sun. Perhaps he is \nalso the cause of childhood asthma, global warming, and rising interest \nrates.\n  I would listen to the people I have just quoted who know the man. \nThey are all Democrats, by the way.\n  If there is any reason to believe such a thing as these awful \ncomments that have been made by our colleagues on the other side, then \nthese left-wing Washington lobbyists should be able to convince Dr. Joe \nReed, Alvin Holmes, and Judge Sue Bell Cobb that Judge William Pryor is \nhostile to civil rights. I wish them luck because I know they can't do \nthat. And they know they can't do it. That is what is reprehensible.\n  Perhaps the most important element of judicial duty is the commitment \nto follow the law regardless of personal views. Throughout his career \nWilliam Pryor has not just stated such a commitment to judicial \nrestraint, he has demonstrated it. We all know, for example, that \nWilliam Pryor is pro-life. His belief in the sanctity of human life no \ndoubt helps explain his advocacy for children. Like millions of \nAmericans, most Alabamians apparently share such pro-life values. In \n1997, the State legislature enacted a ban on partial-birth abortion. If \nWilliam Pryor were what his critics claim, that would surely have been \nhis chance to take a stand, stake a claim, defy the Supreme Court, and \nto seek to impose his personal moral code. He did no such thing, \nproving once again that his critics are flat wrong.\n  (Mr. ALEXANDER assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. HATCH. After the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in Stenberg v. Carhart \nthat a State legislative ban on partial-birth abortion is \nunconstitutional, Attorney General William Pryor instructed State law \nenforcement officials to abide by that decision, even though he \npersonally disagreed. The Senator from Tennessee, Mr. Alexander, \npresiding in the Chair right now, reminded us earlier today that this \nwas at General Pryor's own initiative. The law, not his personal views, \nformed how he carried out his official duties.\n  Attorney General Pryor filed an amicus brief in the Lawrence v. Texas \ncase defending a State's right to prohibit certain sexual conduct. \nAlabama had a statute similar to the Texas statute being challenged in \nthat case. When the Supreme Court ruled against his position, he \nimmediately released an official statement that the Supreme Court \ndecision rendered Alabama's law unenforceable.\n  Similarly, the entire country knows that as Alabama Attorney General, \nWilliam Pryor took an unpopular stand regarding the Ten Commandments \ndisplay in the Alabama judicial building. One respected religious \nmagazine placed a picture of Judge Pryor on its cover with a headline \nasking whether his legal stance amounted to political suicide. It is \nclear that Judge Pryor places the law above personal priorities and \npolitical expediency. This stuff about following the law rather than \npersonal opinions is not rhetoric, talking points, or window dressing. \nThis is not just William Pryor's stated commitment, this is \nhis demonstrated commitment.\n\n  It is a record that makes former Alabama Attorney General Bill \nBaxley, another Democrat, strongly support Judge Pryor's nomination. \nHere is what General Baxley, a leading Democrat in Alabama, said about \nWilliam Pryor:\n\n       In every difficult decision he has made, his actions were \n     supported by his interpretation of the law, without race, \n     gender, age, political power, wealth, community standing, or \n     any other competing interest affecting judgment. I often \n     disagree, politically, with Bill Pryor. This does not prevent \n     me from making this recommendation because we need \n     fairminded, intelligent, industrious men and women, possessed \n     of impeccable integrity, on the Eleventh Circuit. Bill Pryor \n     has these qualities in abundance. . . . There is no better \n     choice for this vacancy.\n\n  That is Bill Baxley, former Alabama Attorney General, leading \nDemocrat in the State.\n  Just think about that. These Democratic leaders from Alabama paint a \nvery consistent picture of William Pryor. He will uphold the law \nwithout fear or favor. He makes decisions without regard to political \nor irrelevant factors. He is fairminded, intelligent, and industrious. \nI certainly agree with this assessment, though it does not come first \nfrom the Senator from Utah. Democrats such as Dr. Joe Reed, \nRepresentative Alvin Holmes, Judge Sue Bell Cobb, and Attorney General \nBill Baxley know the difference between private views and public duty. \nThey know the difference between personal opinion and judicial opinion. \nAnd they strongly support William Pryor's nomination to the Eleventh \nCircuit.\n  I wish some of my Democratic colleagues and their left-wing enablers \nknew the difference. Instead they focus only on results. All that \nmatters, it appears, is that a judge rules right or left, as the case \nmay be.\n  On Tuesday a Democratic Member of this body summed up their results-\noriented litmus test approach when he said:\n\n\n[[Page S6265]]\n\n\n     with respect to a whole series of issues, this nominee is \n     profoundly wrong.\n\n  No doubt each of us in this body has heard something like that in a \ncampaign commercial. We might hear it here when the Senate is in \nlegislative session. But this is a judicial nomination we are debating. \nWhat does it mean to say that the judicial nominee is wrong on the \nissues? Never mind being judicially correct, just be politically \ncorrect. Results are all that matters.\n  Yesterday during the debate on the Brown nomination, the Senator from \nCalifornia, Mrs. Boxer, took a similar tack. She put up one poster \nafter another, each stating in the most simplistic terms the results of \na case, and then claimed that Justice Brown personally favored the \nresult for which she voted.\n  This insidious tactic claims, for example, that if a judge votes that \nthe law does not prohibit racial slurs, then the judge must favor \nracial slurs. If a judge votes that the law does not prohibit an \nemployer's hiring decision, then the judge must favor that hiring \ndecision. In March of 2000, 29 current Senators, including my friend \nfrom California, Senator Boxer, voted against a constitutional \namendment to allow protection of the American flag. How would any of \nthem respond--how would the Senator from California respond--to the \naccusation that by that vote, they were siding with the flag \ndesecraters?\n  That would be an outrageous charge, and we all know that.\n  Yet opponents of these judicial nominees, including the Senator from \nCalifornia, are using exactly the same tactic, exactly the same logic. \nThey continue doing so in this debate over William Pryor's nomination. \nBut this tactic misleads the American people about what judges do, and \nit twists and distorts these debates about whether to confirm judicial \nnominees.\n  I am reminded of a 1998 article written by the distinguished Judge \nHarry Edwards, appointed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the DC \nCircuit by President Jimmy Carter, in which he warned that giving the \npublic a distorted view of judges' work is bad for the judiciary and \nthe rule of law. The tactics being used against nominees such as \nWilliam Pryor are, indeed, giving the public a distorted view of \njudges' work.\n  Thankfully, Judge Pryor knows the difference between personal views \nand the law. He knows the difference between means and ends. And I am \nproud to say that Judge Pryor refuses to go down the politicized road \nof judicial activism. He has demonstrated where his commitment lies. He \nhas shown, in each phase of his career, that he will follow the law.\n  Our colleague and my fellow Judiciary Committee member, Senator \nSessions, has worked very hard to educate this body about this fine \nnominee. He has a special perspective on Judge Pryor's commitment to \nfollow the law. He hired William Pryor in the Alabama attorney \ngeneral's office and Judge Pryor replaced him when then-Attorney \nGeneral Sessions joined us here in the Senate. I thank our colleague \nfor his tireless and principled efforts. I know this Senator's \nunderstanding of this nominee is better as a result.\n  William Pryor is demonstrating that same commitment on the U.S. Court \nof Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit. That is exactly what America needs \nin her judges, and I urge my colleagues to support a permanent \nappointment for Judge William Pryor.\n  Mr. President, I have taken a minute or two over my allotted time. I \napologize to my colleague.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I support the confirmation of William \nPryor to the Eleventh Circuit. I think he is a truly outstanding \nindividual and, most importantly, after all these years of waiting, I \nam pleased he is finally going to get an up-or-down vote on his \nnomination. I am pleased, in just a few hours, Bill Pryor will be \nconfirmed as a Federal appellate judge. He more than deserves to be \nconfirmed by the Senate. Bill Pryor is doing a great job now, and he \nwill continue doing a great job in the future.\n  The problem is how we have gotten to where we are with the hangup and \nthese judges not being voted on. I continue to be troubled by the road \nwe have been going down in this judicial nomination process. \nUnfortunately for Bill Pryor, he has been one of the prime targets of \nthe slash-and-burn program of the left-wing liberal interest groups. He \nand several other good candidates nominated by President Bush have been \nsubject to off-base, trumped-up charges which just smear an \nindividual's record without regard to the reality of that record.\n  We need to look at the merits of a candidate, and, on the merits, \nBill Pryor is one of the more impressive nominees coming before the \nSenate.\n  William Pryor graduated magna cum laude from Tulane Law School, where \nhe was editor in chief of the law review. He served as a law clerk to \ncivil rights legend and champion Judge John Wisdom. He practiced law \nfor several years before joining the attorney general's office in the \nState of Alabama. He also taught law as an adjunct professor at \nCumberland Law School. So without a doubt, and going even beyond the \ngood attributes I pointed out, Bill Pryor has the legal experience to \nserve on this Federal bench. But that is not all. William Pryor has the \nunwavering support of the people who knew him best--the citizens of his \nvery own State of Alabama. His support among Alabama Republicans is \nnear unanimous. But furthermore, and maybe more importantly, some of \nthe most important members of the Alabama Democratic leadership are \njust as supportive of this Pryor nomination.\n  For example, the chairman of the Alabama Democratic Conference, which \nis the State Democratic Party's African-American caucus, said that Bill \nPryor is a first-class public official who will be a credit to the \njudiciary and a guardian of justice.\n  Former Democratic Gov. Don Siegelman described Bill Pryor as an \nincredibly talented, intellectually honest attorney general who calls \nthe issues like they ought to be called.\n  These are just some of the comments made by Democrats, of which I am \naware, who support this good man.\n  But that does not seem to stop some groups or people inside the \nbeltway from upping that ante and spreading lies. The usual suspects \nare back in the saddle again, however, with a vengeance to \nmischaracterize this man's record and drag his good name through the \nmud.\n  But if one really takes a close look at Bill Pryor's record, one can \nonly find that he is a man who embodies the characteristics that any \nFederal judge ought to have. The fact is that William Pryor is a man \nwho puts law before politics. The role of a Federal judge, as all my \ncolleagues know and as best stated by Chief Justice John Marshall, \nis to ``say what the law is.''\n\n  That is exactly upon which Bill Pryor has built a distinguished law \ncareer. The truth is, in the face of opposition from both Democrats and \nRepublicans, Bill Pryor has steadfastly based his legal decisions on \ncourt rulings and not on his own political beliefs. Bill Pryor's \nactions are the only record that we need to look at to see that this is \nan individual who truly believes in the rule of law. He is the right \nman for the job, and we should keep this man on the Eleventh Circuit \nCourt.\n  I have looked at Bill Pryor's record and some of the allegations made \nagainst him. Bill Pryor wins hands down, no contest.\n  I would like to refer to an article in the ``Mobile Press Register,'' \n``Civil Rights Guardian, Outstanding Nominee.'' In this article, Willie \nHuntley took the opportunity to distinguish the views of Alabamians and \nmost Americans from those shared by some inside-the-beltway, left-wing \ninterest groups. Mr. Huntley is an African-American attorney. He is \nfrom Bill Pryor's hometown. He expressed why the people of Alabama \nshould continue to trust in this man, Bill Pryor, rather than in the \nliberal special interest groups, such as People for the American Way, \norganizations that are so powerful here with some Members of Congress.\n  I would like to read some of what this article has to say about Bill \nPryor, again, emphasizing Willie Huntley, an African-American attorney \nfrom Bill Pryor's hometown:\n\n       People for the American Way asserts that Pryor's \n     appointment would devastate civil rights. What its people \n     don't say is that after about 100 years of inaction by other \n     leaders, Bill Pryor led a coalition that included the NAACP \n     to rid the Alabama Constitution of its racist ban on \n     interracial marriage.\n\n[[Page S6266]]\n\n       Bill Pryor then defended the repeal against a court \n     challenge by a so-called Confederate organization. Our \n     Attorney General also took the side of the NAACP in \n     successfully defending majority-minority voting districts--\n     all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court--against challenges by \n     white Alabama Republicans.\n       Bill Pryor further opposed a white Republican redistricting \n     proposal that would have hurt African-American voters. He did \n     not back down to criticism from his own party--not one inch.\n       He then played a key role in the successful prosecution of \n     former Ku Klux Klansmen Bobby Frank Cherry and Thomas \n     Blanton, Jr., for the 1963 bombings of the 16th Street \n     Baptist Church in Birmingham.\n       Pryor started a mentoring program for at-risk kids and \n     regularly goes to Montgomery public schools to teach African-\n     American kids to read.\n       Because Bill Pryor has a civil rights record that very few \n     can equal, it is no wonder that African-American leaders who \n     know and who have worked with him--like Artur Davis, Joe \n     Reed, Cleo Thomas, and Alvin Holmes--support his nomination \n     to the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals.\n       Ignoring Pryor's defense of voting rights for African-\n     Americans, People for the American Way charges that he \n     opposes the landmark Voting Rights Act. The truth is, he has \n     dutifully enforced all of the Voting Rights Act every time a \n     case has come up.\n\n  The article goes on to conclude:\n\n       The truth and the record show that Bill Pryor has fought \n     for the civil rights and voting rights of African-Americans \n     in Alabama when People for the American Way were nowhere to \n     be found. Now that President Bush has nominated Pryor to a \n     Federal judgeship, People for the American Way assumes that \n     it can come here and attack him. . . .We who actually know \n     Bill Pryor support him 100 percent.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record the \narticle from which I quoted so people can read it in its entirety.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                            [From CFIF.ORG]\n\n               Civil Rights Guardian, Outstanding Nominee\n\n                       (By Willie J. Huntley Jr.)\n\n       The Washington-headquartered, liberal witch-hunt against \n     President Bush's federal judicial nominees has targeted its \n     next victim, and it is one of our own: Bill Pryor, the \n     attorney general of Alabama.\n       Among those leading the charge against Pryor is the mis-\n     named group People For the American Way. This should be no \n     surprise; PFAW has led vicious attacks against Attorney \n     General John Ashcroft, Justice Clarence Thomas, Priscilla \n     Owen, Miguel Estrada and numerous other Republican nominees.\n       PFAW is a radical leftist group that has supported broad \n     court protection for child pornography; burning the American \n     flag, and publicly funded art portraying the Virgin Mary \n     splattered with elephant dung. Most recently, PFAW helped \n     coordinate protests against the war in Iraq--the war in which \n     some Alabamians gave their lives for their country.\n       PFAW is funded by the pornography industry and Hollywood \n     radicals, including Playboy magazine, the Screen Actors \n     Guild, and the Center for Alternative Media & Culture. (And \n     they call Bill Pryor an extremist.)\n       PFAW asserts that Pryor's appointment would devastate civil \n     rights. What its people don't say is that after about 100 \n     years of inaction by other leaders, Bill Pryor led a \n     coalition that included the NAACP to rid the Alabama \n     Constitution of its racist ban on interracial marriage.\n       Pryor then defended the repeal against a court challenge by \n     a so-called Confederate heritage organization.\n       Our attorney general also took the side of the NAACP in \n     successfully defending majority-minority voting districts--\n     all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court--against a challenge by \n     white Alabama Republicans.\n       Bill Pryor further opposed a white Republican redistricting \n     proposal that would have hurt African-American voters. He did \n     not back down to criticism from his own party--not one inch.\n       He then played a key role in the successful prosecution of \n     former Ku Klux Klansmen Bobby Frank Cherry and Thomas Blanton \n     Jr. for the 1963 bombing of the Sixteenth Street Baptist \n     Church in Birmingham. In fact, he will personally argue to \n     uphold Blanton's murder conviction before the Alabama \n     Court of Criminal Appeals later this month.\n       Pryor started a mentoring program for at-risk kids, and \n     regularly goes to Montgomery public schools to teach African-\n     American kids to read.\n       Because Bill Pryor has a civil rights record that very few \n     can equal, it is no wonder that African-American leaders who \n     know and have worked with him--like Artur Davis, Joe Reed, \n     Cleo Thomas and Alvin Holmes--support his nomination to the \n     11th Circuit Court of Appeals.\n       Ignoring Pryor's defense of voting rights for African-\n     Americans, PFAW charges that he opposes the landmark Voting \n     Rights Act. The truth is, he has dutifully enforced all of \n     the Voting Rights Act every time a case has come up.\n       Pryor has simply stated that a procedural part of the \n     Voting Rights Act--Section 5--has problems that Congress \n     should fix. Section 5 requires federal officials in \n     Washington to approve even minor changes in voting practices \n     that have nothing to do with discrimination.\n       For example, last year, Pryor issued an opinion that \n     required a white replacement candidate for a deceased white \n     state legislator to get Washington approval under Section 5 \n     to use stickers to put his name on the ballot over the name \n     of the deceased candidate.\n       Thurbert Baker, the African-American Democratic attorney \n     general of Georgia, has voiced similar concerns about Section \n     5 before the U.S. Supreme Court.\n       Undeterred, PFAW and its allies also charge that Pryor \n     believes in ``states' rights''--their code words for racism. \n     The truth is that he believes in the Constitution. He has \n     fought to protect the state's treasury from lawsuits that \n     would have taken our tax dollars away from the state--away \n     from salaries for teachers and medical care for poor people.\n       It is the job of an attorney general to defend his client--\n     the state. In fact, the key Supreme Court case on defending a \n     state from lawsuits was won not by Pryor, but by Democratic \n     Attorney General Bob Butterworth of Florida.\n       Democratic attorneys general like Eliot Spitzer of New \n     York, Jim Doyle of Wisconsin and others have all made the \n     same arguments to defend their state budgets. I guess they \n     are all ``right-wing extremists,'' too.\n       PFAW and its allies have also attacked Pryor for being \n     extremist on abortion rights. As a dedicated Roman Catholic, \n     Bill Pryor loves kids and is against abortion, no doubt about \n     it.\n       But even though he disagrees with abortion, he instructed \n     Alabama's district attorneys to apply Alabama's partial-birth \n     abortion law in a moderate way that was consistent with U.S. \n     Supreme Court precedent.\n       Again, he was criticized by Republicans; pro-life activists \n     accused him of gutting the statute. Again, he didn't back \n     down.\n       Not surprisingly, PFAW and its allies have attacked Pryor \n     for supporting the display of the Ten Commandments in \n     courthouses. But Pryor simply took the position that if a \n     representation of the Ten Commandments can be carved into the \n     wall of the U.S. Supreme Court's courtroom, it can be placed \n     in an Alabama courtroom.\n       PFAW also has attacked Pryor for the position he took in \n     the Alexander vs. Sandoval case, in which a person who didn't \n     speak English sued to force Alabama to spend its money on \n     printing driver's license tests in foreign languages.\n       As broke as our state is, there are better things to spend \n     our money on--like teaching kids to read English so they can \n     take the test and read road signs, and also paving the roads \n     for them to drive on. Pryor fought this attempt to drain our \n     state budget, and the U.S. Supreme Court agreed with him.\n       The truth and the record show that Bill Pryor has fought \n     for the civil rights and voting rights of African-Americans \n     in Alabama when PFAW was nowhere to be found. Now that \n     President Bush has nominated Pryor to a federal judgeship, \n     PFAW assumes that it can come here and attack him.\n       I, for one, suggest that PFAW pack up its pro-pornography, \n     flag-burning, anti-religious, attack-dog tactics and go back \n     to Hollywood and Washington.\n       We who actually know Bill Pryor support him 100 percent.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I hope my colleagues will see through \nall the smoke and mirrors that have been kicked up by groups such as \nthe People for the American Way. I hope my colleagues will take a very \nclose look at the facts and reject those allegations that are not true, \njust as many Alabamians have so rejected because the people who know \nthis man best ought to be the ones to whom we listen.\n  I hope that Bill Pryor's true record will shine through and that my \ncolleagues will join me in supporting his nomination.\n  I close by, once again, telling my Senate colleagues that if the role \nof a Federal judge is to say, as Chief Justice John Marshall said, ``to \nsay what the law is,'' then there are very few candidates as qualified \nas William Pryor.\n  Being a good judge is not about doing what is popular, and it is not \nfor sure about giving in to liberal special interest groups, and it \ncertainly is not about legislating the left-wing's agenda from the \nbench. Being a good judge is about fairly applying the law, fairly \napplying the law no matter who the person is, no matter how unpopular \nthe cause or the argument being advocated is. It is not the role of a \njudge, nor should it ever be the role of a judge, to serve as a puppet \nto the popular position. That is what William Pryor has built his \ncareer on--the rule of law, enforcing the law, carrying out the law.\n  I know that is what William Pryor will continue to do when he is \nfinally confirmed by this Senate for the Eleventh Circuit Court of \nAppeals.\n\n[[Page S6267]]\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I understand we are under a time \nconsideration. I believe I have half an hour. Is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Chair remind me when I have 5 minutes \nremaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair will do that.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to oppose Mr. \nPryor's nomination. Contrary to the widespread impression of a partisan \nbreakdown in the judicial nominations process, Democrats in this \nclosely divided Senate have sought to cooperate with the President on \nthe issues. And we have largely succeeded. We have confirmed 210 of \nPresident Bush's nominees in the past 4 years; 96 percent of the \nnominees have been confirmed.\n  Only 10 nominees did not receive the broad bipartisan support needed \nfor confirmation, because their records showed that they would roll \nback basic rights and protections.\n  Mr. Pryor's nomination illustrates the problems. His views are at the \nextreme right wing of legal thinking. It is clear from his record that \nhe does not deserve confirmation to a lifetime seat on an appellate \ncourt that often has the last word on vital issues for millions of \npeople who live in Alabama, Georgia, and Florida, the States that \ncomprise the Eleventh Circuit.\n  Mr. Pryor is no true conservative. He has sought to advance a radical \nagenda contrary to much of the Supreme Court's jurisprudence over the \nlast 40 years, and at odds with important precedents that have made our \ncountry more inclusive and fair.\n  Mr. Pryor has fought aggressively to undermine the power of Congress \nto protect civil and individual rights. He has tried to cut back on the \nFamily and Medical Leave Act, the Americans with Disabilities Act, and \nthe Clean Water Act. He has been contemptuously dismissive of claims of \nracial bias in the application of the death penalty, and has \nrelentlessly advocated the use of the death penalty, even for persons \nwith mental retardation. Mr. Pryor has even ridiculed the current \nSupreme Court Justices, calling them ``nine octogenarian lawyers who \nhappen to sit on the Supreme Court.'' He even has his facts wrong. Only \ntwo of the nine Justices are 80 years old or older.\n  In addition to these serious substantive concerns, his nomination was \nrushed through the Judiciary Committee in violation of the committee's \nrules, before the committee could complete its investigation of major \nethical questions raised by the nominee's own testimony at his hearing \nand by his answers and non-answers to the committee's follow-up \nquestions. When these serious problems in Mr. Pryor's record prevented \nhim from receiving the Senate support needed for confirmation, \nPresident Bush made an end-run around the constitutional system of \nchecks and balances by giving him a recess appointment during a brief \nSenate recess that was, in all likelihood, an unconstitutional use of \nthe recess appointment power.\n  In the last Congress, some Members of the majority presented a \nversion of the history of the nomination and the committee's \ninvestigation which did not comport with the facts. The history is \nimportant, because it shows that Democrats have in fact acted \nexpeditiously and responsibly, and that the rush to judgment in the \ncommittee in the last Congress was clearly an effort to cut off a \nneeded further investigation.\n  As the extraordinary rollcall vote in the Judiciary Committee on July \n23, 2003 shows, every member of the minority voted, ``no, under protest \nfor the violation of Rule IV.''\n  Democrats did not invent the issue that provoked such an \nunprecedented protest. Years before Mr. Pryor's nomination, lengthy \narticles in Texas and D.C. newspapers raised the question of the \npropriety of the activities of the Republican Attorneys General \nAssociation.\n  It was reported that the organization sought campaign contributions \nto support the election of Republican attorneys general, by arguing \nthey would be less aggressive than Democratic attorneys general in \nchallenging business interests for violations of the law. Some \ndescriptions of this effort characterized it as a ``shakedown'' scheme.\n  The leaders of the association denied the allegations, but refused to \ndisclose its contributors. They were able to maintain their secrecy by \nfunneling the contributions through an account at the Republican \nNational Committee that aggregated various kinds of State campaign \ncontributions, and avoided separate public reporting of the \ncontributions or the amount of their gifts.\n  The issue received significant press coverage during the 2002 Senate \ncampaign in Texas, especially after several Republican attorneys \ngeneral denounced the association as fraught with ethical problems.\n  Because Mr. Pryor had been identified publicly as a leader of the \nassociation's efforts, and the ethical issues raised by it were \nobviously relevant to his qualifications, he was asked about the issue \nat his nomination hearing and in written follow-up questions. His \nresponses avoided the issue and raised more questions than they \nanswered.\n  In July 2003, the Judiciary Committee began a bipartisan \ninvestigation of the matter, in accordance with an investigative plan \nprovided to the majority. No witnesses were ever questioned under oath \nas part of the investigation, and in fact, the investigation was cut \nshort by the committee majority almost as soon as it began. The \nRepublican investigator actually instructed interviewees that they did \nnot have to answer questions from the minority investigator, or comply \nwith document requests from the minority.\n  As a result, all of the committee Democrats, having considered the \ninformation available up to that point, wrote to the chairman and \ninformed him that the investigation was producing serious and \ndisturbing information, that it would require substantial additional \ntime, that his investigators were interfering with it, and that after \nit was complete, the minority members would want to question the \nnominee under oath.\n  The Republican staff had offered informal staff interviews with the \nnominee before that time, but the Democratic investigators had, as any \nserious investigator would, declined that offer until the basic \ninvestigative work had been done. In any event, the Democratic members \nwanted to question the nominee in person under oath at the appropriate \ntime.\n  At the committee meeting to consider the issue, the chairman rejected \nthe minority's unanimous request out of hand. He insisted on a vote on \nthe nomination without completion of the investigation and without \nfurther questioning of the nominee under oath. That was the situation \nwhen Senator Leahy invoked the committee's rule IV to prevent a \npremature vote on the nomination. The party line vote was 10-9.\n  The fact that no minority member was among the 10 should have \nprevented an immediate vote on the nomination and allowed the \ninvestigation to continue. But the chairman refused to follow rule IV \nand insisted on an immediate vote.\n  The 9 Democrats on the committee all voted against reporting the \nnomination, each noting an objection to the violation of rule IV.\n  The 10 Republicans voted to report it, with one Republican stating \nthat his vote to report it did not mean he would necessarily vote for \nthe nominee on the floor. He also stated that he would want to review \nthe results of the investigation with the nominee before any Senate \nvote.\n  Despite the lack of cooperation from the majority staff, the minority \nstaff attempted to obtain further information, and did develop new \ninformation which expanded both the scope and the gravity of our \noriginal concerns. However, in the face of the majority's refusal to \ncooperate, a further investigation involving the witnesses was \nimpossible.\n  I mention this to make clear that the matters raised by this \ninvestigation are very serious, and we should not sweep these questions \nunder the rug. We are not doing our job in reviewing this nomination if \nwe look the other way in the face of these serious ethical questions. \nThe Judiciary Committee should have completed the investigation in \n2003, reviewed its findings, heard from the nominee under oath,\n\n[[Page S6268]]\n\nand then decided whether he should be listed for debate and \nconsideration.\n  This year, when the committee again considered Judge Pryor's \nnomination, the majority offered to permit a few phone calls to \nwitnesses whose telephone interviews were not completed or who could \nnot be found in 2003. That offer was appreciated, but, as was obvious \nfrom the first call, it was too little and too late.\n  The well of evidence had been poisoned by the majority investigator's \nnegative statements to witnesses in 2003, and now it would take an even \nmore concerted inquiry to elicit the full story from witnesses who were \nadverse to begin with. Nevertheless, because some day that story will \nprobably come out, this aspect of the nomination remains a ticking-\nethical time bomb.\n  The rush to judgment on this nomination is particularly troubling, \ngiven the serious substantive problems in Mr. Pryor's record. His \nsupporters say that his views have gained acceptance by the courts, and \nthat his legal positions are well within the legal mainstream, but many \ndisagree. Mr. Pryor has consistently advocated to narrow individual \nrights and freedoms far beyond what any court in this land has been \nwilling to hold.\n  The Supreme Court rejected his argument that States could not be sued \nfor money damages for violating the Family and Medical Leave Act. Had \nMr. Pryor prevailed, it would have been far more difficult to protect \nworkers who need time off because of their own health problems or to \ncare for a loved one.\n  The Supreme Court also rejected Mr. Pryor's sweeping argument that \nCongress lacked authority to pass the Clean Water Act's protections for \nwetlands that are home to migratory birds.\n  The Court rejected his argument that States should be able to \ncriminalize private sexual conduct between consenting adults. It \nrejected his far-reaching argument that counties should have the same \nimmunity from lawsuits that Sates have. It rejected his argument that \nthe right to counsel does not apply to defendants with suspended \nsentences of imprisonment. It rejected his argument that it was \nconstitutional for Alabama prison guards to handcuff prisoners to \nhitching posts for hours in the summer heat.\n  Mr. Pryors opposition to the rights of the disabled is particularly \ndisturbing. In one case, in an opinion Justice Scalia, the Supreme \nCourt unanimously rejected his argument that the Americans with \nDisabilities Act does not apply to State prisons.\n  In another case, the Supreme Court rejected his view that provisions \nof the act ensuring that those with disabilities have access to public \nservices are unconstitutional. In that case, a plaintiff who uses a \nwheelchair had challenged the denial of access to a public courthouse. \nHe had refused to crawl up the courthouse stairs to reach the public \ncourtroom. In his brief in the case, Mr. Pryor argued that Congress has \nno power to require States to make public facilities accessible to the \ndisabled. He argued that denying access to courthouses does not violate \nthe principle of equal protection, because the disabled have no \nabsolute right to attend legal proceedings affecting their rights.\n  In arguing that the legislative history did not show a need for them \nto act, Mr. Pryor dismissed congressional findings of discrimination \nagainst the disabled, and evidence that the University of Georgia had \nlocated its office of handicapped services in an inaccessible second-\nfloor room. According to Mr. Pryor, such ``anecdotes provide no \nindication of the extent of the inaccessibility, or whether the \ninaccessibility lacked a rational basis and was therefore \nunconstitutional.'' That is nonsense. It is obvious that the wording of \nthis legislative history clearly describes the extent of the \ninaccessibility. And there is no rational justification for a State \nuniversity to put an office serving disabled students in an \ninaccessible second-floor location.\n  The Supreme Court also rejected Mr. Pryor's radical view of what \nconstitutes cruel and unusual punishment in the use of the death \npenalty. It rejected his argument that executing retarded persons does \nnot offend the eighth amendment. The Eleventh Circuit, a court \ndominated by conservative, Republican appointees, later unanimously \nrejected Mr. Pryor's attempt to evade the Supreme Court's decision. He \nhad tried to prevent a prisoner with an IQ of 65, who even the \nprosecution agreed was mentally retarded, from raising a claim that he \nshould not be executed.\n  The Supreme Court also rejected his attempt to limit the right to \ncounsel for the poor. Mr. Pryor argued that the poor have no right to \ncounsel in misdemeanor cases, even if they risk imprisonment if found \nguilty. He told the Court during oral argument that it is reasonable \nfor the State to preserve its own resources, just as a more affluent \ndefendant would preserve its resources and not incur the cost of \ncounsel in this kind of circumstance. The Supreme Court held that the \nright to counsel when the accused faces possible imprisonment is more \nimportant than Mr. Pryor's financial concern.\n  Again and again, his far-reaching arguments like these have been \nrejected by the courts. Mr. Pryor is not a nominee within the legal \nmainstream.\n  He and his supporters pretend that he is only ``following the law,'' \nbut in fact Mr. Pryor repeatedly tried to make different law, using the \nAlabama Attorney General's office as a political platform for his own \nradical agenda.\n  We are expected to believe that despite the intensity with which he \nhas advocated for these radical legal positions and the many years he \nhas devoted to dismantling basic rights, he will start to ``follow the \nlaw'' if he receives a lifetime appointment to the Eleventh Circuit. \nRepeating that mantra again and again and again in the face of his \nextreme record does not make it credible that he will do so.\n  His many inflammatory statements show that he lacks the temperament \nto serve on the Federal court. He ridiculed the Supreme Court of the \nUnited States for granting a temporary stay of execution in a capital \npunishment case. Alabama was one of only two States in the Nation that \nuses the electric chair as its sole method of execution. The Supreme \nCourt granted review to determine whether the use of the electric chair \nwas cruel and unusual punishment.\n  For Mr. Pryor, however, the Court should not even have paused to \nconsider the Eighth Amendment. He said the issue: should not be decided \nby nine octogenarian lawyers who happen to sit on the Supreme Court. \nThis does not reflect the thoughtfulness we seek in our Federal judges.\n  He is dismissive of concerns about fairness in capital punishment and \nthe possible execution of persons who are innocent. He has stated: make \nno mistake about it, the death penalty moratorium movement is headed by \nan activist minority with little concern for what is really going on in \nour criminal justice system.\n  On the issue of women's rights, Mr. Pryor has criticized \nconstitutional protections against gender discrimination. He dismissed \nas ``political correctness'' the Supreme Court's decision that a State-\nrun military academy could not deny admission to women because of \nstereotypes about how women learn.\n  In a 1997 statement to Congress, Mr. Pryor opposed section 5 of the \nVoting Rights Act, which has been indispensable in ensuring that all \nAmericans have the right to vote, regardless of race or ethnic \nbackground. He called this important law an affront to federalism and \nan expensive burden that has far outlived its usefulness.\n  In March, we commemorated the 40th anniversary of Bloody Sunday, in \nwhich Martin Luther King, Congressman John Lewis, and others were \nbrutally attacked on a peaceful march in Mr. Pryor's home State of \nAlabama while supporting the right to vote for all Americans, \nregardless of race. Yet we are now being asked by the administration to \nconfirm a nominee who opposes the Voting Rights Act.\n  The Supreme Court has repeatedly upheld the constitutionality of \nsection 5, but Mr. Pryor's derisive statements--criticizing both the \nact and the Supreme Court itself--give no confidence that he will \nenforce the law's provisions. There is too much at stake to risk \nconfirming a judge who would turn back progress on protecting the right \nto vote.\n  It is no surprise that this nomination is opposed by leaders of the \ncivil rights movement, including the Reverend Fred Shuttlesworth, a \nleader of the Alabama movement for civil rights,\n\n[[Page S6269]]\n\nthe Reverend C.T. Vivian, and many of Dr. Martin Luther King's other \nclose advisors and associates.\n  It is clear that Mr. Pryor sees the Federal courts as a place to \nadvance his political agenda. When President Bush was elected in 2000, \nMr. Pryor gave a speech praising his election as the ``last best hope \nfor federalism.'' He ended his speech with these words--a ``prayer for \nthe next administration: Please God, no more Souters.'' He was \nreferring to Justice Souter, a Republican nominee to the court, whose \nopinions Mr. Pryor apparently disagreed with.\n  In another speech, he said he was thankful for the Bush v. Gore \ndecision. I wanted Governor Bush to have a full appreciation of the \njudiciary and judicial selection so we can have no more appointments \nlike Justice Souter.\n  Some have argued that Mr. Pryor's record in his year as a recess \nappointee on the Eleventh Circuit somehow erases his long career of \nopposition to fundamental rights. The fact that Mr. Pryor has voted \nwith other judges during the period when he was temporarily appointed \nto the court says nothing about what he would do if given a lifetime \nappointment and the freedom from Senate oversight. It is no wonder that \nhe might be cautious when he only has a temporary appointment to the \ncourt. We should not be swayed by ``confirmation conversions,'' and \nespecially not by ``recess appointment conversions.''\n  My colleagues on the other side have brought up every argument they \ncould find to save him. His record is full of examples of extreme \nviews, and they try to rebut each one. They call Senate Democrats and \ncitizens who question Mr. Pryor's fitness--including more than 204 \nlocal and national groups--a variety of names. They even accuse us of \nreligious bias.\n  They claim that those who oppose Mr. Pryor's nomination do so because \nof his faith. That's ridiculous given the record. Such a claim is \nunworthy of the Senate. Most of us would have had no idea what \nreligious views are held by Pryor, or any other nominee, if Republicans \nhad not raised the issue.\n  The real question is why, when there are so many qualified Republican \nattorneys in Alabama, the President would choose such a divisive \nnominee? Why pick one whose record raises so much doubt as to whether \nhe will be fair? Why pick one who can muster only a rating of partially \nunqualified from the American Bar Association?\n  At stake is the independence of our Federal courts. We count on \nFederal judges to be intelligent, to have the highest integrity, to be \nopen-minded. Most of all, we count on them to treat everyone fairly and \nnot to prejudge a case based on ideology. Mr, Pryor is free to pursue \nhis agenda as a lawyer or as an advocate, but he does not have the \nopen-mindedness and fairness needed to be a Federal judge, and I urge \nmy colleagues to defeat this nomination.\n  Mr. President, I have, I believe, just a few minutes left. How much \ntime do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 7 minutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I have pointed out at other times in \nrecent days that we have been tied up with these Federal judges--the \nhandful of Federal judges who will have enormous impact in terms of our \ncourt systems--we have been tied up with this issue for weeks and weeks \nwhen this President could have appointed, as I mentioned in the final \nmoments of my speech, outstanding, distinguished jurists who could have \ngone through here like 95 or 96 percent of the other nominees.\n  While we have been taking weeks and weeks, let me just mention a few \nof the things that have been happening that are affecting real American \nfamilies. Let's just take the last week, for example. Let's take the \nNew York Times last Sunday:\n\n       Tax Laws Help to Widen the Gap at the Very Top. The share \n     of the Nation's income earned by those in the uppermost \n     category has more than doubled since 1980.\n\n  There is a long article about what is happening in our country \nbetween the working families, middle-income families, and the super-\nwealthy, and the reasons for it. Are we debating or considering or \nthinking about doing anything about that? No, not the Senate.\n  Here is Monday, New York Times:\n\n       College Aid Rules Change and Families Pay More.\n\n  Are we doing anything about that this week? Are we having a debate on \nthat issue, about what we can do to make college tuition more available \nto families here in the United States? No, no. That is not on the \nagenda.\n  Then look at Tuesday:\n\n       Pension Law Loopholes Help United Hide Its Troubles.\n       Loopholes in the federal pension . . . allow United \n     Airlines to treatment its pension fund . . . solid for years \n     when in fact it was dangerously weakened.\n\n  And it basically collapsed.\n  Pensions, retirement for working families, a matter of principal \nconcern for millions of our workers--are we doing very much about that \non the floor of the Senate? No.\n  Wednesday:\n\n       G. M. Will Reduce Hourly Workers by 25,000. General Motors \n     said Tuesday it will cut 25,000 from its blue collar \n     workforce.\n\n  We don't have a silver bullet to answer that, but don't we think we \nshould be thinking about, if we lost 25,000 workers, what we ought to \ndo and what we might do in terms of helping working families and \nlooking at an industry? That was Wednesday.\n  Here we have Thursday, front-page story:\n\n       Limit for Award in Tobacco Case Set Off Protests.\n\nThe Justice Department's decision to seek $10 billion instead of what \nthe professional attorneys in the Justice Department said that they \nshould, $130 billion.\n\n  They were going to use that $130 billion to educate primarily \nteenagers, primarily teenage girls. Four thousand teenagers start \nsmoking every day, and 2,000 become addicted. Try to educate them with \n$130 billion? What happened to the Justice Department? They threw in \nthe towel. You would think we would talk about that.\n  That is in this last week. These issues affect middle-income working \nfamilies, and what do we spend our time on here in the Senate for the \nlast 6, 7, 8, 9 weeks? Debating these judges, when we know if we had a \nPresident who would offer nominees in the mainstream of judicial \nthinking, those individuals would be confirmed, like 96 percent of them \nwere. Then perhaps we would have a chance to do something that has been \ntalked about on every front page of every newspaper just this last week \nand that affects in a very real and important way the quality of life \nof children in this country, working families, and retirees.\n  Finally, I think I join with Senator Levin and Harry Reid, wondering \nwhy in the world next week we are not going to be considering the \nDefense Authorization bill instead of going to the Energy bill. We need \nan energy bill but, as has been pointed out by the supporters of the \nEnergy bill, passage of that bill will not reduce the gas price by 1 \ncent. The Defense Authorization bill will send a very clear message \nabout our commitment on death benefits, on uparmoring humvees, on \nlooking after families in terms of health insurance--all of these \nissues that are out there. We would send a very clear message that the \nSenate of the United States is behind that reauthorization. We may have \nour questions about Iraq policy, but everyone in this body supports our \ntroops. Why aren't we considering the Defense Authorization bill?\n  These are some of the concerns many of us have who think this Senate \nis not meeting its responsibilities to the American people or to our \nnational security and defense.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to support the \nnomination of Judge William H. Pryor, Jr., to be a judge for the \nEleventh Circuit. It has been divided.\n  Judge Pryor comes to this position with a very distinguished record. \nHe graduated from Northeast Louisiana University in 1984, magna cum \nlaude; from the Tulane University School of Law in 1987, again magna \ncum laude; was editor-chief of the Law Review of the Tulane University \nSchool of Law, which is no minor achievement. There\n\n[[Page S6270]]\n\nare not too many editors-in-chief around. That is quite an \naccomplishment. So the academic career is really extraordinary.\n  Following graduation from law school, he was law clerk to Judge John \nMinor Wisdom for the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, a very \ndistinguished jurist. A I speak on this subject, the Presiding Officer \nis Senator Lamar Alexander, who, as I recollect, was also a law clerk \nto Judge John Minor Wisdom and, on the recommendation of Senator \nAlexander, he spoke very highly of William Pryor, the people who knew \nhim in a very distinguished clerkship, one of America's great, \nhistorical jurists. Bill Pryor was his law clerk.\n  He then had a distinguished record in the practice of law, working \nfor the firm of Cabaniss, Johnston, Gardner, Dumas & O'Neal; was an \nadjunct professor at the Samford University, Cumberland School of Law; \nand came back into the practice of law for 4 more years with Walston, \nStabler, Wells, Anderson & Bains. Then, from 1995 to 2004, he was \nDeputy Attorney General and also Attorney General of the State of \nAlabama and has been on the U.S. Circuit Court for the Eleventh Circuit \nnow for a year, having obtained an interim appointment from President \nBush.\n\n  Judge Pryor has been criticized for his views, expressed very \nforcefully, in opposition to the decision of the Supreme Court of the \nUnited States in Roe v. Wade. The quotation attributed to him was that \nit was the ``worst abomination of constitutional law in our history,'' \nwhich is pretty strong language. That is about as strong as you can \nget.\n  The issue is not what is his personal view of Roe v. Wade. The issue \nis what would he do as a circuit court of appeals judge when faced with \nthe responsibility to uphold the law of the land, of the Supreme Court.\n  This subject came up during the confirmation hearing of Judge Pryor \nbefore the Judiciary Committee on June 11, 2003. I propounded the \nfollowing question to Judge Pryor:\n\n       The Chairman [Senator Hatch at the time] has asked about \n     whether you have made some comments which you consider \n     intemperate, and I regret I could not be here earlier today, \n     but as you know, we have many conflicting schedules. But I \n     note the comment you made after Planned Parenthood v. Casey, \n     where you were quoted as saying--first I would ask you if \n     this is accurate. I have seen a quote or two not accurate. \n     ``In the 1992 case of Planned Parenthood v. Casey the Court \n     preserved the worst abomination of constitutional law in our \n     history,'' . . . is that an accurate quotation of yours?\n       Mr. Pryor. Yes.\n\n  It is pretty hard to get a simple answer of a witness anywhere and I \nappreciated that kind of brevity.\n  I continued:\n\n       Senator Specter. Is that one which would fall into the \n     category that Senator Hatch has commented on, you wish you \n     had not made?\n       Mr. Pryor: No, I stand by the comment.\n\n  Then I asked:\n\n       Why do you consider it an abomination, Attorney General \n     Pryor?\n\n  And he responded:\n\n       Well, I believe that not only is the case unsupported by \n     the text and structure of the Constitution. But it has led to \n     a morally wrong result.\n\n  And he goes on to give his reasons for his conclusion.\n  He was very candid, very steadfast, and stood up to what he had said \nand was not running from it.\n  Later, he made it plain he would abide by the law of the land, that \nhis personal views of Roe v. Wade were not determinative. The record \nshows my own view has been to uphold the Supreme Court decision in Roe \nv. Wade, a subject I will not discuss as to my own views, but I respect \na difference of opinion.\n  In looking for the confirmation of a Federal judge, the issue is, \nwill he follow the law of the land. He said he would and said so very \nemphatically on the record.\n  On March 3 of this year, I wrote to Senator Reid because this \nquestion had come up. I cited the applicable page of the Record June \n11, page 45 of the transcript where the following exchange occurred:\n\n       Chairman Hatch. So even when you disagree with Roe v. Wade \n     you would act in accordance with Roe v. Wade on the Eleventh \n     Circuit Court of Appeals?\n       Mr. Pryor. Even though I strongly disagree with Roe v. Wade \n     I have acted in accordance with it as Attorney General and \n     would continue to do so as a Court of Appeals judge.\n       Chairman Hatch. Can we rely on that?\n       Mr. Pryor. You can take it to the bank, Mr. Chairman.\n\n  Again, that is about as emphatic as you can be on that subject.\n  During the course of Judge Pryor's tenure on the Court of Appeals, he \nhas handed down quite a number of opinions which show maturity, which \nshow growth, and which undercut many of the objections of his critics.\n  I ask unanimous consent the relevant portions of the transcript I \nhave just referred to from the Judiciary Committee hearing and the \nletter which I sent to Senator Reid dated March 3, 2005, be printed in \nthe Record at the conclusion of my statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. SPECTER. Shortly after becoming chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee, within a week, by memorandum dated January 12 of this year, \nI sent to all members of the Judiciary Committee a memorandum including \nsummaries of some of Judge Pryor's statements which I thought merited \nanalysis and reconsideration by those who had opposed him in the past. \nThose opinions included the decision in DIRECTV v. Treworgy, where \nJudge Pryor ruled against a major satellite transmission corporation, \ninstead siding with a private citizen to shield him from liability. \nAlso, a case on Judge Pryor's decision protecting religious liberty, \nBenning v. Georgia, also decided in the year 2004. A case illustrating \nJudge Pryor's protection of civil rights in the case of Wilson v. B/E \nAerospace, Incorporated. A case which involved a district court's \ndismissal of a female employee's gender discrimination claims. Judge \nPryor reinstated her claim of bias as to promotion and remanded back to \nthe district court.\n  By way of amplification of the case I referred to on Benning v. \nGeorgia, that involved a situation when the Georgia prison system \nrefused an inmate's request to practice his Jewish faith. Judge Pryor \nenabled the prisoner to continue to worship in his preferred manner.\n  The case involving Sarmiento-Cisneros, where Judge Pryor ruled \nprotecting immigrants' rights, involved a Mexican immigrant who desired \nto remain in the United States with his family. Judge Pryor vacated the \ndeportation order, enabling the family to remain together, and brought \na commonsense interpretation to a harsh ruling by the Bureau of \nImmigration and Customs Enforcement.\n\n  The case of Brown v. Johnson is an illustration of Judge Pryor's \njudgment and decision in protecting prisoners' rights. Judge Pryor \nrecognized the need for improvement in the treatment of an inmate \nafflicted with HIV and concluded that prison officials were not \nsufficiently concerned about the serious medical needs under the Eighth \nand 14th Amendments.\n  Judge Pryor also stood by the petitioner, permitting him to proceed \nin forma pauperis.\n  Judge Pryor has faced, in his capacity as Attorney General of \nAlabama, quite a number of situations where he took positions which \nwere very unpopular politically and contrary to his own views, but did \nso because of his determination and his recognition that he was \nsupposed to uphold the law of the land.\n  In a very highly celebrated case nationally and internationally, as \nAttorney General for Alabama he proceeded against Alabama Chief Justice \nRoy Moore for refusing to remove the large depiction of the Ten \nCommandments on display in the Alabama Supreme Court after the Federal \ncourts ruled the display was unconstitutional. In that case, Judge \nPryor commented that his personal beliefs were contrary to what he was \nruling. He took a lot of criticism from his Alabama constituency and \nwhen asked about his decision to enforce the law against Alabama Chief \nJustice Moore, Judge Pryor stated:\n\n       This was not a tough call. I believe that our freedom \n     depends on the rule of law. The reason the American \n     experiment has been successful is because we are a nation of \n     laws and not of men. No person is above the law. We have to \n     abide by the law even when we disagree with it. That is the \n     guiding principle of my public service.\n\n  Hard to structure a response better than that. Cannot do any better \nthan\n\n[[Page S6271]]\n\nthat, when you say you disagree with something and you disagree \nstrongly, but you recognize your obligation to enforce the law.\n  On other occasions, then-Attorney General Pryor set aside personal \nbeliefs and instructed State law enforcement officials to enforce the \nSupreme Court rulings. Shortly after the U.S. Supreme Court issued its \nruling in Lawrence v. Texas, he released a press statement through the \nWeb site of the Office of Attorney General saying that in light of the \nSupreme Court ruling in Lawrence:\n\n     the law of Alabama . . . which prohibits consensual sodomy \n     between unmarried persons, is now unenforceable.\n\n  Similarly, after the Supreme Court ruled in Stenberg v. Carhart, \nwhich struck down a Nebraska law prohibiting partial-birth abortion, \nthen-Attorney General Pryor issued a statement to State officials \nsaying State officials ``are obligated to obey the Stenberg ruling \nuntil it is overruled or otherwise set aside.''\n  Judge Pryor's record shows commitment to improving race relations and \nprotecting racial equality. As attorney general, Judge Pryor worked \nwith President Clinton's U.S. attorney Doug Jones to prosecute former \nklansmen who bombed Birmingham's 16th Street Baptist Church in the \n1960s which resulted in the death of four young girls. He helped to \nstart a drive to rid the Alabama Constitution of its racist prohibition \non interracial marriage and then stepped up to head the effort to end \nthe ban, ultimately to its victory in November of 2000.\n  He dedicated much of his career to protecting the interests and the \nsafety of women. As Attorney General, he supported and lobbied for \nlegislation that created a State crime of domestic violence.\n  I ask unanimous consent the summaries of the cases which I referred \nto previously be printed in the Record, with a pertinent letter, at the \nconclusion of my remarks.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (See exhibit 2.)\n  Mr. SPECTER. In conclusion, it is a very healthy situation in that we \nare now proceeding to take up these nominees individually. That is \nsomething which I had sought to do since taking over the chairmanship \nof the Judiciary Committee. We have moved ahead now with three \ncontroversial nominees. It is my hope we will continue to take up these \nnominees, one at a time, and evaluate them on their merits.\n  As I have said in a number of floor statements, we have reached the \ncurrent confrontation because of a practice which goes back almost 20 \nyears, starting with the last 2 years of the Reagan administration and \ncontinuing with 4 years of President Bush, and when the Democrats took \ncontrol of the Senate and the Judiciary Committee, they stopped the \nprocessing of judges and slowed it down.\n  Then when we Republicans won the election in 1994, for the last 6 \nyears of the Clinton administration we slowed down the process and tied \nup some 70 judges in committee, a practice that I objected to at the \ntime, and supported Judge Paez and Judge Berzon and others. Then the \ncontroversy was ratcheted up with the unprecedented systematic \nfilibustering of judges, and then the unprecedented move by President \nBush in the interim appointment, after the Senate rejected a judge, \nalbeit by the route of not getting cloture.\n  My time has expired, and I note the presence of the distinguished \nDemocratic leader, so I yield the floor in midsentence, Mr. President.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n       Senator Specter. The Chairman has asked about whether you \n     have made some comments which you now consider intemperate, \n     and I regret, that I could not be here earlier today, but as \n     you know, we have many conflicting schedules. But I note the \n     comment you made after Planned Parenthood v. Casey, where you \n     were quoted as saying--first I would ask you if this quote is \n     accurate. I have seen a quote or two not accurate. ``In the \n     1992 case of Planned Parenthood v. Casey the Court preserved \n     the worst abomination of constitutional law in our history,'' \n     close quote. Is that an accurate quotation of yours?\n       Mr. Pryor. Yes.\n       Senator Specter. Is that one which would fall into the \n     category that Senator Hatch has commented on, you wish you \n     had not made?\n       Mr. Pryor. No, I stand by that comment.\n       Senator Specter. Why do you consider it an abomination, \n     Attorney General Pryor?\n       Mr. Pryor. Well, I believe that not only is the case \n     unsupported by the text and structure of the Constitution, \n     but it had led to a morally wrong result. It has led to the \n     slaughter of millions of innocent unborn children. That's my \n     personal belief.\n       Senator Specter. With that personal belief, Attorney \n     General Pryor, what assurances can you give to the many who \n     are raising a question as to whether when you characterized \n     it an abomination and slaughter, that you can follow a \n     decision of the United States Supreme Court, which you \n     consider an abomination and having led to slaughter?\n       Mr. Pryor. I would invite anyone to look at my record as \n     Attorney General, where I've done just that. We had a partial \n     birth abortion law in our State that was challenged by \n     abortion clinics in Alabama in 1997. It could have been \n     interpreted broadly or it could have been interpreted \n     narrowly. I ordered the district attorneys of Alabama to give \n     it its narrowest construction because that was based on my \n     reading of Roe and Casey. I ordered the district attorneys to \n     apply that law only to post-viable fetuses. I could have read \n     it easily more broadly. The governor who appointed me was \n     governor at the time and a party to the lawsuit, disagreed \n     with me and openly criticized me. A pro-life activist in \n     Alabama criticized me. But I did it because I thought that \n     was the right legal decision. I still had an obligation to \n     defend Alabama law. This was a recently-passed Alabama law. \n     When the Supreme Court of the United States later of course \n     struck down this kind of partial birth abortion law, we \n     conceded immediately in district court that the decision \n     was binding, but until then I was making the narrowest \n     argument I could make, trying to be faithful to the \n     Supreme Court's precedent, while also being faithful to my \n     role as Attorney General and my oath of office to defend a \n     law recently passed by the legislature.\n       Senator Specter. When you talk about post-viability and you \n     have the categorization of partial birth or late-term \n     abortion, is not that statute necessarily directed toward \n     post-viability?\n       Mr. Pryor. That was one of the main arguments I made in \n     construing it, but if you look at the actual language--\n       Senator Specter. Well, I asked you that question as to \n     whether there was a basis for construing it to the contrary. \n     When you talk about partial birth abortion, we are talking \n     about an event in the birth canal which is definitely post-\n     viability. When you talk about late-term abortion, we are \n     also talking about post-viability. So aside from having some \n     people who will raise a question about anything, whether \n     there is a question to be raised or not, was it not \n     reasonably plain on the face of the statute that they were \n     talking about post-viability?\n       Mr. Pryor. No, I don't think anyone would contend life. I \n     believe that abortion is morally wrong. I've never wavered \n     from that, and in representing the people of Alabama, I have \n     been a candid, engaged Attorney General, who has been \n     involved in the type of--\n       Chairman Hatch. What does that mean with regard to the \n     Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals? If you get on that court, \n     how are you going to treat Roe v. Wade?\n       Mr. Pryor. Well, my record as Attorney General shows that I \n     am able to put aside my personal beliefs and follow the law, \n     even when I strongly disagree with it, to look carefully at \n     precedents and to do my duty. That is the same duty that I \n     would have as a judge. Now, as an advocate for the State of \n     Alabama of course I have an obligation to make a reasonable \n     argument in defense of the law, but as a judge I would have \n     to do my best to determine from the precedents what the law \n     actually at the end of the day requires. My record \n     demonstrates that I can do that.\n       Chairman Hatch. So even though you disagree with Roe v. \n     Wade you would act in, accordance with Roe v. Wade on the \n     Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals?\n       Mr. Pryor. Even though I strongly disagree with Roe v. Wade \n     I have acted in accordance with this as Attorney General and \n     would continue to do so as a Court of Appeals Judge.\n       Chairman Hatch. Can we rely on that?\n       Mr. Pryor. You can take it to the bank, Mr. Chairman.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                                   Committee on the Judiciary,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, March 3, 2005.\n     Hon. Harry Reid,\n     Minority Leader, U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Reid: When we talked earlier this week, we \n     discussed the question of whether or not Judge Pryor had \n     testified that he would follow Roe v. Wade. I have had the \n     transcript reviewed from Judge Pryor's hearing on June 11, \n     2003. I think that you will find the following exchange \n     between Senator Hatch and Judge Pryor, which can be found on \n     page 45 of the transcript, dispositive:\n       Chairman Hatch: So even though you disagree with Roe v. \n     Wade you would act in accordance with Roe v. Wade on the \n     Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals?\n       Mr. Pryor: Even though I strongly disagree with Roe v. Wade \n     I have acted in accordance with it as Attorney General and \n     would continue to do so as a Court of Appeals Judge.\n       Chairman Hatch: Can we rely on that?\n       Mr. Pryor: You can take it to the bank, Mr. Chairman.\n\n[[Page S6272]]\n\n       I am enclosing a copy of the transcript.\n           Sincerely,\n     Arlen Specter.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                               Exhibit 2\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                                   Committee on the Judiciary,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, January 12, 2005.\n       To Members of the Senate Judiciary Committee: As you know, \n     Judge William Pryor has been sitting on the United States \n     Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit for the past eleven \n     months. The President has stated his intention to re-submit \n     Judge Pryor's name for confirmation to the Eleventh Circuit. \n     In light of his expected renomination, I have asked my staff \n     to examine Judge Pryor's Eleventh Circuit opinions.\n       I thought you might be interested in knowing some more \n     about these opinions. In particular, I'd like to bring to \n     your attention several opinions that demonstrate Judge \n     Pryor's willingness to protect the rights of individuals \n     often overlooked in the legal system. It is my hope that \n     these opinions and his record on the Eleventh Circuit for the \n     past eleven months will be considered by the Committee on \n     evaluating him on his re-nomination.\n           Sincerely,\n     Arlen Specter.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                               Memorandum\n\n       During his tenure on the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals, \n     Judge William Pryor has authored several opinions \n     demonstrative of his willingness to protect the rights of \n     those often overlooked in the legal system.\n       Standing up to Corporations: DIRECTV, Inc. v. Treworgy, 373 \n     F.3d 1124 (11th Cir. 2004)\n       Judge Pryor ruled against a major satellite-transmission \n     corporation, siding instead with a private citizen to shield \n     him from liability.\n       Background: DIRECTV (DTV), a provider of satellite \n     television, encrypts transmissions of pay-per-view and \n     premium programming. The security encryption can be illegally \n     circumvented by using ``pirate access devices,'' which allow \n     users to intercept and decrypt DTV's transmissions. Mike \n     Treworgy bought two pirating cards, which enable someone with \n     a satellite dish to receive signals without paying for the \n     service. There was no evidence that Treworgy actually \n     intercepted a signal wth his cards. DTV sued Treworgy for \n     possessing these devices under the Electronic Communications \n     Privacy Act of 1986 (Wiretap Act), which criminalizes the \n     intentional manufacture, distribution, possession and \n     advertising of piracy devices. Treworgy argued that the \n     Wiretap Act did not create a private right of action against \n     persons merely in possession of access devises.\n       Holding: The Eleventh Circuit, Judge Pryor writing, held \n     that DTV did not have a private right of action against \n     Treworgy for mere possession of intercepting technology, and \n     required that the device must have been used to pirate \n     programming before private rights of action arise. ``Congress \n     chose to confine private civil actions to defendants who had \n     `intercepted, disclosed, or intentionally used' [a \n     communication] . . . possession of a pirate access device \n     alone, although a criminal offense, creates nothing more than \n     conjectural or hypothetical harm.''\n       Protecting Religious Liberty: Benning v. Georgia, 2004 WL \n     2749172 (11th Cir. 2004)\n       When the Georgia prison system refused an inmate's requests \n     to practice his Jewish faith, Judge Pryor enabled the \n     prisoner to continue to worship in his preferred manner.\n       By finding that RLUIPA is a proper exercise of Congress' \n     Spending authority, the Eleventh Circuit kept viable similar \n     legal remedies for the elderly, disabled and other victims of \n     discrimination.\n       Background: Ralph Benning, an inmate in the Georgia prison \n     system, asserted that as a ``Torah observant Jew'' he was \n     being prevented from fulfilling his religious duties, such as \n     eating only kosher food, and wearing a yarmulke. Georgia \n     moved to dismiss and argued that Sec. 3 of The Religious Land \n     Use and Institutionalized Persons Act (RLUIPA) exceeds the \n     authority of Congress under the Spending and Commerce \n     Clauses, and violates the Tenth Amendment and the \n     Establishment Clause. RLUIPA imposes strict scrutiny on \n     federally funded programs or activities that burden the \n     religious rights of institutionalized persons.\n       Holding: The Eleventh Circuit, Judge Pryor writing, rule \n     that Congress did not exceed its authority under the Spending \n     Clause in enacting Sec. 3 of RLUIPA. The court held that \n     Congress' spending conditions need meet only a ``minimal \n     standard of rationality.'' The court found that protecting \n     religious exercise of prisoners is a rational goal, and the \n     United States ``has a substantial interest in ensuring that \n     state prisons that receive federal funds protect the federal \n     civil rights of prisoners.'' The Eleventh Circuit also \n     concluded that the statute did not violate the Tenth \n     Amendment by infringing on areas reserved to the states, nor \n     did it violate the Establishment Clause. Judge Pryor further \n     recognized that, ``given the necessarily strict rules that \n     govern every aspect of prison life, the failure of prison \n     officials to accommodate religion, even in the absence of \n     RLUIPA, would not be neutral; it would be hostile to \n     religion.''\n       Protecting Civil Rights: Wilson v. B/E Aerospace, Inc., 376 \n     F.3D 1079 (11th Cir. 2004)\n       When the district court dismissed a female employee's \n     gender discrimination claims, Judge Pryor reinstated her \n     claim of bias as to a promotion, and remanded back to the \n     district court.\n       Background: Loretta Wilson filed an employment \n     discrimination action against B/E Aerospace, Inc. (B/E) \n     alleging sex discrimination in violation of Title VII of the \n     Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended in 42 U.S.C. sections \n     2000e et seq., and the Florida Civil Rights Act, Fla. Stat. \n     sections 760.01 et seq. She claimed that B/E discriminated \n     against her on the basis of sex by not promoting her to the \n     position of Site Vice President and by later terminating her.\n       Procedural Summary: B/E filed a motion for summary judgment \n     at the conclusion of discovery. The district court granted \n     the motion in its entirety finding that Wilson failed to both \n     provide direct evidence of discrimination and establish a \n     prima facie case of discrimination.\n       Holding: Judge Pryor, writing for the Eleventh Circuit, \n     allowed Wilson's case to proceed against the corporation. \n     Focusing on the two distinct types of conduct alleged--\n     discrimination in promotion and discharge--the court \n     concluded that an admission by a supervisor at B/E that \n     Wilson was ``the obvious choice'' and the ``most qualified'' \n     for the then-pending promotion created a genuine issue of \n     fact, prompting Judge Pryor to remand as to the failure-to-\n     promote claim. As to the discharge claim, the court concluded \n     that Wilson had offered no evidence that her termination was \n     based on sex.\n       Protecting Immigrant Rights: Sarmiento-Cisneros v. U.S. \n     Attorney General, 381 F.3d 1277 (11th Cir. 2004).\n       Judge Pryor stood up for a Mexican immigrant who desired to \n     remain in the United States with his family.\n       By vacating the deportation order, Judge Pryor enabled a \n     family to remain together and brought a commonsensical \n     interpretation to the harsh Bureau of Immigration and Customs \n     Enforcement order.\n       Background: Jose Sarmiento-Cisneros was an alien from \n     Mexico who was deported and then reentered the United States \n     illegally, married an American citizen, and then applied for \n     an adjustment of status before the effective date of 8 U.S.C. \n     1231(a)(5). The Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement \n     (BICE) sought to reinstate a removal order under 8 U.S.C. \n     1231(a)(5) and argued that the statute's provisions barring \n     an alien from filing an application for discretionary relief \n     apply retroactively.\n       Holding: After examining the statute, Judge Pryor, writing \n     for the Eleventh Circuit, joined five other circuits in \n     concluding that 8 U.S.C. 1231(a)(5) does not apply \n     retroactively. The court therefore granted the petition for \n     review and vacated the BICE deportation order. Sarmiento \n     Cisneros was thus able to enjoy discretionary relief \n     available to him prior to the BICE's rescission of the \n     previously granted relief.\n       Protecting Prisoners' Rights: Brown v. Johnson, 387 F.3d \n     1344 (11th Cir. 2004).\n       Judge Pryor recognized the need for improved treatment for \n     an inmate afflicted with HIV, concluding that prison \n     officials were indifferent to his serious medical needs under \n     the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments.\n       Judge Pryor not only stood up for the prisoner, but enabled \n     him to proceed in forma pauperis.\n       Background: John Brown, a prisoner in the Georgia State \n     Prison, had been prescribed medication for HIV and hepatitis. \n     Two months after this prescription had been granted, a \n     different doctor ceased treatment. Eight months later, Brown \n     filed a Sec. 1983 claim against the second doctor and the \n     Medical Administrator for the Georgia State Prison alleging \n     deliberate indifference to his serious medical needs in \n     violation of the due process clause of the Fourteenth \n     Amendment and the Eighth Amendment. Additionally, Brown filed \n     a petition to proceed in forma pauperis.\n       Procedural Summary: The Prison Litigation Reform Act (PLRA) \n     establishes the procedures for courts to use to assess \n     prisoner complaints brought in forma pauperis. The provision \n     of the PLRA in question, 28 U.S.C. section 1915(g) (often \n     referred to as the ``three strikes rule''), bars a prisoner \n     from proceeding in forma pauperis after he has filed three \n     meritless lawsuits, unless the prisoner is in imminent danger \n     of serious medical injury. A magistrate judge recommended \n     that Brown's petition to proceed in forma pauperis be denied \n     and that his complaint be dismissed without prejudice because \n     Brown had filed at least three meritless lawsuits previously, \n     and had not met the imminent physical injury exception. Brown \n     then filed timely objections to the recommendation and he \n     filed a motion to amend his complaint. The district court \n     denied Brown's motion to amend his complaint because the \n     complaint was subject to ``three strikes'' dismissal. \n     Subsequently, the district court adopted the recommendation \n     of the magistrate judge and dismissed Brown's complaint \n     without prejudice. Brown then appealed, and the district \n     court granted him permission to proceed in forma pauperis.\n       Holding: Judge Pryor, writing for the Eleventh Circuit, \n     determined that the district court's dismissal of Brown's \n     motion to amend his complaint under the PLRA, and its \n     conclusion barring Brown from proceeding in forma pauperis, \n     were in error. Further, Judge Pryor found that the district \n     court abused its discretion in denying him the right to amend \n     his complaint pursuant to FRCP 15. The amended complaint, \n     sufficiently alleging imminent danger of serious physical \n     injury under 28 U.S.C. 1915(g), permitted Brown to proceed in \n     forma pauperis.\n\n[[Page S6273]]\n\n     Finally, Judge Pryor found that Brown had stated a valid \n     claim of deliberate indifference to serious medical needs \n     under the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments. Therefore the \n     district court's judgment was reversed and remanded for \n     further proceedings, effectively allowing Brown's suit to go \n     forward, and enabling him to get necessary medical treatment.\n\n  (At the request of Mr. Leahy, the following statement was ordered to \nbe printed in the Record.)\n Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I would like to express my \nopposition to the nomination of William H. Pryor, Jr., to the Eleventh \nCircuit Court of Appeals.\n  Mr. Pryor has a distinguished legal career. He graduated magna cum \nlaude from Tulane University Law School, clerked for a judge on the \nFifth Circuit Court of Appeals, was a law professor at Samford \nUniversity, and served as attorney general for the State of Alabama. \nWhile he deserves recognition for his legal background, that alone is \nnot enough in my estimation to be confirmed for a lifetime appointment \nto the Federal bench. In my review of Mr. Pryor's statements, actions, \nand writings, I am concerned that Mr. Pryor's personal opinion, rather \nthan the law, will compel his decisions in some cases.\n  My areas of concern arise in areas of the law that I have spent my \ncareer working to address, including the environment, reproductive \nrights, and gay rights.\n  On the environment, for example, Mr. Pryor urged the U.S. Supreme \nCourt to declare unconstitutional Federal efforts to protect wildlife \non private lands under the Endangered Species Act. In regard to this \ncase, the lower court stated that Mr. Pryor's constitutional arguments \nwould ``place in peril the entire federal regulatory scheme for \nwildlife and natural resource conservation.'' The case is Gibbs v. \nBabbitt.\n  In another important case, Solid Waste Authority of Northern Cook \nCounty v. United States, Mr. Pryor urged the Supreme Court to strike \ndown Federal efforts to protect waters and wetlands that provide \nhabitat for migratory birds. Finally, Mr. Pryor has advocated in \ntestimony before the Senate that States should not be held accountable \nin court for failing to enforce minimum Federal standards from the \njoint hearing before the U.S. Senate Committee on Environment and \nPublic Works and the U.S. Senate Committee on the Judiciary, July 16, \n2002.\n  On reproductive rights Mr. Pryor in 1997 called the Roe v. Wade \ndecision, ``the day seven members of our highest court ripped the \nConstitution and ripped out the life of millions of unborn children.'' \nIn a speech during that same year, Mr. Pryor criticized the 1992 \nSupreme Court decision in Planned Parenthood v. Casey by stating that \nthis decision ``preserved the worst abomination of constitutional law \nin our history: Roe v. Wade.''\n  Finally, during Mr. Pryor's career he has actively worked to oppose \ngay rights. In fact, he has gone so far as to seek out cases to file \nbriefs, or spoken out on the merits of such cases, that have no \nconnection to the job he was currently performing. For example, even \nthough Alabama had no similar statute, Mr. Pryor filed an amicus brief \nin the Romer v. Evans case supporting Colorado's law prohibiting local \ngovernments from enacting laws protecting gays and lesbians from \ndiscrimination. In addition, despite the fact that the Lawrence v. \nTexas case did not involve Alabama law, Mr. Pryor's interest was so \nkeen that he petitioned the Supreme Court for leave to participate in \nthe oral argument and filed a brief on the merits of the case.\n  Some have argued that Mr. Pryor should not be held to all these \nbriefs and statements because he was just doing his job and protecting \nthe rights and positions of his client or employer. However, the \nproblem with this argument is that many of the positions he has taken \nhave not related to the requirements of the job he was performing, but \nwere positions he singularly advocated because he believed in them and \nsought out cases to express and uphold his beliefs. It is this fact \nthat concerns me and leads me to believe that Mr. Pryor will use his \npersonal beliefs rather than settled law to decide cases.\n  His actions as a recess appointment to the Eleventh Circuit Court of \nAppeals have not diminished my concern, especially when Mr. Pryor was \nthe deciding vote that prohibited the full Eleventh Circuit to consider \nthe unique Florida law banning gay adoption. Given these facts and Mr. \nPryor's history, I opposed limiting debate on his nomination in 2003, \nand continue to do so today.\n  Unfortunately, I will be necessarily absent for the votes that will \noccur related to this nominee. However, I feel it is necessary to \nexpress my position on this important nomination.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, the nomination of William H. Pryor, Jr., \nto the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals is nothing more than a \npolitical promotion cloaked in the thin veil of a judicial nomination. \nJudge Pryor has been an active and dutiful soldier in the \nadministration's systematic assault on the Constitution and individual \nrights, effectively making his nomination for a lifetime appointment to \nthe Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals political payback for a job \nperceived well done. Given Judge Pryor's disdain for the Constitution \nand individual rights, I encourage my colleagues to join me in opposing \nJudge Pryor's nomination.\n  If confirmed for a lifetime appointment to the Eleventh Circuit Court \nof Appeals, Judge Pryor would pose an enormous threat to the rights, \nprotections, and freedoms of all Americans. Judge Pryor's professional \nrecord demonstrates a willingness to contort the law in order to make \nit fit his political agenda. During his 7-year tenure as attorney \ngeneral of Alabama, Judge Pryor advanced his own personal, conservative \nagenda not only through litigation in which Alabama was a party, but \nalso by filing amicus curiae briefs in cases in which Alabama was \nneither an interested party nor under any obligation to participate. As \nattorney general of Alabama, Judge Pryor amassed a stunning record \nreplete with hostility for the rights of Americans and contempt for \nconstitutionally mandated protections. In addition to attacking the \nvalidity of constitutional freedoms, Judge Pryor advocated for the \ndissolution of congressionally required protections intended to \npreserve individual rights, to safeguard our environment and to \nmaintain the barriers that separate church and state.\n  Judge Pryor has advocated a view that the Constitution does not \nharbor some of our most critical individual rights and freedoms. He has \ntaken the position that these freedoms should be decided by the States, \nbased on majority vote, regardless of whether constitutional rights are \nviolated. The danger of this simple thinking is of course to \nregionalize the Constitution, making one's constitutional rights \ndependent on where one resides. But much more egregious is what this \nproposal would do to our Bill of Rights; it effectively makes our \ninalienable rights as Americans open to public and political debate. \nThis surely could not have been what the Framers envisioned when they \ndrafted our Constitution.\n  Judge Pryor's general contempt for the Constitution is clear in the \npositions he advocated as attorney general of Alabama. In one amicus \nbrief to the Supreme Court, Judge Pryor defended a State practice of \nhandcuffing prisoners to a hitching post and exposing them to the hot \nsun for 7 hours at a time without water or bathroom breaks. This cruel \nand unusual brand of punishment advocated by Judge Pryor was later \nrejected by the U.S. Supreme Court, which held that ``the use of the \nhitching post under these circumstances violated `the basic concept \nunderlying the Eighth Amendment, [which] is nothing less than the \ndignity of man.' ''\n  Showing disdain for constitutionally protected reproductive freedom, \nJudge Pryor has called Roe v. Wade ``the worst abomination of \nconstitutional law in our history.'' In this spirit, he has endorsed \nthe formation of unconstitutional barriers that would thwart the \npractice of reproductive freedom, going as far as defending Alabama's \nso-called ``partial-birth abortion'' ban despite the fact that it \nlacked the constitutionally required exception to protect the health of \nthe pregnant woman.\n\n  But Judge Pryor's attacks against privacy interests are not only \nrelegated to reproductive rights. Judge Pryor believes that it is \nconstitutional to imprison gay men and lesbians for having sex in the \nprivacy of their own homes. In an amicus brief asking the Supreme Court \nto uphold Texas' ``Homosexual Conduct'' law, Judge Pryor\n\n[[Page S6274]]\n\nadvocated criminalizing homosexual intercourse between consenting \nadults, ignoring the equal protection clause of the 14th amendment. In \nhis brief on behalf of the people of Alabama, Judge Pryor equated sex \nbetween two consenting adults of the same gender with ``activities like \nprostitution, adultery, necrophilia, bestiality, possession of child \npornography, and even incest and pedophilia . . .'' This is from a \nbrief in Support of Respondent at 25, Lawrence v. Texas, 539 U.S. 558, \n2003.\n  Judge Pryor's disrespect for the rule of law however, is not limited \nto his disregard for the Constitution. Judge Pryor has long been a foot \nsoldier in the conservative movement's attack on the authority of \nCongress to enact laws protecting individual and other rights. He and \nlike-minded conservative ideologues have hidden behind the labels \n``States rights'' and ``federalism,'' when what they are truly \nadvocating is the restriction of Congress to protect Americans' rights \nagainst discrimination and injury based on disability, race, and age.\n  Again as attorney general of Alabama, Judge Pryor abused his \ndiscretion, making Alabama the only State to file an amicus brief in \nsupport of striking down part of the Violence Against Women Act. As \nAlabama's attorney general, Judge Pryor filed briefs calling for the \nelimination of protections contained in the Family and Medical Leave \nAct, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, the Clean Water Act, and \nthe Endangered Species Act. On two separate occasions, he testified in \nCongress against EPA enforcement of the Clean Air Act and against key \nprovisions of the Voting Rights Act.\n  In one Supreme Court case in which his office again filed an amicus \nbrief, Judge Pryor urged the Supreme Court to hold that State employees \ncannot sue for damages to protect their rights against discrimination \nunder the Americans with Disabilities Act. In a narrow 5-to-4 decision, \nthe Court agreed with Judge Pryor's ``States' rights'' argument. After \nthe decision, Judge Pryor expressed tremendous satisfaction for his \npart in dismantling a portion of one of this generation's seminal \npieces of civil rights legislation. Judge Pryor said he was ``proud'' \nof his role in ``protecting the hard-earned dollars of Alabama \ntaxpayers when Congress imposes illegal mandates on our state.''\n  Americans deserve better than this. They deserve even-tempered \njurists who will not use the bench as a pulpit for the advancement of \ntheir own political agenda. Given Judge Pryor's disregard for \nindividual rights, the Constitution and congressionally mandated \nprotections, I cannot in good faith extend my constitutionally required \nconsent to his nomination, and I encourage my Senate colleagues to \nagain withhold their support as well.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I would like to discuss the nomination of William Pryor to the \nEleventh Circuit Court of Appeals. I have closely reviewed Judge \nPryor's record, and based upon it, I believe that Judge Pryor would \nhave difficulty putting aside his extreme views in interpreting the \nlaw. Consequently, I do not believe that Judge Pryor should be \nconfirmed to a lifetime appointment on the Eleventh Circuit Court of \nAppeals.\n  Before President Bush's recess appointment of William Pryor to the \nEleventh Circuit in February 2004, Pryor had not been a judge. As a \nresult, he lacks a record as a sitting judge through which his judicial \ntemperament and impartiality may be examined. Consequently, one must \nlook to Judge Pryor's actions and statements throughout his career.\n  In his career, Judge Pryor has primarily been a politician, and \nconsidering the vehemence with which he has advocated his political \nviews, I have serious concerns that he can set aside those views and \napply the law in an independent, non-partisan fashion.\n  First, I want to be very clear about one thing. My objection to \nconfirming Judge Pryor to a lifetime seat on the Eleventh Circuit Court \nof Appeals has nothing to do with Judge Pryor's personal religious \nbeliefs.\n  There are those who have been spreading the false statement that some \nDemocrats vote against judicial nominees because of a nominee's \nreligious beliefs. And that has been said about me. The majority leader \neven had on his Web site a newspaper column that says I voted against \nJudge Pryor because of his religious beliefs.\n  So I went back and I took a look at my statement on the floor, and I \ntook a look at my statement in the Judiciary Committee markup, and they \nare both clear that my concerns with Judge Pryor have nothing to do \nwith his religious beliefs. As I stated before this body in July of \n2003:\n\n       Many of us have concerns about nominees sent to the Senate \n     who feel so very strongly and sometimes stridently and often \n     intemperately about certain political beliefs, and who make \n     intemperate statements about those beliefs.\n\n  So we raise questions about whether those nominees can truly be \nimpartial, particularly when the law conflicts with those beliefs.\n  It is true that abortion rights can often be at the center of these \nquestions. As a result, accusations have been leveled that, at any time \nreproductive choice becomes an issue, it acts as a litmus test against \nthose whose religion causes them to be anti-choice.\n  But pro-choice Democrats on the Judiciary Committee have voted for \nmany nominees who are anti-choice and who believe that abortion should \nbe illegal--some of whom may . . . have been Catholic. I do not know, \nbecause I have never inquired.\n  So this is truly not about religion. This is about confirming judges \nwho can be impartial and fair in the administration of justice.\n  Before the Judiciary Committee, I said of Judge Pryor that, ``I think \nhis faith speaks favorably to his nomination and to his commitment to \nmoral values, which I have no problem with. I would like people in the \njudiciary with positive and strong moral values.''\n  I am troubled that legitimate and serious concerns over Judge Pryor \nand other nominees have been brushed aside, and instead it is said that \nwe on this side are trying to make a case against people of faith. That \nsimply is not true.\n  Thomas Jefferson wrote of the establishment clause of the first \namendment, ``I contemplate with sovereign reverence that act of the \nwhole American people which declared that their legislature should \n`make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the \nfree exercise thereof,' thus building a wall of separation between \nchurch and state.''\n  The Supreme Court has written that ``the most important of all \naspects of religious freedom in this country is that of the separation \nof church and state.''\n  It is because the separation of church and state ensures religious \nfreedom, that some of Judge Pryor's actions and statements concern me.\n  There are those who have minority-held religious views. There are \nthose who have majority-held religious views. But one of the beautiful \nthings about America is that it is a pluralistic society and that the \ngovernment has stayed out of religion. The founding fathers, looking at \nthe history of Europe, recognized the sectarian strife and religious \noppression that can arise from favoring one religion over another. They \ncame here and they founded a government where there was to be a \ndistinct line drawn between government and religion, and it has served \nthis country well.\n  So when people confuse arguments that are made to support the \nseparation of religion and government with an opposition to people of \nfaith, they could not be more wrong. And I think this has to be made \nincreasingly clear. We've all seen the inflammatory ads. We've all \nheard the commercials.\n  I hope that a more responsible tone will be struck, because the value \nof the separation between church and state is based on the fact that \nonce that bright line is broken, what one has to grapple with is which \nreligion do you put in the courtroom? Which religion do you allow to be \ncelebrated in a governmental framework?\n  If the separation of church and state, that has been a part of this \nnation since its founding, is abolished, these become very real and \nvery disturbing questions.\n  Accordingly, I am extremely concerned by Judge Pryor's actions and \nstatements promoting the erosion of the division between church and \nstate.\n  As deputy attorney general and attorney general of Alabama, Judge \nPryor vigorously defended the display of a statue of the Ten \nCommandments\n\n[[Page S6275]]\n\nin the Alabama supreme court. However, when questioned about whether it \nwould be constitutional to display religious artifacts or symbols from \nother religions in the court room, Pryor was noticeably silent.\n  According to an April 4, 1997 Associated Press account, Pryor said \nthat ``the State has no position on whether the Alabama supreme court \nChief Judge's right to pray and have a religious display in his \ncourtroom extends to people of other faiths.'' That Judge Pryor did not \ntake that opportunity to make clear that all religions are equal before \nour courts is distressing.\n  Also while Deputy Attorney General, Judge Pryor defended the Alabama \nsupreme court Chief Judge's practice of having Christian clergymen give \nprayers when jurors first assembled in his courtroom for a trial. Judge \nPryor sought to have an Alabama trial judge declare this practice \nconstitutional under the U.S. and Alabama constitutions. The trial \njudge ruled against Pryor, concluding that the prayer was \nunconstitutional.\n  The judge cited the Chief Judge's own statements that ``acknowledged \nthat through prayer in his court, he is promoting religion.'' Pryor's \ndecision to pursue this case despite the Chief Justice's own admission \nthat the prayer was intended to promote religion--thereby violating the \nestablishment clause of the Constitution--is perplexing.\n  It is imperative that our judges--particularly judges on our Courts \nof Appeals--respect and follow the law, especially the Constitution. I \ndo not believe that a lawyer with Judge Pryor's record of consistent \nattacks on the establishment clause and the separation of church and \nstate enshrined therein should be given a lifetime appointment to the \nEleventh Circuit.\n  Another concern I have with Judge Pryor is the extreme positions he \nhas advocated regarding a woman's right to choose. I have voted for \nnumerous anti-choice judicial nominees. However, Judge Pryor's \npositions are beyond the mainstream even of those who oppose the right \nto choose. Furthermore, his incendiary remarks on the subject \ndemonstrate not only a lack of appropriate judicial temperament, but a \nlack of respect for the Supreme Court.\n  Judge Pryor opposes abortion even in cases of rape and incest and \nsupports an exception only where a woman's life is endangered. He has \ncalled Roe v. Wade ``the worst abomination of constitutional law in our \nhistory,'' and said, ``I will never forget January 22, 1973, the day \nseven members of our highest court ripped the Constitution and ripped \nout the life of millions of unborn children.''\n  As attorney general of Alabama, Judge Pryor called Roe and Miranda v. \nArizona, the well known Supreme Court decision requiring that criminal \ndefendants be informed of their right to remain silent, ``the worst \nexamples of judicial activism.'' This depth of hostility to the \nestablished precedent of the Supreme Court is disquieting in an \nappellate court nominee.\n  At his confirmation hearing, Judge Pryor had the opportunity to \nclarify or step back from these inflammatory remarks. Nevertheless, he \nstood by his statement that Roe is the ``worst abomination of \nconstitutional law in our history''--worse than Plessy v. Ferguson, the \ndecision upholding segregation, the Dred Scott decision, which denied \ncitizenship and court access to all slaves and their descendants, or \nthe Korematsu case, validating the government's internment of Japanese \ncitizens during World War II.\n  That a nominee for a court just below the Supreme Court believes that \nan existing precedent of the Supreme Court protecting a woman's right \nto choose is worse than long discredited decisions denying blacks \ncitizenship or permitting segregation is deeply disturbing and out of \nline with the last hundred years of American jurisprudence.\n  In statements addressing the scope of Federal Government, Judge Pryor \nhas promoted a role so limited that the Federal Government would be \nforced to abdicate many of its central responsibilities. For example, \nhe has stated that Congress ``should not be in the business of public \neducation nor the control of street crime.''\n  I do not believe that the Federal Government should ignore critical \nmatters like education and crime, and neither do most Americans. \nHowever, my larger concern is not that Judge Pryor's position is \ncontrary to my viewpoint or even that it is contrary to the views of \nmost Americans, but that it is contrary to binding Supreme Court \nprecedent establishing the breadth of the Federal Government's powers.\n  This extremely limited view of the role of Federal Government is \nreflected in the positions Judge Pryor has taken on a number of \nimportant issues.\n  Testifying before the Judiciary Committee as attorney general of \nAlabama in 1997, Judge Pryor urged the repeal of Section 5 of the \nVoting Rights Act, calling it an ``affront to federalism, and an \nexpensive burden that has far outlived its usefulness.''\n  Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act requires any changes in voting \nlaws in states with a specific history of voting discrimination to be \npre-cleared by the Justice Department or the Federal District Court in \nWashington. D.C. to ensure they have no discriminatory purpose or \neffect. In this way, Section 5 of the Votings Rights Act has been a \ncritical tool in guaranteeing the voting rights of minorities.\n  Today, Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act continues to ensure voting \nrights. In the last ten years, Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act has \nbeen applied in more than a half-dozen states to ensure that districts \nare not redrawn to intentionally dilute minority votes and that polling \nplaces are not moved for the primary purpose of discouraging minority \nvoting.\n  Judge Pryor's strong criticism of this important safeguard of civil \nrights, particularly on federalism grounds--meaning he believes that \nthe Federal Government has no right to intervene, even where a \ncitizen's right to vote is threatened--concerns me.\n  One of Judge Pryor's legacies as attorney general of Alabama is his \neffort to weaken and undermine the Americans with Disabilities Act, \npassed in 1990 to protect the rights of the disabled. For example, in \nTennessee v. Lane, Pryor, then attorney general of Alabama, submitted \nan amicus brief seeking to deny a disabled defendant access to his own \ntrial.\n  Pryor argued that the constitutional guarantees of equal protection \nand due process ``do not require a State to provide unassisted access \nto public buildings'' and even took the extraordinary position that \nthere is no absolute right for a defendant to be present at his own \ncriminal trial, stating that ``even as to parties in legal proceedings, \nthere is no absolute right to attendance.'' The Supreme Court rejected \nthese extreme positions advocated by Pryor.\n  Pryor's repeated attempts to use judicial means to undo the \nlegislation protecting basic civil rights raise questions about both \nhis willingness to protect individual's civil rights and his propensity \nto judicial activism-- using the courts as a partisan vehicle to undo \nlegislation he does not support.\n  Supporters of Judge Pryor's nomination point to his brief record as a \nrecess appointee to the Eleventh Circuit as evidence of Judge Pryor's \nability to set aside his strong political views. While Judge Pryor, in \nhis short tenure on the Eleventh Circuit has not authored any \nparticularly controversial opinions, decisions he has written addressed \nwhat are largely technical and uncontroversial legal issues.\n  Judge Pryor's brief stint as a recess appointee may or may not offer \na representative preview of the opinions he would render as a lifetime \nmember of the Eleventh Circuit.\n  Ultimately, my concern is that Judge Pryor does not display the \ndispassionate, independent view that we want from our judges. While in \nprivate practice, Pryor's commitment to the Republican Party apparently \ninterfered with his representation of clients. Valstene Stabler, a \npartner at the Birmingham firm of Walston, Stabler, Wells, Anderson & \nBaines, described Pryor as being ``so interested in what the Republican \nParty was doing in the state, he was having trouble devoting attention \nto his private clients.''\n  A Washington Post editorial observed that:\n\n       Mr. Pryor's speeches display a disturbingly politicized \n     view of the role of the courts. He has suggested that \n     impeachment is an appropriate remedy for judges who \n     ``repeatedly and recklessly . . . overturn popular will and . \n     . . rewrite constitutional law.'' And he talks publicly about \n     judging in the vulgarly political terms of the current \n     judicial culture\n\n[[Page S6276]]\n\n     war. He concluded one speech, for example, with the following \n     prayer: ``Please, God, no more Souters'' a reference to the \n     betrayal many conservatives feel at the honorable career of \n     Supreme Court Justice David H. Souter.\n\n  Republicans who have worked with Judge Pryor have voiced concerns \nover his ability to be an independent, non-partisan judge. Grant Woods, \nthe former Republican attorney general of Arizona said that ``he would \nhave great question of whether Mr. Pryor has an ability to be non-\npartisan. I would say he was probably the most doctrinaire and most \npartisan of any attorney general I dealt with in 8 years. So I think \npeople would be wise to question whether or not he's the right person \nto be non-partisan on the bench.''\n  A judge must be able to set aside his views and apply the law evenly \nand fairly to all. Mr. Pryor's intemperate legal and political beliefs, \nand his strident statements and actions in furtherance of those \nbeliefs, have led me to question whether he can be truly impartial.\n  Aside from his brief tenure on the Eleventh Circuit as a recess \nappointee, Judge Pryor has no judicial record upon which to evaluate \nhim. Consequently, we must consider his fitness for the Eleventh \nCircuit on the basis of his actions and statements as deputy attorney \ngeneral and attorney general of Alabama. Looking back on this highly \npartisan and controversial tenure, I cannot vote for Judge Pryor's \nconfirmation to a lifetime appointment on the Eleventh Circuit Court of \nAppeals.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today to express my continued \nopposition to the nomination of William Pryor to be a judge on the \nEleventh Circuit Court of Appeals. Judge Pryor's record was extensively \nconsidered and examined by the Senate when he was first nominated for \nthis position in 2003. After he failed to obtain confirmation, \nPresident Bush used a recess appointment to appoint him to the Eleventh \nCircuit, an appointment that will expire at the end of the year, and \nnow has renominated him to a permanent seat on the court. I find no \nreason today to alter my earlier conclusion that his record of \nextremism makes clear that he falls far outside the mainstream, and \nthat I have no choice but to vote against his confirmation.\n  When considering a nominee to a Federal court judgeship, we consider \nmany things. The nominee should possess exemplary legal skills, \njudgment, and acumen. The nominee should be learned in the law. And the \nnominee should be well regarded among his peers, and in his or her \ncommunity. Perhaps most important of all is the nominee's judicial \ntemperament.\n  An appeals court judge's solemn duty and paramount obligation is to \ndo justice fairly, impartially and without favor. An appeals court \njudge must be judicious--that is, he or she must be open minded, must \nbe willing to set his personal preferences aside, and judge without \npredisposition. And, of course, he or she must follow controlling \nprecedent faithfully, and be able to disregard completely any views he \nor she holds to the contrary.\n  In the case of Judge Pryor, we are presented with a nominee whose \nviews are so extreme that he fails this basic test. In case after case, \nand on issue after issue, Judge Pryor compiled a public record as \nAlabama's attorney general of taking the most extreme positions, often \nat odds with controlling Supreme Court precedent, and in the most hard-\nline and inflexible manner.\n  Judge Pryor's views are outside of the mainstream on issues affecting \ncivil rights, women's rights, disability rights, religious freedom, and \nthe right to privacy. During his confirmation hearings at the Judiciary \nCommittee 2 years ago, he assured us that despite these views, he would \nfollow settled law and Supreme Court precedent. But he made this \npromise only after making extreme statements to the Committee and \nduring his hearing and refusing to disavow other zealous positions that \nhe has taken throughout his career. I concluded then--and do not \nbelieve differently now--that I had no basis to believe Judge Pryor \ncould put his personal views aside and apply the law of the land as \ndecided by the Supreme Court.\n  Judge Pryor's supporters argue that his record in the year since he \nhas sat as a judge on the Eleventh Circuit as a recess appointee \ndemonstrates that he is worthy of confirmation. Yet, in each of the \ndecisions that his supporters rely on for this judgment, Judge Pryor \njoined unanimous panels in supporting results virtually mandated by \ncontrolling precedent. Much more relevant than Judge Pryor's short and \ntemporary tenure on the Eleventh Circuit is his record during all the \nyears of his professional career prior to his recess appointment, \nespecially his seven years of service as Alabama's attorney general, as \nwell as his testimony before our committee in 2003.\n  And his record of extremism and ideologically motivated decision \nmaking during his years as attorney general could not be more clear. \nWhile attorney general of Alabama, Judge Pryor actively sought out \ncases where he could expand on his cramped view of federalism and \nchallenge the ability of the Federal Government to remedy \ndiscriminatory practices. Many of the cases in which he took his most \nextreme legal positions were on behalf of the State of Alabama where he \nhad the sole decision under State law as to what legal position to \nassert. These cases include his assertion of federalism claims to \ndefeat provisions of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act and the \nAmericans With Disabilities Act; his opposition to Congress's authority \nto provide victims of gender-motivated violence to sue their attackers \nin federal court; his argument that Congress exceeded its authority in \npassing the Family and Medical Leave Act; and many other cases. The \nextreme legal positions advanced in these cases were fully and entirely \nthe responsibility of this nominee while he served as Alabama's \nattorney general.\n  Of course, Judge Pryor has every right to hold his views, whether we \nagree with him or not. He can run for office and serve in the \nlegislative or executive branches should he convince a majority of his \nfellow Alabamians that he is fit to represent them. But he has no right \nto be a federal appeals court judge. Only those who we are convinced \nare impartial, unbiased, fair, and whose only guiding ideology is to \nfollow the Constitution to apply equal justice to all are fit for this \nposition. Unfortunately, we can have no confidence that he will set \nthese views aside and faithfully follow the Constitution and binding \nprecedent. For these reasons, I must oppose his confirmation.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the time \nfrom 3:15 until 3:30 shall be under the control of the Democrats, and \nthe time from 3:30 until 3:45 shall be under the control of the \nDemocratic leader.\n  The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the time I have left over from the 15 \nminutes that is from 3:30 to 3:45 I will leave to Senator Leahy. I am \ngoing to use part of his time now.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise to express my strong opposition to \nthe nomination of William Pryor to the Eleventh Circuit Court of \nAppeals.\n  At the outset, let me note the unusual fact that we are considering \nwhether to confirm this nominee to a court on which he has been sitting \nfor over a year as a recess appointee. In my view) this nomination is \nentitled to no special deference as a result of the nominee's status as \na sitting federal judge.\n  There are serious constitutional questions about the validity of Mr. \nPryor's recess appointment, and his confirmation at this time does not \nanswer those questions with regard to cases heard by this or other \nrecess appointees. Nor should it embolden President Bush to continue \nthe questionable practice of appointing judges without the advice and \nconsent of the Senate.\n  I oppose this nominee because his views on a wide range of vital \nissues are far outside the mainstream of legal thought, and I question \nhis ability to put those views aside to decide cases impartially.\n  I said during the floor debate yesterday that Janice Rogers Brown is \nPresident Bush's most objectionable nominee. But I want to be clear: on \nthe critical issue of civil rights, William Pryor holds views that are \nequally offensive as those of Justice Brown. The Pryor nomination \ndeserves to be defeated just as the Brown nomination deserved to be \ndefeated.\n\n[[Page S6277]]\n\n  Any analysis of Mr. Pryor's judicial philosophy should begin with his \nviews on federalism. This nominee has been a self-styled leader of the \nso-called federalism revolution conservative legal circles, a movement \nthat challenges the authority of Congress to remedy civil rights \nviolations.\n  Now, I am certainly thankful that the Framers of the Constitution had \nthe wisdom to create a Federal system that divided power between the \nnational and State governments. But for Mr. Pryor, the word \n``federalism'' is more than that--it is a code word or a systematic \neffort to undermine important Federal protections for the disabled, the \naged, women, minorities, labor, and the environment.\n  While attorney general of Alabama, Pryor told a Federalist Society \nconference that Congress:\n\n     should not be in the business of public education nor the \n     control of street crimes . . . With real federalism, Congress \n     would . . . make free trade its main domestic concern. \n     Congress would not be allowed to subvert the commerce clause \n     to regulate crime, education, land use, family relations, or \n     social policy . . .\n\n  One proponent of the federalism movement is Michael Greve, a \nconservative scholar at the American Enterprise Institute. Greve told \nthe New York Times that:\n\n       what is really needed here is a fundamental intellectual \n     assault on the entire New Deal edifice.\n\n  Greve said he thinks this attack on the New Deal will get a good \nhearing from judges like William Pryor. Greve says of Pryor:\n\n     [he] is the key to this puzzle; there's nobody like him.\n\n  Let's look at some of the bedrock laws that Mr. Pryor has challenged \nunder the banner of federalism. Mr. Pryor has argued that the Federal \ncourts should narrow, or throw out entirely, all or portions of the \nAmericans with Disabilities Act, the Age Discrimination in Employment \nAct, the Civil Rights Act, the Clean Water Act, the Fair Labor \nStandards Act, the Family and Medical Leave Act, the Violence Against \nWomen Act, and the Voting Rights Act.\n\n  What would America look like if this federalist revolution were to \ntake hold in the Federal courts? University of Chicago Law Professor \nCass Sunstein describes it well:\n\n       Many decisions of the Federal Communications Commission, \n     the Environmental Protection Agency, the Occupational Safety \n     and Health Administration and possibly the National Labor \n     Relations Board would be unconstitutional. It would mean that \n     the Social Security Act would not only be under political but \n     also constitutional stress . . . the Securities and Exchange \n     Commission and maybe even the Federal Reserve would be in \n     trouble. Some applications or the Endangered Species Act and \n     Clean Water Act would be struck down as beyond Congress's \n     commerce power.\n\n  As attorney general of Alabama, Pryor had the sole power to decide \nwhat legal action the State and its agencies would take, and he used \nthat power to file ``friend of the court'' briefs attacking many of \nthese statutes. In fact, Alabama was the only State to file a brief \nagainst the Violence Against Women Act, while 36 States submitted \nbriefs in support of the statute--which had passed Congress with \nbipartisan support.\n  With regard to the Voting Rights Act, Mr. Pryor had the following to \nsay when he testified before Congress in 1997:\n\n       I encourage you to consider seriously, for example, the \n     repeal or amendment of section 5 of the Voting Rights Act, \n     which is an affront to federalism and an expensive burden \n     that has far outlived its usefulness, and consider modifying \n     other provisions of the Act that have led to extraordinary \n     abuses of judicial power.\n\n  The Voting Rights Act is still of vital importance, and section 5 is \none of its most important sections. I have grave concerns that if Mr. \nPryor cannot understand the continuing need for voting rights \nprotections for minorities, he is unlikely to rigorously enforce the \nact in cases before the Circuit. This is especially important since all \nof the States within the circuit are covered, in whole or in part, by \nSection 5.\n  Mr. Pryor has waged an assault on other civil rights laws. In the \ncase of Alexander v. Sandoval, Pryor filed a brief for Alabama which \nurged the Court to drastically restrict title VI of the Civil Rights \nAct, which bars discrimination in federally funded programs. In a 5-to-\n4 opinion written by Justice Scalia, the Supreme Court agreed with \nPryor and held that there is no private right of action to enforce \ntitle VI regulations. This ruling was a dramatic setback for the civil \nrights movement and continues to impede the enforcement of civil rights \nlaws.\n  While five Supreme Court Justices agreed with Pryor about title VI, \nhis outside-the-mainstream views have often been rejected by the \ncurrent conservative Supreme Court. In fact, the Court unanimously \nrejected three of Mr. Pryor's federalism arguments: that sovereign \nimmunity applies not only to States but to counties; that the Americans \nwith Disabilities Act does not apply to State prisons; and that a law \nbarring a State from selling the personal information of its citizens \nwithout permission is unconstitutional.\n  It is no wonder that the Atlanta-Journal Constitution, in an \neditorial entitled ``Right-wing Zealot is Unfit to Judge,'' wrote that \nMr. Pryor's nomination:\n\n     is an affront to the basic premise that a candidate for the \n     federal bench must exhibit respect for established \n     constitutional principles and individual liberties. Pryor may \n     be a good lawyer and a faithful Republican, but his lifelong \n     extremism disqualifies him for a federal judgeship.\n\n  And there is more.\n  There is Mr. Pryor's view of the equal protection clause, which led \nhim to oppose a 7-to-1 ruling by the Supreme Court that opened the \nVirginia Military Institute, a State-funded university, to women. \nPredictably, Mr. Pryor called that case an example of the Supreme Court \nbeing ``both anti-democratic and insensitive to federalism.''\n  There is Mr. Pryor's contempt for what he called the ``so-called wall \nof separation between church and state'' and his belief that this \nimportant doctrine was created by ``errors of case law.'' In fact, Mr. \nPryor remarked at a graduation ceremony that ``the challenge of the \nnext millennium will be to preserve the American experiment by \nrestoring its Christian perspective.''\n  There is his view of the Constitution's prohibition on cruel and \nunusual punishment. The Supreme Court--which has not exactly been \nliberal on this issue--rejected Mr. Pryor's argument that prison guards \ncould handcuff prisoners to a hitching post in the Alabama sun and deny \nthem bathroom breaks or water. It also rejected his argument that it is \npermissible to execute the mentally retarded. It also rejected his \nargument that counsel need not be provided to indigent defendants \ncharged with a misdemeanor that carries a jail sentence.\n  Is this the kind of judge we want to confirm to a lifetime seat on a \nFederal appellate court?\n  Do we want a judge who, when the Supreme Court questioned the \nconstitutionality of Alabama's use of the electric chair in 2000, \nlashed out at the Court by saying ``[T]his issue should not be decided \nby nine octogenarian lawyers who happen to sit on the U.S. Supreme \nCourt''?\n  Do we want a judge who, on the day after the Supreme Court's final \nruling in Bush v. Gore, said:\n\n       I'm probably the only one who wanted it 5-4. I wanted \n     Governor Bush to have a full appreciation of the judiciary \n     and judicial selection so we can have no more appointments \n     like Justice Souter.\n\n  On another occasion he said:\n\n       Please God, no more Souters.\n\n  This kind of temperament served Pryor well as a Republican \npolitician, but this doesn't represent the kind of judicial temperament \nwe want on the Federal bench.\n  The Senate must exercise its advice and consent responsibility with \ngreat care. In fact, we should follow Mr. Pryor's own advice. He once \ntold a Senate subcommittee that:\n\n     your role of advice and consent in judicial nominations \n     cannot be overstated.\n\n  I agree with him on that point. For these reasons, I urge my \ncolleagues to withhold the in consent to this very unacceptable \nnomination.\n  Mr. President, I apologize to my friend. Since he was not here, I \nused my time a little early. So the record is clear, my friend is the \ngreat Senator Pat Leahy from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n\n[[Page S6278]]\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, how much time is available?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the \nSenator from Vermont has such time until 3:45 remaining.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I appreciate that.\n  Mr. President, last month 80 American service men and women died in \nIraq, along with more than 700 Iraqis. This week, there are reports \nthat the Army National Guard and the Marines are not meeting their \nrecruitment goals, in spite of the bonuses and benefits being offered. \nThe price of gasoline, prescription drugs, health care, and so many \nessentials for American working families are rising a lot faster than \ntheir wages. This week, the Washington Times reported that the rate of \nincrease in the Consumer Price Index doubled in the last year. This \nweek, we have learned that General Motors has planned to lay off \nanother 25,000 workers and that other companies are not expanding or \nare, even worse, downsizing. The report of only 78,000 jobs created \nlast month puts us back to the dismal levels that have characterized so \nmany months during this administration. A loss of our manufacturing \njobs continues at a steady drip. Millions are suffering and dying in \nAfrica. The British Prime Minister visited to urge greater efforts to \nhelp.\n  But, of course, we debated none of these issues in the Senate. The \nRepublican leadership continued to force us to expend our precious days \ndebating something else. And what is that? The Senate's time has been \nfocused not on these things that touch the pocketbooks of Americans but \nalmost exclusively on this administration's divisive and contentious \njudicial nominees.\n  Over the last several months, and for many days and weeks over the \nlast few years, the work of the Senate has been laid aside by the \nRepublican leadership to force debate after debate on divisive \nnominations, on people who are going to be paid almost $200,000 a year \nin lifetime jobs. Those who are barely able to make their week's rent \nor their month's mortgage ask what we are doing in the Senate.\n  Among the matters the Senate has neglected this week in order to \ndevote its attention to these nominations are many issues that concern \nthe American people. One matter is the consideration and passage of the \nNOPEC bill. It is bipartisan legislation. It affects all Americans, \nRepublicans and Democrats. Senator DeWine, a Republican of Ohio, \nSenator Kohl, a Democrat of Wisconsin, are key sponsors. The sponsors \nof the bill include Senator Grassley, Senator Specter, Senator Coburn, \nand Senator Snowe.\n  With an increase in gasoline prices of almost 50 percent during the \nfour years of the Bush Presidency, with Americans having to pay so much \nmore to drive to work, to get their kids to school, just to get around \nto conduct the daily business of their lives, the Republican leadership \nof the Senate is ignoring this substantial burden on American working \nfamilies.\n  This week, the national average price for a gallon of regular \ngasoline was $2.12. When the President took office, it was $1.46. We \njust heard reports that in Vermont and New Hampshire home heating oil \nprices will be up another 30 percent this fall and winter.\n  The artificial pricing scheme enforced by OPEC affects all of us, and \nit is especially tough on our hard-working Vermont farmers. Rising \nenergy expenses can add thousands of dollars a year to the costs of \noperating a 100-head dairy operation, a price that could mean the \ndifference between keeping the family business alive for another \ngeneration or shutting it down.\n  With summer coming, many families are going to find that OPEC has put \nan expensive crimp in their vacation plans. Some are likely to stay \nhome; others will pay more to drive or to fly so that they can visit \ntheir families or take their well-deserved vacations.\n  Americans deserve better. If the White House is not going to \nintervene, then Congress has to act. It is past time--it is past the \ntime--for holding hands and exchanging kisses with Saudi princes, \nprinces who have artificially inflated the price of gasoline. The \nPresident's jawboning with his close friends in Saudi Arabia has proven \nunsuccessful. It is time to act, but the Senate, under Republican \nleadership, is choosing instead to revisit another extreme judicial \nnomination, one that has already been considered.\n\n  The production quota set by OPEC continues to take a debilitating \ntoll on our economy, our families, our businesses, industry, and \nfarmers. Last year and again earlier this year, the Judiciary Committee \nvoted to report favorably to the full Senate the bipartisan NOPEC bill, \nwhich is short for No Oil Producing and Exporting Cartels Act. Our \nlegislation would apply America's antitrust laws to OPEC's anti-\ncompetitive cartel. It would prohibit foreign states from working \ntogether to limit production and set prices, restrain the trading of \npetroleum and natural gas, when such actions affect the United States. \nIt would give the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade \nCommission authority to enforce the law through antitrust actions in \nFederal courts.\n  Why not give the Justice Department clear authority to use our \nantitrust laws against the anti-competitive, anti-consumer conduct in \nwhich the OPEC cartel is engaged here in the United States?\n  This bipartisan bill was reported by the Judiciary Committee more \nthan a year ago, in April of last year. It was reintroduced this year \nand reported, again, in April of this year. It has been stalled on the \nSenate Business Calendar for too long. It is a bipartisan initiative \nthat could help in the fight to reduce gasoline prices now and heating \noil prices in the fall and winter. It deserves a vote. Why not have an \nup or down vote on this measure without further delay by the Republican \nleadership? Why can't we do that when we have seen gasoline go from \n$1.46 to $2.12 in this President's administration? No, instead we spend \nweeks and months, not passing legislation that would win the support of \na majority of Republicans and Democrats, but talking about a handful of \npeople who are going to get lifetime, well-paid jobs.\n  Another consequence of the Republican leadership's fixation on \ncarrying out this President's attempt to pack the Federal courts with \nactivist jurists may be much-needed asbestos compensation reform. For \nmore than 3 years, I have been working on asbestos reform to provide \ncompensation to asbestos victims in a fair and more expedited fashion. \nChairman Specter and I have worked closely on S. 852, the FAIR Act. It, \ntoo, is pending on the Senate Business Calendar, even though it was \nvoted out in a bipartisan effort last month.\n  Chairman Specter deserves enormous credit for this achievement, even \nthough we were slowed significantly by the extensive debate on \ncontentious nominees and the nuclear option the past few months. We \nhave been working in good faith to achieve a bipartisan legislative \nprocess on this issue. We have done so, despite criticism from the left \nand the right. In fact, after the bill was successfully reported by the \ncommittee, Senator Hatch called it the most important measure the \nSenate would consider this year for the American economy. Are we \ndebating it on the floor? No. We are debating a handful of right-wing \nactivist judges for lifetime, highly paid jobs.\n  There are many items that need prompt attention. The Armed Services \nCommittee completed its work on the Department of Defense authorization \nbill. But we are seeing the Republican leadership delay action on the \nDefense authorization bill at a time when we have so many of our men \nand women under arms overseas. I don't know why they are doing it, \nunless it is to allow more activist judges to come through. At a time \nwhen we have young men and women serving their country around the \nworld, and we are talking about the recently recommended base closings, \nI would have thought the Defense authorization would be more of a \npriority than three or four activist judges.\n  The Senate Energy Committee successfully completed its consideration \nof an Energy bill, and it was reported to the Senate with a strong \nbipartisan majority. Despite its balance and a bipartisan vote, the \nSenate Republican leadership said, no, we can't talk about it. We have \nto talk about a couple more right-wing activist judges.\n\n[[Page S6279]]\n\n  Another matter that deserves timely attention is the Stem Cell \nResearch Enhancement Act which was just passed by the House of \nRepresentatives. It is another bipartisan effort that deserves our \nattention. It had 200 House sponsors, led by Congressman Castle and \nCongresswoman DeGette. It passed with 238 votes. It is critically \nimportant. It authorizes work on embryonic stem cells which otherwise \nwould be discarded, work which holds great promise and hope for those \nfamilies suffering from debilitating disease and injury. More effective \ntreatments for Parkinson's, Alzheimer's disease, diabetes, for spinal \ncord injuries, for many other diseases are all possibilities. Why are \nwe not debating that? We have three or four more activist right-wing \njudgeships for lifetime, highly paid positions. That is far more \nimportant than stem cell research.\n  While the administration continues to talk about its efforts to \nweaken Social Security, there is bipartisan legislation we should be \nconsidering, the Social Security Fairness Act. Are we going to talk \nabout that? No. Will we talk about the fact that the administration is \nraiding the Social Security fund to pay for their war in Iraq? That is \nsomething they don't want to talk about. They want to talk about Social \nSecurity failing, but they don't talk about the fact that they have to \ntake the money out of the Social Security fund to pay for the war in \nIraq. We can't talk about the Social Security Fairness Act here on the \nfloor because we have to take the time for three or four more right-\nwing activist judges.\n  The bill I talked about is a bill that Republican and Democratic \nSenators have cosponsored over the years to protect the Social Security \nretirement of police officers. Those on the front lines protecting all \nof us from crime and violence should not see their Social Security \nbenefits reduced. That needs fixing. We could have done that easily \nthis week. But, no, we can't protect our police officers. Instead, we \nwill make sure that a handful of right-wing activist judges get highly \npaid lifetime jobs.\n\n  These are merely examples of some of the business matters the \nRepublican majority of the Senate has cast aside to force more debate \non more contentious nominees. The Senate could be making significant \nlegislative progress on an agenda that would result in much-needed and \ntangible relief to the American people on a number of important fronts. \nWe could be acting to lower gas prices, authorize actions against \nillegal cartels, make asbestos compensation efficient and effective, \nauthorize vital scientific research, provide fairness to police \nofficers and to make health care more affordable, create new and better \njobs and give our veterans and their families the support they need and \ndeserve. Instead, the Republican leadership of the Senate continues its \nnarrow focus on helping this Administration pack the federal courts \nwith extreme nominees.\n  For more than four years, we have seen the Republican congressional \nleadership and the administration ignore the problems of Americans with \na single-minded effort to pack and control the Federal courts. \nUnemployment, gas prices, the number of uninsured, the Nation's budget, \nthe trade deficit were all lower when President Bush assumed office. \nThrough Republican Senate obstruction of more than 60 of President \nClinton's moderate and qualified judicial nominees, more than 60 of \nPresident Clinton's nominees who were subjected to a pocket filibuster \nby Republicans, judicial vacancies went up. But let's take a look.\n  Since President Bush came in, what are the things that have gone up? \nUnemployment has gone up 21 percent. Since President Bush came in, what \nhas gone up? The budget deficit has gone up. It has gone from a $236 \nbillion surplus under President Clinton to a $427 billion deficit under \nPresident Bush--$663 billion down the rat hole. What else has gone up? \nThe price of gas has gone from $1.42 to $2.10. That is not helping the \naverage American. Let's take a look at the trade deficit. It has gone \nup from $36 billion to $55 billion. How about the percentage of the \nuninsured? That has gone up another 10 percent.\n  But the full-time, highly paid positions of judgeships is the one \nthing that has come down. Judicial vacancies have come down 49 percent.\n  It seems that is far more important than seeing projected trillions \nof dollars in surpluses go to trillions of dollars in projected \ndeficits, far more important than the problem we create when we allow \nthe Saudis, the Chinese, the South Koreans, the Japanese, and others to \npay our bills but then be able to manipulate our economy. It seems \nwrong.\n  We helped the President confirm a record number of his judges, but we \nDemocrats would like to see us talk about the people who are out of \nwork, the price of gasoline, the huge deficits that have been created \nby this presidency.\n  We know that yesterday the Senate confirmed Janice Rogers Brown to \nthe Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, despite the fact she is a \ndivisive and controversial nominee. She was opposed by both her home \nState Senators because she had a record so extreme it marked her as one \nof the most activist judicial nominees ever chosen by any President.\n  In the past, when both Senators from a nominee's State opposed them, \nthe person, even if highly qualified, would be turned down. In this \ncase, we have somebody who is not qualified, an activist judge opposed \nby both of her State's Senators, who still passed. I mention that \nbecause I remember Justice Ronnie White, now the first African American \nto serve as Chief Justice of the Missouri Supreme Court. When the two \nSenators from his home State, Republican Senators, said they were \nopposed to him, what happened? In 1999, every Republican Senator came \non to the floor and voted down Justice Ronnie White, even though he had \nbeen voted out of the Judiciary Committee with heavy support. They \nsaid: Whoops, he may be this distinguished African-American jurist from \nMissouri. But we have two Senators from his State who oppose him so we \nwill vote him down. And they did.\n\n  But yesterday, what a difference. What a difference if you have a \nRepublican in the White House. Those same Republican Senators, joined \nby new Republican Senators, the same Republican Senators who told me, \n``We know that Justice Ronnie White is well qualified, but, after all, \nwe have to follow the fact that the two Senators from his State say \nthey don't want him, so we have to vote him down,'' those same Senators \ncome up here and meekly come in, in lockstep, and vote for Judge Brown, \neven though the two home-state Senators, for very good reasons, opposed \nher.\n  Last week, all but one Republican Senator voted to confirm Priscilla \nOwen.\n  Yesterday's vote on the Brown nomination apparently indicates \nRepublican Party discipline has been restored. For all the talk about \nprofiles in courage and Senators voting their conscience, the \nRepublican majority has reduced the Senate to a rubberstamp of this \nPresident's extreme and activist nominees. Even though Senators will \ntell you privately they would vote against this person if it was secret \nballot, the White House tells them what to do.\n  William Pryor has argued that Federal courts should cut back on the \nprotections of important and well-supported Federal laws, including the \nAge Discrimination in Employment Act, the Americans with Disabilities \nAct, the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Clean Water Act, the Violence \nAgainst Women Act, the Family and Medical Leave Act. That should be \nenough to vote against him, but it won't be, not with this rubberstamp. \nHe has repudiated decades of legal precedents that permitted \nindividuals to sue States to prevent violations of Federal civil rights \nregulations. Is that going to cause us to vote him down? Heck no.\n  His aggressive involvement in the Federalist revolution shows he is a \ngoals-oriented activist who has used his official position to advance \nhis cause. While his advocacy is a sign to most people of the \nextremism, he trumpets his involvement. He is unabashedly proud of his \nrepeated work to limit congressional authority to promote the health, \nsafety, and welfare of all Americans.\n  His passion is not some obscure legal theory but a legal crusade that \nhas driven his actions since he was a student and something that guides \nhis actions as a lawyer. His speeches and his testimony before Congress \ndemonstrate just how rooted his views are, how much he wants to effect \na fundamental change in this country.\n\n[[Page S6280]]\n\n  Just remember this: These judicial nominees are being confirmed for \nlife. They do not leave or get reconsidered after the congressional \nelections next year or after this administration ends. They serve as \nlifetime appointments to the Federal court.\n  It is one thing for us to ignore all the things we should be doing \nfor the American people, but I urge all Senators, on both sides of the \naisle, to end this up-or-down rubberstamp, fulfill the Senate's \nconstitutionally mandated duty to evaluate with clear eyes the fitness \nof judicial nominees, even President Bush's nominees, when they are for \nlifetime appointments. Stop telling me privately how you would vote if \nit was a secret ballot. Have the courage to vote in an open ballot the \nsame way.\n  In the last Congress, following one of the most divisive debates I \nhave seen on the floor of the Senate, I explained why I felt strongly \nabout voting against the nomination of William Pryor to the U.S. Court \nof Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit--in committee and in two \nunsuccessful cloture attempts. The President disregarded the advice \ngiven to him by the Senators opposing this nomination, and he installed \nMr. Pryor as a recess-appointed judge on the Eleventh Circuit where he \nwill serve until the end of this year. Today, because the President \ncontinues to insist on pushing his most divisive nominees in a group \nthat he renominated to the Senate, we are here voting yet one more time \non this nomination.\n  I expect some will try to point to the few cases he has worked on \nduring his time ``auditioning'' on the circuit court as evidence that \nhe should be confirmed. But nothing Judge Pryor has done in the \nintervening period has changed my view that based on his entire career \nand record, if he were to receive life tenure on the Federal bench, he \nwould put ideology above the law. I cannot support him.\n  In the course of their march toward the ``nuclear option''--a \ndevelopment thankfully averted--the President and the Republican \nleadership escalated the rhetoric surrounding this issue in alarming \nways. The majority leader last month participated in a telecast \nsmearing opponents of the most extreme judicial nominees as ``against \npeople of faith.'' Arrayed behind the podium at that gathering were \nphotos of the filibustered nominees, and speaker after speaker accused \nDemocrats of opposing nominees such as Judge Pryor because of his \nfaith. These are baseless and despicable accusations, and it is time \nthe Republican leadership and other Republicans in and out of the \nSenate disavow them.\n  Senate Democrats do not oppose William Pryor because of his faith. We \noppose the nomination of William Pryor to the Eleventh Circuit because \nof his extreme--some, with good reason, use the word ``radical''--ideas \nabout what the Constitution says about federalism, criminal justice and \nthe death penalty, violence against women, the Americans with \nDisabilities Act, and the Government's ability to protect the \nenvironment on behalf of the American people. Of course, those \nsubstantive concerns will not do much to advance Republicans' political \nambitions and the agendas of polarizing interest groups. So some \nRepublican partisans are putting the truth to one side. They dismiss \nthe views of Democratic Senators doing their duty under the \nConstitution to examine the fitness of every nominee to a lifetime \nposition on the Federal bench and choose, instead, to use smears and \naccusations.\n  The last time Judge Pryor came before this committee and the Senate, \nslanderous accusations were made by Republican Senators, and scurrilous \nnewspaper advertisements were run by a group headed by the President's \nfather's former White House counsel and a group whose funding includes \nmoney raised by Republican Senators and even by the President's family. \nOther Republican members of the Judiciary Committee and of the Senate \nstood mute in the face of these McCarthyite charges, or, worse, fed the \nflames. Now, the same type of rhetoric--identifying opponents as \nagainst faith--has again reared its ugly head.\n  This kind of religious smear campaign hurts the whole country. It \nhurts Christians and non-Christians. It hurts all of us, because the \nConstitution requires judges to apply the law, not their personal \nviews. Remember that all of us, no matter what our faith--and I am \nproud of mine--are able to practice our religion as we choose or not to \npractice a religion. That is a fundamental guarantee of our \nConstitution. The Constitution's prohibition against a ``religious \ntest'' in Article VI is consistent with that fundamental freedom. I \nhope that Republican Senators will debate this nomination absent the \nscurrilous charges that marked it the past and the discourse during the \n``nuclear option'' last month.\n  Instead, the Senate's debate should center on the nominee's \nqualifications for this lifetime post in the Federal judiciary. There \nis an abundance of substantive and compelling reasons why William Pryor \nshould not be a judge on the Eleventh Circuit. Opposition to Judge \nPryor's nomination is shared by a wide spectrum of objective observers. \nJudge Pryor's record is so out of the mainstream that a vast number of \neditorial boards and others have weighed in with significant \nopposition.\n  Even The Washington Post, which has been exceedingly generous to the \nAdministration's efforts to pack the courts, has termed Judge Pryor \n``unfit'' and consistently opposed his nomination. In Alabama, both the \nTuscaloosa News and the Hunstville Times wrote against the nomination. \nOther editorial boards across the country have spoken out, including \nthe Atlanta Journal-Constitution, the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, The New \nYork Times, the Charleston Gazette, the Arizona Daily Star, and The Los \nAngeles Times.\n  We have also heard from a large number of organizations and \nindividuals concerned about justice before the federal courts. The Log \nCabin Republicans, the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights, the AFL-\nCIO, the National Partnership for Women and Families and many others \nhave provided the Committee with their concerns and the basis for their \nopposition. We have received letters of opposition from organizations \nthat rarely take positions on nominations but feel so strongly about \nthis one that they are compelled to publicly oppose it, including the \nNational Senior Citizens' Law Center, the Anti-Defamation League and \nthe Sierra Club.\n  The ABA's evaluation also indicates concern about this nomination. \nTheir Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary gave Mr. Pryor a \npartial rating of ``not qualified'' to sit on the Federal bench. Of \ncourse this is not the first ``not qualified'' rating or partial ``not \nqualified'' rating that this administration's judicial nominees have \nreceived. More than two dozen of President Bush's nominees have \nreceived indications of concerns about their qualifications from the \nABA's peer reviews, which have been less exacting and much more \naccommodating to this administration than to previous ones. I would \nnote that this softer treatment follows the changes in the process \nimposed by the Bush administration.\n  Judge Pryor has long been a leader of the federalist movement, \npromoting State power over the Federal Government. A leading proponent \nof what he refers to as the ``federalism revolution,'' Judge Pryor \nseeks to revitalize state power at the expense of Federal protections, \nseeking opportunities to attack Federal laws and programs designed to \nguarantee civil rights protections. He has urged that Federal laws on \nbehalf of the disabled, the aged, women, minorities, and the \nenvironment all be limited. Not long ago, in a New York Times Magazine \narticle about the so-called ``Constitution-in-Exile'' movement, Michael \nGreve, was quoted as saying, ``Bill Pryor is the key to this puzzle; \nthere's nobody like him. I think he's sensational. He gets almost all \nof it.'' That is precisely why he should not be confirmed.\n  William Pryor has argued that the Federal courts should cut back on \nthe protections of important and well-supported Federal laws including \nthe Age Discrimination in Employment Act, the Americans with \nDisabilities Act, the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Clean Water Act, \nthe Violence Against Women Act, and the Family and Medical Leave Act. \nHe has repudiated decades of legal precedents that permitted \nindividuals to sue states to prevent violations of Federal civil rights \nregulations. His aggressive involvement in this ``federalist \nrevolution'' shows that he is a goal-oriented, activist conservative \nwho has used his official position\n\n[[Page S6281]]\n\nto advance his ``cause.'' Alabama was the only state to file an amicus \nbrief arguing that Congress lacked authority to enforce the Clean Water \nAct. He argued that the Constitution's commerce clause does not grant \nthe Federal Government authority to prevent destruction of waters and \nwetlands that serve as a critical habitat for migratory birds. The \nSupreme Court did not adopt his narrow view of the commerce clause \npowers of Congress. While his advocacy in this case is a sign to most \npeople of the extremism, he trumpets his involvement in this case. He \nis unabashedly proud of his repeated work to limit congressional \nauthority to promote the health, safety and welfare of all Americans.\n  His passion is not some obscure legal theory but a legal crusade that \nhas driven his actions since he was a student and something that guides \nhis actions as a lawyer. His speeches and testimony before Congress \ndemonstrate just how rooted his views are, how much he seeks to effect \na fundamental change in the country, and how far outside the mainstream \nhe is.\n  Judge Pryor is candid about the fact that his view of federalism is \ndifferent from the current operation of the Federal Government--and \nthat he is on a mission to change the government to fit his vision. His \ngoal is to continue to limit Congress's authority to enact laws under \nthe Fourteenth Amendment and the commerce clause--laws that protect \nwomen, ethnic and racial minorities, senior citizens, the disabled, and \nthe environment--in the name of sovereign immunity. Is there any \nquestion that he will pursue his agenda as a judge on the Eleventh \nCircuit Court of Appeals reversing equal rights progress and affecting \nthe lives of millions of Americans for decades to come?\n  Judge Pryor's comments have revealed insensitivity to the barriers \nthat disadvantaged persons and members of minority groups and women \ncontinue to face in the criminal justice system. This is what is at \nstake for Americans, the consumers of our justice system. This is the \ntype of judge this President and this Republican leadership are intent \non permanently installing in our justice system.\n  In testimony before Congress, William Pryor has urged repeal of \nSection 5 of the Voting Rights Act--the centerpiece of that landmark \nstatute--because, he says, it ``is an affront to federalism and an \nexpensive burden that has far outlived its usefulness.'' That testimony \ndemonstrates that Judge Pryor is more concerned with preventing an \n``affront'' to the States' dignity than with guaranteeing all citizens \nthe right to cast an equal vote. It also reflects a long-discredited \nview of the Voting Rights Act. Since the enactment of the statute in \n1965, every Supreme Court case to address the question has rejected the \nclaim that Section 5 is an ``affront'' to our system of federalism. \nWhether under Earl Warren, Warren Burger, or William Rehnquist, the \nUnited States Supreme Court has recognized that guaranteeing all \ncitizens the right to cast an equal vote is essential to our democracy \nnot a ``burden'' that has ``outlived its usefulness.''\n  His strong views against providing counsel and fair procedures for \ndeath row inmates have led William Pryor to doomsday predictions about \nthe modest reforms in the Innocence Protection Act that would create a \nsystem to ensure competent counsel in death penalty cases. When the \nUnited States Supreme Court questioned the constitutionality of \nAlabama's method of execution in 2000, William Pryor lashed out at the \nSupreme Court, saying: ``[T]his issue should not be decided by nine \noctogenarian lawyers who happen to sit on the U.S. Supreme Court.'' \nAside from the obvious disrespect this comment shows for the Nation's \nhighest court, it shows again how results-oriented Judge Pryor is in \nhis approach to the law and to the Constitution. Of course an issue \nabout cruel and unusual punishment ought to be decided by the Supreme \nCourt. It is addressed in the Eighth Amendment, and whether or not we \nagree on the ruling, it is an elementary principle of constitutional \nlaw that it be decided by the Supreme Court, no matter how old its \nmembers.\n  Judge Pryor has also vigorously opposed an exemption for persons with \nmental retardation from receiving the death penalty, exhibiting more \ncertainty than understanding or sober reflection. He authored an amicus \ncuriae brief to the Supreme Court arguing that the Court should not \ndeclare that executing mentally retarded persons violated the Eighth \nAmendment. After losing on that issue, Judge Pryor made an unsuccessful \nargument to the Eleventh Circuit that an Alabama death-row defendant is \nnot mentally retarded.\n  Judge Pryor has spoken harshly about the moratorium imposed by former \nIllinois Governor George Ryan, calling it a ``spectacle.'' Can someone \nso dismissive of evidence that challenges his views be expected to hear \nthese cases fairly? Over the last few years, many prominent Americans \nhave begun raising concerns about the death penalty including current \nand former supporters of capital punishment. For example, Justice \nO'Connor recently said there were ``serious questions'' about whether \nthe death penalty is fairly administered in the United States, and \nadded: ``[T]he system may well be allowing some innocent defendants to \nbe executed.'' In response to this uncertainty, Judge Pryor offers us \nnothing but his obstinate view that there is no problem with the \napplication of the death penalty. This is a position that is not likely \nto afford a fair hearing to a defendant on death row.\n  Judge Pryor's troubling views on the criminal justice system are not \nlimited to capital punishment. He has advocated that counsel need not \nbe provided to indigent defendants charged with an offense that carries \na sentence of imprisonment if the offense is classified as a \nmisdemeanor. The Supreme Court nonetheless ruled that it was a \nviolation of the Sixth Amendment to impose a sentence that included a \npossibility of imprisonment if indigent persons were not afforded \ncounsel.\n  Judge Pryor is overwhelmingly hostile to a woman's right to choose. \nThere is every indication from his record and statements that he is \ncommitted to reversing Roe v. Wade. Judge Pryor describes the Supreme \nCourt's decision in Roe v. Wade as the creation ``out of thin air [of] \na constitutional right,'' and opposes abortion even in cases of rape or \nincest.\n  Judge Pryor does not believe Roe is sound law, neither does he give \ncredence to Planned Parenthood v. Casey. He has said that ``Roe is not \nconstitutional law,'' and that in Casey, ``the court preserved the \nworst abomination of constitutional law in our history.'' When Judge \nPryor appeared before the Committee, he repeated the mantra suggested \nby White House coaches that he would ``follow the law.'' But his \nwillingness to circumvent established Supreme Court precedent that \nprotects fundamental privacy rights seems much more likely.\n  Judge Pryor has expressed his opposition to fair treatment of all \npeople regardless of their sexual orientation. The positions he took in \na brief he filed in the Supreme Court case of Lawrence v. Texas were \nentirely repudiated by the Supreme Court majority two years ago when it \ndeclared that: ``The petitioners are entitled to respect for their \nprivate lives. The State cannot demean their existence or control their \ndestiny by making their private conduct a crime.'' Judge Pryor's view \nis the opposite. He would deny certain Americans the equal protection \nof the laws, and would subject the most private of their behaviors to \npublic regulation.\n\n  Capping Judge Pryor's record of extreme activism were sworn \nstatements made by former Alabama Governor Fob James and his son, both \nRepublicans, explaining that Judge Pryor was only chosen by James to be \nthe State's Attorney General after promising that he would defy court \norders, up through and including orders of the Supreme Court of the \nUnited States. In sworn affidavits, Governor James and his son recount \nhow Pryor persuaded them he was right for the job by showing them \nresearch papers he had supervised in law school about \n``nonacquiesence'' to court orders. Indeed, under penalty of perjury, \nthe former Republican Governor and his son say that Judge Pryor's \nposition on defying court orders changed only when he decided he wanted \nto be a Federal judge.\n  If true, this information, consistent with the activism and extremism \npresent elsewhere in Judge Pryor's record, is revealing. To think that \nthis\n\n[[Page S6282]]\n\nman would come before the Senate after having made a promise like \nthat--to undermine the very basis of our legal system--and ask to be \nconfirmed to a lifetime position on the Federal bench, is beyond \nbelief.\n  Indeed, William Pryor's activism has often transcended judicial \nphilosophy and entered the realm of pure partisan politics to the point \nwhere it appeared political concerns openly affected his legal views. \nAs Attorney General of Alabama, Pryor was one of the founders of the \nRepublican Attorneys General Association, or RAGA, an organization \nwhich raised money from corporations for Republican candidates for \nstate Attorney General positions. Before RAGA was founded, Attorney \nGeneral candidates usually shied away from corporate fundraising \nbecause of the potential for conflicts of interest with an Attorney \nGeneral's duty to go after any corporate wrongdoing.\n  But William Pryor not only ignored the tradition of keeping Attorney \nGeneral's races above politics, he embraced with both hands the mixing \nof law and politics. He spoke out, vocally and often, against state \nattorneys general bringing aggressive cases against the tobacco \nindustry, the gun industry, and other corporate interests. And then \nRAGA, Pryor's organization, raised money for attorney general campaigns \nfrom these very industries and others like them that hoped to avoid \nlawsuits and prosecution. Pryor's philosophy of opposing mainstream \ngovernment regulation of corporations advanced his politics and his \norganization's fundraising, and his political interests in turn \ninformed his pro-corporation legal philosophy. Curiously, when asked \nabout RAGA at his hearing, Mr. Pryor could remember very little about \nthe organization or his role in it.\n  His partisan, political worldview colors the way he thinks about the \nrole of the courts as well. He ended one speech with the prayer, \n``Please God, no more Souters!''--a slap at a Supreme Court Justice \nseen by some as insufficiently conservative. And he said he was pleased \nthe Court's vote in Bush v. Gore was a 5-4 split because that vote \nwould give President Bush ``a full appreciation of the judiciary and \njudicial selection;'' in other words, it would show the president that \nhe needed to appoint partisan conservatives to the bench. These are the \nsentiments of an activist and a politician. They are not the considered \ndeliberations that all of us, as Republican or Democrat would expect \nfrom an impartial judge.\n\n  On a full slate of issues--the environment, voting rights, women's \nrights, gay rights, federalism, and more--William Pryor's record of \nactivism and advocacy is clear. That is his right as an American \ncitizen, but it does not make him qualified to be a judge. As a judge, \nit is his duty impartially to hear and weigh the evidence and to impart \njust and fair decisions to all who come before the court. In their \nhands, we entrust to the judges in our independent Federal judiciary \nthe rights that all of us are entitled to enjoy through our birthright \nas Americans.\n  Judge Pryor's time on the Eleventh Circuit brings out the very \nproblem with recess appointments of controversial judges. The \nConstitution sets out that Article III judges receive lifetime \nappointments precisely so that they can be independent. Judge Pryor, in \ncontrast, cannot be independent during the pendency of his recess \nappointment because he is dependent on the Senate for confirmation to a \nlifetime position. He is, in essence, trying out for the job. \nAccordingly, the opinions he writes while temporarily on the court are \nnot much of a predictor for what he would do if he did receive a \nlifetime appointment and became truly independent.\n  What is a good predictor for what he would do as a permanent Eleventh \nCircuit judge? Quite simply, his actions and statements in the many \nyears of his professional life before he was appointed provide the best \ninsight. And these actions and statements paint a clear and consistent \npicture of a judicial activist whose extreme views place him far \noutside the mainstream. A year of self-serving restraint does little to \nalter this picture.\n  The President has said he is against what he calls ``judicial \nactivism.'' How ironic, then, that he has chosen several of the most \ncommitted and opinionated judicial activists ever to be nominated to \nour courts.\n  The question posed by this controversial nomination is not whether \nJudge Pryor is a skilled and capable politician and advocate. He \ncertainly is. The question is whether--not for a two-year term but for \na lifetime--he would be a fair and impartial judge. Could every person \nwhose rights or whose life, liberty or livelihood were at issue before \nhis court, have faith in being fairly heard? Could every person rightly \nhave faith in receiving a just verdict, a verdict not swayed by or \nyoked to the legal philosophy of a self-described legal crusader? To \nsee Judge Pryor's record and his extreme views about the law is to see \nthe stark answer to that question.\n  I oppose giving Judge Pryor a lifetime appointment to the Eleventh \nCircuit where he can impose his radical activist vision on the many \npeople whose lives and disputes come before him. I believe the \nPresident owes them a nominee who can unite the American people.\n  Mr. President, I believe my time has expired.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Under the previous order, the time until 4 o'clock is under the \ncontrol of the majority leader.\n  The Senator from Alabama is recognized.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, it is a great honor for me to stand in \nthis great Senate Chamber to share a few thoughts about my friend, one \nof the best lawyers I have ever known, now Judge Bill Pryor, serving on \nthe Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals, to speak in favor of his \nconfirmation.\n  He is principled. He is highly intelligent. He is committed to doing \nthe right thing. He has won the support, respect, friendship, and \nadmiration of people on both sides of the aisle--African Americans, \nWhites, Democrats--throughout our State of Alabama. He has virtually \nunanimous support among those groups, and he has earned that by his \nprincipled approach to being attorney general, his love and respect for \nthe law, his courageous commitment to doing the right thing.\n  He has views about the law and public policy in America, and he \nexpresses those, but he absolutely understands that there is a \ndifference between advocacy and being on a bench and having to judge, \nthat you are not then an advocate, you are a referee, you are a judge, \na person who is supposed to fairly and objectively decide how the \ndispute should be settled. He understands that totally. That is true \nwith most good lawyers in America, but I think he understands it more \nthan even most good lawyers. Most good lawyers have been good \nadvocates, and they have become good judges. Certainly we understand \nthat.\n  Criticism has been raised against him that is painful to me. I think \nmuch of it is a result of misinformation. For example, my colleague \nfrom Iowa, who is such a champion of the disabled, always is a champion \nof the interests of the disabled, suggested that Bill Pryor is not a \nbeliever in rights for the disabled because in a disabilities act that \nwas passed by this Congress it allowed people to sue their employers \nfor back pay, for injunction, and for damages if they were wronged by \nan employer. But the Congress never thought at that time what it meant \nif it involved a State.\n  Three percent of the people in Alabama work for the State of Alabama. \nHe understood, as a skilled constitutional lawyer, that the Congress \nwould have then undertaken, if the law was to be interpreted so that \ndamages could be rendered against the State, to wipe out the doctrine \nof sovereign immunity. That is a doctrine that prohibits States from \nbeing sued for money damages. He said, yes, the employee can get the \njob back, yes, the employee can receive back pay if they were \ndiscriminated in any way as a result of that disability, but they \ncannot, in a case against the State of Alabama or any State, get money \ndamages because that violates the constitutional principle of sovereign \nimmunity.\n\n[[Page S6283]]\n\n  He took that to the Supreme Court and won. Nobody in Alabama or \nanywhere else who knows anything about disabilities would think this \nrepresented an action by him to harm the disabled. It was simply to \nclarify this important principle as to what power the Congress has \nunder these kinds of legislation to wipe out the traditional historic \nright of a State under sovereign immunity.\n  That is how these issues become confused. That is what hurts me about \nthis debate process. So often nominees are accused of things based on \nresults or maybe outcome of any one given case, and they are said to be \nagainst poor people or against education or against the disabled.\n  I will offer for the Record an editorial from the Mobile Press that \ntotally analyzes the complaints and allegations that were raised by \nSenator Kennedy about fundraising for the Attorney Generals \nAssociation. It completely refutes those allegations. We had a full \nlook at it. I think everybody who was involved in the Judiciary \nCommittee and the staff people who made lots of phone calls found there \nwas absolutely nothing to show any wrongdoing.\n  How do we decide what a good person is or a good nominee is? I do not \nknow. You may know them and respect them personally. You have seen \ntheir integrity and their courage in trying to do the right thing \ndaily. What do others say who may have a different political \nphilosophy? Let me read a letter from Alvin Holmes, a member of the \nState House of Alabama.\n  I see the majority leader here. I will be willing to yield to him or \ntake a couple minutes, if he allows me.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, we will start voting about 4. If I can \nstart in a couple minutes, that will be good.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I will state what Representative Alvin \nHolmes said. He is an African American. He starts off saying:\n\n       Please accept this as my full support and endorsement of \n     Alabama's Attorney General Bill Pryor to the United States \n     Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit.\n       I am a black member of the Alabama House of Representatives \n     having serving for 28 years. During my service . . . I have \n     led most of the fights for civil rights of blacks, women, \n     lesbians and gays and other minorities.\n\n  He lists seven different points where Attorney General Bill Pryor has \nstood up for minority rights and African-American rights in the State, \nincluding a mentor program where he for 3 years worked every week \nreading as a tutor to Black children.\n  He goes on to note a number of points. He finally concludes this way:\n\n       Finally, as one of the key civil rights leaders in Alabama \n     who has participated in basically every major civil rights \n     demonstration in America, who has been arrested for civil \n     rights causes on many occasions, as one who was a field staff \n     member of Dr. Martin Luther King's SCLC, as one who has been \n     brutally beaten by vicious police officers for participating \n     in civil rights marches and demonstrations, as one who has \n     had crosses burned in his yard by the KKK . . . as one who \n     has lived under constant threats day in and day out because \n     of his [stands] . . . I request your swift confirmation of \n     Bill Pryor to the 11th Circuit because of his constant \n     efforts to help the causes of blacks in Alabama.\n\n  Bill Pryor has the support of every Democratic official in the State, \nthe top African-American leaders, the people of Alabama. They know him \nand respect him to an extraordinary degree.\n  I am pleased to now yield the floor. I see the majority leader is \nhere.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cornyn). The majority leader.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I thank my distinguished colleague from \nAlabama for his leadership. I mentioned to him yesterday it was just a \nfew weeks ago that it was uncertain whether we would ever reach this \nmoment--about 3\\1/2\\ weeks ago and I remember the conversation. We \ncommitted to have an up-or-down vote, whatever it took. Indeed, I am \ndelighted to say that in a few moments we will vote up or down on \nWilliam Pryor's nomination to serve on the Eleventh Circuit Court of \nAppeals. This body will be allowed that opportunity to give Judge Pryor \nwhat he deserves, and that is the respect of an up-or-down vote.\n  He was first nominated to the Federal bench on April 9, 2003, over 2 \nyears ago. So it has been a long time coming. That wait is almost over. \nIt will be over in about 6 or 7 minutes. The partisan charges and \nobstruction leveled against him are going to be brought to a close. \nSoon William Pryor will get the fairness and the respect he deserves \nwith that vote.\n  Judge Pryor's experience and achievements in the legal profession \nhave prepared him well to serve on the Federal bench. He graduated \nmagna cum laude from Tulane University School of Law where he served as \neditor in chief of the Law Review.\n  He began his legal career as a law clerk for a legendary civil rights \nadvocate, the late Judge John Minor Wisdom of the U.S. Court of Appeals \nfor the Fifth Circuit.\n  While practicing law at two of Alabama's most prestigious firms, \nJudge Pryor also taught several years as adjunct professor at Samford \nUniversity's Cumberland School of Law.\n  Later he served as deputy attorney general and then attorney general \nof Alabama. As attorney general, he was overwhelmingly reelected by the \npeople of Alabama in 2002.\n  Two years later, President Bush, in 2004, recess appointed Judge \nPryor to the Eleventh Circuit. During this time, Judge Pryor has served \nwith distinction. While on the appellate bench, many of Judge Pryor's \nopinions have been supported by judges appointed by both Democrats and \nRepublicans.\n  But this should not come as a surprise. His rulings as a Federal \njudge are entirely consistent with his past record. William Pryor \nbelieves in interpretation of the law, not rewriting the law according \nto his own political views.\n  He has an outstanding record on civil rights. Dr. Joe Reed, chairman \nof the African-American caucus for Alabama's Democratic Conference, \nsaid of Judge Pryor: He ``will uphold the law without fear or favor. I \nbelieve all races and colors will get a fair shake when their cases \ncome before him.''\n  Many other prominent African-American leaders have submitted letters \nof support for Judge Pryor praising him for his commitment to upholding \ncivil rights and equality for all Americans. It is simple. Those who \ncriticize Judge Pryor's record have not examined it with the care and \nrespect that every nominee's record deserves.\n\n  His record consistently proves his unwavering dedication to the \nprotection of individual liberties and his commitment to treating all \npeople fairly.\n  Further, those who study his record, as I have, know that Judge Pryor \nunderstands and appreciates the obligation of the judiciary branch to \ninterpret the law, not to write the law. He stated in his hearing \nbefore the Judiciary Committee the following:\n\n       I understand my obligation to follow the law, and I have a \n     record of doing it. You don't have to take my word that I \n     will follow the law. You can look at my record as Attorney \n     General and see where I have done it.\n\n  It has been over 2 years since the President sent William Pryor's \nnomination to the Senate. In that time, he has endured a hearing before \nthe Senate Judiciary Committee lasting 4 hours where he answered over \n185 questions.\n  Judge Pryor answered another 45 written questions from Senators and \nsubmitted over 26 pages in response.\n  On two separate occasions, his nomination has been favorably voted \nout of the Judiciary Committee, consuming another 4 hours of debate.\n  Two times his nomination has come to the Senate floor for a cloture \nvote, and twice the motion to invoke cloture failed because of partisan \nobstruction.\n  But that day is over. During the last 2 days, we have continued to \ndebate the nomination of Judge Pryor, and now it is time to give him \nthat long overdue vote. With the confirmation of Justice Owen and \nJustice Brown, and the upcoming vote on Judge Pryor, the Senate does \ncontinue to make good progress, placing principle before partisan \npolitics and results before rhetoric.\n  I hope and I know we will continue working together. As the debate on \njudicial nominees has shown, we can disagree on whether individual \nnominees deserve confirmation, but we can all agree on the principle \nthat each nominee deserves a fair up-or-down vote.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting the confirmation of \nJudge William H. Pryor.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n\n[[Page S6284]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  Under the previous order, the hour of 4 o'clock having arrived, the \nquestion is, Will the Senate advise and consent to the nomination of \nWilliam H.

McKEAGUE TO BE UNITED STATES CIRCUIT JUDGE FOR \n                           THE SIXTH CIRCUIT\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the next two nominations \nen bloc.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read the nominations of Richard A. \nGriffin, of Michigan, to be United States Circuit Judge for the Sixth \nCircuit, and David W. McKeague, of Michigan, to be United States \nCircuit Judge for the Sixth Circuit.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I rise this afternoon in support of the \nnominations of Judge David McKeague and Judge Richard Griffin to the \nSixth Circuit Court.\n  For some time now, Senator Levin and I have been proposing the Senate \nmove forward on these nominees as part of a good-faith effort for us to \nbe working together in a bipartisan way in the Senate. I am pleased we \nare now to vote on the nomination of Judge Griffin and Judge McKeague \nas a result of the bipartisan agreement to move forward and stop what \nwas called the nuclear option, which would have eliminated the checks \nand balances in the Senate. It is my hope this bipartisan agreement \nwill help restore comity and civility in our very important Chamber.\n  I will say a few words about these two nominees. Judge Richard \nGriffin is a lifelong resident of Michigan. He would be the first \nnominee to the Sixth Circuit from Traverse City, MI. He has had a \ndistinguished career both as an attorney and as a State appeals judge. \nHe has served on the Michigan Court of Appeals for over 16 years and \nhas been rated as ``well-qualified'' by the American Bar Association.\n  Judge David McKeague is also a lifelong resident of Michigan. He \nwould be the first nominee from my home of Lansing, MI, to the Sixth \nCircuit. Judge McKeague has also had a distinguished career as an \nattorney, a law professor, and a Federal judge. He served on the U.S. \nDistrict Court for the Western District of Michigan for over 12 years \nand has been rated ``well-qualified'' by the American Bar Association.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me and Senator Levin in supporting the \nnomination of Judge Griffin and Judge McKeague. It is important for us \nto move forward.\n  I hope confirming the Sixth Circuit nominees before the Senate will \nhelp restore comity and civility to the judicial nominations process. \nWe have a constitutional obligation to advise and consent on Federal \njudicial nominees. This is a responsibility I take extremely seriously, \nas I know my colleagues do on both sides of the aisle. These are not \ndecisions that will affect our courts for three or four years, but for \n30 or 40 years, making it even more important for the Senate not to act \nas a rubberstamp.\n  This is the third branch of government and it is important we move \nforward in a positive way and be able to work with the White House on \nnominees who will reflect balance and reflect a mainstream approach for \nour independent judiciary.\n  I hope the White House will begin working with the Senate in a more \nbipartisan and inclusive manner on judicial nominations. I look forward \nto working with the White House on any future Michigan nominees since \nit is absolutely critical we work together in filling these positions.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chafee). The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I am supporting the two nominations before \nthe Senate.\n  With today's confirmation of William Pryor, 211 of 218 of President \nBush's judicial nominees have been confirmed. After Richard Griffin's \nand David McKeague's upcoming confirmation, 213 of 218 of President \nBush's nominees will have been confirmed. What a contrast to the way \nthat President Clinton's nominees were treated. More than 60 of \nPresident Clinton's nominees never received a vote in the Judiciary \nCommittee. In the battles over judicial nominations that have consumed \nthis body in recent years, the way those nominees were treated stands \nout as uniquely unfair. Even then-White House Counsel Alberto Gonzales \nacknowledged that treatment of President Clinton's nominees was \n``inexcusable.''\n  For the last 4 years of the Clinton Presidency, there were Michigan \nvacancies on the Sixth Circuit court. The Republican majority refused \nto hold hearings in the Judiciary Committee on Clinton nominations for \nthose vacancies. Indeed, one of those nominees waited longer for a \nhearing in the Senate Judiciary Committee than any nominee in American \nhistory had--a hearing she ultimately never received.\n  Her nomination was held up for some time by former Senator Spencer \nAbraham in an attempt to secure the nomination of his preferred \ncandidate to a second position. Then, the seats were kept vacant \nbecause the majority hoped that a Republican would be elected President \nand would put forward his nominees for those vacancies. When President \nBush came to office, he not only filled positions which should have \nbeen filled by nominees of President Clinton, his nominees were allowed \nto go forward even over the objections of their home state senators.\n  Today, we will confirm two of President Bush's Michigan nominees to \nthe Sixth Circuit Court. They should be confirmed and I will vote for \nthem. In deciding to move on, we should not excuse the treatment of \nPresident Clinton's nominees or the refusal of President Bush to adopt \na bipartisan solution to the acknowledged wrong. A brief history of the \nMichigan vacancies on the Sixth Circuit will also hopefully prevent a \nrecurrence of the tactic which was used against Clinton nominees--\ndenial of a hearing in the Judiciary Committee, year after year--not \njust in the last year of a presidential term but in the years before \nthe last year of a presidential term.\n  Michigan Court of Appeals Judge Helene White was nominated to fill a\n\n[[Page S6285]]\n\nSixth Circuit vacancy on January 7, 1997. Some months later, Senator \nLeahy, as ranking member of the Judiciary Committee, came to this floor \nto urge that the Committee act on her nomination. This would be the \nfirst of at least sixteen statements on the Senate floor by Senator \nLeahy regarding the Sixth Circuit nominations over a 4 year period.\n  A year and a half after Judge White was nominated--Senator Leahy came \nto the floor and said: ``At each step of the process, judicial \nnominations are being delayed and stalled.'' His plea was again ignored \nand the 105th Congress ended without a hearing for Judge White.\n  On January 26, 1999, President Clinton again submitted Judge White's \nnomination. That day, I urged both Senator Abraham and Chairman Hatch \nto recognize that fundamental fairness dictated that she receive an \nearly hearing in the 106th Congress, having received no hearing in the \n105th.\n  On March 1, 1999, a second Michigan vacancy on the Sixth Circuit \nopened up. The next day, Senator Leahy returned to the floor, \nreiterated that nominations were being stalled by the majority.\n  The reason that the majority in the Judiciary Committee did not hold \na hearing on Judge White was because of Senator Abraham's opposition, \nbased on his effort to obtain the nomination of Jerry Rosen, a district \ncourt judge in the Eastern District of Michigan, to the second Michigan \nopening on the Sixth Circuit. President Clinton, however, in September \nof 1999, decided to nominate Kathleen McCree Lewis to that seat.\n  Soon thereafter, I spoke with Senator Abraham about the Lewis and \nWhite nominations, Senator Leahy again urged the Committee to act, \ncalling the treatment of judicial nominees ``unconscionable.''\n  On November 18, 1999, I again urged Senator Abraham and Chairman \nHatch to proceed with hearings for the two Michigan nominees. At that \ntime I noted that Judge White had been waiting for nearly 3 years and \nthat the confirmation of the two women was ``essential for fundamental \nfairness.'' 1999 ended without Judiciary Committee hearings.\n  In February of 2000 Senator Leahy spoke again on the Senate floor \nabout the multiple vacancies on the Sixth Circuit. Less than two weeks \nlater, I again made a personal plea to Senator Abraham and Chairman \nHatch to grant a hearing to the Michigan nominees.\n  On March 20, 2000, the chief judge of the Sixth Circuit sent a letter \nto Chairman Hatch expressing concerns about a reported statement from a \nmember of the Judiciary Committee that ``due to partisan \nconsiderations'' there would be no more hearings or votes on vacancies \nfor the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals during the Clinton \nadministration. His concern would turn out to be well founded.\n  On May 2, 2000, I sent a note to Chairman Hatch, but neither Judge \nWhite's nor Ms. Lewis's nominations were placed on the Committee's \nhearing agenda. Over the next several months, Senator Leahy went to the \nfloor ten more times to urge action on the Michigan nominees. I also \nraised the issue on the Senate floor on several occasions.\n\n  In the fall of 2000, in a final attempt to move the nominations of \nthe two Michigan nominees, I met with Majority Leader Lott to discuss \nthe situation. On September 12, I sent him a letter saying ``the \nnominees from Michigan are women of integrity and fairness. They have \nbeen stalled in this Senate for an unconscionable amount of time \nwithout any stated reason.'' Neither the meeting with Senator Lott nor \nthe letter prompted the Judiciary Committee to act on the nominations, \nand the 106th Congress ended without hearings for either woman.\n  By this point, Judge White's nomination had been pending for nearly 4 \nyears--the longest period of time that any circuit court nominee had \nwaited for a hearing in the history of the United States Senate. Ms. \nLewis's nomination had been pending for about a year and a half.\n  The experience of Kent Markus of Ohio will shed some light on these \nevents. Professor Markus was nominated by President Clinton in February \nof 2000, to fill an Ohio vacancy on the sixth Circuit. Both home state \nsenators indicated their approval of his nomination. Nevertheless, he \nwas not granted a Judiciary Committee hearing. In his testimony before \nthe Judiciary Committee, Professor Markus recollected the events:\n\n     ``. . . To their credit, Senator DeWine and his staff and \n     Senator Hatch's staff and others close to him were straight \n     with me. Over and over again they told me two things:\n       (1) There will be no more confirmations to the 6th Circuit \n     during the Clinton Administration, and\n       (2) This has nothing to do with you; don't take it \n     personally--it doesn't matter who the nominee is, what \n     credentials they may have or what support they may have.\n\n  And Professor Markus continued:\n\n     ``. . . On one occasion, Senator DeWine told me ``This is \n     bigger than you and it's bigger than me.'' Senator Kohl, who \n     had kindly agreed to champion my nomination within the \n     Judiciary Committee, encountered a similar brick wall . . . \n     The fact was, a decision had been made to hold the vacancies \n     and see who won the presidential election. With a Bush win, \n     all those seats could go to Bush rather than Clinton \n     nominees.\n\n  The logic of it was quite straightforward, and unfair.\n  Senator Stabenow and I are not alone in our view that what occurred \nwith respect to the Michigan nominees was fundamentally unfair. As I \nsaid, even Judge Gonzales, then-White House Counsel, has acknowledged \nthat the treatment of some nominees during the Clinton administration \nwas ``inexcusable.''\n  Given that belief, Senator Stabenow and I had hoped that the Bush \nadministration might consider a bipartisan approach and believed that \nsimply moving forward with Bush nominees would mean the unfair tactic \nused against the Clinton nominees would succeed.\n  The number of Michigan vacancies on the federal courts provided an \nunusual opportunity for bipartisan compromise. In an effort to achieve \na fair resolution of the mistreatment of President Clinton's Michigan \nnominees, Senator Stabenow and I proposed a bipartisan commission to \nrecommend nominees to the President for two of the then-four open \nMichigan Sixth Circuit positions. Similar commissions have successfully \nbeen used in other states. Such a commission would not guarantee the \nrecommendation of any particular individual, much less the nomination \nof any particular individual, since the nomination decision is the \nPresident's alone. That proposal was rejected. The administration \nrejected another proposal to resolve the matter suggested by Senator \nLeahy and endorsed by then-Republican Governor John Engler.\n  In the hopes of stimulating a bipartisan response, Senator Stabenow \nand I returned negative blue slips on President Bush's nominees. \nDespite past practice of not proceeding in the face of negative blue \nslips from home state Senators, the Judiciary Committee held hearings \non the nominees.\n  In 1999, Chairman Hatch had stated, with respect to the Clinton \nnomination of Judge Ronnie White, ``had both home-State Senators been \nopposed to Judge (Ronnie) White in committee, [he] would never have \ncome to the floor under our rules, [and] that would be true whether \nthey are Democrat Senators or Republican Senators. That has just been \nthe way the Judiciary Committee has operated . . .''\n  During the entire Clinton Presidency, it is my understanding that not \na single judicial nominee got a Judiciary Committee hearing if there \nwas opposition by one home-state Senator, let alone two. In our case, \nboth home-state Senators opposed proceeding with President Bush's \nMichigan judicial nominees absent a bipartisan approach, but the \nCommittee held hearings anyway.\n  So, the unreturned blue slips of one Republican Senator was enough to \nblock Judiciary Committee consideration of two nominees by a Democratic \nPresident. But despite negative blue slips of both home State \nDemocratic Senators, hearings were held for Sixth Circuit nominations \nof President Bush. That is inconsistent and unfair.\n\n  Mr. President, each of us who was here during that time knows what \nhappened to President Clinton's Michigan nominees to the Sixth Circuit \nwas unfair. Senator Hatch said it accurately, and I give him credit for \nputting it just this way when, in July of 2004, he said the following:\n\n       The two senators from Michigan have been very upset and if \n     I'd put myself in their shoes I'd feel the same way.\n\n\n[[Page S6286]]\n\n\n  Well, it is time, however, to move on. And we support moving on with \nthese two nominations and hope that in doing so, it might produce some \nbipartisanship and compromise. But bipartisanship cannot just be a one-\nway street. It requires reciprocity.\n  In closing, I thank the many Senators who worked for a bipartisan \napproach to the Michigan nominees. In particular, I thank Senator Harry \nReid, who, like Senator Daschle before him, got personally involved and \ntried to achieve a compromise. I thank Senator Leahy for his \nextraordinary efforts over the many years. I cannot tell you how many \ntimes he came to the Senate floor to make a statement. I thank him for \nhis efforts personally to try to resolve this matter. I also thank \nSenator Specter, who has recently provided some bipartisan suggestions \nto the White House.\n  With that, Mr. President, I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cornyn). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, President George W. Bush first nominated \nJudge Richard Allen Griffin to the Sixth Circuit on June 26, 2002.\n  During the 108th Congress, on June 16, 2004, the committee held a \nhearing on the nomination of Judge Griffin. He was successfully voted \nout of committee on July 20, 2004.\n  Judge Griffin is a judge of the Michigan Court of Appeals currently \nserving his 16th year on the court.\n  Judge Griffin is an outstanding and highly qualified candidate.\n  After graduating magna cum laude from Western Michigan University \nHonors College, Judge Griffin received his juris doctor from the \nUniversity of Michigan Law School in 1977.\n  Upon graduating from law school, Judge Griffin clerked for the \nHonorable Washtenaw Circuit Judge Ross W. Campbell. He then became an \nassociate and eventual partner at Coulter Cunningham, Davison & Read.\n  In 1985, Judge Griffin started his own firm, Read & Griffin, where he \npracticed a broad range of litigation, including automobile negligence, \npremises liability, products liability, and employment law. Judge \nGriffin engaged in both plaintiff and defense personal injury \nlitigation.\n  During this time, Judge Griffin also provided pro bono legal services \nas a volunteer counselor and attorney with the Third Level Crisis \nClinic.\n  In 1989, Judge Griffin successfully ran for the Michigan Court of \nAppeals. He was reelected to retain his seat in 1996, and again in \n2002.\n  The American Bar Association rated Judge Griffin ``Well-Qualified'' \nfor appointment to the Sixth Circuit.\n  Judge Griffin has engaged in numerous noteworthy activities. In \naddition to his duties on the Michigan Court of Appeals, Judge Griffin \nalso devotes a significant amount of time to volunteer activities. \nJudge Griffin has served as president of the Grant Traverse Zoological \nSociety since 1987. He also has served as chief judge of the YMCA Youth \nin Government Mock Trial Program since 1997.\n  Judge Griffin has widespread support.\n  Gerald Ford, 38th President of the United States, said:\n\n       I can say with conviction that Judge Griffin is a person of \n     the highest quality character. As the record shows, he has \n     been a very excellent Judge with unquestioned integrity.\n  Maura D. Corrigan, chief justice, Michigan Supreme Court, said:\n\n       Judge Griffin brings a depth of practical experience and a \n     grasp of real life problems to the decisions of cases . . . \n     Richard Allen Griffin is a man of integrity and probity who \n     is fully capable of discharging the duty of protecting our \n     Constitution and laws. He is deserving of the public trust as \n     he has already proven himself worthy of that trust during his \n     years of service to the State of Michigan.\n\n  William C. Whitbeck, chief judge, Michigan Court of Appeals, said:\n\n       [T]here is no question that the United States Senate should \n     promptly confirm Judge Griffin for the position on the Sixth \n     Circuit . . . He is a decisive, scholarly judge with an \n     instinct for the core issues and with a flair for authoring \n     crisp, understandable opinions.\n\n  Stephen L. Borrello, judge, Michigan Court of Appeals, said:\n\n       Judge Griffin possesses a rare trait amongst my colleagues: \n     an intrinsic sense of justice. His innate fairness is \n     combined with a rigorous work ethic and a thorough grasp of \n     legal issues. Judge Griffin is one of the finest jurists in \n     this State.\n\n  Mr. President, Judge David McKeague was originally nominated by \nPresident George W. Bush on November 8, 2001, and was renominated by \nthe President on February 14, 2005. He received a hearing on June 16, \n2004, and was voted out of the Judiciary Committee on July 20, 2004.\n  Judge McKeague is extremely well qualified to sit on the Court of \nAppeals for the Sixth Circuit. Judge McKeague has a B.A. from the \nUniversity of Michigan and a J.D. from the University of Michigan Law \nSchool. Upon his graduation from law school, he joined the law firm of \nFoster, Swift, Collins & Smith, P.C., in Lansing, MI, and was elected a \nshareholder and director of the firm. Judge McKeague served on the \nfirm's Executive Committee in various offices, and was chairman of the \nfirm's Government and Commerce Department, for many years before his \nconfirmation to the Federal bench in 1992.\n  Since February 1992, Judge McKeague has served as a judge on the U.S. \nDistrict Court for the Western District of Michigan. Judge McKeague has \nregularly participated by designation on, and authorized appellate \nopinions for, panels of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth \nCircuit. The American Bar Association has rated Judge McKeague as \nunanimously ``well-qualified'' for appointment to the Sixth Circuit.\n  Judge McKeague is an active member of the community and several \nprofessional associations. Judge McKeague has been active as a member \nof several community, local, and professional organizations, including \nthe Judicial Conference of the United States, the Federal Judicial \nCenter, the Michigan State and Ingham County bar associations. Both \nwhile in private practice and while on the Federal bench, Judge \nMcKeague has directed and participated in numerous seminars, moot court \ncompetitions, and trial advocacy programs at high schools, universities \nand law schools throughout Michigan.\n  Prior to his confirmation to the Federal bench, he served 6 years in \nthe U.S. Army Reserve. Since 1998, he has also served as an adjunct \nprofessor of law at Michigan State University's Detroit College of Law, \nwhere he teaches Federal Jurisdiction and Trial Advocacy.\n  Judge McKeague has the support of many attorneys and peers in \nMichigan, including several Democrats.\n  John H. Logie, attorney and Mayor of Grand Rapids, said:\n\n       What emerged from our mutual experiences was a deep \n     admiration for Judge McKeague's concerns both with the \n     processes of the court and with their impact on people. If \n     these are matters that we want out appellate judges to have \n     in equal measure, then I can and do assure you that he will \n     be an excellent choice.\n\n  Paul D. Borman, U.S. District Judge for the Eastern District of \nMichigan, said:\n\n       I have known Judge McKeague for seven years and I can vouch \n     for his intelligence, hard work, and commitment to equal \n     protection under the law.\n\n  Randall S. Levine, attorney and life-long Democrat, said:\n\n       Judge McKeague is extremely intelligence, possesses a sharp \n     wit and keen intellect . . . His integrity is beyond \n     reproach.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, as we debate the nominations of Richard \nGriffin and David McKeague to the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals, and \nmove on to their almost certain confirmation, I believe we must \nacknowledge the cooperation and statesmanship of the two Senators from \nMichigan who have compromised a great deal in order to contribute to \nthe preservation of the rules and traditions of the Senate. Senator \nLevin and Senator Stabenow have spent much of the last 4 years trying \nto persuade the President to fulfill his constitutional duty and \nconsult with them on his Michigan appointments, to no avail. Because of \nthat lack of cooperation, combined with the shameful treatment given to \nPresident Clinton's nominees, the Michigan Senators exercised their \nright as home State Senators to withhold their consent to the \nnominations of candidates chosen without consultation to the Sixth \nCircuit.\n\n[[Page S6287]]\n\n  The Michigan Senators had the support of other Senators. Nonetheless, \nthe Michigan Senators, with grace and dedication to this institution, \nwithdrew their opposition to three of those nominees as part of the \ndiscussions related to averting the nuclear option. Because of their \nwillingness to go forward, we are here today debating and voting upon \nthe confirmation of two nominees to the Sixth Circuit despite a lack of \nconsultation by President Bush and a complete disregard for the history \nof this court.\n  First, it is essential to explain what a significant break with \nprecedent it was that these two nominees were even given a hearing in \nthe last Congress without the support of either of their home State \nSenators. The scheduling of that hearing was another example of the \ndownward spiral the committee traveled over the last 2 years, when we \nwitnessed rule after rule broken or misinterpreted away.\n  The list is long. From the way that home State Senators were treated \nto the way hearings were scheduled, to the way the committee \nquestionnaire was altered, to the way our committee's historic \nprotection of the minority by committee rule IV was violated; the \nRepublican leadership on the committee last Congress destroyed \nvirtually every custom and courtesy that had been available to help \ncreate and enforce cooperation and civility in the confirmation \nprocess.\n  The then-chairman of the committee crossed a critical line that he \nhad never before crossed when in June of 2003, he held a hearing for \nHenry Saad, another of the Michigan nominees to the Sixth Circuit, \nopposed by both of his home State Senators. It may have been the first \ntime any chairman and any Senate Judiciary Committee proceeded with a \nhearing on a judicial nominee over the objection of both home State \nSenators. It was certainly the only time in the last 50 years, and I \nknow it to be the only time during my 31 years in the Senate.\n  Having broken a longstanding practice of the Judiciary Committee \nfounded on respect for home State Senators, whether in the case of a \ndistrict or circuit court nominee, the committee's leadership did not \nhesitate to break it again and hold a hearing for Richard Griffin and \nDavid McKeague.\n  The Michigan Senators did not do what so many other Senators did when \nholding up more than 60 of President Clinton's nominees, and block them \nsilently. To the contrary, they came to the committee and articulated \ntheir very real grievances with the White House and their honest desire \nto work towards a bipartisan solution to the problems filling vacancies \nin the Sixth Circuit. We should have respected their views, as the \nviews of home State Senators have been respected for decades. I urged \nthe White House to work with them. I proposed reasonable solutions to \nthe impasse that the White House rejected. The Michigan Senators \nproposed reasonable solutions, including a bipartisan commission, but \nthe White House rejected every one.\n  Although President Bush promised on the campaign trail to be a uniter \nand not a divider, his practice once in office with respect to judicial \nnominees has been most divisive. Citing the remarks of a White House \nofficial, The Lansing State Journal reported that President Bush was \nsimply not interested in compromise on the existing vacancies in the \nState of Michigan. It is unfortunate that the White House was never \nwilling to work toward consensus with all Senators and on all courts. \nOver the last 4 years, time and again the good faith efforts of Senate \nDemocrats to repair the damage done to the judicial confirmation \nprocess over the previous six years were rejected. And time and again, \nthe rules were thrown by the wayside.\n  When Republicans chaired the Judiciary Committee and we were \nconsidering the nominations of a Democratic President, one negative \nblue slip from just one home State Senator was enough to doom a \nnomination and prevent a hearing on that nomination. This included all \nnominations, including those to the circuit courts. How else to explain \nthe failure to schedule hearings for such qualified and \nnoncontroversial nominees as James Beaty and James Wynn, African-\nAmerican nominees from North Carolina? What other reason could \nplausibly be found for what happened to the nominations of Enrique \nMoreno and Jorge Rangel--both Latino, both Harvard graduates, both \nhighly rated by the ABA, and both denied hearings in the Judiciary \nCommittee? There is no denying that was the rule during the previous \nDemocratic administration. There is no way around the conclusion that \nwith a Republican in the White House, the Republicans in the Senate \nhave found it politically expedient to change the rules and reverse \ntheir own practices time and again.\n  In all, more than 60 of President Clinton's judicial nominees and \nmore than 200 of his executive branch nominees were defeated in Senate \ncommittees through the enforcement of rules and precedents that the \nRepublican majority later found inconvenient--now that there is a \nRepublican in the White House. Indeed, among the more than 60 Clinton \njudicial nominees who the committee never considered there were more \nthan a few who were blocked despite positive blue slips from both home \nState Senators. So long as a Republican Senator had an objection, it \nappeared to be honored, whether that was Senator Helms of North \nCarolina objecting to an African-American nominee from Virginia or \nSenator Gorton of Washington objecting to nominees from California.\n\n  During the last Congress, the Judiciary Committee also took the \nunprecedented action of proceeding to a hearing on the nomination of \nCarolyn Kuhl to the Ninth Circuit over the objection of Senator Boxer. \nWhen the senior Senator from California announced her opposition to the \nnomination as well at the beginning of a Judiciary Committee business \nmeeting, I suggested to the chairman that further proceedings on that \nnomination ought to be carefully considered. I noted that he had never \nproceeded on a nomination opposed by both home State Senators once \ntheir opposition was known. Senator Feinstein likewise reminded the \nthen-chairman of his statements in connection with the nomination of \nRonnie White when he acknowledged that had he known both home Sstate \nSenators were opposed, he would never have proceeded. Nonetheless, in \none in a continuing series of changes of practice and position, the \ncommittee was required to proceed with the Kuhl nomination. A party-\nline vote was the result.\n  With the Saad nomination, the committee made a further profound \nchange in its practices. When a Democratic President was doing the \nnominating and Republican Senators were objecting, a single objection \nfrom a single home State Senator stalled the nomination. There was not \na single example of a single time that the committee went forward with \na hearing over the objection or negative blue slip of a single \nRepublican home State Senator during the Clinton administration. But \nonce a Republican President was doing the nominating, no amount of \nobjecting by Democratic Senators was sufficient. The committee overrode \nthe objection of one home State Senator with the Kuhl nomination. The \ncommittee overrode the objection of both home State Senators when a \nhearing and a vote was held on the Saad nomination, and once more by \nholding a hearing and vote for the two circuit court nominees we are \ndiscussing today.\n  I know it is frustrating that there have been unfilled vacancies on \nthe Sixth Circuit for so long. Many of us experienced worse frustration \nduring the Clinton years when good nominees were held up for no \ndiscernable reason--other than politics. During President Clinton's \nsecond term, the Republican Senate majority shut down the process of \nconfirmations to the Sixth Circuit entirely, and three outstanding \nnominees were not accorded hearings, committee consideration or Senate \nvotes. In fact, while there were numbers of vacancies on the Sixth \nCircuit and nominees for those vacancies, from November of 1997 there \nwas not a confirmation to that court until the confirmation of Julia \nSmith Gibbons while I was chairman on July 29, 2002, a span of nearly 5 \nyears. Not a single Sixth Circuit nominee was even given a hearing \nduring Republican control of the 106th Congress, and one of the \nnominees, Kent Marcus from Ohio, testified at a Judiciary subcommittee \nhearing in 2002 that he was told that he would not be confirmed despite \npublic support from his home State Senators. Republicans wanted to keep \nthe vacancies in\n\n[[Page S6288]]\n\ncase a Republican was elected President.\n  When I chaired the committee, we broke that impasse with the first \nSixth Circuit confirmation in those many years. I scheduled a hearing \nand a vote for Julia Smith Gibbons of Tennessee, who was confirmed \nshortly thereafter, and I did the same for John Rogers of Kentucky, who \nwas confirmed in November of 2002.\n  I know that around the time a Republican leadership staffer was found \nto have stolen confidential Democratic files there were outrageous \naccusations made that Judge Gibbons' confirmation was delayed to affect \na pending affirmative action case in some way. I have never considered \nthe outcome of any particular case when scheduling that or any other \nnominee for a hearing.\n  The facts of this nomination belie this scurrilous accusation. Judge \nGibbons was nominated to the Sixth Circuit in October 2001 but did not \nhave a completed file until November 15, shortly before the end of the \nfirst session of the 107th Congress. Before her paperwork was complete, \nthe Sixth Circuit panel assigned to the affirmative action cases had \nalready circulated a request for the full court to hear argument, and \non November 16, the Sixth Circuit ordered that the case to be argued to \nthe full court. The oral argument in that case took place after \nThanksgiving, on December 6.\n  Given the lateness of her nomination, her paperwork, and the year, \nGibbons could not realistically have expected a hearing, a committee \nvote and a confirmation vote to all have taken place in the 3 weeks \nbetween the time her paperwork was complete and the time the Sixth \nCircuit sat for the oral argument in that case and took a poll about \nthe outcome of that case. The ordinary practice is that only the judges \nwho are on the court at the time the court votes to hear the case ``en \nbanc'' can participate in the case, even if they retire. It is just \nunreasonable to contend that Judge Gibbons could have heard the \nDecember 6 argument in that case.\n  When we returned for the second session of the 107th Congress, I \nscheduled several hearings at the request of a number of different \nRepublican Senators. The first circuit court nominee to get a hearing \nwas Michael Melloy for the Eighth Circuit at Senator Grassley's \nrequest; followed by Judge Pickering, who was supported by Senator \nLott; then Judge D. Brooks Smith, for the Third Circuit, at Senator \nSpecter's request; then Terrence O'Brien, for the Eighth Circuit, at \nthe request of Senators Thomas and Enzi; and Jeffrey Howard, for the \nFirst Circuit, who was supported by Senator Bob Smith.\n  Once those hearings were completed, in the week of April 15, I \nscheduled a hearing for Judge Gibbons. Her hearing was held on April \n25. I listed her for a committee vote the very next week, and all of \nthe Democratic Senators joined in voting her out the same day, May 2. \nShe did not get an immediate floor vote due to a dispute between the \nWhite House and Senators over commissions, but she was ultimately \nconfirmed on July 29, 2002.\n  The Sixth Circuit issued its decision in the Michigan affirmative \naction case on May 14, 2002, which means the judges were already \nworking on the majority and dissenting opinions for weeks, likely even \nmonths, given the complexity of the case. The Supreme Court, where I \nthink we all knew the issue would finally be decided, accepted the \nappeal of the affirmative action decision later that year and issued \nits ruling on June 23, 2003.\n  To say that Democrats used their power to influence the Sixth Circuit \nin any case is demonstrably false. What is factually true is that from \nthe time the case against the University of Michigan case was filed in \nDistrict Court until the time I facilitated the confirmation of Judge \nGibbons, Republicans had successfully blocked any and all appointees to \nthat Circuit.\n  Even after the 107th Congress, Democrats continued to cooperate in \nfilling seats on the Sixth Circuit. Although many of us strongly \nopposed their nominations, we did not block the confirmations of two \nmore controversial judges to that court: Deborah Cook and Jeffrey \nSutton. With their confirmations, that brought us to a total of four \nSixth Circuit confirmations in 3 years as opposed to no confirmation in \nthe last 3 years of the Clinton administration. We cut Sixth Circuit \nvacancies in half. With cooperation from the White House, we could have \ndone even better.\n  The Republican Senate majority refused for over 4 years to consider \nPresident Clinton's well-qualified nominee, Helene White, to the Sixth \nCircuit. Judge White has served on the Michigan Court of Appeals with \nJudge Griffin since 1993, and, prior to her successful election to that \nseat, served for nearly 10 years as a trial judge, handling a wide \nrange of civil and criminal cases. She was first nominated by President \nClinton in January 1997, but the Republican-led Senate refused to act \non her nomination. She waited in vain for 1,454 days for a hearing, \nbefore President Bush withdrew her nomination in March 2001. It stands \nin contrast to the recent mantra from Republicans that every judicial \nnominee is entitled to an up-or-down vote.\n  President Clinton had also nominated Kathleen McCree Lewis. She is \nthe daughter of a former Solicitor General of the United States and a \nformer Sixth Circuit Judge. She was also passed over for hearings for \nyears. No effort was made to accord her consideration in the last 18 \nmonths of President Clinton's term. The Republican double standard \ndenied her the treatment they now demand for every Bush nominee.\n  Despite the flawed process that brought us here, the Michigan \nSenators understood that in recent weeks we found ourselves on the \nbrink of a terrible moment in the United States Senate when the \nmajority leader would break the rules to change the rules in order to \nachieve the President's goal of packing the courts. They understood the \nextreme tactics of the Republican majority. I applaud their sacrifice, \nand hope that the President was listening to the 14 other Senators who \nexpressly asked him in their memorandum of understanding on nominations \nto engage in real consultation with home State Senators. That is sound \nadvice.\n  In deference to the Michigan Senators, I will no longer oppose these \nconfirmations. Still, there are issues related to their records and \nviews that trouble me. I hope that they will be able to put any \nideologies or preconceptions aside and rule fairly in all cases.\n  As a judge on the Michigan Court of Appeals since 1989, Judge Griffin \nhas handled and written hundreds of opinions involving a range of civil \nand criminal law issues. Yet, a review of Judge Griffin's cases on the \nMichigan Court of Appeals raises concerns. He has not been shy about \ninterjecting his own personal views into some of his opinions, \nindicating that he may use the opportunity, once confirmed, to further \nhis own agenda when confronted with cases of first impression.\n  For example, in one troubling case involving the Americans with \nDisabilities Act--ADA--Doe v. Mich. Dep't of Corrections, Judge Griffin \nfollowed precedent and allowed the State disability claim of disabled \nprisoners to proceed, but wrote that, if precedent had allowed, he \nwould have dismissed those claims. Griffin authored the opinion in this \nclass action brought by current and former prisoners who alleged that \nthe Michigan Department of Corrections denied them certain benefits on \nthe basis of their HIV-positive status. Although Judge Griffin held \nthat the plaintiffs had stated a claim for relief, his opinion makes \nclear that he only ruled this way because he was bound to follow the \nprecedent established in a recent case decided by his Court. Moreover, \nhe went on to urge Congress to invalidate a unanimous Supreme Court \ndecision, written by Justice Scalia, holding that the ADA applies to \nState prisoners and prisons. He wrote, ``While we follow Yeskey, we \nurge Congress to amend the ADA to exclude prisoners from the class of \npersons entitled to protection under the act.''\n  In other cases, he has also articulated personal preferences that \nfavor a narrow reading of the law, which would limit individual rights \nand protections. For example, in Wohlert Special Products v. Mich. \nEmployment Security Comm'n, he reversed the decision of the Michigan \nEmployment Security Commission and held that striking employees were \nnot entitled to unemployment benefits. The Michigan Supreme Court \nvacated part of Judge Griffin's decision, noting that he had \ninappropriately made his own findings of fact\n\n[[Page S6289]]\n\nwhen ruling that the employees were not entitled to benefits. This case \nraises concerns about Judge Griffin's willingness to distort precedent \nto reach the results he favors.\n  In several other cases, Judge Griffin has gone out of his way to \ninterject his conservative personal views into his opinions. The \nappeals courts are the courts of last resort in over 99 percent of all \nfederal cases and often decide cases of first impression. If confirmed, \nJudge Griffin will have much greater latitude to be a conservative \njudicial activist.\n  It is ironic that Judge Griffin's father who, as Senator in 1968, \nlaunched the first filibuster of a Supreme Court nominee and blocked \nthe nomination of Justice Abe Fortas to serve as Chief Justice. Despite \nthe deference given in those days to the President's selected nominee, \nformer Senator Griffin led a core group of Republican Senators in \nderailing President Johnson's nomination by filibustering for days. \nEventually, Justice Fortas withdrew his nomination. I know that the \nRepublicans here have called filibusters of Federal judges \n``unconstitutional'' and ``unprecedented'', but this nominee's father \nactually set the modern precedent for blocking nominees by filibuster \non the Senate floor.\n\n  The second of the two nominees before us today is David McKeague. His \nrecord raises some concerns, and his answers to my written questions on \nsome of these issues did little or nothing to assuage them.\n  In particular, I am concerned about Judge McKeague's decisions in a \nseries of cases on environmental issues. In Northwoods Wilderness \nRecovery v. United States Forest Serv., 323 F.3d 405 (6th Cir. 2003), \nJudge McKeague would have allowed the U.S. Forest Service to commence a \nharvesting project that allowed selective logging and clear-cutting in \nareas of Michigan's upper peninsula. The appellate court reversed him \nand found that the Forest Service had not adhered to a ``statutorily \nmandated environmental analysis'' prior to approval of the project, \nwhich was dubbed ``Rolling Thunder.''\n  Sitting by designation on the Sixth Circuit, Judge McKeague joined in \nan opinion that permitted the Tennessee Valley Authority--TVA--broadly \nto interpret a clause of the National Environmental Policy Act in a way \nthat would allow the TVA to conduct large-scale timber harvesting \noperations without performing site-specific environmental assessments. \nThis is the case of Help Alert Western Ky., Inc. v. Tenn. Valley \nAuthority, 1999 U.S. App. LEXIS 23759 (6th Cir. 1999). The majority \ndecision in this case permitted the TVA to determine that logging \noperations that covered 2,147 acres of land were ``minor,'' and thus \nfell under a categorical exclusion to the environmental impact \nstatement requirement. The dissent in this case noted that the \nexclusion in the past had applied only to truly ``minor'' activities, \nsuch as the purchase or lease of transmission lines, construction of \nvisitor reception centers and onsite research.\n  Judge McKeague also dismissed a suit brought by the Michigan Natural \nResources Commission against the Manufacturer's National Bank of \nDetroit, finding that the bank was not liable for the costs of \nenvironmental cleanup at sites owned by a ``troubled borrower.'' This \nis the case of Kelley ex rel. Mich. Natural Resources Comm'n v. \nTiscornia, 810 F. Supp. 901 (W.D. Mich. 1993). The bank took over the \nproperty from Auto Specialties Manufacturing Company when it defaulted \non its loans. The Natural Resources Commission argued that the bank \nshould be responsible for taking over the cost of cleanup because it \nheld the property when the toxic spill occurred, but Judge McKeague \ndisagreed.\n  In Miron v. Menominee County, 795 F. Supp. 840 (W.D. Mich. 1992), \nJudge McKeague rejected the efforts of a citizen who lived close to a \nlandfill to require the Federal Aviation Administration to enjoin \nlandfill cleanup efforts until an environmental impact statement \nregarding the efforts could be prepared. The citizen contended that if \nthe statement were prepared, the inadequacies of a State-sponsored \ncleanup would be revealed and appropriate corrective measures would be \nundertaken to minimize further environmental contamination and wetlands \ndestruction. Holding that the alleged environmental injuries were \n``remote and speculative,'' Judge McKeague denied the requested \ninjunctive relief.\n\n  In Pape v. U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, 1998 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 9253 \n(W.D. Mich.), Judge McKeague seems to have ignored relevant facts in \norder to prevent citizen enforcement of environmental protections. Dale \nPape, a private citizen and wildlife photographer, sued the U.S. Corps \nof Army Engineers under the Federal Resource Conservation and Recovery \nAct of 1976 (RCRA), alleging that the Corps mishandled hazardous waste \nin violation of RCRA, destroying wildlife in a park near the site. \nDespite the Supreme Court's holding in Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife \nthat ``the desire to use or observe an animal species, even for purely \nesthetic purposes, is undeniably a cognizable interest for purpose of \nstanding,'' and even though RCRA specifically conferred the right for \ncitizen suits against the government for failure to implement orders or \nto protect the environment or health and safety, Judge McKeague \ndismissed the case, holding that plaintiff lacked standing to sue.\n  Judge McKeague found plaintiff's complaint insufficient on several \ngrounds, in particular plaintiff's inability to establish which site \nspecifically he would visit in the future. Plaintiff had stated in his \ncomplaint that he ``has visited the `area around' the RACO site `at \nleast five times per year' and that he has made plans to vacation in \n`Soldiers Park' located `near' the RACO site in early October 1998, \nwhere he plans to spend his time `fishing, canoeing, and photographing \nthe area.' '' Comparing Pape's testimony with that of the Lujan \nplaintiff, who had failed to win standing after he presented general \nfacts about prior visits and an intent to visit in the future, Judge \nMcKeague rejected Pape's complaint as too speculative, based on the \nCourt's holding in Lujan that:\n\n       [Plaintiffs'] profession of an ``intent'' to return to the \n     places [plaintiffs] had visited before--where they will, \n     presumably, this time, be deprived of the opportunity to \n     observe animals of the endangered species--is simply not \n     enough to establish standing . . .. Such ``some day'' \n     intention-- without any description of concrete plans, or \n     indeed, even any specification of when the some day will be--\n     do not support a finding of the ``actual or imminent'' injury \n     that our cases require.\n\n  In concluding that ``the allegations contained in plaintiff's first \namended complaint fail to establish an actual injury because they do \nnot include an allegation that plaintiff has specific plans to use the \nallegedly affected area in the future,'' Judge McKeague seemed to \nignore completely the detailed fact description that Pape submitted in \nhis amendment complaint. The judge further asserted that there was no \ncausal connection between the injury and the activity complained of, \nand that, in any case, the alleged injury was not redressable by the \nsuit.\n  On another important topic, that of the scheme of enforcing the civil \nand constitutional rights of institutionalized persons, I am concerned \nabout one of Judge McKeague's decisions. In 1994, in United States v. \nMichigan, 868 F. Supp. 890 (W.D. Mi. 1994), he refused to allow the \nDepartment of Justice access to Michigan prisons in the course of its \ninvestigation into some now notorious claims of sexual abuse of women \nprisoners by guards undermines the long-established system under the \nConstitutional Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act or CRIPA. That \nact's investigative and enforcement regime is unworkable if the \nDepartment of Justice is denied access to State prisons to determine if \nenough evidence exists to file suit, and Judge McKeague's tortured \nreasoning made it impossible for the investigation to continue in his \ndistrict.\n\n  I know that concern for the rights of prisoners who have often \ncommitted horrendous criminal acts is not politically popular, but \nCongress enacted the law and expected its statute and its clear intent \nto be followed. It seems to me that Judge McKeague disregarded \nlegislative history and the clear intent of the law, and that sort of \njudging is of concern to me.\n  Finally, I must express my profound disappointment in his answer to a \nquestion I sent him about a presentation he made in the Fall of 2000, \nwhen he made what I judged to be inappropriate and insensitive comments \nabout the health and well-being of sitting Supreme Court Justices. In a \nspeech to a law school audience about the impact of the 2000 elections \non the\n\n[[Page S6290]]\n\ncourts, Judge McKeague discussed the possibility of vacancies on the \nCourt over the following year. In doing so he felt it necessary to not \nonly refer to--but to make a chart of--the Justices' particular health \nproblems, and ghoulishly focus on their life expectancy by highlighting \ntheir ages. He says he does not believe he was disrespectful, and used \nonly public information. There were other, better ways he could have \nmade the same point, and it is too bad he still cannot see that.\n  Under our Constitution, the Senate has an important role in the \nselection of our judiciary. The brilliant design of our Founders \nestablished that the first two branches of Government would work \ntogether to equip the third branch to serve as an independent arbiter \nof justice. As columnist George Will once wrote: ``A proper \nconstitution distributes power among legislative, executive and \njudicial institutions so that the will of the majority can be measured, \nexpressed in policy and, for the protection of minorities, somewhat \nlimited.'' The structure of our Constitution and our own Senate rules \nof self-governance are designed to protect minority rights and to \nencourage consensus. Despite the razor-thin margin of recent elections, \nthe majority party has never acted in a measured way but in complete \ndisregard for the traditions of bipartisanship that are the hallmark of \nthe Senate. It acted to ignore precedents and reinterpret longstanding \nrules to its advantage, but fortunately its attempt to eliminate the \nvoice of the minority entirely failed because of the efforts of well-\nmeaning and fair-minded Senators. Two more well-meaning and fair-minded \nSenators did their part to save the Senate by clearing the way for the \nconfirmation of the two nominees today. I hope that despite the \nconcerns I have expressed and others that may emerge during this \ndebate, once confirmed Judge Griffin and Judge McKeague will fulfill \ntheir oath and provide fair and impartial justice to all who come \nbefore them.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise in support of the nominations of \nDavid McKeague and Richard Griffin to the Sixth Circuit Court of \nAppeals.\n  The Sixth Circuit covers thirty million people in Michigan, Ohio, \nTennessee and my home State of Kentucky. For the last several years, \nthe Sixth Circuit has been operating with at least one-fourth of its 16 \nseats empty. This 25 percent vacancy rate is the highest vacancy rate \namong Federal circuit courts. The Administrative Office of the Courts \nhas declared all four of these empty seats to be ``judicial \nemergencies.''\n  Because of this high vacancy rate, the Sixth Circuit has been \noperating under a crushing caseload burden and has been the slowest \ncircuit in the Nation. According to the AOC, last year--like the year \nbefore it--the Sixth Circuit was a full 60 percent behind the national \naverage. In 2004, the national average for disposing of an appeal in \nthe Federal circuit courts was 10.5 months. But in the Sixth Circuit, \nit took almost 17 months to decide an appeal. For your average \nlitigant, that means in other circuits, if you file your appeal at the \nbeginning of the year, you get your decision around Halloween. But in \nthe Sixth Circuit, if you file your appeal at the same time, you get \nyour decision after the following Memorial Day--over a half year later.\n  Mr. President, you know the old saying that ``justice delayed is \njustice denied.'' Well, the thirty million residents of the Sixth \nCircuit have been denied justice due to the continued obstruction of \nMichigan nominees by my Democrat colleagues. What is the reason for \nthis sorry state of affairs? An intra-delegation spat in the Michigan \ndelegation from years ago--when a quarter of the current Senate was not \neven here. Nor, I might add, was the current President around either. \nThis dispute has dragged on year after year. I do not know who started \nit.\n  My colleagues from Michigan cite Clinton nominees to the Sixth \nCircuit who did not receive hearings. Other people note that our \ncolleagues from Michigan do not have a monopoly on disappointment. They \npoint to Michigan nominees from President George Herbert Walker Bush, \nsuch as Henry Saad and John Smietanka, who did not get hearings when \nDemocrats controlled the Senate Judiciary Committee in the early 1990s.\n  Regardless of who started what and when, all the residents in the \nSixth Circuit have been suffering from the refusal of our Democratic \ncolleagues to allow these seats from Michigan to be filled. Moreover, \nthis obstruction has been out of all proportion to any alleged \ngrievance. Specifically, our colleagues had been blocking four circuit \ncourt nominees from Michigan, as well as three district court nominees \nfrom Michigan. But of these seven Michigan vacancies that the Democrats \nhad been refusing to let the Senate fill, five of the seats were not \neven involved in this dispute. President Clinton never nominated anyone \nto the seat to which current nominee Henry Saad has been nominated. The \nseat to which current nominee David McKeague has been nominated did not \neven become vacant until the current Bush administration. And the three \ndistrict court seats that are being blocked were not involved in the \ndispute either. So my friends from Michigan had been holding up one-\nfourth of an entire circuit in crisis, along with three district court \nseats, because of an internal dispute about two seats, the genesis of \nwhich occurred years ago.\n  What had my friends from Michigan been demanding in order to lift \nthis blockade? They had wanted to pick circuit court appointments. Mr. \nPresident, let us get back to first principles. As much as they would \nlike to, Democrat Senators do not get to pick circuit court judges in \nRepublican administrations. For that matter, Republican Senators do not \nget to pick circuit court judges in Republican administrations.\n  Article II, section 2 of the Constitution clearly provides that the \nPresident, and the President alone, nominates judges. It then adds that \nthe Senate is to provide its advice and consent to the nominations that \nthe President has made. By tradition, the President may consult with \nSenators. But the tradition of ``consultation'' does not transform \nindividual Senators into co-presidents. We have elections for that, and \nPresident Bush has won the last two.\n  Fortunately, it appears our friends from Michigan have reconsidered \ntheir position. As a result, two fine jurists, Judge Richard Griffin \nand Judge David McKeague, will get up or down votes, and will be \nconfirmed to the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals. All residents of the \nSixth Circuit will benefit from their service on that court. We should \nall be thankful for that.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, before the recess, the Senate confirmed \nPriscilla Owen to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals. Yesterday, we \nconfirmed Janice Rogers Brown to the DC Circuit. And earlier today, \nWilliam Pryor was confirmed to serve on the Eleventh Circuit Court of \nApeals.\n  All three of these judges had been waiting for years to get an up-or-\ndown vote on the Senate floor. Until 2 weeks ago, all three of these \nnominees had been blocked by partisan obstructionist tactics.\n  In a few minutes, we will give Judge Richard Griffin and Judge David \nMcKeague fair up or down votes. We are making progress on fulfilling \nour constitutional duty to advise and consent.\n  The judges before us now are nominees to the Sixth Circuit Court of \nAppeals--a circuit which includes Michigan, Ohio, Kentucky, and my home \nState of Tennessee. It is a circuit that desperately needs new judges. \nMy circuit--the Sixth Circuit--has the highest vacancy rate and the \nslowest appeals process in the Nation.\n  For the last 3 years, the Sixth Circuit has had the highest the \nvacancy rate for Federal judges in the nation. Twenty five percent--4 \nout of 16--of its seats are empty. All four have been declared judicial \nemergencies.\n  These vacant judgeships have turned the Sixth Circuit into the \nslowest circuit in the country. Consider that the national average for \nan appeal is about 10 months. In the Sixth Circuit, it takes almost 17.\n  This situation is unfair to our constituents and unfair to the hard-\nworking judges who labor under increasingly heavy caseloads.\n  Judicial obstruction has been delaying and denying justice to the 30 \nmillion people who live in the Sixth Circuit. It is time to end this \njudicial obstruction and fill these seats with qualified judges.\n  I would like to comment briefly on the backgrounds of Judges McKeague \nand Griffin.\n\n[[Page S6291]]\n\n  The President nominated Judge McKeague on November 8, 2001, and Judge \nGriffin on June 26, 2002.\n  Judge Griffin has extensive experience as a practicing attorney. He \nhas appeared before the Federal district courts in Michigan and before \nthe Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals.\n  He also has served with distinction as a State court judge for well \nover a decade. As an appellate judge, he wrote over 280 published \nopinions and heard thousands of criminal and civil cases.\n  He enjoys bipartisan support from his colleagues. The chief judge of \nthe Michigan Court of Appeals has called Judge Griffin a ``decisive \nscholarly judge with an instinct for the core issues and with a flair \nfor authoring crisp understandable opinions.''\n  Judge Griffin has been waiting nearly 3 years for a fair up or down \nvote. It is time to give him that courtesy. It is time to vote.\n  Judge David McKeague, likewise, is a highly regarded jurist. In 1992, \nthe Senate voted unanimously to confirm him to serve on the U.S. \nDistrict Court for the Western District of Michigan.\n  Many of those same Senators who confirmed Judge McKeague to the \ndistrict court have been obstructing his nomination to the appellate \ncourt for over 3 years.\n  Judge McKeague was also appointed by Supreme Court Chief Justice \nRehnquist to serve on the Judicial Conference's Committee on Defender \nServices and on the Federal Judicial Center's District Judges Education \nCommittee, which he chairs.\n  Those in the legal community who have worked with Judge McKeague \nrespect him. One fellow attorney called him ``a person of unquestioned \nhonor and integrity. Judge McKeague's judgments are sound, impartial, \nand prompt.''\n  Attorneys who have represented clients before Judge McKeague say that \nhe is fair and ``treats all litigants and litigators with courtesy and \nrespect'' and that ``his rulings are well reasoned with due regard for \nprecedent and the law.''\n  Judge McKeague has been waiting nearly 4 years for an up-or-down \nvote. It is time to give him that courtesy. It is time to vote.\n  Judges Griffin and McKeague are highly qualified individuals with \nextensive legal experience and bipartisan support. Both have been rated \n``well qualified'' by the American Bar Association, the highest rating \npossible.\n  It is only because of partisan obstruction that they have not \nreceived a fair vote. Justice has been delayed because an up-or-down \nvote has been denied.\n  I hope things are changing in the Senate. I am pleased that with \ntoday's votes the Senate is continuing to move forward to embrace the \nprinciple of fair up or down votes on judicial nominees.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me to vote to confirm Judge Griffin and \nJudge McKeague to the Federal appeals court.\n  Mr. President, for the information of our colleagues, we plan on \nbeginning the votes--there will be two votes--in about 5 minutes. I \nknow a number of people are in meetings and around the Hill, but I want \nto notify them that we will begin voting at 4:55, in about 5 minutes.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, with the leader on the floor, have the yeas \nand nays been ordered on these two nominees?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. They have not.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that it be in order \nat this time to ask for the yeas and nays on both nominations.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I know the two Senators from Michigan \nsupport both these nominees. They both returned positive blue slips, \nwhich is one of the reasons they are moving so quickly.\n  As to when the time arrives that the leader wishes to begin the \nvotes, I ask unanimous consent that at that time the time on this side \nof the aisle be yielded back, whether I am on the floor or not.\n  Mr. FRIST. No objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I understand that all time will have been \nyielded back and, therefore, we will be starting the vote at 4:55 \nsharp.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I know our colleagues are anxious to \nvote. I have put into the Record statements in support of the \nnominations of Richard Allen Griffin to be a judge on the Sixth Circuit \nCourt of Appeals and David W. McKeague to be, similarly, a judge on the \nSixth Circuit. It would have been gratifying a couple of years ago to \nhave had this confirmation at that time, but it is good to have it now \nrather than at some time in the future. It would not serve any useful \npurpose to go through the litany of reasons these nominees have been \nheld up. Suffice it to say, they are very well qualified, and the Sixth \nCircuit is in a state of crisis, and it will help the administration of \njustice to have these nominees confirmed.\n  Mr. President, I believe we are ready to vote.\n\n\n                vote on nomination of richard a. griffin\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is, Will the Senate advise and \nconsent to the nomination of Richard A. Griffin, of Michigan, to be \nUnited States Circuit Judge for the Sixth Circuit?

Mr. President, I rise to speak a little bit about the \nDepartment of Homeland Security. I have the good fortune to chair their \nappropriations committee, and we will be marking up the appropriations \nbill relative to that agency next week, hopefully, if we can straighten \nout the proper allocations for funding within the budget, which I \nexpect to happen today under the leadership of Chairman Cochran.\n  The Homeland Security Department is a big one because, of course, \nthis goes to the essence of how we protect ourselves as a nation, how \nwe make sure that we are ready should we be attacked, and how we, \nhopefully, make it possible for us to avoid such an attack. \nRegrettably, the Department of Homeland Security has been thrown \ntogether and has had some problems as it has tried to shake out in the \npost-9/11 world.\n  In fact, the problems have been so extreme that almost a day does not \ngo by that we do not see an inspector general report or a GAO report \noutlining some function of that agency which simply is not working \ncorrectly. Today, there was a report where the inspector general found \nthat there were no backup computer systems within the Department for \nsome of the critical agencies that are involved, but that is only one \nof literally a stack of GAO and inspector general reports which \nprobably is 2 or 3 feet high.\n  There is a lot to do in this agency. Certainly, I congratulate the \nPresident on bringing aboard Secretary Chertoff. I know he is a hard-\ndriving and committed individual, and I know he is going to try to put \ntogether programs which will get that agency focused and functioning in \na manner in which the American people expect.\n  As we look at the agency, however, I do think we have to be driven by \na certain theory or theme, a set of policies. The first is that we \naddress threat first and that we start with the highest threats as \nbeing the first threats which we should focus on. Of course, the \nhighest threats are weapons of mass destruction coming into the country \nor being developed in the country which would be used against American \ncitizens.\n  Those weapons involve things such as chemical or biological weapons \nor potentially some sort of nuclear device. So we must prepare \nourselves and focus that Department on making sure that it is ready to \ndeal with those types of threats.\n  Some of the responsibility for making ourselves adequately prepared \nin the area, especially biologics, falls outside the Department and \nfalls with the CDC or HHS--the Health and Human Services Department--\nwhich have responsibility for developing vaccines. NIH, for example, \nNational Institutes of Health, has the responsibility for making sure \nthat we are on course to bring on line adequate responses should we be \nattacked with a biological weapon such as anthrax, a plague or \nbotulism.\n  The Department still has a huge role in this area, and it obviously \nhas a role in the nuclear area of detection and making sure that we are \nready to try to anticipate and stop a weapon of that sort. Below that \nlevel of addressing the weapons of mass destruction issues, we have to \nlook at the other areas of threat and how we as a government are \nstructured to handle it.\n  There was a report today that the President of the United States, in \na meeting with the leadership of the House at least, and maybe the \nSenate, said that he thought we should be focusing on border security \nas a priority in the area of maintaining our security as a nation. I \nthink that is absolutely true. Most Americans today wonder why there \nare still literally tens of thousands, maybe hundreds of thousands of \npeople coming across our borders, entering this country illegally.\n  A lot of other Americans wonder why today there is so much happening \nin the area of people coming into the country without us knowing what \ntheir purposes are or what their potential threat is as individuals. \nThere is concern about our capacity to screen folks who are coming into \nthis Nation who may have as one of their purposes to do us harm. We \nneed to strengthen our ability to stay on top of this situation.\n  There is significant concern about what is happening within our ports \nand whether we are putting in place systems which adequately review and \ngive us the capacity to address what might be in a container in one of \nthe hundreds of thousands of containers that\n\n[[Page S6293]]\n\ncome into this country on a daily basis. So this is an area of high \npriority. If this report is correct, it is very good that the President \nhas decided to put significant focus on the issue of border security \nbeyond what was obviously energy that was being put into that effort to \nbegin with anyway.\n  There is no question there has been significant effort in this area, \nbut it needs a lot more effort, and that brings me to what we are \nplanning to do with the appropriations bill. I want to lay out a bit of \na precursor to that bill so people will know what is coming and can \nanticipate it.\n\n  Basically, what we intend to do is reorient, to the extent we can, \nfunds within the moneys we have available to us for the Department of \nHomeland Security to focus on border security because we consider \nthat--or I happen to consider--after we go below the weapons of mass \ndestruction issue, to be the most significant area of need from the \nstandpoint of protecting our national security and making sure that we \nare able to manage our national security.\n  Unfortunately, the proposal that came up to us from the \nadministration prior to this recent discussion which occurred at the \nWhite House yesterday or the day before did not put the type of \nresources or focus on that Department that was necessary within the \ncontext of the entire Homeland Security Department. As a result, in \norder to accomplish that within the dollars we have--and the dollars \nare going to be fairly significant because the chairman of the \nAppropriations Committee, I believe, has stated not publicly yet but \nhas at least implied that he intends to fund aggressively this activity \nof the Federal Government because he understands the importance of the \nsecurity of our Nation. He used to be chairman of this subcommittee and \ncertainly knows its needs. So he is going to give us an allocation \nwhich is fairly significant. Within that allocation we do intend to \nreform and restructure so that we are putting more money into homeland \nsecurity.\n  That is going to mean that other accounts we might want to have \nfunded at a higher level are not going to be funded at quite so high a \nlevel. We are going to set priorities. My view of how we fund the issue \nof protecting our national security is that we address the issue of \nthreat, pick the highest threat, and fund responses to that threat. \nAfter the issue of weapons of mass destruction, the highest threat is \nour failure to manage our borders; thus, we are going to put more money \ninto that. That means we will have to take money from accounts which \nare not necessarily going to make those folks happy in those accounts, \nbut it is necessary if we are going to adequately fund this area.\n  It is a two-step effort, really. First, we have to put on the border \nthe necessary capability to have a reasonable review of who is coming \ninto the country and what is coming into the country. Today, we do not \nhave that capacity. Within that effort we need to have not only people, \nbut we need to have infrastructure in the form of technology capability \nand in the form of physical plant capability.\n  Secondly, we have to have a program in place as a nation which does \nnot create an incentive for people to come into the country illegally. \nThat gets into this whole question of guest worker. My Appropriations \nCommittee may not have that jurisdiction. We would love to have that \njurisdiction. We have it marginally, but that is an authorizing \nexercise, and maybe it will be debated on this bill. But, in any event, \nwe are going to focus on that first part where we do have jurisdiction, \nwhich is we are going to significantly tool up our physical and \npersonnel capabilities and our technology capabilities in order to try \nto address border security at the first level, which is a question of \nhaving the people and the resources on the borders, in the ports, in \norder to effectively manage our borders.\n\n  This is not an overnight event. This has been attempted before and it \nhas been singularly unsuccessful. When I had responsibility for \nImmigration and Border Patrol in the prior committee that was moved \nover from the Justice Department when they had the Justice Department \nresponsibility moved over to Homeland Security, we were in the midst of \ntrying to gear up the number of Border Patrol agents and we made a \ncommitment to add literally thousands of Border Patrol agents over a \nseries of years. Unfortunately, the Border Patrol first was not able to \nrecruit the people at the price we were willing to pay them because the \npeople were required to be bilingual and actually had talents that in \nthe marketplace could command more than we were willing to pay them, \nand second, we did not have the training facilities, so we ended up \nnever reaching the increase in numbers of Border Patrol we need in \norder to effectively address the border.\n  We are going to try again. The Border Patrol told us the number they \nthink they can train up in a year. We are going to give them more \ntraining capacity so in later years we can train more people. We are \ngoing to put in pay scales--we already have--that will make it a more \nattractive job. And we are going to start to hire people who can do the \njob effectively at fairly significant numbers.\n  On top of that, we have to do other things. There is within the \nDepartment of Homeland Security a program called US-VISIT, about which \nI have serious misgivings. It is a massive computer undertaking. I have \nseen these before in other agencies and my sense is this computer \ninitiative is not going well and is not evolving the software and \nhardware capabilities necessary. We are going to try to focus on that \nand hopefully turn that corner so that program will in the end be an \nasset, so we will know who is coming in the country.\n  There is other work we need to do. We need to increase the number of \ndetention beds. We need to increase the number of people who are doing \nthe prosecution of detainees. We need to increase the capability, the \nphysical plant capacity of the Border Patrol and the Immigration and \nCustoms officers. We need a lot of physical plant and people and \ntechnology and we are going to take from other accounts to try to \naccomplish that as we move this Homeland Security bill forward.\n  I am putting people on notice that this is the direction we are \ngoing. It is my opinion as we move this bill across the floor there \nshould be and will be a lot of interest in this area because securing \nour borders is, as the President has stated at least indirectly, \nthrough hearsay as presented by the leadership of the House, a priority \non which it is time we focused like a laser beam and took some action.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. GREGG. I am happy to yield to the Senator from Alabama for a \nquestion, or I will yield the floor.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I am very pleased the Senator from New Hampshire, Mr. \nGregg, is chairing this important committee. He has had a large number \nof years of intense interest in improving homeland security.\n  I am not sure he is aware, but yesterday there was a hearing in the \nJudiciary Committee on the Joint Terrorism Subcommittee and the \nImmigration Subcommittee. It dealt with people coming into the country \nillegally, people who were other than Mexicans, on the Mexican border. \nThe story, as described by a reporter in a newspaper article of early \nMay, said that a group--for example, in this case 20 from Brazil--came \nacross the border, looked for the Immigration Border Patrol people, and \nimmediately went up to them and turned themselves in to them. They were \ntaken into some form of custody, placed in some form of transportation, \ntransported further into the country, and then released on their own \nrecognizance. Of the 8,908 notices to appear that the immigration court \nin Harlington issued to non-Mexicans, 8,767 of them never showed up \nwhen they were supposed to come to court.\n\n  First, I would note there are a lot of people other than our Mexican \nneighbors who are coming across that border. Second, there were some \nplans to expedite removal to these other countries, which is somewhat \ndifficult. Maybe one-fifth of these are being handled in the more \nexpedited and effective way. But I wanted to share that with the \nSenator. I ask if he thought the committee would be responsive to \nrequests from the Administration to fund those expedited programs, \nbecause what we are doing now is not effective at all.\n  Mr. GREGG. The Senator from Alabama has pointed to one of the many\n\n[[Page S6294]]\n\nanecdotal but glaringly difficult instances that should cause us all \nconcern. We are hearing anecdotal information that the Border Patrol is \nfinding material that is clearly written in Arabic, and is clearly \nIslamic fundamentalist, at the border. People have left it there or it \nhas been left behind by people coming across the border, it appears. So \nthat is obviously an extreme concern.\n  But your story reflects the fact that these borders are simply not \ncontrolled and we don't have the capacity to handle the people when we \ndo catch them. That is going to take a rethinking of the effort. It is \ngoing to take a lot of resources. As we move forward as a Congress, we \nhave to think about: Are we putting too many resources in other \naccounts when we should be focusing on the border? I will take two \nexamples.\n  One is TSA, our transportation security, which we see in our \nairports. How many people can we afford there versus the border? The \nfirst responder funds that are going out not necessarily on the basis \nof threat but on the basis of formula, can we afford that in light of \nthe fact we have a threat, which is the border, or should we take \nanother look at other approaches to funding a significant increase in \nthe border security effort?\n  I look forward to working with the members of the Judiciary \nCommittee. Our role is the money role. We look to you folks to give us \nthe authorizing leadership, which I know you have in the past. You \ncertainly have and certainly other members in your committee are \nleaders in this area. We look forward to any ideas or thoughts you have \nwhich you want to bring forward.\n  I do think on this bill we should have a fairly open and substantive \ndebate as to how we are going to move forward on the issue of border \nsecurity. Clearly the White House is committed to this. It is going to \ntake resources.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the Senator, also the Chair of the Budget \nCommittee. He answered very well when he said we can't always fund the \nnew things we want to do by pumping new money into them. Sometimes we \nneed to ask ourselves if there is not some money being spent in a way \nthat is less useful, and utilize that money where we have to utilize \nit.\n  I am proud to serve with him on that Budget Committee.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/06/09/senate-section/article/S6294-1", "month": "06", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6294]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          THE TEACHER EXCELLENCE FOR ALL CHILDREN ACT OF 2005\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, good teachers lead to good students. In \nfact, recent evidence suggests that providing great teachers may be the \nsingle most important thing that we can do to give our children the \ngood education they deserve.\n  Most of our teachers are hardworking, selfless, and dedicated to \nhelping our children learn. We are asking them for more, however. We \ncontinue to demand that our teachers develop greater subject matter \nexpertise, but we have yet to figure out how to help teachers learn \nwhile they are still needed in the classroom full time. In addition, to \nmeet growing student need we will need to bring over 2 million new \nteachers into our public schools over the next decade.\n  We must attract, develop, and retain as many talented teachers as we \ncan muster. We must act now to begin meeting this critical national \ncrisis.\n  That is why I am proud to introduce with Senator Kennedy the Teacher \nExcellence For All Children Act of 2005. The TEACH Act provides \nfinancial incentives to attract and retain our best teachers and \nprincipals. The TEACH Act helps schools recognize and reward the best \nteachers. The TEACH Act encourages good teachers to work in the schools \nthat need good teachers the most, and it also encourages teachers to \nspecialize in the subjects which need the most teachers. Finally, the \nTEACH Act helps new teachers transition into the classroom, it helps \nveteran teachers keep their skills sharp, and it attracts talented new \nprincipals into our schools.\n  Developing great teachers takes time, but this is an investment that \nwe as a nation must make. I therefore encourage my colleagues to \nsupport the TEACH Act now. Our children deserve nothing less.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/06/09/senate-section/article/S6294-2", "month": "06", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6294-S6295]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                FAMILIES OF SEPTEMBER 11'S FINAL REPORT\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, less than 2 weeks after the horrific events \nof September 11, Congress passed a law to establish the September 11 \nVictim Compensation Fund, providing assistance to victims and their \nfamilies during an unimaginably difficult time. I was pleased to work \nwith my colleagues to create this needed resource for the families of \nthis national tragedy. The families of victims that died in the \nSeptember 11 attacks also came together and created their own nonprofit \norganization, Families of September 11.\n  Although no amount of compensation can replace a lost loved one, \nFamilies of September 11 and Ken Feinberg, the Special Master in charge \nof overseeing the Fund, worked diligently to improve the rules \ngoverning the September 11 Victim Compensation Fund, to give the \nvictims and their families more flexibility and to provide information \nto victims and their families about how and where they could find \nsupport. Working together, Mr. Feinberg and Families of September 11 \nreached out to the victims and their families to make sure they \nunderstood their rights and to assist them in filing their claims. This \ntask was made all the more difficult because many victims and survivors \nof those terrorist attacks had to confront the logistical burden and \nemotional pain of filing a death or injury claim.\n  Last October, Mr. Feinberg submitted to the Department of Justice a \nfinal report summarizing the accomplishments and work of the September \n11 Victim Compensation Fund. While the September 11 Victim Compensation \nFund has reached its final deadline, Families of September 11 continues \nits mission, including supporting legislation on security and \nintelligence reform. This week, Families of September 11 also submitted \na final report to the Department of Justice, sharing the experiences of \nthe victims and their families, including those who chose not to \nparticipate in the September 11 Victim Compensation Fund. The report in \nits entirety may be read at http://www.familiesofseptember11.org.\n  Mr. President, I ask that a copy of the Executive Summary of this \nreport be in the Record for lawmakers and the public to review.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  Executive Summary: Final Report of Families of September 11 on the \n            September 11th Victim Compensation Fund of 2001\n\n       Families of September 11 is a nonprofit organization \n     founded in October 2001 by families of those who died in the \n     September 11 terrorist attacks. We gather and disseminate \n     helpful information, refer victims' families, survivors, and \n     others affected by the events of 9/11 to assistance \n     providers, offer online chat sessions, and address such \n     issues as victims' assistance, methods of response to trauma \n     from terrorist attacks, and the effects of terrorism on \n     children. We support public policies that effectively respond \n     to the threat of terrorism, including support for the 9/11 \n     Commission Recommendations, development of appropriate agency \n     procedures, legislation related to aviation, border, port and \n     transportation security, and intelligence reform.\n       Our Final Report on the September 11th Victim Compensation \n     Fund follows the format of ``Final Report of the Special \n     Master for the September 11th Victim Compensation Fund of \n     2001.'' Just as the Special Master's Final Report provides \n     the perspective of the administrator of the Fund, our Report \n     gives voice to those victims and family members who \n     participated in the Fund as well as those who elected not to. \n     Although much of our report serves as counterpoint to the \n     Special Master's observations and conclusions, we agree with \n     much of what is said in his report and our Report should be \n     read with an acknowledgement that the Special Master was \n     asked to and did construct a program in extremely difficult \n     circumstances. The enabling legislation that created the Fund \n     was hastily crafted, imprecise in significant ways, and \n     sometimes internally inconsistent. The Special Master was \n     faced not only with the uncertain nature of the legislation, \n     but with a host of other competing influences: e.g., the \n     enormity of the losses, emotionally overwhelmed victims and \n     families, a stunned public, and conflicting compensation \n     policy ideologies. The Special Master and those who worked \n     with him deserve great credit for their tireless and devoted \n     work under these daunting circumstances, particularly in the \n     administration of the Fund after promulgation by the \n     Department of Justice of the Final Rules.\n       In many respects, the Fund was a success. Much of this \n     success was due to the efforts of the Special Master and his \n     staff in meeting with individual family members, \n     demonstrating flexibility where possible in making \n     determinations of awards, and expressing\n\n[[Page S6295]]\n\n     compassion for family members in the process. But, the \n     Special Master's view, expressed in the introduction to his \n     Final Report, that ``the Fund was an unqualified success'' is \n     not shared by many who participated in the Fund and most of \n     those who did not. The options available to the victims and \n     families of September 11 were substantially impaired by the \n     Victim Compensation Act and subsequent legislation. \n     Lawsuits were confined to a narrow population of \n     potentially responsible parties whose liability exposure \n     was limited to available and inadequate insurance (e.g., \n     the airlines). Evidence for use in litigation was sure to \n     be (has been) compromised by government intervention \n     (e.g., assertions of national security and criminal \n     prosecution grounds for non-disclosure). Families were, \n     thus, faced with a Hobson's choice and for most the Fund \n     was the better one.\n       In December 2004, Families of September 11 conducted a Web-\n     based survey of its members consisting of fourteen questions \n     and an opportunity to make narrative comments designed to \n     elicit information that might be helpful in assessing whether \n     there should be a compensation mechanism in place before \n     another terrorist attack occurs. One hundred forty-four (144) \n     members responded. Though not designed to conform with \n     scientifically reliable protocols, the results are of \n     interest and are included in our Report.\n       Much of the Special Master's report is devoted to efforts \n     made by him and his staff to assure that families could \n     obtain detailed information about their likely recovery from \n     the Fund and assist families in the process. Although our \n     Report applauds him for these efforts, it points out that had \n     there been pre-existing comprehensive legislation in place, \n     the Special Master's extraordinary efforts to educate \n     potential participants about and assist them with the Fund \n     would not have been necessary and the enormous anxiety \n     created by the uncertainties surrounding the Fund would have \n     been avoided.\n       The regulations promulgated by the Department of Justice \n     established ``grid'' awards with ``extraordinary \n     circumstances'' thresholds of proof to overcome them and no \n     review process. Claimants were accustomed to the very \n     different and more substantial notions of ``hearings'' and \n     ``due process'' embedded in our legal culture and were left \n     disappointed and uncomfortable by the Fund design. Mr. \n     Feinberg and his staff should, however, receive high marks \n     for the way they played the cards dealt them.\n       The victims and their families were faced with enormous \n     uncertainty in the weeks and months following September 11, \n     2001, during which the Department of Justice promulgated \n     regulations and the Special Master developed claims handling \n     procedures. It is this uncertainty that Families of September \n     11 believes must be eliminated by enactment of forward-\n     looking legislation. The victims of future terrorist attacks \n     will need to go on living, as have the victims of the \n     September 11 attacks and should have the comfort of knowing \n     immediately after a terrorist event occurs that they have \n     rights to compensation sufficient to allow them to do so and \n     a clear and certain path to obtaining those rights.\n       Issues of accountability and responsibility by those in the \n     chain of causation linked to the injuries and deaths on \n     September 11, 2001, and the suffering that followed are of \n     great importance to the survivors of the attacks. The Fund, \n     its enabling legislation, and related congressional and \n     administrative actions had the effect of limiting that \n     accountability and responsibility. Our Report expresses \n     concern that this model tends to increase the risk of future \n     terrorist attacks and needs to be reassessed and remedied.\n       The Special Master made determinations on 7,403 claims \n     completing its work by the statutory deadline in June 2004. \n     Congress now has the benefit of more than 11,000 comments \n     made to the Justice Department during the rule-making \n     process; the comments of the Special Master; the opinions of \n     lawyers, economists, academics, mental heath professionals, \n     victims and survivors of the attacks; and the developing \n     history of terrorism and its effects on our society. In its \n     report, Families of September 11 encourages Congress and the \n     Administration to:\n       a. Use the perspectives of time and experience in \n     implementation of the Victim Compensation Fund to consider \n     carefully issues it was forced to address hastily in the \n     immediate aftermath of the terrorist attacks of September 11, \n     2001;\n       b. assess how well the rules adopted in 2002 to implement \n     the legislation met Congressional intent;\n       c. consider the incentives and disincentives to reducing \n     the risks of terrorist attacks implicit in the legislation; \n     and\n       d. fashion legislation that will reduce those risks and \n     ensure that victims of future terrorist attacks and their \n     families are made whole.\n       Copies of the ``Final Report of Families of September 11 on \n     the September 11th Victim Compensation Fund of 2001'' may be \n     obtained by contacting Families of September 11 at the \n     address below or by going to its website at \n     www.familiesofseptember11.org.\n\n         Families of September 11, Inc., 1560 Broadway, Suite 305, \n           New York, NY 10036, 212-575-1878.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/06/09/senate-section/article/S6295-1", "month": "06", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6295]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ENHANCEMENT ACT OF 2005\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the need for \nhate crimes legislation. Each Congress, Senator Kennedy and I introduce \nhate crimes legislation that would add new categories to current hate \ncrimes law, sending a signal that violence of any kind is unacceptable \nin our society. Likewise, each Congress I have come to the floor to \nhighlight a separate hate crime that has occurred in our country.\n  A gay white male was severely beaten and sent to the hospital by two \nmen in a Columbus gay bar. The victim and a friend noticed the men in \nthe bar when they arrived. At the end of the evening the two males \nstarted calling the victim various derogatory names, and pushed him out \nof the bar. Once outside, the men continued to beat the victim, using \nliquor bottles. Since the beating, the victim has had his tires slashed \nand received a letter in his mailbox telling him to `watch his back.' A \npolice report was filed, but no arrests have been made.\n  I believe that the Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, \nto defend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act is a symbol that can become substance. I \nbelieve that by passing this legislation and changing current law, we \ncan change hearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/06/09/senate-section/article/S6295-2", "month": "06", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6295-S6296]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   BREAKING THE CYCLE OF GUN VIOLENCE\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I would like to bring the results of a \nrecent study on gun violence by a University of Michigan researcher to \nthe attention of my colleagues. The study found that adolescents who \nare exposed to gun violence are more likely to carry out serious acts \nof violence.\n  The study, completed by University of Michigan doctoral student \nJeffrey Bingenheimer, analyzed data from more than 1,500 adolescents. \nThe participants underwent a series of interviews over the course of \nseveral years as part of the Project on Human Development in Chicago \nNeighborhoods. Among other things, initial interviews focused on \nexposure to firearm violence, including being shot or shot at or seeing \nsomeone else shot or shot at within the previous year. Subsequent \ninterviews were designed to uncover whether the participant had engaged \nin violent acts themselves. These acts of violence were defined in the \nstudy as shooting at or shooting someone, being in a gang fight, \nattacking someone with a weapon, or carrying a hidden weapon. \nReportedly, 23 percent of those interviewed reported being exposed to \ngun violence and 12 percent indicated that they had carried out violent \nacts themselves. Statistical analysis of the resulting data revealed \nthat adolescents who were exposed to gun violence were more than twice \nas likely to carry out violent acts within the following two years.\n  Describing the results of his study, Mr. Bingenheimer stated, ``The \nprimary implication of these findings is that violence can be \ntransmitted from person to person by means of exposure in the \ncommunity. This makes the `epidemic of violence' metaphor seem \nparticularly apt, and is consistent with sociological theories of \nviolent crime as a contagious social process.''\n  While Congress cannot simply legislate an end to the gun violence \nepidemic, we can do more to support local law enforcement officials as \nthey work to prevent gun violence in our communities. One important \nprogram, known as COPS, was created by President Clinton in 1994 to \nassist State and local law enforcement agencies in hiring additional \npolice officers to reduce crime through the use of community policing. \nNationwide, the COPS program has awarded more than $11 billion in \ngrants, resulting in the hiring of 118,000 additional police officers. \nUnfortunately, authorization for the COPS program was permitted to \nexpire at the end of fiscal year 2000. Although the program has \nsurvived through continued annual appropriations, its funding has been \nsignificantly cut. I am a cosponsor of the COPS Reauthorization Act \nwhich would continue the COPS program for another six years at a \nfunding level of $1.15 billion per year, nearly double the amount \nappropriated for fiscal year 2005. Among other things, this funding \nwould allow State and local governments to hire an additional 50,000 \npolice officers. Having more officers on our streets helps to\n\n[[Page S6296]]\n\ndeter gun violence and therefore reduces the chance that adolescents \nare exposed to such crimes.\n  In addition, Congress can make it more difficult for potential \ncriminals to gain access to dangerous firearms. Under current law, when \nan individual buys a handgun from a licensed dealer, there are federal \nrequirements for a background check to insure that the purchaser is not \nprohibited by law from purchasing or possessing a firearm. However, \nthis is not the case for all gun purchases. For example, when an \nindividual wants to buy a handgun from another private citizen who is \nnot a licensed gun dealer, there is no requirement that the seller \nensure the purchaser is not in a prohibited category. This creates a \nloophole in the law, making it easy for criminals, terrorists, and \nother prohibited buyers to evade background checks and buy guns from \nprivate citizens often at organized gun shows. This loophole creates a \ngateway to the illegal market because criminals know they will not be \nsubject to a background check when purchasing from another private \ncitizen even at a gun show. It is important that Congress close this \n``gun show loophole'' to help stop the flow of dangerous firearms to \nprohibited buyers who may use them in violent crimes.\n  Much more can be done to break the cycle of gun violence that plagues \nmany of our communities. I urge my colleagues to take up and pass \ncommon sense legislation that will help to achieve this goal.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/06/09/senate-section/article/S6296-1", "month": "06", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6296]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   TRIBUTE TO SGT RUSSELL J.

This marked the \nbeginning of a remarkable career in which Paul served the Clay \ncommunity school system in countless capacities. He taught science, \nmath, and health to the junior high students before moving on to \ninstruct health, physical education, and driver education classes in \nthe high school. Additionally, he took time to coach the boys freshman \nand junior varsity basketball teams, and represented the school as \nathletic director and guidance director. In 1977, Paul took the reigns \nas principal of Clay City Jr./Sr. High School.\n  For the past 28 years Paul has worked extremely long hours overseeing \nthe operations of Clay City High School. In 1992, he was selected as \nthe Principal of the Year in the IASP District 8. In addition, he \nserved as president of the Indiana Association of School Principals of \nDistrict 8 in 1994-1995.

Mr. President, as we wind down from a Presidential \nelection year and gear up for yet another cycle of congressional \nelections, it seems appropriate to take a moment and consider how \nimportant an educated electorate is to this country. It is the bedrock \nupon which our Founding Fathers built a fledgling government, creating \na Constitution that functions with protean efficiency--inextricably \nbound to the necessity of knowledgeable and civic-minded citizens. I am \nproud to make public mention of the Moscow, ID, chapter of the League \nof Women Voters, which has won an award from the League of Women Voters \nof the United States for its efforts to educate future voters in north \nIdaho.\n  The League of Women Voters promotes a mock election program through \nits State and local chapters across the Nation. The Moscow chapter \nconducted what can only be described as a phenomenal month-long series \nof events and outreach that culminated in late October in the most \nsuccessful ``mock election'' in Idaho and one of the top in the Nation. \nThey were able to register and have almost 2900 first through twelfth-\ngraders in the Moscow area vote. And I am relieved to add that I was \nreelected by these young people.\n  The chapter worked to bring together local, county, and State \nofficials, teachers, parents, and volunteers to provide these students \nwith a comprehensive and highly educational election experience. The \nstudents were given issues ballots, information about the candidates, \nWeb site curriculum, sample ballots and had to abide by all\n\n[[Page S6297]]\n\nof the State voting laws. Students were taught their voting rights \nunder the Help America Vote Act, and the overall efforts were so \nsuccessful that the League of Women Voters of Idaho and the Idaho \nSecretary of State's office asked them to share their mock election \nhandbook for instruction and use by other organizations in the State.\n  The Moscow chapter went above and beyond in its outreach efforts, \nbringing in students from an alternative high school and made voting \naccessible for handicapped students under Americans For Disabilities \nAct laws. In the successful aftermath, the effect has been felt \nthroughout the community as private schools and home-schooling parents \nhave expressed interest in becoming involved in the future. Even more \nnoteworthy, although parents were not required to participate, more \nparents volunteered than in past years, and it could be surmised that \nthis ``mock election'' contributed to the historically high voter \nturnout in that area of Idaho for the real elections in November.\n  Thomas Jefferson said: ``If a nation expects to be ignorant and free, \nin a state of civilization, it expects what never was and never will \nbe.'' I congratulate the outstanding efforts of the League of Women \nVoters of Moscow on its remarkable effort to reinforce civic education \nand voter responsibility in Idaho's children.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/06/09/senate-section/article/S6297-1", "month": "06", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6297]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/06/09/senate-section/article/S6297-2", "month": "06", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6297]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/06/09/senate-section/article/S6297-3", "month": "06", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6297]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 2:19 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 2744.

A bill to provide for local control for the siting of \nwindmills; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, in order to protect our Nation's most \nscenic areas, Senator Warner, the senior Senator from Virginia, and I \nare today introducing a revised version of the Environmentally \nResponsible Windpower Act of 2005. It will be introduced in the House \nof Representatives by Congressman John Duncan, a Republican, who is \nchairman of the Water Resources Subcommittee, and by Representative \nBart Gordon, a Democrat, who is the ranking Democrat on the Science and \nTechnology Committee.\n  Senator Warner and I have listened to our colleagues, and we have \nmade several changes in our initial bill to simplify it and to make it \nthe kind of bill we hope all Senators will think makes good sense. What \nwe have done is to simplify the local notification procedures and to \nmore precisely protect scenic areas of the country without impacting \nthe entire coastline. We have also removed a provision regarding \nmilitary bases that was in our bill since that can be addressed in \nother legislation.\n  Our revised bill would do three things:\n  No. 1, to protect America's most scenic treasures, such as the Grand \nCanyon, the Statue of Liberty, and the Great Smoky Mountains National \nPark, and deny Federal subsidies for giant wind turbines within 20 \nmiles of any national park, national military park, national seashore, \nnational lakeshore, or 20 World Heritage sites in the United States.\n  No. 2, to protect our most pristine coastlines, it would deny Federal \nsubsidies for wind turbines less than 20 miles offshore, which is the \nhorizon of a national seashore, a national lakeshore, or a National \nWildlife Refuge.\n  No. 3, to enhance local control, which most of us believe in, it \nwould give communities a 180-day timeout period from when a wind \nproject is filed with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in which \nto review local zoning laws related to the placement of these giant \nwind turbines.\n  This legislation is necessary because my research suggests that if \nthe present policies are continued we will spend over the next 5 years \nnearly $4.5 billion to subsidize windmills. Because of those large \nsubsidies, the number of the giant wind turbines in the United States \nis expected to grow from 6,700 today to 40,000, or even double that \nnumber in 20 years according to estimates by the Department of Energy \nand the Union of Concerned Scientists.\n  These wind turbines are not your grandmother's windmills, gently \npumping water from the farm well. Here is just one example, which my \ncolleagues from Alabama and South Carolina will especially appreciate. \nThe University of Tennessee has the second largest football stadium in \nAmerica, seating 107,000 people. The Senator from Alabama and I sat \nthere while Auburn University beat the tar out of the University of \nTennessee last year. I ask him to imagine that just one of these giant \nwind turbines would fit into that stadium. It would rise to more than \ntwice the height of the highest skybox.\n  Its rotor blades would stretch almost from 10-yard line to 10-yard \nline. And on a clear night, its flashing red lights could be seen for \n20 miles. Usually, these wind turbines are located in wind farms \ncontaining 20 or more, but the number can be more than 100. They work \nbest, of course, where the wind blows best which, in our part of the \ncountry, is along scenic coastlines or scenic ridgetops.\n  Now, reasonable Members of this body may disagree about the cost, \neffectiveness, and appropriateness of such wind turbines. We can have \nthat debate at another time. But at least we ought to be able to agree \nnot to subsidize building them in places that damage our most scenic \nareas and coastlines.\n  Since wind turbines of this giant size are such a relatively new \nphenomenon, it fits our American traditions to give local communities \ntime to stop and think about their most appropriate location.\n  In conclusion, Mr. President, let me emphasize that our legislation \ndoes not prohibit the building of a single wind turbine. It only denies \na Federal taxpayer subsidy in highly scenic areas. And it ensures local \ngovernments have the time to review wind turbine proposals.\n  This revised version does not give local authorities any power they \ndo not already have. It simply gives them a little time to act.\n  We intend to offer our legislation as an amendment when the full \nSenate debates the Energy bill next week, and we hope our colleagues \nwill join us in this effort to ensure the Federal Government does not \nprovide tax incentives that ruin the beauty of our most pristine and \nscenic areas around our country.\n  Egypt has its pyramids, Italy has its art, England has its history, \nand the United States has the great American outdoors. We should prize \nthat and protect it where we can. One way to do that is to make sure \nwhen we look at the Statue of Liberty, when we look at the Great Smoky \nMountains, when we look at the Grand Canyon, we do not have giant \nwindmills, twice as tall as Neyland Stadium, with flashing red lights, \nin between us and that landscape.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthe text of the legislation which Senator Warner and I are introducing, \na copy of the attachment which includes the approximately 200 highly \nscenic sites that could be protected by the Environmentally Responsible \nWindpower Act of 2005, and two editorials from Tennessee newspapers--\none from the Chattanooga Times Free Press and one from the Knoxville \nNews Sentinel--which comment on the previous legislation we introduced.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1208\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn., has introduced a bill in \n     Congress designed to avoid having an army of huge windmills \n     slip up on us without sufficient warning.\n       The senator says an effort is being made to require \n     electric companies to produce 10 percent of their power from \n     ``renewable'' sources. That means wind, hydro, solar, \n     geothermal and biomass power. Sounds good on the surface, \n     doesn't it? The trouble is that there are few opportunities \n     for substantial power generation by these means except by \n     wind. What would that mean?\n       ``The idea of windmills,'' said Sen. Alexander, conjures up \n     pleasant images--of Holland and tulips, of rural America . . \n     . My grandparents had such a windmill at their well pump . . \n     . But the windmills we are talking about today are not your \n     grandmother's windmills.\n       ``Each one is typically 100 yards tall, two stories taller \n     than the Statue of Liberty, taller than a football field is \n     long.\n       ``These windmills are wider than a 747 jumbo jet.\n       ``Their rotor blades turn at 100 miles per hour.\n       ``These towers and their flashing red lights can be seen \n     from more than 25 miles away.\n       ``Their noise can be heard from up to a half-mile away. It \n     is a thumping and swishing sound. It has been described by \n     residents that are unhappy with the noise as sounding like a \n     brick wrapped in a towel tumbling in a clothes drier on a \n     perpetual basis.\n       ``These windmills produce very little power since they only \n     operate when the wind blows enough or doesn't blow too much, \n     so they are usually placed in large wind farms covering huge \n     amounts of land.\n       ``As an example, if the Congress ordered electric companies \n     to build 10 percent of their power from renewable energy--\n     which as we have said, has to be mostly wind--and if we renew \n     the current subsidy each year, by the year 2025, my state of \n     Tennessee would have at least 1,700 windmills, which would \n     cover land almost equal to two times the size of the city of \n     Knoxville.''\n       Do these revelations by Sen. Alexander, accompanied by the \n     prospect that $3.7 billion of your taxes might be required \n     for subsidies over five years, cause you to want to have \n     100,000 of these huge, red lighted, noisy, thumping windmills \n     erected throughout the United States, with 1,700 of them in \n     Tennessee--perhaps in your neighborhood?\n       Talk about ``pollution'' of area, sound and sight!\n       Surely, non-polluting nuclear power and other energy \n     sources would be better. The windmill subsidies could be used \n     better to promote cleaner, more efficient and cheaper coal, \n     gas and oil technology.\n       Sen. Alexander said the purpose of his legislation, in \n     which Sen. John Warner, R-Va., has joined, is to be sure that \n     ``local authorities have a chance to consider the impact of \n     such massive new structures before dozens or hundreds of them \n     begin to be built in their communities.''\n       For that fair warning, we should give thanks. If you have \n     seen windmill farms in California, Texas or Hawaii, you will \n     surely understand why the warning is appropriate.\n       Don Quixote thought he had problems with windmills, He \n     hadn't seen the kind Sen. Alexander is talking about.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                        [KnoxNews, June 9, 2005]\n\n                  Windmills Need Commonsense Approach\n\n       U.S. Sen. Lamar Alexander has unleashed a storm of \n     controversy among environmentalists over windmills, but we \n     think he is using a commonsense approach.\n       Alexander has introduced legislation that would restrict \n     tax credits for new windmills, and he has asked TVA to place \n     a moratorium on new windmills.\n       Alexander's bill would give local governments veto power \n     over wind farm projects and require environmental impact \n     statements for windmill construction in offshore areas and \n     within 20 miles of certain scenic areas, such as the Great \n     Smoky Mountains National Park, and military bases.\n       The provision on eliminating tax credits for projects in \n     those restricted areas, however, is what has drawn criticism \n     from environmentalists and windmill manufacturers.\n       Stephen Smith of the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy \n     said the legislation is ``the most direct assault on wind \n     power we've ever seen by a United States senator.''\n       Jaime Steve, a lobbyist for the American Wind Energy \n     Association, said wind energy could bring up to 4,500 new \n     jobs and $4.2 billion in investment to the state in the next \n     five or six years.\n       Alexander released a statement that said his bill would \n     protect scenic areas and give local citizens more control. \n     ``It keeps those 100-yard-tall, monstrous structures away \n     from Signal Mountain, Lookout Mountain,\n\n[[Page S6304]]\n\n     Roan Mountain, the Tennessee River Gorge, the foothills of \n     the Smokies and other highly scenic areas,'' Alexander said.\n       ``As for jobs,'' he continued, ``every Tennessee job is \n     important, but I fear that hundreds of these giant windmills \n     across Tennessee's ridges could destroy our tourism industry, \n     which could cost us tens of thousands of jobs.''\n       In remarks on the Senate floor, Alexander said serious \n     questions have been raised about how much relying on wind \n     power will raise the cost of electricity. ``My studies \n     suggest that, at a time when America needs large amounts of \n     low-cost, reliable power, wind produces puny amounts of high-\n     cost unreliable power,'' he said. ``We need lower prices; \n     wind power raises prices.''\n       About his request to TVA, Alexander said the moratorium \n     should be in effect ``until the new TVA board, Congress and \n     local officials can evaluate the impact on these massive \n     structures on our electric rates, our view of the mountains \n     and our tourism industry.''\n       TVA Directors Bill Baxter and Skila Harris responded that \n     TVA has no plans to build more wind turbines in the next two \n     years and beyond.\n       We believe Alexander has raised some serious questions \n     about the effectiveness and efficiency of wind power. While \n     we understand the importance of focusing on new forms of \n     energy to reduce reliance on oil, we agree with Alexander's \n     premise that we must go about it wisely.\n       ``I hope we decide that we need a real national energy \n     policy instead of a national windmill policy,'' Alexander \n     said.\n       We think that's well said.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GREGG:\n  S. 1209. A bill to establish and strengthen postsecondary programs \nand courses in the subjects of traditional American history, free \ninstitutions, and Western civilization, available to students preparing \nto teach these subjects, and to other students; to the Committee on \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, today I am proud to introduce the Higher \nEducation for Freedom Act. This bill will establish a competitive grant \nprogram making funds available to institutions of higher education, \ncenters within such institutions, and associated nonprofit foundations \nto promote both graduate and undergraduate programs focused on the \nteaching and study of traditional American history and government, and \nthe history and achievements of Western Civilization. The program will \nhelp ensure that more postsecondary students have the opportunity to \nparticipate in programs focused on these critical subjects and that \nprospective teachers of history and government have access to a solid \nfoundation of content knowledge.\n  Today, more than ever, it is important to preserve and defend our \ncommon heritage of freedom and civilization, and to ensure that future \ngenerations of Americans understand the importance of traditional \nAmerican history and the principles of free government upon which this \nNation was founded. This knowledge is not only essential to the full \nparticipation of our citizenry in America's civic life, but also to the \ncontinued success of the American experiment in self-government, which \nbinds together a diverse people into a single Nation with common \npurposes.\n  However, college students' lack of historical literacy is quite \nstartling, and too few of our colleges and universities are focused on \nthe task of imparting this fundamental knowledge to the next \ngeneration. A survey of students at America's top colleges found that \nseniors could not identify Valley Forge, words from the Gettysburg \nAddress, or even the basic tenets of the U.S. Constitution. Given high \nschool-level American history questions, 81 percent of the college \nseniors would have received a D or F, the report found. One college \nprofessor informed me that her students did not know which side Lee was \non during the Civil War, or whether the Russians were allies or enemies \nin World War II. A student of hers asked why anyone should care what \nthe Founding Fathers wrote.\n  As unfortunate as these findings are, they are perhaps not \nsurprising. A survey conducted several years ago found that not one of \nAmerica's top fifty colleges and universities required its students to \ntake a course in American history. More recently, another report \ndocumented the extent to which our top postsecondary institutions have \nabandoned the traditional core requirements that once gave students a \nsystemic grasp of our nation's ideals, institutions, and origins. \nIndeed, only about a dozen undergraduate programs at major American \ncolleges and universities have a central focus on American \nconstitutional history and principles.\n  We are doing our students a disservice if we allow them to graduate \nfrom an institution of higher education without a solid understanding \nof and appreciation for our democratic heritage. We cannot hope to \npreserve our democracy without taking action to remedy our students' \nhistorical illiteracy. As Thomas Jefferson once wrote, ``If a nation \nexpects to be ignorant--and free--in a state of civilization, it \nexpects what never was and never will be.'' I believe the time has come \nfor Congress to do something to promote the teaching and study of \ntraditional American history at the postsecondary level, and I urge my \ncolleagues to support this legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1209\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Higher Education for Freedom \n     Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Given the increased threat to American ideals in the \n     trying times in which we live, it is important to preserve \n     and defend our common heritage of freedom and civilization \n     and to ensure that future generations of Americans understand \n     the importance of traditional American history and the \n     principles of free government on which this Nation was \n     founded in order to provide the basic knowledge that is \n     essential to full and informed participation in civic life \n     and to the larger vibrancy of the American experiment in \n     self-government, binding together a diverse people into a \n     single Nation with a common purpose.\n       (2) However, despite its importance, most of the Nation's \n     colleges and universities no longer require United States \n     history or systematic study of Western civilization and free \n     institutions as a prerequisite to graduation.\n       (3) In addition, too many of our Nation's elementary school \n     and secondary school history teachers lack the training \n     necessary to effectively teach these subjects, due largely to \n     the inadequacy of their teacher preparation.\n       (4) Distinguished historians and intellectuals fear that \n     without a common civic memory and a common understanding of \n     the remarkable individuals, events, and ideals that have \n     shaped our Nation and its free institutions, the people in \n     the United States risk losing much of what it means to be an \n     American, as well as the ability to fulfill the fundamental \n     responsibilities of citizens in a democracy.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are to promote and \n     sustain postsecondary academic centers, institutes, and \n     programs that offer undergraduate and graduate courses, \n     support research, sponsor lectures, seminars, and \n     conferences, and develop teaching materials, for the purpose \n     of developing and imparting a knowledge of traditional \n     American history, the American Founding, and the history and \n     nature of, and threats to, free institutions, or of the \n     nature, history, and achievements of Western civilization, \n     particularly for--\n       (1) undergraduate students who are enrolled in teacher \n     education programs, who may consider becoming school \n     teachers, or who wish to enhance their civic competence;\n       (2) elementary school, middle school, and secondary school \n     teachers in need of additional training in order to \n     effectively teach in these subject areas; and\n       (3) graduate students and postsecondary faculty who wish to \n     teach about these subject areas with greater knowledge and \n     effectiveness.\n\n     SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       In this Act:\n       (1) Eligible institution.--The term ``eligible \n     institution'' means--\n       (A) an institution of higher education;\n       (B) a specific program within an institution of higher \n     education; and\n       (C) a non-profit history or academic organization \n     associated with higher education whose mission is consistent \n     with the purposes of this Act.\n       (2) Free institution.--The term ``free institution'' means \n     an institution that emerged out of Western civilization, such \n     as democracy, constitutional government, individual rights, \n     market economics, religious freedom and tolerance, and \n     freedom of thought and inquiry.\n       (3) Institution of higher education.--The term \n     ``institution of higher education'' has the meaning given the \n     term under section 101 of the Higher Education Act of 1965 \n     (20 U.S.C. 1001).\n       (4) Secretary.--The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary \n     of Education.\n       (5) Traditional american history.--The term ``traditional \n     American history'' means--\n\n[[Page S6305]]\n\n       (A) the significant constitutional, political, \n     intellectual, economic, and foreign policy trends and issues \n     that have shaped the course of American history; and\n       (B) the key episodes, turning points, and leading figures \n     involved in the constitutional, political, intellectual, \n     diplomatic, and economic history of the United States.\n\n     SEC. 4.

A bill to enhance the national security of the United States \nby providing for the research, development, demonstration, \nadministrative support, and market mechanisms for widespread deployment \nand commercialization of biobased fuels and biobased products, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and \nForestry.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, over the past 100 years, the economy of \nthe United States has become inextricably tied to the supply of \npetroleum. In the early part of the 20th century, America's abundant \nsources of petroleum helped drive tremendous improvements in quality of \nlife, offering greater mobility through gasoline-powered \ntransportation, and a whole host of new and innovative products made \nfrom plastics and other petroleum-based chemicals.\n  But as the 20th century wore on, the costs of a petroleum-based \neconomy grew increasingly apparent: pollution of air and water became a \ngrowing risk to our health and environment, and a growing dependence on \nforeign imports became an increasing risk to our economic and national \nsecurity. Today, nearly two-thirds of the oil we use comes from \noverseas, much of it from hostile and unstable regimes.\n  Instability in the oil-producing regions of the world, the growing \nthreat of global warming, and record-high prices for gasoline at the \npump all call for a new kind of economy for the 21st century: one based \non a resource that is not only abundant, but clean, renewable and home-\ngrown.\n  Today, biofuels like ethanol and biodiesel are making great inroads \nin reducing our foreign oil dependence. The biofuels industry will \nprovide nearly 4 billion gallons of clean, domestically-produced fuel \nalternatives to gasoline and diesel this year. We need to ensure \ncontinued growth of renewable fuels, first by supporting a robust \nRenewable Fuels Standard of at least 8 billion gallons a year by 2012, \nand then by supporting additional measures to grow the ``bioeconomy.''\n  That is why I am very proud today to be joined by my colleagues, \nSenator Lugar, Senator Obama, and Senator Coleman, in introducing the \nNational Security and Bioenergy Investment Act of 2005. This important \nbipartisan legislation provides the research, development, \ndemonstration, and market mechanisms necessary to move this country \nfrom an economy based largely on foreign oil, to one increasingly \nfueled with clean, renewable, domestically-grown biomass. It is an \nimportant compliment to a robust RFS, and a vital element of our energy \nfuture.\n  According to the National Academies of Science, this country \ngenerates nearly 300 million tons of biomass each year--everything from \ncorn stalks and wheat straw to forest trimmings and even segregated \nmunicipal waste. This biomass is currently sent to landfills or left in \nthe fields after harvest in quantities greater than that needed to \nprovide natural cover and nutrient replacement.\n  The Natural Resources Defense Council estimates that by 2025, an \nadditional 200 million tons of biomass could be generated each year \nfrom dedicated biomass crops such as native switchgrass, hybrid poplar \nand other woody crops, grown throughout the country. These crops \nrequire little or no fertilizer or chemical treatment, while helping to \nenhance soil quality and reduce runoff.\n  Cellulose from biomass can be converted to ethanol, to provide a \nclean transportation fuel with potentially near-zero net carbon dioxide \nand sulfur emissions, and substantially reduced carbon monoxide, \nparticulate and toxic emissions compared to petroleum-based fuel. The \nNatural Resources Defense Council estimates that by 2050 biomass could \nsupply 50 percent of the nation's transportation fuel, dramatically \nreducing our dependence on foreign oil.\n  Other products of the biomass refining process, such as biochemicals \nand bioplastics, can also complement or replace less environmentally-\nfriendly petroleum-based equivalents. For example, if all of the \nplastic used in the United States were made from biomass instead of \npetroleum, the Nation's oil consumption would decrease by 90 to 145 \nmillion barrels a year. Biobased plastics can also be composted and \nconverted back to soil instead of being thrown in a landfill.\n  Biobased chemicals, lubricants and metal-working fluids are all \navailable in the marketplace today, and offer safe, non-toxic \nalternatives to their petroleum-based counterparts. The National \nAcademies of Science found that biomass could meet all of the Nation's \nneeds for organic chemicals, replacing 700 million barrels of petroleum \na year.\n  But perhaps one of the greatest benefits of biobased fuels and \nproducts is to our rural economy. A mature biomass industry would \ncreate more than 1 million jobs and generate $5 billion annually in \nrevenue for farmers. This represents a tremendous opportunity to grow \nand diversify sources of rural income, while reducing our dependence on \nforeign oil, bolstering national security and protecting the \nenvironment.\n  However, several obstacles still remain. Current Federal programs to \ndevelop biomass crops, establish supply chains, and reduce the cost of \nbiofuels production are under-funded and lack appropriate targeting. \nPotential biomass refinery developers remain reluctant to invest in \nconstruction of ``next generation'' plants due to the high level of \nfinancial risk. And, according to a recent report from the Government \nAccountability Office, biobased\n\n[[Page S6306]]\n\npurchase requirements and other bioeconomy measures at the U.S. \nDepartment of Agriculture have not been given the necessary priority \nfor full implementation.\n  A wide range of groups, including the Energy Future Coalition, the \nNational Commission on Energy Policy, the Governors' Ethanol Coalition, \nand the Natural Resources Defense Council, is calling on Congress to \ninvest in the bioeconomy as the best direction for the country's energy \nfuture.\n  The time to act is now.\n  This legislation implements several critical measures to help ensure \nthe widespread deployment and commercialization of biobased fuels and \nproducts over the next 10 years.\n  The bill substantially updates and improves the Biomass Research and \nDevelopment Act by refining its objectives, providing greater focus on \novercoming remaining technical barriers, and increasing funding. It \nauthorizes $1 billion in research and development over five years to \nhelp today's successful biorefineries become the biorefineries of \ntomorrow, while developing advanced biomass crops, crop production \nmethods, harvesting and transport technology to deliver abundant \nbiomass to the refinery door.\n  It creates a reverse auction of production incentives to deliver the \nfirst billion gallons of cellulosic biofuels at the lowest cost to \ntaxpayers. Each year, cellulosic biofuels refiners will bid for \nassistance on a per gallon basis. Refiners who request the lowest level \nof assistance will earn production contracts. As the volume of biofuels \nproduction grows, competition will increase, and per gallon incentive \nrates will decrease. After the first billion gallons of annual \nproduction, cellulosic ethanol is expected to be competitive with \ngasoline without government assistance.\n  It establishes a new Assistant Secretary position for Energy and \nBioproduct Development at USDA to provide the necessary priority and \nresources for bioenergy and bioproduct programs. It expands the Federal \nGovernment biobased product procurement program of the 2002 farm bill \nto include government contractors. It also extends the program to the \nU.S. Capitol Complex, and establishes the Capitol as a showcase for \nbiobased products.\n  It creates grant programs to help small biobased businesses with \nmarketing and certification of biobased products, and funds bioeconomy \ndevelopment associations and Land Grant institutions to support the \ngrowth of regional bioeconomies.\n  The legislation calls on Congress to create tax incentives to \nencourage investment in production of biobased fuels and products, and \nit provides for education and outreach to promote producer investment \nin processing facilities and to heighten consumer awareness of biobased \nfuels and products.\n  Together, these measures will send a strong signal to innovators, \ninvestors and biobased businesses that Congress is committed to \nadvancing the bioeconomy. With full funding, this bill will deliver the \ntechnological advances needed to help make biobased fuels and products \ncost competitive with petroleum-based equivalents, and it will take a \nbig step toward a future in which our cars run on clean-burning \nrenewable fuels, our plastics turn to compost, and our Nation's farmers \nfortify our energy security.\n  The bill has strong support from a broad coalition of agricultural \nproducers, industry, clean energy, environment and national security \ngroups. I have here several letters of endorsement.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill, and the \naccompanying letters of endorsement, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1210\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) the Governors' Ethanol Coalition, in the report \n     entitled ``Ethanol From Biomass America's 21st Century \n     Transportation Fuel'', found that--\n       (A) the dependence of the United States on oil is a major \n     risk to national security and economic and environmental \n     health;\n       (B) the safest and least costly approach to mitigating \n     these risks is to set and achieve aggressive biofuels \n     research, development, production and use goals; and\n       (C) significant investment in cellulosic biofuels, \n     including a dramatic expansion of existing research programs, \n     production and consumer incentives, and commercialization \n     assistance, is needed;\n       (2) the National Academy of Sciences has found that there \n     are abundant sources of waste biomass, and approximately \n     280,000,000 tons of waste biomass generated, in all regions \n     of the United States each year;\n       (3) the Natural Resources Defense Council has estimated \n     that by 2025, 200,000,000 additional tons of biomass could be \n     harvested each year from dedicated energy crops grown \n     throughout the country, yielding $5,000,000,000 annually in \n     profit for farmers;\n       (4) the Department of Agriculture has estimated that energy \n     derived from existing biomass supplies could displace 25 \n     percent of current petroleum imports while still meeting \n     agricultural demands;\n       (5) if all diesel fuel in the United States were blended \n     with a 4-percent blend of biodiesel, crude oil consumption in \n     the United States would be reduced by 300,000,000 barrels \n     each year by 2016;\n       (6) there is sufficient domestic feedstock for the \n     production of at least 8,000,000,000 annual gallons of \n     renewable fuels, including ethanol and biodiesel, by 2012;\n       (7) the Natural Resources Defense Council has estimated \n     that biomass could supply 50 percent of current \n     transportation petroleum demand by 2050;\n       (8) the National Academy of Sciences has estimated that \n     enough agricultural crop residue is produced each year to \n     entirely replace the 700,000,000 barrels of petroleum used in \n     organic chemical production in 2004;\n       (9) the Biotechnology Industry Organization, in its report \n     entitled ``New Biotechnology Tools for a Cleaner \n     Environment'', found that if all plastics in the United \n     States were made from biomass, oil consumption would decrease \n     by up to 145,000,000 barrels per year;\n       (10) the National Academy of Sciences has reported that \n     biobased products have the potential to improve the \n     sustainability of natural resources, environmental quality, \n     and national security while competing economically;\n       (11) the Department of Agriculture has made significant \n     advances in the understanding and use by the United States of \n     biomass as a feedstock for fuels and products;\n       (12) through participation with the Department of Energy in \n     the Biomass Research and Development Initiative, the \n     Department of Agriculture has also made valuable \n     contributions, through grant-making and other initiatives, to \n     the support of biomass research and development at \n     institutions throughout the United States;\n       (13) the Government Accountability Office has found that--\n       (A) actions to implement the requirements of the Farm \n     Security and Rural Investment Act of 2002 (Public Law 107-\n     171; 116 Stat. 134) for purchasing biobased products have \n     been limited; and\n       (B) greater priority by the Department of Agriculture would \n     promote compliance by other agencies with biobased purchasing \n     requirements;\n\n[[Page S6307]]\n\n       (14) an Assistant Secretary of the Department of \n     Agriculture for Energy and Biobased Products would provide \n     the priority, staff, and financial resources to fully \n     implement biobased purchasing requirements and other \n     provisions of the energy title of the Farm Security and Rural \n     Investment Act of 2002;\n       (15) Federal government contractors and the Architect of \n     the Capitol are currently exempt from biobased purchasing \n     requirements of the Farm Security and Rural Investment Act of \n     2002;\n       (16) expansion of those biobased purchasing requirements--\n       (A) to Federal contractors would significantly expand the \n     market for, and advance commercialization of, biobased \n     products; and\n       (B) to the Architect of the Capitol would, in combination \n     with a program of public education, allow the Capitol Complex \n     to serve as a showcase for the existence, use, and benefits \n     of biobased products;\n       (17) fuel derived from cellulosic biomass could have near-\n     zero net carbon dioxide and sulfur emissions, and \n     substantially reduced carbon monoxide, particulate and toxic \n     emissions relative to petroleum-based fuels;\n       (18) the bipartisan National Commission on Energy Policy \n     has predicted that with a dedicated Federal research, \n     development, and demonstration effort, cellulosic ethanol \n     could be less expensive to produce than gasoline by 2015;\n       (19) the 2004 report of the Rocky Mountain Institute, \n     entitled ``Winning the Oil Endgame'', estimated that a mature \n     biomass industry would create up to 1,045,000 jobs;\n       (20) the National Academy of Sciences has found that there \n     are significant opportunities to produce biomass ethanol more \n     efficiently;\n       (21) the National Commission on Energy Policy has found \n     that current Federal programs directed toward reducing the \n     cost of biofuels are under-funded, intermittent, scattered, \n     and poorly targeted;\n       (22) a report commissioned by the Department of Defense \n     urged the United States to invest in a new large-scale \n     initiative to produce biofuels as an alternative supply \n     source, and as a feedstock for future fuel vehicles;\n       (23) the Consumer Federation of America has found that the \n     blending of ethanol into conventional gasoline can \n     significantly benefit consumers by lowering prices at the \n     pump;\n       (24) 45 leading national security, labor, and energy policy \n     experts joined the Energy Future Coalition in supporting a \n     national commitment to cut the oil use of the United States \n     by 25 percent by 2025 through the rapid development and \n     deployment of advanced biomass, alcohol, and other available \n     petroleum fuel alternatives;

Tom Harkin,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Richard Lugar,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Re the National Security and Bioenergy Investment Act of \n         2005.\n\n       Dear Senators Harkin and Lugar: The National Corn Growers \n     Association (NCGA), the American Soybean Association (ASA), \n     and the Renewable Fuels Association are writing to express \n     our support for the National Security and Bioenergy \n     Investment Act of 2005. In particular, we strongly support \n     the increased procurement of biobased products by Federal \n     agencies and all Federal government contractors. Biobased \n     products represent a large potential growth market for corn \n     and soybean growers in areas such as plastics, solvents, \n     packaging and other consumer goods to provide markets for \n     U.S.-grown crops. The biobased product industry has already \n     started to grow, bringing new products to consumers, new \n     markets to growers and new investments to our communities.\n       The procurement of biobased products promotes energy and \n     environmental security. Products made from corn and soybeans \n     could replace a variety of items currently produced from \n     petroleum, and aid in reducing dependence on imported oil. \n     Already the production of ethanol and biodiesel reduces \n     imports by more than 140 million barrels of oil. The \n     production of biobased products generates less greenhouse gas \n     than traditional petroleum-based items. There are also \n     tremendous opportunities for grower-owned processing \n     facilities and rural American and agriculture as a whole. New \n     jobs and investments will be brought into rural communities, \n     as new processing and manufacturing facilities move into \n     those communities to be near renewable feed stocks.\n       NCGA, ASA and RFA applaud your continued efforts to promote \n     the use of biobased products that will encourage the \n     development of new markets for corn and soybeans and \n     ultimately help to revitalize rural economies and the \n     agriculture industry as a whole. We have been avid supporters \n     of the biobased products industry, and we look forward to \n     working with you as you continue to provide vision and \n     direction for this emerging industry.\n           Sincerely,\n     Leon Corzine,\n       President, National Corn Growers Association.\n     Neal Bredehoeft,\n       President, American Soybean Association.\n     Bob Dinneen,\n       President, Renewable Fuels Association.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                 Governors' Ethanol Coalition,\n\n                                        Lincoln, NE, June 9, 2005.\n     Hon.

Norm Coleman,\n     Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators: On behalf of the thirty members of the \n     Governors' Ethanol Coalition, we strongly support and endorse \n     the National Security and Bioenergy Investment Act of 2005, \n     as well as your efforts to expand development of other \n     biofue1s and co-products. The Governors' Ethanol Coalition is \n     pleased that this bill embodies the recommendations developed \n     by the Coalition in Ethanol From Biomass, America's 21st \n     Century Transportation Fuel. When signed into law, this act \n     will catalyze needed research, production, and use of \n     biofue1s and bio-based products, thereby enhancing our \n     economic, environmental, and national security.\n       The Coalition believes that the nation's dependency on \n     imported oil presents a huge risk to this country's future. \n     The combination of political tensions in major oi1-producing \n     nations with growing oil demand from China and India is \n     seriously threatening our national security. Moreover, as we \n     import greater amounts of oil each year, we are draining more \n     and more of the wealth from our states.\n       The key provisions contained in your bill bring focus and \n     resources to biomass-derived ethanol research and \n     commercialization efforts. The result, over time, will be the \n     replacement of significant amounts of imported oil with \n     domestically produced fuels--improving our rural economies, \n     cleaning our air, and contributing to our national security. \n     Of particular importance is the bill's aim to broaden ethanol \n     production to include all regions of the nation so that many \n     more states will reap the benefits of biofuels.\n       Again, thank you for inclusion of the Coalition's \n     recommendations in this landmark legislation. Please let us \n     know how the Coalition can help with the passage of this very \n     important legislation. The continued expansion of ethanol \n     production and use, particularly biomass-derived fuels, and \n     the accompanying economic growth and environmental benefits \n     for our states is essential to the nation's long-term \n     economic vitality and national security.\n           Sincere1y,\n     Tim Pawlenty,\n       Chair, Governor of Minnesota.\n     Kathleen Sebelius,\n       Vice Chair, Governor of Kansas.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                         Energy FutureSM Coalition,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, June 8, 2005.\n     Hon. Tom Harkin,\n     Hon. Richard G. Lugar,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Harkin and Lugar: On behalf of the Energy \n     Future Coalition, I am writing to commend your leadership and \n     vision in drafting the National Security and Bioenergy \n     Investment Act of 2005.\n       In our judgment, America's growing dependence on foreign \n     oil endangers our national and economic security. We believe \n     the Federal government should undertake a major new \n     initiative to curtail U.S. oil consumption through improved \n     efficiency and the rapid development and deployment of \n     advanced biomass, alcohol and other available petroleum fuel \n     alternatives.\n       With such a push, we believe domestic biofuels can cut the \n     nation's oil use by 25 percent by 2025, and substantial \n     further reductions are possible through efficiency gains from \n     advanced technologies. That is an ambitious goal, but it is \n     also an extraordinary opportunity for American leadership, \n     innovation, job creation, and economic growth.\n       You took an important step forward by introducing S. 650, \n     the Fuels Security Act, incorporated into the Senate energy \n     bill during Committee markup. This legislation is another \n     important step, authorizing the additional research and \n     development and federal incentives needed to accelerate the \n     adoption of biobased fuels and coproducts. We are pleased to \n     support it.\n            Sincerely,\n     Reid Detchon.\n                                  ____\n\n                                            Biotechnology Industry\n\n\n                                                 Organization,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, June 8, 2005.\n     Hon. Tom Harkin,\n      Ranking Democratic Member.\n     Hon. Richard Lugar,\n     Member, U.S. Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition and \n         Forestry, Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Harkin and Lugar: The Biotechnology Industry \n     Organization (BIO) Industrial and Environmental Section fully \n     supports the National Security and Bioenergy Investment Act \n     of 2005. We greatly appreciate your vision and initiative to \n     expand the Biomass Research and Development Act and to create \n     new incentives to produce biofuels and biobased products.\n       America's growing dependence on foreign energy is eroding \n     our national security. We must take steps to drastically \n     increase production of domestic energy. As an active \n     participant in the Energy Future Coalition, BIO believes this \n     country needs a major new initiative to more aggressively \n     research, develop and deploy advanced biofuels technologies. \n     With sufficient government support, we can meet up to 25% of \n     our transportation fuel needs by converting farm crops and \n     crop residues to transportation fuel.\n       The National Security and Bioenergy Investment Act of 2005 \n     will boost the use of industrial biotechnology to produce \n     fuels and biobased products from renewable agricultural \n     feedstocks. With the use of new biotech tools, we can now \n     utilize millions of tons of crop residues, such as corn \n     stover and wheat straw, to produce sugars that can then be \n     converted to ethanol, chemicals and bio-based plastics. These \n     biotech tools can only be rapidly deployed if federal policy \n     makers take steps to help our innovative companies get over \n     the initial hurdles they face during\n\n[[Page S6312]]\n\n     the commercialization phase of bioenergy production and your \n     bill will help get that job done.\n       We are pleased to endorse this visionary legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n     Brent Erickson,\n       Executive Vice President, Biotechnology Industry \n     Organization.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                            Natural Resources Defense Council,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, June 7, 2005.\n       Dear Senators Harkin and Lugar: The Natural Resources \n     Defense Council strongly supports the National Security and \n     Bioenergy Investment Act of 2005, which you introduced today. \n     This important bill would expand and refine research, \n     development, demonstration and deployment efforts for the \n     production of energy from crops grown by farmers here in \n     America. The bill would also expand and improve the \n     Department of Agriculture's efforts to promote a biobased \n     economy, federal bio-energy and bio-product purchasing \n     requirements, and federal educational efforts.\n       The Research and Development (R) title of this bill \n     continues your tradition of leadership in this area by \n     updating the Biomass Research and Development Act of 2000, \n     which you also crafted. This title will not only extend the \n     provisions of the original bill and greatly increase the \n     funding for these provisions, it will also refine the \n     direction of this funding. Taken together, these changes \n     maximize the impacts of R on the greatest challenges facing \n     cellulosic biofuels today.\n       Your bill also creates extremely important production \n     incentives for the first one billion gallons of cellulosic \n     biofuels. The production incentives approach taken by the \n     bill--a combination of fixed incentives per gallon at first, \n     switching over to a reverse auction--will maximize the \n     development of cellulosic biofuels production while \n     minimizing the cost to taxpayers.\n       In addition, the bill creates an Assistant Secretary of \n     Agriculture for Energy and Biobased Products. Coupled with \n     the bill's development grants, tax incentives, biobased \n     product procurement provisions, and educational program, the \n     bill would make a huge contribution to developing a \n     sustainable biobased economy, reducing our oil dependence and \n     improving our national security.\n       The technologies advanced by this bill will undoubtedly \n     make important contributions to reducing our global warming \n     pollution and the air and water pollution that comes from our \n     dependence on fossil fuels. We are concerned, however, that \n     the eligibility provisions for forest biomass do not exclude \n     sensitive areas that need protecting, including roadless \n     areas, old growth forests, and other endangered forests, and \n     do not restrict eligibility to renewable sources or prohibit \n     possible conversion of native forests to plantations. We know \n     that you do not want to see this admirable legislation \n     applied in ways that exploit these features, and will be \n     happy to work with you in the future to take any steps needed \n     if abuses arise.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Karen Wayland,\n     Legislative Director.\n                                  ____\n\n                                             Environmental Law and\n\n\n                                                Policy Center,\n\n                                        Chicago, IL, June 8, 2005.\n     Hon. Tom Harkin,\n     Hon. Richard G. Lugar,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Harkin and Lugar: The Environmental Law and \n     Policy Center (``ELPC'') is pleased to support the National \n     Security and Bioenergy Investment Act of 2005, and we commend \n     you for your leadership and vision in introducing this \n     legislation. This bill would accelerate research, \n     development, demonstration and production efforts for energy \n     from farm crops in the United States, especially cellulosic \n     ethanol. It also will expand and prioritize the United States \n     Department of Agriculture's leadership responsibilities to \n     promote clean and sustainable energy development, and it will \n     increase procurement of biobased products.\n       By significantly expanding the development and production \n     of clean energy ``cash crops,'' this legislation will improve \n     our environmental quality, stimulate significant rural \n     economic development, and strengthen our national energy \n     security. ELPC also appreciates that this legislation \n     reflects your longstanding support for farm-based sustainable \n     energy programs. ELPC strongly supported your successful \n     efforts to create the new Energy Title in the 2002 Farm Bill, \n     which established groundbreaking new federal incentives for \n     renewable energy and energy efficiency, while renewing \n     existing programs such as the Biomass Research and \n     Development Act of 2000.\n       The National Security and Bioenergy Investment Act of 2005 \n     is a natural complement to the 2002 Farm Bill Energy Title \n     programs, and it will help to strengthen support for the \n     right bioenergy production programs in the 2007 Farm Bill. \n     Accordingly, ELPC is pleased to support this legislation.\n           Very truly yours,\n                                                Howard A. Learner,\n     Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                            Institute for Local Self-Reliance,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, June 6, 2005.\n     Hon. Tom Harkin,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Tom Harkin: Congratulations on your bill, \n     National Security and Bioenergy Investment Act of 2005. It is \n     a breakthrough piece of legislation. Your well-conceived \n     bill, combining needed executive branch changes, welcome \n     increases in research and development funding and innovative \n     commercialization techniques, can move the use of plants as a \n     fuel and industrial material from the margins of the economy \n     to the mainstream. I urge everyone with an interest in our \n     environmental, agricultural and economic future to support \n     this bill.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     David Morris,\n                                                   Vice President.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BINGAMAN:\n  S. 1211. A bill to establish an Office of Foreign Science and \nTechnology Assessment to enable the United States to effectively \nanalyze trends in foreign science and technology, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on foreign Relations.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President--I rise today to introduce a bill that \nwould establish a capability within the State Department Science \nAdvisor's Office to assess science and technology outside the United \nStates.\n  Over the past two years I have traveled to Taiwan, China and India to \nbetter understand why these developing countries' economies were \ngrowing so rapidly. I learned that in all cases the primary reason for \ntheir robust growth was the emergence of a well-trained science and \nengineering workforce that tied directly into their highly competitive \ninnovation economies.\n  For instance, Taiwan now leads the world in general purpose foundry \ncomputer chip facilities, controlling about 70 percent of the world \nmarket. A recent Defense Science Board Report entitled ``High \nPerformance Microchip Supply'' notes that by the end of 2005 there will \nbe 59 300mm chip fabrication plants with only 16 of these located in \nthe United States. The number of U.S. plants has remained constant for \nthe past two years, so as the number of Asian foundries has risen, the \nshare of these advanced chip making facilities has declined from 30 to \n20 percent. This report also notes that capital expenditures in the \nU.S. chip industry has fallen from a high of 42 percent in 2001 to 33 \npercent in 2004. Conversely, Taiwan's investment has increased from 15 \npercent in 2002 to 20 percent of the world's capital expenditure in \nchip facilities and now leads Korea, Japan, and Europe.\n  There is a good explanation as to why countries such as Taiwan are \nrapidly rising in the high-technology world. Since 1984 Taiwan has made \nsteady increases in their investments in the building of science based \nresearch parks. Hsinchu, their flagship science park, now has over 324 \nhigh technology companies, generating over $22 billion annually in \ngross revenues, and employing a high technology work force exceeding \n100,000. This science park is bounded by two universities and contains \nsix national laboratories. Taiwan is now building science parks in the \nmiddle and south of the island to concentrate on other fields such as \nnanoscience, optoelectronics, and biotechnology. These parks are the \nresult of a number of carefully crafted government policies and \nincentives dealing with taxes, real estate, and fundamental research. \nIn the area of technology transfer, the Taiwan government helped set up \nthe world famous Industrial Technology Research Institute (ITRI) which \nhas over 5,000 scientists working to spin out laboratory ideas across \nthe ``valley of death'' into new industries. Remarkably, the two chip \nfoundry companies which now control 70 percent of the world's foundry \nmarket were launched from ITRI. As a result of this rapid economic \ngrowth, Taiwan's technical universities are now world class with their \nown excellent graduate programs. The reason they are side-by-side with \nthese large science parks is to supply a steady stream of talented \nresearchers.\n  Recently, our National Academy of Sciences noted in its report, \n``International Graduate Students and Postdoctoral Scholars,'' that \nTaiwan's domestic economic growth has led to fewer Taiwanese students \napplying to U.S. graduate schools. For the past two decades, Taiwan's \nstudents were the core supply of talent in our innovative science and \nengineering graduate school programs. Of equal concern, the successful \nTaiwanese scholars who attended graduate school in the United States 20 \nor 30 years ago are now returning home and giving back their\n\n[[Page S6313]]\n\nprofessional wisdom to advance on their birth country's high-technology \nleadership.\n  This same story holds true for India. My visit there this January \nyielded similar observations on their rapidly developing high \ntechnology sector. Since 1990, India has invested in the development of \nsoftware and technology parks and currently has over 40 spread \nthroughout the country. These parks were responsible for much of the \nhigh technology development in software and biotechnology. Indeed, \nmultinational companies such as Intel, Microsoft and GE have built \nlarge research centers there to tap into the intellectual power \neducated at the Indian Institutes of Technology and the Indian \nInstitute of Science. GE's Jack Welch R Center in Bangalore has 2,300 \nPh.D.'s conducting research in all aspects of their product lines. \nIndia's GE center now directs their plastics plant in Indiana on how to \noperate more efficiently in real time over the internet. Intel's \nresearch center has 2,000 product engineers designing the chips \nAmericans will use in our computers and home entertainment centers next \nholiday season. The chips designed at Intel's Bangalore center are \nfabricated at their plant in Albuquerque. The tables have turned rather \ndramatically. We used to design the chips here and then they were \nmanufactured overseas.\n\n  When I visited Infosys, one of India's largest software companies, I \nwas advised that in 2004 they received 1.2 million on-line employment \napplications, gave a standardized test to 300,000 job seekers \ninterviewed 30,000, and then hired 10,000. They expect to repeat this \nsame process again this year, which illustrates the deep pool of well \ntrained talent that India has available. A number of the India's \nleading biotech entrepreneurs I visited with told me they weren't so \nmuch afraid of losing talent to the U.S. as they were to Singapore, \nwith its burgeoning government investments in biotechnology.\n  Similar to Taiwan, the National Academy report also documents a rapid \ndrop in Indian student applications to U.S. graduate schools. India's \nrapidly developing economy encourages the best and brightest students \nto stay home and study in India rather than consider U.S. graduate \nschools. For the past 20 years, we have relied on this influx of the \ncream of the academic crop I from India and Taiwan to form the high-\ntech startup companies of Silicon Valley.\n  The stark question before us--whether it involves India, Taiwan, \nChina, or Singapore is: are we missing the bigger picture? By the time \nwe realize we have a problem in innovation and our investments in \nscience and engineering investments, will it be too late? Will these \nPacific Rim countries have climbed past us up the value chain, and will \nthey be able to produce equally innovative high technology product at \nfar cheaper costs?\n  The bill I am introducing today, may be small, but the consequences \nare enormous. This measure proposes to authorize a capability in the \noffice of the Science Advisor to the Secretary of State to conduct \nassessments of the science and technology capabilities in other \ncountries such as India, China and Taiwan.\n  The director of this office will report to the Secretary of State's \nScience Advisor. The office will to the maximum extent possible utilize \nfirms that can conduct science and technology assessments in the \ncountry of interest to minimize and augment the federal staff. That is \nwhy I have proposed giving the office generous contracting authorities \nwith respect to soliciting contracts and disbursing funds so that it \nmay move quickly to gather information on certain topics so that we as \na nation are not caught by surprise by an advance in a high technology \narea.\n  Additionally, this legislation authorizes a Foreign Science and \nTechnology Assessment Panel whose purpose is to look over the horizon \nand choose topics and technologies to assess, as well as to evaluate \nthe timeliness and quality of the reports generated. These reports are \nto be publicly available, benefiting not only our government by \nensuring the nation's leadership in science and engineering, but also \nour private sector, especially those high technology firms that must \nsuccessfully compete in a fierce global market. The panel members, to \nbe selected by the Secretary of State in consultation with the Director \nof the Office of Science and Technology Policy, will be distinguished \nleaders who have expert knowledge about our competitors' capabilities \nin science and technology.\n  High technology moves at a rapid rate, and every sign I picked up \nfrom my science and technology trips to China, India, Taiwan and Japan \nindicates to me that our government seems to be asleep at the switch \nhere at home with regard to understanding how quickly these countries \nare moving up the value chain from simple manufacturing to sustained \nefforts in science and engineering that matches if not exceeds us in \nthe innovation cycle. This bill, while a small step forward, will serve \nto ensure that we constantly assess where other countries are in that \nvalue chain and to make sure we are doing everything possible to \nmaintain our leadership in fields of high technology.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1211\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to require the Commandant of the Coast Guard to \nconvey the Coast Guard Cutter Mackinaw, upon its scheduled \ndecommissioning, to the City and County of Cheboygan, Michigan, to use \nfor purposes of a museum; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nthat will convey the United States Coast Guard Cutter Mackinaw to the \nCity and County of Cheboygan for use as a museum.\n  The United States Coast Guard Cutter Mackinaw, or the ``Big Mac'' as \nshe is affectionately called, was commissioned on December 20, 1944. \nCongress commissioned her construction during World War II to keep the \nshipping lanes open during winter months to maintain the production of \nsteel. The Mackinaw has provided 60 years of outstanding service to the \ncommunities and commercial enterprises of the Great Lakes.\n  The Mackinaw was a state of the art ice breaker ideally suited for \nthe Great Lakes because of her shallower draft, wider beam, and longer \nlength than the polar ice breakers that her design was based on. These \nattributes enable the Mackinaw to break a 70 foot wide channel through \n4 feet of solid blue ice to accommodate the largest of the Great Lakes \nore carriers. She has also plowed through a remarkable 37 feet of \nbroken ice.\n  The Mackinaw breaks ice for 12 of the 42 weeks of the Great Lakes \nshipping season. Typically, the Mackinaw begins her ice breaking season \nin the first week of March in the Straights of Mackinac and works her \nway up through the Soo Locks, to Whitefish Bay and areas of the St. \nMary's River before heading to Lake Superior. During her lifetime, the \nMackinaw has enabled the shipping season to start sooner and last \nlonger to enable the annual delivery of 15 tons of iron ore and other \nmaterials. Later in the year the Mackinaw works in the lower Lakes' \nareas where she serves as a buoy tender, carries fuel and supplies to \nlight stations, serves as a training ship, and assists vessels in \ndistress when necessary.\n  The Mackinaw has been stationed in Cheboygan since she began \noperations in the end of December 1944. She will serve through the \nwinter of 2005 and 2006 and then be decommissioned by the Coast Guard. \nThe Mackinaw will be a great local attraction, encourage tourism, build \njobs and aid the local economy.\n  The City of Cheboygan and the surrounding community are committed to \ntransforming this historic landmark into a museum after she has been \ndecommissioned. I am hopeful that she will be maintained for the public \nfor years to come. While her age has made her expensive to maintain, \nthe Mackinaw can still teach our children and visitors of Michigan's \nGreat Lakes heritage.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1212\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow a \nrefundable credit against income tax for the purchase of a principal \nresidence by a first-time homebuyer; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I believe ``home'' is one of the warmest \nwords in the English language. At the end of a long day, I think the \nfavorite phrase of every hardworking man and woman in this country is: \n``Well, I'll see you tomorrow. I'm going home now.''\n  And, that is why I rise today to introduce the First Time Homebuyers' \nTax Credit Act of 2005.\n  The bill I am introducing will spread that warmth by opening the door \nto homeownership to millions of hardworking families, helping them \ncover the initial down payment and closing costs.\n  This initiative is in keeping with our longstanding national policy \nof encouraging homeownership.\n  Owning a home has always been a fundamental part of the American \ndream.\n  We, in Congress, have long recognized the social and economic value \nin high rates of homeownership through laws that we have enacted, such \nas the mortgage interest tax deduction and the capital gains exclusion \non the sale of a home.\n  Over the life of a loan, the mortgage interest tax deduction can save \nhomeowners thousands of dollars that they could use for other necessary \nfamily expenses such as education or health care.\n  These benefits, however, are only available to individuals who own \ntheir own home.\n  It is important also to note that owning a home is a principle and \nreliable source of savings as homeowners build equity over the years \nand their homes appreciate.\n  For many people, it is home equity--not stocks--that help them \nthrough the retirement years.\n  In addition, owning a home insulates people from spikes in housing \ncosts.\n  Indeed, while rents may go up, the costs of a fixed monthly mortgage \npayment, in relative terms, will go down over the course of the \nmortgage.\n  Clearly, one of the biggest barriers to homeownership for working \nfamilies is the cost of a down payment and the costs associated with \nclosing a mortgage.\n  According to the Mortgage Bankers Association, typical closing costs \non an average sized loan of $200,000 can approach approximately $6,000.\n  Even with mortgage products that allow a down payment of 3 percent of \nthe value of a home, total costs can quickly approach $9,000.\n  This is an impossible amount to save for those who are working hard \nto make ends meet. The problem is only getting worse as home values \nclimb faster than families can save for a down payment.\n  To address this problem, I am introducing the First Time Homebuyers' \nTax Credit Act of 2005.\n  My bill authorizes a one-time tax credit of up to $3,000 for \nindividuals and $6,000 for married couples.\n  This credit is similar to the existing mortgage interest tax \ndeduction in that it creates incentives for people to buy a home.\n  To be eligible for the credit, taxpayers must be first-time \nhomebuyers who were within the 25 percent bracket or lower in the year \nbefore they purchase their home. That is $71,950 for single filers, \n$102,800 for heads of household, and $119,950 for joint returns. There \nis a dollar-for-dollar phase-out beyond the cap.\n\n[[Page S6315]]\n\n  Normally, tax credits like this are an after-the-fact benefit. They \ndo little to get people actually into a home.\n  What is particularly innovative and beneficial about the tax credit \nin this bill, however, is that, for the first time, the taxpayer can \neither claim the credit in the year after he or she buys a first home \nor the taxpayer can transfer the credit directly to a lender at \nclosing.\n  The transferred credit would go toward helping with the down payment \nor closing costs. This is cash at the table.\n  As mandated in the bill, the eligible homebuyer would have the money \nfor the lender from the Treasury within 30 days of application.\n  I am happy to say that this legislation has had strong support. When \nthis bill was first introduced in 2003 it garnered the support of: The \nAmerican Bankers Association, America's Community Bankers, the Housing \nPartnership Network, the National Housing Conference, the National \nCongress for Community Economic Development, the National Council of La \nRaza, the National Association of Affordable Housing Lenders, the \nManufactured Housing Institute, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, National \nCommunity Reinvestment Coalition, Standard Federal Bank, Habitat for \nHumanity, and, the National American Indian Housing Council.\n  Clearly, the breadth and diversity of support is strong for this \nlegislation.\n  This is a bold and aggressive effort to reach out to a large number \nof working families to help them get into this first home.\n  The Joint Committee on Taxation has estimated that more than fifteen \nmillion working people would get into their first home over the next \nseven years because of this new tax credit.\n  We are working to send a message to people all over the country that \nif you are working hard to save up enough to get into that first home, \nthe Federal government will make a strategic investment in your \nfamily--it will offer a hand up.\n  This is not unlike what we already do through the mortgage interest \ntax deduction for millions of people who are fortunate enough to \nalready own their own home.\n  We certainly won't do all the hard work for you. You must be frugal \nand save and do most of the work yourself, but we, in Congress, \nunderstand that it is good for America to enhance homeownership.\n  We also understand that this sort of investment in working families \nstimulates the economy.\n  No one can deny that when the First Time Homebuyers' Tax Credit is \nenacted and used by millions of people, every single time the credit is \nused, it will be stimulative. Why?\n  Because it means someone bought a house. And that generates economic \nactivity for multiple small business people. House appraisers and \nInspectors. Realtors. Lenders. Title insurers. And so on. And there is \na ripple of economic activity by the new homeowners as they fix up \ntheir new homes and get settled in.\n  Housing has been such a bright light in the sluggish economy we've \nfaced for the last several years. My bill is designed to ensure that \nthe housing sector remains a strong component of our economy.\n  Finally, let me close by emphasizing how happy and proud I am that \nthis tax legislation is bipartisan. In a closely divided Senate, and a \nclosely divided Congress, it is so important to work across the aisle \nand Senator Smith, who is a real champion for good housing policy, is \nsomeone I want to work closely with on this bill and other important \nhousing legislation. He understands how housing tax benefits help build \nstrong communities and provide economic security for millions of \nfamilies.\n  I am committed to seeing this legislation passed. And, I welcome the \nchance to work with all of my colleagues to see the dream of \nhomeownership expanded to all people.\n  Home. Sentimentally, it is one of the warmest words in the English \nlanguage. Economically, it's the key word in bringing millions of \nfamilies in from the cold and letting them begin building wealth for \nthemselves and their family.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of this legislation be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1213\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, today I introduce important legislation to \nenable more Americans to realize the dream of homeownership. The First-\nTime Homebuyers' Tax Credit Act that Senator Stabenow and I are \nintroducing would give a one-time tax credit that will help more \nAmericans to become homeowners.\n  Homeownership brings safety and stability to families and their \ncommunities. People who own their homes have the security of knowing \nthat they have a reliable investment, and they are protected from \nspikes in housing costs. Yet despite these advantages, barriers exist \nfor many who are looking to make the leap to homeownership.\n  Even for families and individuals who can make monthly mortgage \npayments, down payment and closing costs can prove too great a burden. \nBased on information from the Mortgage Bankers Association, the average \nloan of $175,000 would incur closing costs of approximately $4,000. \nCombined with even a modest down-payment of as little as 3 percent of a \nhome's value, total costs can quickly approach $9,000 or more.\n  To help Americans achieve the dream of private homeownership, the \nFirst-Time Homebuyer Bill would provide a tax credit of up to $3,000 to \nindividuals and up to $6,000 for families falling within or below the \n27 percent tax bracket.\n  The bill would allow first-time homebuyers to claim the credit on \ntheir tax return or transfer the credit directly to the lender at \nclosing, providing an immediate benefit to potential homeowners. This \ncredit is similar to the Washington DC Homebuyers' Tax Credit.\n  While Congress has enacted legislation to increase incentives for \nhomeownership in the past, including the mortgage interest tax \ndeduction, these benefits are available only to those who already own a \nhome. In contrast, the First Time Homebuyer Bill will help increase \nhomeownership among those who are working towards their first home \npurchase.\n  I thank you for the opportunity to speak today, and I urge my \ncolleagues to support this important legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. SNOWE (for himself, Mr. Reid, Mr. Warner, Mr. Leahy, Mr. \n        Chafee, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Akaka, Mr. Durbin, Ms. \n        Cantwell, and Mr. Lautenberg):\n  S. 1214. A bill to require equitable coverage of prescription \ncontraceptive drugs and devices, and contraceptive services under \nhealth plans; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, this year well over 6 million pregnancies \nwill occur in America. The challenge of raising healthy children and \npreparing them for a changing world is a staggering one indeed. This is \neven more so when so frequently both parents are working. So it is \ntragic that half of all pregnancies today are unplanned. In too many \ncases, this means that the necessary financial, emotional and other \nresources for parenting are simply not present. I think we certainly \nshare a broad consensus that every child should be wanted, and that \nparents should have the resources to ensure their child's health and \nsuccess.\n  This week we have commemorated the 40th anniversary of a landmark \nSupreme Court decision, that of Griswold v. Connecticut, in which the \nright of married couples to contraceptives and family planning \ncounseling was recognized. Yet less than a decade ago, when we examined \nthe state of contraceptive coverage by insurance plans, it certainly \nwas discouraging. While many health plans included coverage for \nprescription drugs, nearly half did not cover even oral contraceptives. \nNeedless to say, many other contraceptive options for women, such as \nthe diaphragm, implants, and injectable methods were covered even less \nfrequently. This is disturbing, as contraception is so vital to a \nwoman's health. Most women will spend just a few years attempting to \nconceive, with the average woman desiring two children. That\n\n[[Page S6317]]\n\nleaves about 30 years in which women need access to safe, affordable \ncontraceptives.\n  The benefits of contraception should be obvious. The maternal death \nrate in the U.S. is only one third what it was back in 1965 before \nGriswold. The same is true for infant survival. Family planning \npreserves a woman's health, and allows couples to ensure that they have \nthe means to give every child the attention, support, and resources \nthey need.\n  So today I am joining again with Senator Reid to introduce \nlegislation to ensure broader access to contraception--to ensure that \nthe promise of Griswold v. Connecticut is fully realized. I thank him \nfor his ongoing leadership on this issue. We both agree that \ncontraception coverage is essential to reducing unwanted pregnancies \nand to ensuring that every couple can employ family planning. The \nEquity in Prescription Insurance and Contraceptive Coverage Act, which \nwe again introduce today, will assure that for those plans which \nprovide prescription drug coverage, contraceptive coverage is not \nexcluded. It further ensures that contraceptive services are provided \nequitably with other outpatient services.\n  Such coverage is just what the Institute of Medicine called for back \nin 1995, when the Institute reported that a lack of coverage was a \nmajor contributor to unwanted pregnancy. Expanding the proportion of \nhealth plans which cover contraception is one of the Surgeon General's \nobjectives for the Healthy People 2010 plan. We can certainly achieve \nthat objective and ensure that in 2010, unwanted pregnancies are \nexceedingly rare.\n  Some may argue that such a mandate creates yet more costs for \nproviders, but the evidence fails to support that notion. We have seen \nthat for every dollar in public funds which is invested in family \nplanning, three dollars is saved in Medicaid costs for pregnancy-\nrelated health care and medical care for newborns. Indeed after we \nacted in 1998 to assure coverage to women in the Federal Employees \nHealth Benefits Program, the Office of Personnel Management concluded \nin 2001 that there was no cost increase due to coverage.\n  Many health providers have come to the same conclusion. I note that \napproximately 90 percent of plans now cover the leading methods of \nreversible contraception. So we have come a long way.\n  There should be no mistake--this issue boils down the principles of \nbasic fairness--fairness for half this Nation's population, fairness in \nhow we view and treat a woman's reproductive health versus every other \nkind of health care need that can be addressed with prescription drugs. \nThe facts are not in dispute B the lack of equitable coverage of \nprescription contraceptives has a very real impact on the lives of \nAmerica's women and, therefore, our society as a whole. This is not \noverstatement, this is reality.\n  All we are saying is that if an employer provides insurance coverage \nfor all other prescription drugs, they must also provide coverage for \nFDA-approved prescription contraceptives--it is that simple, it is that \nfair, and it builds on existing law and jurisprudence.\n  The approach we are taking today has already been endorsed by a total \nof 29 States--including my home State of Maine--that have passed \nsimilar laws since 1998. This is real progress but this piecemeal \napproach to fairness leaves many American women at the mercy of \ngeography when it comes to the coverage they deserve.\n  But fairness is not the only issue. We believe that EPICC not only \nmakes sense in terms of the cost of contraceptives for women, but also \nas a means bridging the pro-choice pro-life chasm by helping prevent \nunintended pregnancies and thereby also preventing abortions. The fact \nof the matter is, we know that there are over three million unintended \npregnancies every year in the United States. We also know that almost \nhalf of those pregnancies result from women who do not use \ncontraceptives. Most of the other half involved inconsistent or \nincorrect use of contraceptives--and in many of these cases, the women \nwould benefit from counseling or provision of a contraceptive which is \nmore appropriate to their circumstances.\n  Surveys consistently demonstrate that almost nine out of ten \nAmericans support contraception access and over 75 percent support laws \nrequiring health insurance plans to cover methods of contraception such \nas birth control pills.\n  The question before us is, if EPICC-style coverage is good enough for \n9 million Federal employees and their dependents, if it is good enough \nfor every Member of Congress and every Senator, why is not it good \nenough for the American people?\n  Women should have control over their reproductive health. It is the \nbest interests of their overall health, their children and their future \nchildren's health--and when we have fewer unintended pregnancies, we \nwill reduce the number of abortions. We need to finally fix this \ninequity in prescription drug coverage and make certain that all \nAmerican women have access to this most basic health need. I thank all \nof those who have supported us in this effort, and call upon each of my \ncolleagues to join us to ensure that more couples have access to family \nplanning to reduce unwanted pregnancies, and to assure the health and \nsecurity of American families.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, this week marks the fortieth anniversary of \nthe U.S. Supreme Court decision in Griswold v. Connecticut that struck \ndown a Connecticut law that had made the use of birth control by \nmarried couples illegal. This decision laid the groundwork for \nwidespread access to birth control for all American women.\n  In the 40 years since this landmark decision, increased access to \nbirth control has contributed to a dramatic improvement in maternal and \ninfant health and has drastically reduced the infant death rate in our \ncountry.\n  In spite of these advances, we still have a long way to go. The \nUnited States has among the highest rates of unintended pregnancies of \nall industrialized nations. Half of all pregnancies in the United \nStates are unintended, and nearly half of those end in abortion.\n  Making contraception more accessible and affordable is one crucial \nstep toward reducing unintended pregnancies, reducing abortions and \nimproving women's health.\n  We cannot allow the pendulum to swing backwards. That is why Senator \nSnowe and I are reintroducing the Equity in Prescription and \nContraception Coverage Act of 2005, EPICC. Over the last 8 years, \nSenator Snowe and I have joined together to advance this important \nlegislation.\n  The EPICC legislation is also a critical component of the Prevention \nFirst Act, S. 20. This legislation includes a number of provisions that \nwill improve women's health, reduce the rate of unintended pregnancy \nand reduce abortions.\n  The legislation we are introducing today proves we can find not only \ncommon ground, but also a commonsense solution to these important \nchallenges.\n  By making sure women can afford their prescription contraceptives, \nour bill will help to reduce the staggering rates of unintended \npregnancy in the United States, and reduce abortions.\n  It is a national tragedy that half of all pregnancies nationwide are \nunintended, and that half of those will end in abortions. It is a \ntragedy, but it doesn't have to be. If we work together, we can prevent \nthese unintended pregnancies and abortions.\n  One of the most important steps we can take to prevent unintended \npregnancies, and to reduce abortions, is to make sure American women \nhave access to affordable, effective contraception.\n  There are a number of safe and effective contraceptives available by \nprescription. Used properly, they greatly reduce the rate of unintended \npregnancies.\n  However, many women simply can't afford these prescriptions, and \ntheir insurance doesn't pay for them, even though it covers other \nprescriptions.\n  This is not fair. We know women on average earn less than men, yet \nthey must pay far more than men for health-related expenses.\n  According to the Women's Research and Education Institute, women of \nreproductive age pay 68 percent more in out-of-pocket medical expenses \nthan men, largely due to their reproductive health-care needs.\n  Because many women can't afford the prescription contraceptives they \nwould like to use, many do without\n\n[[Page S6318]]\n\nthem, and the result, all too often, is unintended pregnancy and \nabortion.\n  This isn't an isolated problem. The fact is, a majority of women in \nthis country are covered by health insurance plans that do not provide \ncoverage for prescription contraceptives\n  This is unfair to women. It is bad policy that causes additional \nunintended pregnancies, and adversely affects women's health.\n  Senator Snowe and I first introduced our legislation in 1997. Since \nthen, the Viagra pill went on the market, and one month later it was \ncovered by most insurance policies.\n  Birth control pills have been on the market since 1960, and today, 45 \nyears later, they are covered by only one-third of health insurance \npolicies.\n  So, today we find ourselves in the inexplicable situation where most \ninsurance policies pay for Viagra, but not for prescription \ncontraceptives that prevent unintentional pregnancies and abortions.\n  This isn't fair, and it isn't even cost-effective, because most \ninsurance policies do cover sterilization and abortion procedures. In \nother words, they won't pay for the pills that could prevent an \nabortion, but they will pay for the procedure itself, which is much \nmore costly.\n  The Federal Employee Health Benefits Program, which has provided \ncontraceptive coverage for several years, shows that adding such \ncoverage does not make the plan more expensive.\n  In December 2000, the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, \nEEOC ruled that an employer's failure to include insurance coverage for \nprescription contraceptives, when other prescription drugs and devices \nare covered, constitutes unlawful sex discrimination under Title VII of \nthe Civil Rights Act of 1964.\n  On June 12, 2001, a Federal district court in Seattle made the same \nfinding in the case of Erickson vs. Bartell Drug Company.\n  These decisions confirm what we have known all along: contraceptive \ncoverage is a matter of equity and fairness for women.\n  We are not asking for special treatment of contraceptives, only \nequitable treatment within the context of an existing prescription drug \nbenefit.\n  This legislation is right because it is fair to women.\n  It is right because it is more cost-effective than other services, \nincluding abortions, sterilizations and tubal ligations, costly \nprocedures that most insurance companies routinely cover.\n  And it is right because it will prevent unintended pregnancies and \nreduce abortions, goals we all share.\n  This is common sense, common-ground legislation, and it is long \noverdue.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GREGG (for himself, Ms, Mikulski, Mr. Sarbanes, Mr. Biden, \n        Mr. Corzine, Ms. Snowe, Mr. Reed, Ms. Cantwell, Mrs. Murray, \n        Mr. Cochran, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Inouye, and Mrs. Feinstein):\n  S. 1215. A bill to authorize the acquisition of interests in \nunderdeveloped coastal areas in order better to ensure their protection \nfrom development; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I rise today along with Senator Mikulski to \nintroduce the Coastal and Estuarine Land Protection Act. We are \nintroducing this much needed coastal protection act along with Senators \nSarbanes, Biden, Corzine, Snowe, Reed, Cantwell, Murray, Cochran, \nKerry, Wyden, and Inouye. In addition, this legislation is supported by \nthe Trust for Public Land, Coastal States Organization, International \nAssociation of Fish and Wildlife Agencies, Association of National \nEstuary Programs, the Land Trust Alliance, Society for the Protection \nof New Hampshire Forests, The Conservation Fund, NH Audubon, Restore \nAmerica's Estuaries, and National Estuarine Research Reserve \nAssociation.\n  The Coastal and Estuarine Land Protection Act promotes coordinated \nland acquisition and protection efforts in coastal and estuarine areas \nby fostering partnerships between nongovernmental organizations and \nFederal, State, and local governments. As clearly outlined by the U.S. \nCommission of Ocean Policy, these efforts are urgently needed. With \nAmericans rapidly moving to the coast, pressures to develop critical \ncoastal ecosystems are increasing. There are fewer and fewer \nundeveloped and pristine areas left in the Nation's coastal and \nestuarine watersheds. These areas provide important nursery habitat for \ntwo-thirds of the Nation's commercial fish and shellfish, provide \nnesting and foraging habitat for coastal birds, harbor significant \nnatural plant communities, and serve to facilitate coastal flood \ncontrol and pollutant filtration.\n  The Coastal and Estuarine Land Protection Act pairs willing sellers \nthrough community-based initiatives with sources of Federal funds to \nenhance environmental protection. Lands can be acquired in full or \nthrough easements, and none of the lands purchased through this program \nwould be held by the Federal Government. This bill puts land \nconservation initiatives in the hands of State and local communities. \nThis new program, authorized through the National Oceanic and \nAtmospheric Administration at $60,000,000 per year, would provide \nFederal matching funds to States with approved coastal management \nprograms or to National Estuarine Research Reserves through a \ncompetitive grant process. Federal matching funds may not exceed 75 \npercent of the cost of a project under this program, and non-Federal \nsources may count in-kind support toward their portion of the cost \nshare.\n  This coastal land protection program provides much need support for \nlocal coastal conservation initiatives throughout the country. For \ninstance, I have worked hard to secure significant funds for the Great \nBay estuary in New Hampshire. This estuary is the jewel of the seacoast \nregion, and is home to a wide variety of plants and animal species that \nare particularly threatened by encroaching development and \nenvironmental pollutants. By working with local communities to purchase \nlands or easements on these valuable parcels of land, New Hampshire has \nbeen able to successfully conserve the natural and scenic heritage of \nthis vital estuary.\n  Programs such as the Coastal and Estuarine Land Protection program \nwill further enable other States to participate in these community-\nbased conservation efforts in coastal areas. This program was modeled \nafter the U.S. Department of Agriculture's successful Forest Legacy \nProgram, which has conserved millions of acres of productive and \necologically significant forest land around the county.\n  I welcome the opportunity to offer this important legislation, with \nmy good friend from Maryland, Senator Mikulski. I am thankful for her \nleadership on this issue, and look forward to working with her to make \nthe vision for this legislation a reality, and to successfully conserve \nour coastal lands for their ecological, historical, recreational, and \naesthetic values.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CORZINE:\n  S. 1216. A bill to require financial institutions and financial \nservice providers to notify customers of the unauthorized use of \npersonal financial information, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, identity theft is a serious and growing \nconcern facing our Nation's consumers. According to the Federal Trade \nCommission, nearly 10 million Americans were the victims of identity \ntheft in 2003, three times the number of victims just 3 years earlier. \nResearch shows that there are more than 13 identity thefts every \nminute.\n  According to the Identity Theft Resource Center, identity theft \nvictims spend on average nearly 600 hours recovering from the crime. \nAdditional research indicates the costs of lost wages and income as a \nresult of the crime can soar as high as $16,000 per incident. No one \nwants to suffer this kind of hardship.\n  Events this week have further served to highlight how serious the \nproblem has become. The announcement by Citigroup that a box of \ncomputer tapes containing information on 3.9 million customers was lost \nby United Parcel Service in my own State of New Jersey while in transit \nto a credit reporting agency is the latest in a line of recent, high \nprofile incidents. In fact, I myself was a victim of a similar recent \nloss of computer tapes by Bank of America.\n  In both of these cases, Citigroup and Bank of America acted \nresponsibly and\n\n[[Page S6319]]\n\nnotified possible victims in a prompt and timely manner. But this is \nnot always the case.\n  At the very least, consumers deserve to be made aware when their \npersonal information has been compromised. Right now, they must hope \nthat the laws of a few individual States, such as California, apply to \ntheir case, or that victimized institutions will act responsibly on \ntheir own.\n  The legislation I am introducing today, the Financial Privacy Breach \nNotification Act of 2005, would protect consumers by requiring prompt \nnotification by any financial institution or affiliated data broker in \nall cases, subject, of course, to the concerns of law enforcement \nagencies. It would also require automatic inclusion of fraud alerts in \nvictim's credit files to minimize the damage done.\n  Notification by itself won't solve everything, but it is an important \nfirst step that requires immediate attention. I intend to introduce \nmore comprehensive legislation in the very near future to further \nprotect consumers against the growing threat of identity theft, but \nrequiring notification in a uniform fashion is an important and \nurgently needed first step.\n  It is imperative that we take action to combat the growing threat of \nidentity theft. This crime harms individuals and families, and drags \ndown our economy in the form of lost productivity and capital. We can \ndo more and we must do more.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1216\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend title II of the Social Security Act to phase \nout the 24-month waiting period for disabled individuals to become \neligible for medicare benefits, to eliminate the waiting period for \nindividuals with life-threatening conditions, and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce bipartisan \nlegislation entitled ``Ending the Medicare Disability Waiting Period \nAct of 2005'' with Senators DeWine, Corzine, Durbin, Schumer, Johnson, \nCantwell, Lautenberg, Stabenow, Kennedy, Clinton, Kerry, Mikulski, \nAkaka, Salazar, and Sarbanes. This legislation would phase-out the \ncurrent 2-year waiting period that people with disabilities must endure \nafter qualifying for Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI). In \nthe interim or as the waiting period is being phased out, the bill \nwould also create a process by which the Secretary can immediately \nwaive the waiting period for people with life-threatening illnesses.\n  When Medicare was expanded in 1972 to include people with significant \ndisabilities, lawmakers created the 24-month waiting period. According \nto a July 2003 report from the Commonwealth Fund, it is estimated that \nover 1.2 million SSDI beneficiaries are in the Medicare waiting period \nat any given time, ``all of whom are unable to work because of their \ndisability and most of whom have serious health problems, low incomes, \nand limited access to health insurance.''\n  The stated reason at the time was to limit the fiscal cost of the \nprovision. However, I would assert that there is no reason, be it \nfiscal or moral, to tell people that they must wait longer than 2 years \nafter becoming severely disabled before we provide them access to much \nneeded health care.\n  In fact, it is important to note that there really are actually three \nwaiting periods that are imposed upon people seeking to qualify for \nSSDI. First, there is the disability determination process through the \nSocial Security Administration, which often takes many months or even \nlonger than a year in some cases. Second, once a worker has been \ncertified as having a severe or permanent disability, they must wait an \nadditional 5 months before receiving their first SSDI check. And third, \nafter receiving that first SSDI check, there is the 2-year period that \npeople must wait before their Medicare coverage begins.\n  What happens to the health and well-being of people waiting more than \n2\\1/2\\ years before they finally receive critically needed Medicare \ncoverage? According to Karen Davis, president of the Commonwealth Fund, \nwhich has conducted 2 important studies on the issue, ``Individuals in \nthe waiting period for Medicare suffer from a broad range of \ndebilitating diseases and are in urgent need of appropriate medical \ncare to manage their conditions. Eliminating the 2-year wait would \nensure access to care for those already on the way to Medicare.''\n  Again, we are talking about individuals that have been determined to \nbe unable to engage in any ``substantial, gainful activity'' because of \neither a physical or mental impairment that is expected to result in \ndeath or to continue for at least 12 months. These are people that, by \ndefinition, are in more need of health coverage than anybody else in \nour society. Of the 1.2 million people stuck in the 2-year waiting \nperiod at any given time, it is estimated that one-third, or 400,000, \nare left completely uninsured. The consequences are unacceptable and \nare, in fact, dire.\n  In fact, various studies show that death rates among SSDI recipients \nare highest during the first 2 years of enrollment while waiting to be \ncovered by Medicare. For example, the Commonwealth Fund report, \nentitled ``Elimination of Medicare's Waiting Period for Seriously \nDisabled Adults: Impact on Coverage and Costs,'' 4 percent of these \npeople die during the waiting period. In other words, it is estimated \nthat of the estimated 400,000 uninsured disabled Americans in the \nwaiting period at any given time, 16,000 of them will die awaiting \nMedicare coverage. Let me repeat . . . 16,000 of the 400,000 uninsured \ndisabled in the waiting period at any given moment will die while \nwaiting for Medicare coverage to begin.\n  Moreover, this does not factor in the serious health problems that \nothers experience while waiting for Medicare coverage during the 2-year \nperiod. Although there is no direct data on the profile of SSDI \nbeneficiaries in the 2-year waiting period, the Commonwealth Fund has \nundertaken a separate analysis of the Medicare Current Beneficiary \nSurvey for 1998 to get a good sense of the demographic characteristics, \nincome, and health conditions of this group.\n  According to the analysis, ``. . . 45 percent of nonelderly Medicare \nbeneficiaries with disabilities had incomes below the Federal poverty \nline, and 77 percent had incomes below 200 percent of poverty. Fifth-\nnine percent reported that they were in fair or poor health; of this \ngroup, more than 90 percent reported that they suffered from one or \nmore chronic illnesses, including arthritis (52 percent), hypertension \n(46 percent), mental disorder (36 percent), heart condition (35 \npercent), chronic lung disease (26 percent), cancer (20 percent), \ndiabetes (19 percent), and stroke (12 percent).''\n  To ascertain the impact the waiting period has on the lives of these \ncitizens, the Commonwealth Fund and the Christopher Reeve Paralysis \nFoundation conducted a follow-up to ``gain insight into the experiences \nof people with disabilities under age 65 in the Medicare 2-year waiting \nperiod.'' According to that second report entitled ``Waiting for \nMedicare: Experiences of Uninsured People with Disabilities in the Two-\nYear Waiting Period for Medicare'' in October 2004, ``Most of these \nindividuals must invariably get by with some combination of living one \nday at a time, assertiveness, faith, and sheer luck.''\n  One person in the waiting period with a spinal cord injury from \nAtlanta, Georgia, seeking medical treatment for their condition was \ntold to simply ``try not to get sick for 2 years.'' As the individual \nsaid in response, ``None of us TRIED to become disabled.''\n  The people that we have spoken to in the waiting period, since the \nintroduction of this legislation last year, talk about foregoing \ncritically needed medical treatment, stopping medications and therapy, \nfeeling dismayed and depressed about their lives and future, and \nfeeling a loss of control over their lives and independence while in \nthe waiting period.\n  These testimonials and appeals in support of this legislation are \noften emotional and intense. Some describe the waiting period as a \n``living nightmare'' and appropriately ask how it is possible that \ntheir government is doing this to them.\n  In fact, some have had the unfortunate fate of having received SSI \nand Medicaid coverage, applied for SSDI, and then lost their Medicaid \ncoverage because they were not aware that the change in income, when \nthey received SSDI, would push them over the financial limits for \nMedicaid. In such a case, and let me emphasize this point, the \ngovernment is effectively taking their health care coverage away \nbecause they are so severely disabled.\n  Therefore, for some in the waiting period, their battle is often as \nmuch with the government as it is with their medical condition, \ndisease, or disability.\n  Nobody could possible think this makes any sense.\n  House Ways and Means Chairman Bill Thomas questioned the rationale of \nthe waiting period in a press conference on April 29, 2005.\n  As the Medicare Rights Center has said, ``By forcing Americans with \ndisabilities to wait 24 months for Medicare coverage, the current law \neffectively sentences these people to inadequate health care, poverty, \nor death . . . Since disability can strike anyone, at any point in \nlife, the 24-month waiting period should be of concern to everyone, not \njust the millions of Americans with disabilities today.''\n  Although elimination of the Medicare waiting period will certainly \nincrease Medicare costs, it is important\n\n[[Page S6321]]\n\nto note that there will be some corresponding decrease in Medicaid \ncosts. Medicaid, which is financed by both Federal and State \ngovernments, often provides coverage for a subset of disabled Americans \nin the waiting period, as long as they meet certain income and asset \nlimits. Income limits are typically at or below the poverty level, \nincluding at just 74 percent of the poverty line in New Mexico, with \nassets generally limited to just $2,000 for individuals and $3,000 for \ncouples.\n  The Commonwealth Fund estimates that, of the 1.26 million people in \nthe waiting period, 40 percent are enrolled in Medicaid. As a result, \nthe Commonwealth Fund estimates in the study that Federal Medicaid \nsavings would offset nearly 30 percent of the increased costs. \nFurthermore, States, which have been struggling financially with their \nMedicaid programs, would reap a windfall that would help them better \nmanage their Medicaid programs.\n  Furthermore, from a continuity of care point of view, it makes little \nsense that somebody with disabilities must leave their job and their \nhealth providers associated with that plan, move on the Medicaid to \noften have a different set of providers, to then switch to Medicare and \nyet another set of providers. The cost, both financial and personal, of \nnot providing access to care or poorly coordinated care services for \nthese seriously ill people during the waiting period may be greater in \nmany cases than providing health coverage.\n  And finally, private-sector employers and employees in those risk-\npools would also benefit from the passage of the bill. As the 2003 \nreport notes, ``. . . to the extent that disabled adults rely on \ncoverage through their prior employer or their spouse's employer, \neliminating the waiting period would also produce savings to employers \nwho provide this coverage.''\n  To address concerns about costs and immediate impact on the Medicare \nprogram, the legislation phases out the waiting period over a 10-year \nperiod. In the interim, the legislation would create a process by which \nothers with life-threatening illnesses could also get an exception to \nthe waiting period. Congress has previously extended such an exception \nto the waiting period for individuals with amyothrophic lateral \nsclerosis (ALS), also known as Lou Gehrig's disease, and for hospice \nservices. The ALS exception passed the Congress in December 2000 and \nwent into effect July 1, 2001. Thus, the legislation would extend the \nexception to all people with life-threatening illnesses in the waiting \nperiod.\n  I would like to thank Senator DeWine and the other original \ncosponsors, including Senators Corzine, Durbin, Schumer, Johnson, \nCantwell, Lautenberg, Stabenow, Kennedy, Clinton, Kerry, Mikulski, \nAkaka, Salazar, and Sarbanes, for supporting this critically important \nlegislation. Furthermore, I would like to commend Representative Gene \nGreen of Texas for his introduction of the companion bill in the House \nof Representatives and for his work, diligence, and commitment to this \nissue.\n  I urge passage of this legislation and ask unanimous consent that a \nfact sheet, which includes a list of original supporting organizations \nfor the legislation, and the text of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the materials were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record as follows:\n\n                               Fact Sheet\n\n\n       ending the medicare disability waiting period act of 2005\n\n       Senators Jeff Bingaman (D-NM) and Mike DeWine (R-OH) are \n     preparing to introduce the ``Medicare Disability Waiting \n     Period Act of 2005.'' The bill would, over 10 years, \n     completely phase-out the two-year waiting period which \n     Americans with disabilities must endure before receiving \n     Medicare coverage. The legislation also creates a process by \n     which the Secretary can immediately waive the waiting period \n     for people with life-threatening illnesses.\n       When Medicare was expanded in 1972 to include people who \n     have significant disabilities, lawmakers created a ``Medicare \n     waiting period.'' Before they can get Medicare coverage, \n     people with disabilities must first receive Social Security \n     Disability Insurance (SSDI) for 24 months. Generally, SSDI \n     begins five months after an individual's disability has been \n     certified. As a result, people with disabilities face three \n     consecutive waiting periods prior to getting health coverage: \n     (1) a determination of SSDI approval from the Social Security \n     Administration; (2) a five-month waiting period to receive \n     SSDI; and, (3) another 24-month waiting period to get \n     Medicare coverage.\n       Because of the 24-month Medicare waiting period, an \n     estimated 400,000 Americans with disabilities are uninsured \n     and many more are underinsured at a time in their lives when \n     the need for health coverage is most dire, Dale and Verdier, \n     The Commonwealth Fund, July 2003. In fact, various studies \n     show that death rates among SSDI recipients are highest \n     during the first two years of enrollment, Mauney, AMA, June \n     2002. For example, according to the Commonwealth Fund, 4 \n     percent of these people die during the waiting period.\n       There is an important exception to the 24-month waiting \n     period and that is for individuals with amyothrophic lateral \n     sclerosis (ALS), also known as Lou Gehrig's disease, and for \n     hospice services. The ALS exception passed the Congress in \n     December 2000 and went into effect July 1, 2001.\n       ``Ending the Medicare Waiting Period Act of 2005'' would, \n     over 10 years, phase-out the waiting period and would also, \n     in the interim, create a process by which others with life-\n     threatening illnesses, like ALS, could also get an exception \n     to the waiting period.\n       As the Medicare Rights Center has said, ``By forcing \n     Americans with disabilities to wait 24 months for Medicare \n     coverage, the current law effectively sentences these people \n     to inadequate health care, poverty or death. . . . Since \n     disability can strike anyone, at any point in life, the 24-\n     month waiting period should be of concern to everyone, not \n     just the millions of Americans with disabilities today.''\n       If you have any questions or need additional information, \n     please contact Bruce Lesley in Senator Bingaman's office at \n     202-224-5521 or Abby Kral in Senator DeWine's office at 202-\n     224-7900.\n\n\n                        Supporting Organizations\n\n       Acid Maltase Deficiency Association\n       AIDS Foundation of Chicago\n       The AIDS Institute\n       AIDS Project Los Angeles\n       Air Compassion America\n       Alzheimer's Association\n       American Academy of Audiology\n       American Academy of HIV Medicine\n       American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine (ACRM)\n       American Congress of Community Supports and Employment \n     Services (ACCSES)\n       American Dance Therapy Association\n       American Gastroenterological Association\n       American Network of Community Options and Resources\n       American Occupational Therapy Association\n       American Psychological Association\n       Angel Flight Mid-Atlantic\n       The Arc of the United States\n       Association for Community Affiliated Plans\n       Association of University Centers on Disabilities (AUCD)\n       Benign Essential Blepharospasm Research Foundation\n       Brian Tumor Action Network\n       California Health Advocates\n       Center for Medicare Advocacy, Inc.\n       Coalition for Pulmonary Fibrosis\n       Community Action New Mexico\n       Disability Service Providers of America (DSPA)\n       Empowering Our Communities in New Mexico\n       Families USA\n       Family Voices\n       Gay Men's Health Crisis\n       Harm Reduction Coalition\n       Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia (HHT) Foundation \n     International\n       HIV Medicine Association\n       HIVictorious, Inc., Madison, WI\n       Medicare Rights Center\n       Mercy Medical Airlift\n       Miami, ACT UP\n       National Alliance for the Mentally Ill (NAMI)\n       National Alliance of State and Territorial AIDS Directors \n     (NASTAD)\n       National Association of Children's Behavioral Health\n       National Association of Councils on Developmental \n     Disabilities (NACDD)\n       National Association of Protection and Advocacy Systems \n     (NAPAS)\n       National Ataxia Foundation\n       National Health Law Program (NHeLP)\n       National Kidney Foundation\n       National Mental Health Association\n       National Minority AIDS Council\n       National Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD)\n       National Patient Advocacy Foundation\n       National Women's Law Center\n       New Mexico AIDS Services\n       New Mexico Medical Society\n       New Mexico POZ Coalition\n       New Mexico Public Health Association\n       North American Brain Tumor Coalition\n       Paralyzed Veterans of America\n       Power Mobility Coalition\n       Reflex Sympathetic Dystrophy Syndrome Association of \n     America\n       Senior Citizens Law Office, New Mexico\n       Southern New Hampshire HIV/AIDS Task Force\n       Special Olympics\n       The Title II Community AIDS National Network\n       United Cerebral Palsy\n       United Spinal Association\n       Utah AIDS Foundation\n       Visiting Nurse Associations of America\n       Von Hippel-Lindau Family Alliance\n\n[[Page S6322]]\n\n                                S. 1217\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Elementary and Secondary Education Act \nof 1965, the Higher Education Act of 1965, and the Internal Revenue \nCode of 1986 to improve recruitment, preparation, distribution, and \nretention of public elementary and secondary school teachers and \nprincipals, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it is a privilege to join my \ndistinguished colleague, Senator Durbin, in introducing the Teacher \nExcellence for All Children Act of 2005. Its goal is to bring us closer \nto giving every child a highly qualified teacher, and enable more \nteachers to obtain the support they need to improve their instruction. \nWe join our distinguished colleague Congressman George Miller in this \neffort, who is introducing this legislation in the House, and commend \nhim for his leadership on the issue.\n  One of the major challenges we face today is to improve the \nrecruitment, preparation, and retention of good teachers. Few issues \nare of greater importance to our future than education. The Nation is \nstrongest when our schools are strongest--when all students can attend \ngood schools with good teachers to help them learn. In this new era of \nglobalization, a well-educated citizenry and well-skilled workforce are \nessential to our role in the world.\n  We owe a great debt to America's teachers. They work day in and day \nout to give children a decent education. Teachers are on the front \nlines in the Nation's schools, and at the forefront of the constant \neffort to improve public education. It is their vision, energy, hard \nwork, and dedication that will make all the difference in successfully \nmeeting this challenge.\n  We took a major step forward in the No Child Left Behind Act and its \nrecognition that all students deserve first-rate teachers to help them \nreach their potential and succeed in life. This act made a bold \nnational commitment to guarantee a highly qualified teacher in every \nclassroom. But to reach that goal, we need to recruit, train, retain \nand support our teachers. The TEACH Act addresses four specific \nchallenges head on: to increase the supply of outstanding teachers; to \nensure all children have teachers with expertise in the subjects they \nteach; to improve teaching by identifying and rewarding the best \npractices and expanding professional development opportunities; and to \nhelp schools retain teachers and principals by providing the support \nthey need to succeed.\n  Since enrollment in public schools has reached an all-time high of 53 \nmillion students, and is expected to keep\n\n[[Page S6323]]\n\nincreasing over the next decade, additional highly qualified teachers \nare needed to meet the growing demand.\n  Many schools face a teacher crisis, particularly in our poorest \ncommunities. Currently, there are approximately 3 million public school \nteachers across the country. Two million new, qualified teachers will \nbe needed in the next 10 years to serve the growing student population. \nYet we are not even retaining the teachers we have today. A third of \nall teachers leave during their first 3 years, and almost half leave \nduring the first 5 years.\n  Too often, teachers also lack the training and support needed to do \nwell in the classroom. They are paid on average almost $8,000 less than \ngraduates in other fields, and the gap widens to more than $23,000 \nafter 15 years of teaching. Thirty-seven percent of teachers cite low \nsalaries as a main factor for leaving the classroom before retirement.\n  The TEACH Act will do more to recruit and retain highly qualified \nteachers--particularly in schools and subjects where they are needed \nthe most. The bill provides financial incentives to encourage talented \npersons to enter and remain in the profession and it offers higher \nsalaries, tax breaks, and greater loan forgiveness.\n  To attract motivated and talented individuals to teaching, the bill \nprovides up-front tuition assistance--$4,000 per year--to high-\nperforming undergraduate students who agree to commit to teach for 4 \nyears in high-need areas and in subjects such as math, science, and \nspecial education.\n  One of our greatest challenges in school reform today is to equalize \nthe playing field, so that the neediest students have access to the \nbest teachers to help them succeed. Research shows that good teachers \nare the single most important factor in the success of children in \nschool, both academically and developmentally. Children with good \ninstruction can reach new heights through the hard work, vision, and \nenergy of their teachers. Good teaching helps overcome the harmful \neffects of poverty and other disadvantages on student learning.\n  Unfortunately, we still have a long way to go. In high-poverty \nschools, teacher turnover is 33 percent higher than in other schools. \nIn the poorest middle schools and high schools, students are 77 percent \nmore likely to be assigned an out-of-field teacher. Almost a third of \nclasses are taught by teachers with no background in the subject--no \nmajor degree, no minor degree, no certification.\n  Despite our past efforts, this problem is worsening. In most academic \nsubjects, the percentage of secondary school teachers ``out-of-\nfield''--those teaching a class in which they do not have a major, a \nminor, or a certification--increased from 1993 to 2000. Clearly, we \nmust do a better job of attracting better teachers to the neediest \nclassrooms and do more to reward their efforts so that they stay in the \nclassroom.\n  Because schools compete for the best teachers, the bill provides \nfunding to school districts to reward teachers who transfer to schools \nwith the greatest challenges, and provides incentives for teachers \nworking in math, science, and special education.\n  The TEACH Act also establishes a framework to develop and use the \nsystems needed at the State and local levels to identify and improve \nteacher effectiveness and recognize exceptional teaching in the \nclassroom. States will develop data systems to track student progress \nand relate it to the level of instruction provided in the classroom. \nThe bill also encourages the development of model teacher advancement \nprograms with competitive compensation structures that recognize and \nreward different roles, responsibilities, knowledge, skills and \npositive results.\n  Too often, teachers lack the training they need before reaching the \nclassroom. On the job, they have few sources of support to meet the \nchallenges they face in the classroom, and few opportunities for \nongoing professional development to expand their skills. The bill \nresponds to the needs of teachers in their first years in the classroom \nby creating new and innovative teacher induction models that use proven \nstrategies to support beginning teachers. New teachers will have access \nto mentoring, opportunities for cooperative planning with their peers, \nand a special transition year to ease into the pressures of entering \nthe classroom. Veteran teachers will have an opportunity to improve \ntheir skills through peer mentoring and review. Other support includes \nprofessional development delivered through teaching centers to improve \ntraining and working conditions for teachers.\n  Since good leadership is also essential for schools, the bill \nprovides important incentives and support for principals by raising \nstandards and improving recruitment and training for them as well.\n  This legislation was developed with the help of a broad and diverse \ngroup of educational professionals and experts, including the Alliance \nfor Excellent Education, the American Federation of Teachers, the \nBusiness Roundtable, the Center for American Progress Action Fund, the \nChildren's Defense Fund, the Education Trust, the National Council on \nTeacher Quality, the National Council of La Raza, the National \nEducation Association, New Leaders for New Schools, the New Teacher \nCenter, Operation Public Education, the Teacher Advancement Program \nFoundation, Teach for America and the Teaching Commission. I thank them \nfor their help and their work on behalf of our Nation's children.\n  As Shirley Mount Hufstedler, the first United States Secretary of \nEducation, has said:\n\n       The role of the teacher remains the highest calling of a \n     free people. To the teacher, America entrusts her most \n     precious resource, her children; and asks that they be \n     prepared, in all their glorious diversity, to face the rigors \n     of individual participation in a democratic society.\n\n  We must do all in our power to help them in this endeavor.\n  I urge my colleagues to join in supporting this bill and I ask \nunanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1218\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Conforming amendments.\n\n     SEC. 3. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds as follows:\n       (1) There are not enough qualified teachers in the Nation's \n     classrooms, and an unprecedented number of teachers will \n     retire over the next 5 years. Over the next decade, the \n     Nation will need to bring 2,000,000 new teachers into public \n     schools.\n       (2) Too many teachers and principals do not receive \n     adequate preparation for their jobs.\n\n[[Page S6324]]\n\n       (3) More than one-third of children in grades 7-12 are \n     taught by a teacher who lacks both a college major and \n     certification in the subject being taught. Rates of ``out-of-\n     field teaching'' are especially high in high-poverty schools.\n       (4) Seventy percent of mathematics classes in high-poverty \n     middle schools are assigned to teachers without even a minor \n     in mathematics or a related field.\n       (5) Teacher turnover is a serious problem, particularly in \n     urban and rural areas. Over one-third of new teachers leave \n     the profession within their first 3 years of teaching, and 14 \n     percent of new teachers leave the field within the first \n     year. After 5 years--the average time it takes for teachers \n     to maximize students' learning--half of all new teachers will \n     have exited the profession. Rates of teacher attrition are \n     highest in high-poverty schools. Between 2000 and 2001, 1 out \n     of 5 teachers in the Nation's high-poverty schools either \n     left to teach in another school or dropped out of teaching \n     altogether.\n       (6) Fourth graders who are poor score dramatically lower on \n     the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) than \n     their counterparts who are not poor. Over 85 percent of \n     fourth graders who are poor failed to attain NAEP proficiency \n     standards in 2003.\n       (7) African-American, Latino, and low-income students are \n     much less likely than other students to have highly-qualified \n     teachers.\n       (8) Research shows that individual teachers have a great \n     impact on how well their students learn. The most effective \n     teachers have been shown to be able to boost their pupils' \n     learning by a full grade level relative to students taught by \n     less effective teachers.\n       (9) Although nearly half (42 percent) of all teachers hold \n     a master's degree, fewer than 1 in 4 secondary teachers have \n     a master's degree in the subject they teach.\n       (10) Young people with high SAT and ACT scores are much \n     less likely to choose teaching as a career. Those who have \n     higher SAT or ACT scores are twice as likely to leave the \n     profession after only a few years.\n       (11) Only 16 States finance new teacher induction programs, \n     and fewer still require inductees to be matched with mentors \n     who teach the same subject.\n\n               TITLE I--RECRUITING TALENTED NEW TEACHERS\n\n     SEC. 101.

Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation that \nprovides an important clarification to the Fort Peck Reservation Rural \nWater System Act of 2000. The water project authorized by that \nlegislation will provide desperately needed drinking water to the \nresidents of the Fort Peck Indian Reservation and the communities \nsurrounding the Reservation Dry Prairie Rural Water System.\n  In order to accomplish this, the Assiniboine and Sioux Tribes of the \nFort Peck Reservation and Dry Prairie are set to enter into an \nagreement, allowing Dry Prairie to use the water. The Dry Prairie \nallocation will be approximately 2,800 acre feet of water. The \nagreement is consistent with the provisions of the Tribes' Water \nCompact. However, to address any possible questions regarding the \nTribes' grant of use of this water to Dry Prairie, both the Tribes and \nDry Prairie would like the Secretary's authority to approve this water \nuse agreement to be clearly approved by Congress. The legislation I am \nintroducing today provides this clarification.\n  The Project, as authorized, calls for the water to be diverted from \nthe Missouri River at a single location south of Poplar, MT, to an \nintake system or an infiltration gallery. The estimated amount of \nannual project diversion is 6,000 acre feet for the entire Project \narea. The Missouri River at the point of diversion has an average \nannual streamflow of approximately 7.5 million acre feet.\n  The Tribes, pursuant to their tribal-state water rights compact, one \nof the first in the Nation, hold a water right to nearly one million \nacre feet in the Missouri River. This compact has been approved by the \nMontana Water Court and is binding on all the parties. This Project \nwill finally enable the Fort Peck Tribes to receive critical benefits \nfrom its water settlement with the United States and the State of \nMontana. As a result of this settlement, the Tribes are able to make a \nsignificant contribution to the Project: the water that will be used \nfor the entire system. My legislation will provide the legal clarity \nnecessary to ensure this project moves forward as intended.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DODD (for himself, Ms. Collins, and Mr. Leahy):\n  S. 1220. A bill to assist law enforcement in their efforts to recover \nmissing\n\n[[Page S6332]]\n\nchildren and to strengthen the standards for State sex offender \nregistration programs; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with my colleague from \nMaine, Senator Collins, and my colleague from Vermont, Senator Leahy, \nto introduce legislation today to protect America's children from the \nvicious criminals who prey on them.\n  While we've made some progress in the last few years, anyone who \npicks up a newspaper today can see that far too many of our kids are \nstill too vulnerable.\n  The most recent annual data shows that about 58,000 children were \nabducted by nonfamily members, usually people who are strangers to the \nchildren. The most frequent victims were teenage girls. Almost one-half \nof these victims were sexually molested.\n  Our bill, ``The Prevention and Recovery of Missing Children Act of \n2005'', will take 3 common-sense steps to better protect the children \nof America.\n  First, it will require that information on a missing child be \ndisseminated throughout the country within 2 hours through the National \nCrime Information Center database. The reason for this requirement is \nthat time is of the essence. In cases where a child is killed, the \nevidence shows that the child died within the first three hours of \nbeing kidnapped. The more quickly that police throughout the country \ncan be alerted, the more likely it is that we can save a child before a \nchild is harmed.\n  Second, the bill will make it tougher for convicted sex offenders to \nescape the law and the watchful eye of the community in which they \nlive. We know that far too many jurisdictions rely essentially on the \nvoluntary actions of the convicted sex offender to register his \nresidence, his car and license plate, and other pertinent information. \nMoreover, requirements vary from state to state and jurisdiction to \njurisdiction.\n  Therefore the legislation we are introducing today will provide tough \nnational standards that will require these criminals to register before \nthey are released from prison. It will require, within 48 hours of \nmoving to a new residence, that these individuals report to local law \nenforcement and provide information about their residence, a current \nphotograph, DNA sample, as well as report the make, model, and license \nplate number of his or her vehicle and get a drivers license or ID. \nEvery 90 days, they would have to verify their registry information and \nannually provide a new photograph. Failure to comply with these \nrequirements would subject the criminal to a felony.\n  These new requirements are tough, but our children's safety is far \ntoo important to be left to patchwork laws and the voluntary action of \nconvicted criminals whose likelihood of repeating the crime is \nextremely high.\n  Third, the legislation removes a current requirement that the names \nof missing children be deleted from the national database when those \nchildren turn 18. Just because a child turns 18 doesn't mean that our \ncountry should not try to find that child and certainly doesn't mean \nthat the child should be forgotten.\n  Nothing we do as a Nation is more important than building a better \nfuture for our children. And, nothing is more important to building \nthat future than keeping our children safe today.\n  Therefore, in my view, no legislation is more important to be enacted \nin this Congress than this legislation to protect our children from \nevery parent's nightmare. I ask unanimous consent to have a brief \nsummary of the bill printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record as follows:\n\n Prevention and Recovery of Missing Children Act of 2005--Brief Summary\n\n       The most recent annual data shows that 58,000 children were \n     abducted by nonfamily members, mostly strangers to the \n     children. Most of the victims were teenage girls and nearly \n     half were sexually molested. The National Crime Information \n     Center (NCIC) database is a critical means of cooperation, \n     linking 16,000 Federal, State, and local law enforcement \n     agencies. Currently, registration for convicted sex offender \n     rules vary by state. A number of States rely on sex offenders \n     to self-report.\n       Improves missing child reporting requirements. Stops the \n     practice of removing a missing child entry from the NCIC \n     database when the child reaches age 18, to increase the \n     chances for child recovery and investigative information \n     available for other cases.\n       Improves the chances for recovery of missing children. \n     Requires entry of child information into the NCIC database \n     within 2 hours of receipt. Immediate entry is critical as \n     evidenced by the fact that in 74 percent of abduction \n     homicide cases the child is dead within 3 hours and 91 \n     percent are killed within 24 hours.\n       Strengthens sex offender registration requirements. Each of \n     the following suggested amendments are currently part of the \n     statutory sex offender registration policies and procedures \n     in at least one or more states.\n       Requires States to register sex offenders before they are \n     released from prison. Permitting sex offenders to self-\n     register can lead to under-registration and loss of \n     potentially vital investigative information for law \n     enforcement.\n       Requires the registering agency to obtain current \n     fingerprints and a photograph (annually), as well as a DNA \n     sample, from an offender at the time of registration. Up-to-\n     date identifying information is a vital investigative tool \n     and may help law enforcement connect seemingly unrelated \n     cases in different jurisdictions.\n       Requires registrants to obtain either a driver's license or \n     an identification card from the department of motor vehicles. \n     This provides another mechanism through which law enforcement \n     can track the location of potential re-offenders.\n       Requires that registration changes occur within 48 hours of \n     the changes taking effect. The delay of registering changes \n     creates a ``loophole'' through which sex offenders can re-\n     offend and remain undetected.\n       Requires all registered sex offenders to verify their \n     registry information every 90 days. Currently, this \n     requirement is imposed for sexually violent predators only. \n     Obtaining up-to-date registry information from all sex \n     offenders is a vital investigative tool for law enforcement \n     and obtaining it every 90 days provides earlier warning to \n     law enforcement of non-compliant offenders who may have \n     traveled into other jurisdictions, placing new communities at \n     risk.\n       Requires States to inform another state when a known \n     registered person is moving into its jurisdiction. Placing \n     this burden solely on the sex offender leads to under-\n     registration and places communities at risk.\n       In order to give sex offenders a strong incentive to comply \n     with registry requirements, the bill mandates a felony \n     designation for the crime of non-compliance. Non-compliance \n     must be viewed as an ongoing offense.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. STEVENS (for himself, Mr. Inouye, and Ms. Cantwell):\n  S. 1222. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to \nreinstate the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund tax and to maintain a \nbalance of $3 billion in the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I introduce legislation today to maintain \nthe solvency of the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund established pursuant \nto the Oil Pollution Act of 1990. Shortly after midnight on March 24, \n1989 the Exxon Valdez went aground on Bligh reef and caused an oil \nspill in Prince William Sound that is to this day still being \nmonitored, studied, and restored. I wrote the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 \nin the aftermath of this disaster to provide the needed regulatory \nsafeguards to reduce the potential for a similar spill to happen again \nand mitigate the environmental impacts in such an instance. The Oil \nSpill Liability Trust Fund is the cornerstone of the Oil Pollution Act \nensuring funds for expeditious oil removal and providing for \nuncompensated damages to the environment. It is the ``polluter pays'' \npolicy under the Act that requires the responsible party to pay back \ninto the Fund all costs and damages related to a spill.\n  Unfortunately, the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund is rapidly running \nout of money. At a recent Commerce Committee hearing the Commandant of \nthe Coast Guard testified that the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund would \nlikely be depleted by 2009. And in its report on the ``Implementation \nof the Oil Pollution Act of 1990'', released May 12, 2005, the Coast \nGuard announced at the end of fiscal year 2004 there was $842 million \nremaining in the Fund. This is compared to previous years when the un-\nobligated balance was well over $1 billion, as was required under the \nAct through a 5 cents per barrel of oil tax collected from the oil \nindustry on petroleum produced in or imported to the United States. The \ntax was suspended on July 1, 1993 when the un-obligated balance in the \nFund exceeded $1 billion. Thereafter, the tax was reinstated on July 1, \n1994 when the balance declined below $1 billion. However, the tax \nexpired on December 31, 1994 pursuant to the sunset provision under the \nAct.\n\n[[Page S6333]]\n\n  Since this time, the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund has been unable \nto maintain a funding level above $1 billion from its various revenue \nsources prescribed under the Act, which consist of transfers from other \nexisting pollution funds, interest on the Fund principal from U.S. \nTreasury investments, cost recoveries from responsible parties, and \npenalties. The only viable option to maintain the Fund's solvency is \nthe reinstatement of the 5 cents per barrel of oil tax. The bill I \nintroduce today will require the 5 cents tax go into effect after the \nlast day of the first calendar quarter ending more than 30 days after \nthe date of enactment. In addition, the bill provides that the Oil \nSpill Liabillty Trust Fund be funded at $3 billion, and if the fund \ndrops below $2 billion the 5 cents per barrel tax will automatically be \nreinstated until the fund exceeds $3 billion.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DODD:\n  S. 1223. A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to improve the \nquality and efficiency of health care delivery through improvements in \nhealth care information technology, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, today I am pleased to announce the \nreintroduction of the Information Technology for Health Care Quality \nAct. By encouraging health care providers to invest in information \ntechnology (IT), this legislation has the potential to bring \nskyrocketing health care costs under control and improve the overall \nquality of care in our nation.\n  We are facing a health care crisis in our country. According to the \nCensus Bureau, 45 million Americans were without health insurance in \n2003--an increase of 1.4 million over 2002. In many respects, we have \nthe greatest health system in the world, but far too many Americans are \nunable to take advantage of this system.\n  The number of uninsured continues to rise because the cost of health \ncare continues to soar. Year after year, health care costs increase by \ndouble-digit percentages. The cost of employer-sponsored coverage \nincreased by 11 percent last year, after a 14-percent increase in 2003. \nEmployers are dropping health care coverage because they can no longer \nafford to foot the bill.\n  One of the ways to provide health care coverage to every American is \nto reign in health care costs. And expanding the use of IT in health \ncare is the best tool we have to control costs. Studies have shown that \nas much as one-third of health care spending is for redundant or \ninappropriate care. Estimates suggest that up to 14 percent of \nlaboratory tests and 11 percent of medication usage are unnecessary. \nFinally, and perhaps most disturbingly, we know that it takes, on \naverage, 17 years for evidence to be incorporated into clinical \npractice. Along these same lines, a recent study showed that patients \nreceive the best evidence-based treatment only about half the time.\n  Significant cost-savings will undoubtedly be realized simply by \nmoving away from a paper-based system, where patient charts and test \nresults are easily lost or misplaced, to an electronic system where \ndata is easily stored, transferred from location to location, and \nretrieved at any time. With health IT, physicians will have their \npatients' medical information, at their fingertips. A physician will no \nlonger have to take another set of X-Rays because the first set was \nmisplaced, or order a test that the patient had six months ago in \nanother hospital because she is unaware that the test ever took place. \nThe potential for cost-savings from simply eliminating redundancies and \nunnecessary tests, and reducing administrative and transaction costs, \nis substantial.\n  Of course, when we consider the improved quality of care and patient \nsafety that will result from wider adoption of health IT, the impact on \ncost is even greater. For example, IT can provide decision support to \nensure that physicians are aware of the most up-to-date, evidence-based \nbest practices regarding a specific disease or condition, which will \nreduce expensive hospitalizations. Given all of these benefits, \nestimates suggest that Electrontc Health Records (EHRs) alone could \nsave more than $100 billion each year. The full benefits of IT could be \nmultiple hundreds of billions annually. Such a significant reduction in \nhealth care costs would allow us to provide coverage to millions of \nuninsured Americans.\n\n  The benefits of IT go beyond economics. I am sure that all of my \ncolleagues are familiar with the Institute of Medicine (IOM) estimate \nthat up to 98,000 Americans die each year as a result of medical \nerrors. A RAND Corporation study from last year showed that, on \naverage, patients receive the recommended care for certain widespread \nchronic conditions only half of the time. That is an astonishing \nfigure. To put it in a slightly different way, for many of the health \nconditions with which physicians should be most familiar, half of all \npatients are essentially being treated incorrectly.\n  Most experts in the field of patient safety and health care quality, \nincuding the IOM, agree that improving IT is one of the crucial steps \ntowards safer and better health care. By providing physicians with \naccess to patients' complete medical history, as well as electronic \ncues to help them make the correct treatment decisions, IT has the \npotential to significantly impact the care that Americans receive. It \nis impossible to put a value on the potential savings in human lives \nthat would undoubtedly result from a nationwide investment in health \ncare information technology.\n  It might seem counterintuitive that we can realize tremendous cost \nsavings while, at the same time, improving care for patients. But in \nfact, improving patient care is essential to reducing costs. IT is the \nkey to unlocking the door--it has the potential to lead to improvements \nin care and efficiency that will save patients' lives, reduce costs, \nand reduce the number of uninsured.\n  Unfortunately, despite the impact that IT can have on cost, \nefficiency, patient safety, and health care quality, most health care \nproviders have not yet begun to invest in new technologies. The use of \nIT in most hospitals and doctors' offices lags far behind almost every \nother sphere of society. The vast majority of written work, such as \npatient charts and prescriptions, is still done using pen and paper. \nThis leads to mistakes, higher costs, reduced quality of care, and in \nthe most tragic cases, death.\n  There is no question in my mind that the federal government has a \nsignificant role to play in expanding investment in health IT. The \nlegislation that I am introducing today defines that role. First, this \nbill would establish federal leadership in defining a Nationai Health \nInformation Infrastructure (NHII) and adopting health IT standards. \nWhile I am pleased that the administration has already appointed a \nNational Coordinator for Health Information Technology, I believe that \nthe authority given to the Coordinator and the resources at his \ndisposal are not equal to the enormity of his task. That is why my \nlegislation creates an office in the White House, the Office of Health \nInformation Technology, to oversee all of the Federal Government's \nactivities in the area of health IT, and to create and implement a \nnational strategy to expand the adoption of IT in health care.\n  This office would also be responsible for leading a collaborative \neffort between the public and private sectors to develop technical \nstandards for health IT. These standards will ensure that health care \ninformation can be shared between providers, so that a family moving \nfrom Connecticut to California will not have to leave their medical \nhistory behind. At the same time, this bill would ensure that the \nadopted standards protect the privacy of patient records. While the \ncreation of portable electronic health records is an important goal, \nprivacy and confidentiality must not be sacrificed.\n  This legislation would also provide financial assistance to \nindividual health care providers to stimulate investment in IT, and to \ncommunities to help them set up interoperable IT infrastructures at the \nlocal level, often referred to as Local Health Information \nInfrastructures--LHIIs. IT requires a huge capital investment. Many \nproviders, especially small doctors offices, and safety-net and rural \nhospitals and health centers, simply cannot afford to make the type of \ninvestment that is needed.\n  Finally, this legislation would provide for the development of a \nstandard\n\n[[Page S6334]]\n\nset of health care quality measures. The creation of these measures is \ncritical to better understanding how our health care system is \nperforming, and where we need to focus our efforts to improve the \nquality of care. IT has the potential to drastically improve our \nability to capture these quality measures. All recipients of Federal \nfunding under this bill would be required to regularly report on these \nmeasures, as well as the impact that IT is having on health care \nquality, efficency, and cost savings.\n  The establishment of standard quality measures is also the first step \nin moving our nation towards a system where payment for health care is \nmore appropriately aligned--a system in which health care providers are \npaid not simply for the volume of patients that they treat, but for the \nquality of care that they deliver. To this end, my legislation would \nrequire the Secretary of Health and Human Services to report to \nCongress on possible changes to Federal reimbursement and payment \nstructures that would encourage the adoption of IT to improve health \ncare quality and patient safety.\n  I know that many of my colleagues, including Senator Enzi, Senator \nKennedy, Senator Clinton, Senator Frist and Senator Gregg, have an \ninterest in this issue. I look forward to working with all of them to \nmove legislation this year. It is time for our country to make a \nconcerted effort to bring the health care sector into the 21st century. \nWe must invest in health IT systems, and we must begin to do so \nimmediately. The number uninsured, the skyrocketing cost of care, and \nthe number of medical errors should all serve as a wake-up call. We \nhave a tool at our disposal to address all of these problems, and there \nis no more time to waste. I urge my colleagues to support this \nlegislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1223\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to protect the oceans, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, as we commemorate World Oceans Week, we \ncelebrate the wonder and beauty of the world's oceans. We celebrate the \nrole our oceans play in commerce, fishing and shipping. We celebrate \nthe beauty of our coral reefs and the potential lifesaving cures they \nmight contain. And we celebrate our commitment to improving the health \nof our oceans, so that our children and grandchildren will have a \nchance to enjoy and cherish them.\n  That is why I am pleased to introduce the National Oceans Protection \nAct of 2005--comprehensive legislation to improve the health and \ngovernance of our oceans. The bill is co-sponsored by Senator \nLautenberg.\n  This legislation ``was written after two major oceans commission \nreports in the past two years determined that our oceans are in a state \nof crisis. The congressionally-established U.S. Commission on Ocean \nPolicy and the independent Pew Oceans Commission provided detailed \ndescriptions of the challenges our oceans are facing as well as \nspecific solutions to improve ocean health.\n  From pollution to over-fishing to invasive species, there are many \nfactors that have contributed to the current crisis in which we find \nourselves. Pollution threatens all aspects of ocean health. Every 8 \nmonths, nearly 11 million gallons of oil flow from American roads into \nour waters--the equivalent of the Exxon Valdez oil spill.\n  Our oceans are also showing signs of being over-fished, which affects \nthe communities that depend on fish stocks for their livelihood. Many \nfish populations, including salmon, face the threat of being depleted \nto seriously low levels. Invasive species--such as the killer algae \nfound near San Diego in 2000--are another threat to ocean health. In \nthe San Francisco Bay alone, more than 175 invasive species threaten to \noverwhelm native species.\n  By targeting some of the most serious challenges facing our oceans, \nas outlined in the Commissions' reports, my legislation provides a \ncomprehensive national approach to oceans protection and preservation.\n  Let me just mention a couple of the important provisions in four key \nareas:\n  First, the bill improves the governance of the oceans by giving the \nNational Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration the independence it \nneeds to better facilitate the management and oversight of our oceans.\n  Second, the bill protects and conserves marine wildlife and habitat \nby, among other things, creating protection areas and authorizing $50 \nmillion per year in grants to local communities to restore fisheries \nand coastal areas.\n  Third, the bill strengthens fisheries and encourages sustainable \nfishing in a number of ways, including requiring that entire ecosystems \nbe taken into account when considering the health of a fishery.\n  And, fourth, the bill improves the quality of ocean water by \nestablishing maximum amounts of pollution that a body of water can hold \nand still be healthy. In addition, financial assistance will be \nprovided to local governments to reduce pollution and increase \nmonitoring.\n  For their contributions to this legislation and their great \nleadership on\n\n[[Page S6338]]\n\noceans issues, I would like to thank Senators Inouye, Gregg, \nLautenberg, and Levin, as well as former Senator Hollings.\n  It is my hope that this bill will provide the framework needed to \nprotect and improve our oceans. The great environmentalist and ocean-\nexplorer Jacques Cousteau once said, ``If we were logical, the future \nwould be bleak, indeed. But we are more than logical. We are human \nbeings, and we have faith, and we have hope, and we can work.''\n  As we celebrate World Oceans Week, it is my hope that we can work \ntogether to provide a bright future for the world's oceans and continue \nto protect our coastal economy.\n  I encourage my colleagues to join me in this effort to implement the \nrecommendations of the U.S. Commission on Ocean Policy and the Pew \nOcean Commission.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a summary of the bill and list of \nendorsements be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                   The National Oceans Protection Act\n\n\n               1. IMPROVING THE GOVERNANCE OF THE OCEANS\n\n     The Ernest ``Fritz'' Hollings National Ocean Policy and \n         Leadership Act\n       Establishes an independent National Oceanic and Atmospheric \n     Administration (NOAA).\n       Independence will occur after a two-year transition period.\n       Creates a Council on Ocean Stewardship that will annually \n     review funding, policy recommendations, and programs for \n     ocean protection.\n       The Council will function as a federal coordinating body of \n     the various agencies that deal with oceans issues, and will \n     be placed in the Executive Office of the President.\n     Other Governance Provisions\n       Requires that all activities on the Outer Continental \n     Shelf--such as wave energy projects, bioextraction by biotech \n     companies, and wind energy projects--receive a federal permit \n     to ensure that projects do not pose an adverse threat to the \n     health of the oceans current law only requires permits for \n     oil and gas activities.\n       NOAA, working with other relevant agencies such as the EPA \n     or the Army Corps of Engineers, will develop the permitting \n     process, specifically to protect and preserve the marine \n     environment, conserve fisheries and natural resources, and \n     protect public health and safety.\n       NOAA makes the final determination of whether the activity \n     poses a threat to any of these interests--and if so, a permit \n     will not be given.\n       Establishes a Trust Fund in the U.S. Treasury and \n     administered by NOAA composed of Federal money generated from \n     these newly permitted activities; funds will be used for \n     ocean conservation, science and research, and assistance to \n     displaced fishermen.\n       Prohibits NOAA from issuing any lease for marine \n     aquaculture until strong national standards and regulations \n     are issued to protect fish stocks from disease, parasites, \n     and invasive species and to prevent water quality impairment.\n\n\n        2. PROTECTING AND CONSERVING MARINE WILDLIFE AND HABITAT\n\n       Provides protection for ecologically-important coral areas \n     by creating ``Coral Management Areas.''\n       NOAA must carry out a comprehensive ocean exploration and \n     mapping program to determine areas where coral and other \n     creatures live and the marine environments on which they \n     depend for food and habitat.\n       Based on this data, NOAA may establish Coral Management \n     Areas, which would trigger protection from certain fishing \n     gear and practices, such as `rockhopper' trawling gear on \n     fishing nets that tear up essential habitat.\n       Authorizes $3 million per year for research on the effects \n     of noise pollution (i.e. sonar) on marine mammals.\n       Establishes a voluntary buyback program for environmentally \n     and ecologically unsafe ``gear''--such as boat engines.\n       Prohibits almost all discharges of ballast water in U.S. \n     waters and requires ships to install technology to capture \n     invasive species in ballast water before discharge--and \n     creates an early detection and rapid response system to \n     provide assistance to states to protect against invasive \n     species.\n       Authorizes $50 million per year in grants to local \n     communities to restore fishery and coastal habitats.\n       Authorizes $500 million per year in grants to local \n     communities to purchase lands that are vulnerable to \n     development and are important to the protection and \n     preservation of habitats.\n\n\n              3. STRENGTHENING FISHERIES AND FISH HABITAT\n\n       Requires that, when determining the health of a fishery, \n     the entire ecosystem be taken into account, not just the \n     health of a particular fish species.\n       Each regional fishery council must establish a science and \n     statistical committee (SSC) to help develop, collect, and \n     evaluate statistical, biological, economic, social, and other \n     scientific information--the regional councils must then set \n     fish take allowances that are consistent with the SSC \n     determinations, but even greater conservation measures can be \n     taken.\n       Authorizes $115 million over five years for NOAA and the \n     regional fishery councils to develop ecosystem-wide plans to \n     protect and sustain fisheries.\n       Requires NOAA to establish standards for reducing bycatch \n     and authorizes $55 million over five years to monitor \n     compliance with those standards.\n       Creates Individual Fishing Quotas (IFQ) that are equitably \n     allocated and that protect against bycatch, overfishing, and \n     economic harm to local communities.\n\n\n                4. IMPROVING THE QUALITY OF OCEAN WATER\n\n       Requires EPA to establish maximum amounts of nutrient \n     runoff pollution that a body of water can hold and still be \n     healthy, taking into account regional conditions and \n     reasonable economic considerations.\n       Requires water utilities to establish water treatment \n     standards to remove nutrient pollution.\n       Mandates best management practices for agriculture--\n     requiring farmers, to the greatest extent practicable, to \n     take steps to curtail runoff.\n       Expedites beach pollution testing and posting by \n     determining which beaches are most at risk of dangerous water \n     conditions and requiring beach closures as soon as \n     practicable but not longer than 48 hours after discovery.\n       Requires public notification and testing of sewer \n     overflows.\n       Authorizes $11.2 billion per year in funding for state and \n     local governments to reduce stormwater pollution and to \n     increase monitoring and testing.\n       Requires a survey and continuous monitoring of contaminated \n     sediments that are threats to bodies of water, and \n     establishes standards to protect sensitive aquatic species \n     from contaminated sediments.\n                                  ____\n\n\n         Support for the National Oceans Protection Act of 2005\n\n\n                         NATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS\n\n       Natural Resources Defense Council;

Mr. President, I rise today in support of a Senate \nresolution that honors the Small Business Administration's (SBA's) \nSmall Business Development Centers (SBDCs) on their tremendous service \nand dedication to America's small businesses and entrepreneurs over the \npast 25 years.\n  Small businesses form a solid foundation for economic growth and job \ncreation. The successes of our Nation's 25 million small businesses \nhave helped create nearly three-quarters of all new jobs and produce 50 \npercent of our country's Gross Domestic Product.\n  As Chair of the Senate Committee on Small Business and \nEntrepreneurship, I understand that the spirit of entrepreneurs, to \nexplore beyond their limits, is the engine driving our economy. Each \nyear 3 to 4 million new businesses open their doors to the marketplace \nand one in 25 adult Americans takes the steps to start a business. \nClearly, it is essential we ensure that every American has the \nnecessary resources available to start, grow and develop a business.\n  Among the most valuable assets for any entrepreneur is the SBA's \nSmall Business Development Center program. Over the past 25 years, the \nSBDCs have provided unique one-on-one counseling to over 11 million \nAmericans helping new business start-ups, sustain struggling firms, and \nexpand growth for existing firms.\n  Through a network of 63 lead centers and more than 1,100 service \nlocations, the SBDCs deliver their services in all 50 States, as well \nas the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, Guam, and \nAmerican Samoa. From financial management, to marketing to procurement \nassistance, the SBDCs tailor their counseling and training to the needs \nof the client in each local community.\n  In addition, the SBDCs have an extraordinary record of excellence. \nHaving counseled and trained more than 50,000 business owners and \nentrepreneurs in 1980, today they counsel and train almost three-\nquarters of a million start-ups and existing small businesses annually. \nMoreover, in 2003, the SBDCs helped create and retain over 163,000 jobs \nacross America.\n  In 2004 alone, the SBDCs in my home State of Maine assisted \nentrepreneurs in obtaining over $16 million in loans, helped create and \nretain over 700 jobs, counseled nearly 3,000 clients and held 200 \ntraining events. Just as there's no question that small businesses are \nthe lifeblood of our economy, SBDCs are truly the lifeline for \nentrepreneurs.\n  As we celebrate the SBDCs 25th Anniversary, we must reaffirm our \ncommitment to foster an environment that is favorable to economic \ngrowth and development for new and growing firms. On that note, the 36 \npercent cut in the SBA's budget over the last five years has been a \nstep in the wrong direction, and it is a misjudgement I hope Congress \nwill reverse. I will continue to fight to ensure that the SBA and its \nresource partners like the SBDCs obtain the valuable resources they \ndeserve.\n  The challenges of starting a new business are surpassed only by the \ndetermination and ingenuity of America's entrepreneurs. By \nstrengthening the SBA's core programs such as the SBDC program, we can \nencourage job growth and provide American small businesses an even \ngreater opportunity to thrive and prosper.\n  Today I urge my colleagues to show their support for the Small \nBusiness Development Center program during their silver anniversary and \nsupport this Resolution. Small Business Development Centers are a \ncritical component to strengthening our Nation's economy and creating \nAmerican jobs, and they clearly deserve our accolades and recognition.\n\n[[Page S6340]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/06/09/senate-section/article/S6339-1", "month": "06", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6339-S6340]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 165--CONGRATULATING THE SMALL BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT \n   CENTERS OF THE SMALL BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION ON THEIR 25 YEARS OF \n      SERVICE TO AMERICA'S SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS AND ENTREPRENEURS\n\n  Ms. SNOWE (for herself, Mr. Coleman, Mr. Isakson, Mr. Vitter, Ms. \nLandrieu, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Burns, Mr. Pryor, Mr. Bayh, and Mr. Lieberman) \nsubmitted the following resolution; which was referred to the Committee \non Small Business and Entrepreneurship:\n\n                              S.

Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Isakson). The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, as I expressed to the distinguished majority \nleader personally, and I say so today, and I have said so publicly on a \nnumber of occasions, I wish this week we had been working on something \nelse. The\n\n[[Page S6342]]\n\nfact is, we have now what I consider a bump in the road out of the way. \nI am glad we are now going to move on to legislative business. We have \nso much to do in the next few, literally, weeks we have remaining in \nthis legislative session.\n  I appreciate very much the people on both sides of the aisle allowing \nus to move forward on the Energy bill. It is a big piece of legislation \nthat is vitally important to the people of America. Of course, in a big \npiece of legislation such as this, there will be problems, and \ncertainly there will be in this bill.\n  Again, as I said previously, I am grateful to Senators Domenici and \nBingaman for getting the bill to us initially. It is a bill that is \ndeveloped by consensus of the committee. That speaks well of both \nSenator Domenici and Senator Bingaman and the members of the committee. \nThat is going to be some heavy lifting in legislative terms.\n  The distinguished majority leader has set a very high mark for the \nSenate before we leave here. He wants to finish at least two \nappropriations bills. I think it is possible we can do three \nappropriations bills. I hope we can do that. If we can get rid of--I \nsay that in a most positive sense--the Homeland Security, the Energy, \nwater, and Interior bill, and it does not matter what order, that would \nbe good work for this work period.\n  I also express to the distinguished majority leader my appreciation \nfor his hard work. We are not there yet. But we hope we can arrive at \nsome agreement on stem cell research during that work period. It would \nmake everything move a little more quickly if we do that. The leader is \nworking on that. I am working on that. I hope we can, maybe in the next \nweek, agree on something that will allow us to do that so we do not \nhave a lot of hurdles thrown up in other legislation because of that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator withdraw his reservation?\n  Mr. REID. I do.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, briefly in response--really in agreement--\nas we heard from the Democrat leader, we have a lot to do. We have an \nambitious agenda with a superb piece of legislation that we bring to \nthe Senate early next week, the Energy bill, which addresses gasoline \nprices, energy independence, a move toward energy independence, issues \nimportant to the American people.\n\n  In addition to appropriations bills, the Democratic leader mentioned \nstem cell research. I add to that the Department of Defense \nauthorization which is ready for consideration. Asbestos--the \ndistinguished Senator from Pennsylvania who was just here, Senator \nSpecter, has worked so hard on that particular bill. That is important \nto job creation, to health care, to getting benefits to people who need \nit. We have a lot to do. I look forward to beginning that process.\n  Next week, we have one more judge, Thomas Griffith, on Monday. Then \nwe can go to the Energy legislation. So we have an ambitious agenda, \nbut we are working together and we have made a huge amount of progress \nin the last week.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. FRIST. I yield.\n  Mr. REID. It has been brought to my attention that we also have to do \nin the next few weeks the Native Hawaiian legislation we talked about \nthat we would help Senator Akaka on; also, we have a couple of hours \nthe Majority Leader has agreed to set aside for the China trade issue \nwith Senator Schumer. Those things I am sure we can work in, but those \nare things we have to keep in mind that we have to do.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, as you can see, the list is huge. We are \ngoing about it systematically, in discussion on a regular basis with \nthe Democratic leader. That is the way we will continue as we address \nmany issues important to the American people.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/06/09/senate-section/article/S6342-1", "month": "06", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6342]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    NATIONAL MILITARY FAMILIES WEEK\n\n  Mr. FRIST.

Mr. President, we have just seen a major accomplishment \nin the Senate in the last several weeks: the confirmation of five \nnominees to serve on the Federal bench. These confirmations were \nachieved after a historic agreement was reached in the Senate, an \nagreement that allowed us to proceed.\n  We have seen five individuals confirmed by the Senate--Priscilla \nOwen, Janice Rogers Brown, William Pryor, David McKeague, and Richard \nGriffin. The majority leader has indicated that Thomas Griffith will be \non the Senate floor shortly and we will take up that nomination.\n  This represents a major accomplishment and a major change in the way \nthe Senate has been doing business. This shows bipartisanship. This is \na step forward. It is progress.\n  As one of the 14 Senators involved in negotiating the recent \ncompromise agreement on the use of filibusters to block judicial \nnominations, I am very pleased to see this progress and to see what has \nhappened since this agreement was reached. As everyone knows, of these \nfive nominations, several of them have been held up for years. Two I \nhave a particular interest in come from the Sixth Circuit from the \nStates of Ohio, Michigan, Kentucky, and Tennessee. These two come from \nthe State of Michigan but are part of the Sixth Circuit which has had \nvacancies for many years. Now we have these two positions filled.\n  I am pleased to see this progress we have been making the last 2 \nweeks on nominations but also the progress we have been making in the \nSenate on other matters, as well. I think it is good for the country.\n\n  The agreement that we entered into not only cleared the field for the \nPresident's judicial nominations, some of whom, as I have said, have \nbeen waiting for over 4 years, but by avoiding confrontation it also \nallowed the people's agenda to move forward. And that is a very \nimportant matter.\n  Already, since the agreement was reached, the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee has passed out of the committee\n\n[[Page S6343]]\n\nthe asbestos bill, and the Senate Energy and Natural Resources \nCommittee has passed the Energy bill.\n  Now, as someone who was in the room for the negotiations of the \nfilibuster agreement, I would like to take just a few moments to talk \nabout what happened, why I was involved, and where we go from here. \nCandidly, I became involved in the negotiations because I was not \nsatisfied with what I had seen in the Senate over the last few years. \nEveryone got in the negotiation, I am sure, for different reasons. I am \njust speaking for myself. I believed that judges were not getting voted \non in the Senate, that the circuit court judges were not being acted \nupon when they should have been, that many of them were being denied an \nup-or-down vote. I believed the filibuster was being used in excess to \nblock their nominations. I felt that the status quo was simply not \nacceptable, that we could no longer continue down that path.\n  Well, what was the solution? How were we going to get judges voted on \nin the Senate? The status quo abuse of the filibuster, which I felt \nclearly was an abuse of the filibuster, was not acceptable to me. I was \nprepared to take action to deal with that. Yet I felt that, in the best \ninterests of the Senate and the Nation, it was really not in the best \ninterests of the Nation or the Senate to totally change the rules and \ntotally eliminate the filibuster, if we could avoid that. I felt what \nwe needed basically was a resolution to this crisis, a new option or \nalternative that could restore the Senate to where it was when I \nentered the Senate a decade ago. That was a Senate where the \npossibility of a filibuster for judicial nominations was there but \nhardly ever used.\n  I believe that is exactly what we were able to achieve with the \nagreement.\n  During our negotiations, we agreed that a filibuster for a judge \nshould not be used unless under extraordinary circumstances. \nFurthermore, we made sure the agreement included a provision that if \nthe terms of the agreement were violated, and a judge was filibustered \nin circumstances that an individual Member considered not to be \nextraordinary--in other words, if Mike DeWine or any Member considered \nthat another Member was filibustering a judge under a circumstance that \nwas not extraordinary, that I or any Member had the right to pull out \nof that agreement and to go back and say: I am going to use the \nconstitutional option to change the practice, the precedent of the \nSenate.\n  That was my right. I insisted on that when I entered the \nnegotiations. I felt that was important and that was the only way I \ncould be a part of the negotiations.\n  So let me make that very clear. The constitutional option was on the \ntable, and it does remain on the table today. There was never any \nquestion in my mind about that. In fact, let me repeat exactly what I \nsaid at the press conference that the group held on May 23, right after \nwe had reached our agreement. This is what I said that evening at that \npress conference when everyone was there, at least 12 of the 14 people \nwho had reached the agreement. This is what I said. I quote myself:\n\n       This agreement is based on good faith--good faith among \n     people who trust each other. And, it's our complete \n     expectation that it will work. Senators have agreed that they \n     will not filibuster except in extraordinary circumstances. We \n     believe that will, in fact, work. Some of you who are looking \n     at the language may wonder what some of the clauses mean. The \n     understanding is--and we don't think this will happen--but if \n     an individual Senator believes in the future that a \n     filibuster is taking place under something that's not \n     extraordinary circumstances, we, of course, reserve the right \n     to do what we could have done tomorrow, which is to cast a \n     yes vote for the constitutional option. I was prepared to do \n     that tomorrow if we could not reach an agreement.\n\n  Mr. President, let me also quote from the May 30, Washington Post \narticle by Dan Balz. He wrote the following about the agreement:\n\n       [Senator] DeWine, Senator Lindsey Graham have disputed the \n     assertion . . . that the nuclear option is off the table. \n     DeWine said he explicitly raised the issue just before the \n     group announced the deal.\n\n  Balz then quotes me:\n\n       I said at the end, ``Make sure I understand this now, that \n     . . . if any member of the group thinks the judge is \n     filibustered under circumstances that are not extraordinary, \n     that member has the right to vote at any time for the \n     constitutional option.'' Everyone in the room understood \n     that.\n\n  Now, the article goes on to say--again, Dan Balz's article in the \nWashington Post--\n\n       Senator Mark Pryor, [a Democrat and] another member of the \n     group [of 14], concurred, saying that while he hopes the \n     nuclear option is gone for the duration of the 109th \n     Congress, circumstances could bring it back.\n\n  Quoting Senator Pryor:\n\n       I really think Senator DeWine and Senator Graham have it \n     right.\n\n  Mr. President, Members of the Senate, Senate Majority Leader Frist \nalso agrees with this assessment. He said, in this May 30 article by \nDan Balz:\n\n       The nuclear option remains on the table. It remains an \n     option. I will not hesitate to use it, if necessary.\n\n  And later, Senator Frist was quoted in the June 5 New York Times from \nhis comments in a speech at Harvard University, as follows. This is \nSenator Frist:\n\n       The short-term evaluations, I believe, will prove to be \n     shortsighted and wrong after we get judge after judge after \n     judge after judge through, plus at least one Supreme Court \n     nominee and an energy bill . . . and we will get Bolton.\n\n  Mr. President, Members of the Senate, as the recent judicial \nconfirmation votes in the Senate demonstrate, the majority leader is \nright. We are getting things done. We are getting things done because \nthis agreement was negotiated in good faith by good people who want to \nget things done, who want to proceed step by step. It was negotiated in \ngood faith by Members working together in the best interests of this \nSenate and of our Nation. It is a good agreement, one that has enabled \nus in the Senate to get back to doing the business of the people, for \nthe people. That is what the American people expect, and it certainly \nis what the American people deserve.\n  We have made progress. We have been able to confirm judges and bring \nto the floor of this Senate for up-or-down votes three judges who have \nbeen held up for years and two other judges in a circuit, the Sixth \nCircuit, in Ohio and three other States, that has suffered from a lack \nof judges on the Sixth Circuit for years, with many vacancies. Today, \nwe filled two of those vacancies. That makes a difference. We are \nmaking progress.\n  I am not arrogant enough to come to the floor today and say that \neverything is going to work out perfectly. I don't know that it will. I \ndon't have a crystal ball. I just know that we have come a ways. We \nhave taken some steps. We have made some progress. I believe we can \nrely on the good faith of Members to try to continue to work together, \ncontinue to make progress, and continue to try to exercise good faith.\n  We have set a bar now, a standard. Seven Members of the Senate on \neach side have said they will not filibuster except under extraordinary \ncircumstances. That is something that had not been set before. That is \nthe bar. No, it is not specifically defined. I understand that. But at \nleast there is a bar. It is an understanding. That is progress. It is a \nrecognition that the filibuster is not something just to be used; it is \nsomething to be used only in very rare cases. You have to use it after \nyou think long and hard about it. It is the recognition of 14 people \nthat they will only use that filibuster after thinking long and hard. \nThat is progress.\n  What we have seen with these five judges is progress. So we celebrate \ntonight progress, not total victory. You are never done in the Senate. \nWe are always trying to move forward. But at least we should stop for a \nmoment tonight and say: We have made progress. We have come this far. \nWe know we have a ways to go, but here we are, at least.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, let me at the outset say that I am proud \nthat I was 1 of the 14 Members who signed the agreement just referred \nto by my good friend from Ohio. In the signing of that agreement, one \nof the things that brought people together was the concept of respect \nfor each other, mutual respect for our colleagues in this Chamber, \nmutual respect for the people of America.\n  As we have gone through the debate on the confirmation of judges over \nthe last several days, I have seen debate\n\n[[Page S6344]]\n\nwithin this body as well as debate among some of the constituent groups \nthat I have found troublesome because it goes to the heart of the kind \nof respect we should afford each other in this Chamber.\n  I have heard statements that those who happened to be opposed to Bill \nPryor, for whom I voted, were opposed to him because he was anti-\nCatholic. I heard statements made that some of my Democratic colleagues \nwho were opposed to Janice Rogers Brown were opposed to her because she \nwas African American. I submit that nothing could be further from the \ntruth. In fact, when those kinds of statements emanate from Members of \nthis Chamber or when they emanate from some of the constituent groups \nthat follow us, it is a violation of the respect we should afford each \nother.\n  I, too, am hopeful that as we move forward in the consideration of \nother judges and other matters, that kind of hurtful, vitriolic, and \nunwarranted attack on each other is something we will not see again. If \nwe can establish that kind of collegiality within this body, we can, in \nfact, return to those days when we had people working across the aisle \nto solve the common problems that faced Americans, regardless of \nwhether they were Democrats, Independents, or Republicans. It is that \nkind of ethic I hope is embraced as we move forward in deliberations.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/06/09/senate-section/article/S6344-1", "month": "06", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6344]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                    Staff Sergeant Justin L. Vasquez\n\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I rise to speak for a moment about a \nbrave American who lost his life earlier this week. His name is SSG \nJustin L. Vasquez. Staff Sergeant Vasquez was killed this past Sunday \nwhen a roadside bomb exploded near his military vehicle.\n  Staff Sergeant Vasquez was 26, and from the small town of Manzanola, \nCO, near La Junta, along the Arkansas River. He was a member of the 3rd \nSquadron, 3rd Armored Cavalry Regiment out of Fort Carson, CO.\n  He aspired to become an FBI agent, to continue his career of helping \nto protect people. He even considered becoming a lifetime military man. \nRegardless of whether he chose the FBI or stayed in the military, he \nwas clearly motivated by patriotism and was making service to our great \ncountry and our security his career.\n  Staff Sergeant Vasquez was always a patriot who chose to put his \ncountry over himself. He enlisted at 18, and after his first tour of \nIraq reenlisted for a second 6-year stretch with the Army in 2003.\n  Consider that, Mr. President. We are learning everyday that the Army \nis having trouble meeting its recruiting goals because of the demands \nof deployments in Iraq and Afghanistan. Staff Sergeant Vasquez chose to \nre-up for service after having been to Iraq and knowing he was in all \nlikelihood heading back to Iraq.\n  During this, his second tour in Iraq, Staff Sergeant Vasquez was \nserving as a commander of a team of Bradley Fighting Vehicles.\n  Earlier this year, Staff Sergeant Vasquez was selected as one of nine \nsoldiers from Colorado profiled by the Rocky Mountain News during their \nservice in Kuwait. The paper noted that Staff Sergeant Vasquez had \n``arguably, the toughest job in First Platoon, if not in all of \nLightning Troop''--working with new enlistments fresh out of boot camp.\n  But perhaps most importantly, Staff Sergeant Vasquez was a leader. \nAmong the nine men under his command, five were new enlistments on \ntheir first tour. He would spend much of his time during the days \ntraining the inexperienced scouts, helping to build their confidence in \ntheir mission and their actions.\n  Staff Sergeant Vasquez was shaping nervous boys into confident young \nmen, creating leaders for our cities and towns, businesses and PTA \nboards. He had every confidence in his men and inspired them to have \nconfidence in themselves and their mission.\n  In his short life, Sergeant Vasquez was a living role model of what \neach of us in this Chamber hopes to become: a champion for something \nother than ourselves, a champion for an ideal--freedom--bigger than \nanyone person.\n  All of Colorado is saddened by the loss of SSG Justin Vasquez, but we \nalso celebrate everything that he stood for. He served his Nation with \nhonor and distinction, and set an example to which we can all aspire. \nHe will be missed by his family and friends and the men whom he led. \nToday, they are all in our thoughts and prayers.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/06/09/senate-section/article/S6344-2", "month": "06", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6344]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 2 P.M.
