Mr. President, today we will proceed shortly to executive \nsession for the consideration of the nomination of Michael Chertoff to \nbe Secretary of Homeland Security.\n  We have a consent agreement that will govern the debate on the \nnomination. During today's session, there will be up to 6 hours of \ndebate on Michael Chertoff, and Senator Collins is here to manage time \non behalf of the majority.\n  The agreement provides for additional debate between the hours of \n2:15 and 4 o'clock tomorrow, with the vote on confirmation of the \nnomination at 4 o'clock Tuesday.\n  I remind all Senators that there will be no rollcall votes during \ntoday's session. We have a number of issues to address this week. \nChairman Enzi and the HELP Committee have reported several bills that \nwe are working on clearing for floor action.\n  In addition, the House is sending us several pieces of legislation, \nincluding the broadcast decency bill. We are talking to the appropriate \ncommittees of jurisdiction regarding the status of that bill. The \nfunding resolution for our committees is also scheduled for this week. \nTherefore, following the Chertoff nomination, there are a number of \nlegislative items that we are hoping to clear. We will keep all Members \napprised of the voting schedule as we proceed.\n  I want to remind all of my colleagues that on Friday of this week we \nwill have a traditional reading of President Washington's Farewell \nAddress. Senator Richard Burr is scheduled to deliver that address. I \nthank him in advance for his contribution to this longstanding Senate \ntradition.\n  I look forward to another good week, and I thank my colleagues for \ntheir attention.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, will the leader yield for a question?\n  Mr. FRIST. I would be happy to yield.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I have received several inquiries about \nthis. I have spoken to the leader about the status of the Federal \ntransportation bill. We are now in our third year trying to come to an \nagreement on that bill. I ask the leader if there is any indication on \nhis side of progress.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, in response through the Chair, the \ntransportation bill is a major priority for the leadership on this side \nof the aisle and the leadership on the other side of the aisle. We have \nbeen in numerous discussions with the chairmen and ranking members for \nthe responsible committees. There are five different committees \ninvolved. It remains a major priority. It is also, I might add, a major \npriority for the House of Representatives, which is committed to having \nappropriate committee action. We encourage the committees to act as \nsoon as they practically can. Once that bill is ready, we will make \nsure it comes to the floor of the Senate. It is a bill which, as we all \nknow, has strong bipartisan support.\n  We have passed a major transportation bill on the floor of this \nSenate,\n\n[[Page S1312]]\n\nand it is time to look at what changes there might be, look to the \nbudgetary objectives, and as soon as possible bring that bill to the \nfloor.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, if the Senator will further yield for a \nquestion through the Chair, I am sure the Senator is mindful that, in \nfact, a year ago in February we passed this bill, and we are very proud \nof our work product. I am sure it could have been better. We produced a \nvery good product on a bipartisan basis, and then we failed to reach \nagreement with the White House and our colleagues in the House of \nRepresentatives.\n  My concern--which I am sure the leader shares--is that if we don't \nmove in a similar timely fashion this year, we could enact it too late \nand lose another construction season which would be harmful to our \neconomy and to the number of very good paying jobs that could be \ncreated across America with this bill.\n  I encourage my friend from Tennessee, and in the form of a question, \nI ask him if my hope is well placed that we can move quickly on this \nmeasure.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, the Senator's hope is well placed. I think \nwhat our colleagues just heard is a bipartisan leadership commitment to \nfocus on this bill, to build on the past but recognizing that passing a \nbill in the Senate is not enough. We need to make sure we work with the \nHouse of Representatives and with the White House but taking the first \nstep of getting it through the Senate.\n  The commitment is there. We will continue to encourage our chairmen \nand ranking members.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/02/14/senate-section/article/S1312-1", "month": "02", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1312-S1314]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  NOMINATION OF MICHAEL CHERTOFF TO BE SECRETARY OF HOMELAND SECURITY\n\n  ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the Senate \nwill proceed to executive session for the consideration of Executive \nCalendar No. 10, which the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read the nomination of Michael \nChertoff, of New Jersey, to be Secretary of Homeland Security.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the \nnomination of Judge Michael Chertoff to be the next Secretary of \nHomeland Security.\n  Based on my personal interview with him and his sworn testimony last \nweek before the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental \nAffairs, I am convinced that he has the character and the \nqualifications to excel in what is one of the most challenging and \ndemanding positions in all of Government.\n  Let me begin my remarks today by first expressing my gratitude to the \nperson whom Judge Chertoff seeks to replace. In the immediate aftermath \nof the attacks of September 11, Tom Ridge answered the call of service \nto his country. At a time when homeland security was little more than a \nconcept, Tom Ridge stepped forward to begin the monumental task of \nmaking it a reality. He is a pioneer and a patriot. On behalf of all \nAmericans, I thank Secretary Ridge and I wish him great success in his \nfuture endeavors.\n  Judge Chertoff now steps forward to answer this call. The strengths \nand experience he brings are impressive. He has devoted a significant \npart of his life to public service as a Federal prosecutor in New \nJersey, as head of the Justice Department's Criminal Division, and now \nas a Federal judge. As the overwhelming vote for his judicial \nconfirmation 2 years ago demonstrated, as well as the unanimous vote by \nthe Homeland Security Committee, he is well respected on both sides of \nthe aisle. Since 9/11, Judge Chertoff has established himself as the \nleading expert on the legal and national security issues surrounding \nthe war on terrorism.\n  The debate on this nomination will take place in the context of where \nthe Department of Homeland Security currently stands and where we want \nit to go.\n  For the context to be complete, however, it is important we also \nconsider the environment into which the Department was born. In the \nimmediate aftermath of the attacks on our country on September 11, \nAmerica was a nation determined to defeat terrorism, but we were still \nfeeling our way toward an effective response.\n  We knew from the start that protecting America from terrorism could \nnot come at the cost of the freedoms that define us as Americans. In \nthose perilous, uncertain days, however, the proper balance between the \ntwo seemed somewhat different than it does now in the relative comfort \nof today. Judge Chertoff recognizes the need for a constant \nreevaluation to maintain the proper balance between liberty and \nsecurity. This is how he put it in a speech he gave at Rutgers Law \nSchool in 2003:\n\n       Measures that are easily accepted in the sudden response to \n     overwhelming crisis demand somewhat greater testing in the \n     light of experience. In the heat of the battle, the \n     decisionmaker has to rely on foresight because he has no \n     hindsight. We should not, therefore, judge him in hindsight. \n     But at the same time, when hindsight does become available, \n     we would be foolish if we did not take advantage of the \n     lessons for the future.\n\n  As to the nature of that balance, here is what Judge Chertoff said in \nresponse to a question I posed to him during his confirmation hearing:\n\n       I believe that we cannot live in liberty without security, \n     but we would not want to live in security without liberty.\n\n  Judge Chertoff does not just talk the talk of civil liberties; he has \nwalked the walk. As both of my distinguished colleagues from New \nJersey, Senator Lautenberg and Senator Corzine, pointed out when \nintroducing this nominee to the committee, Michael Chertoff, as counsel \nto that State's legislature, played a key role in investigating \nallegations of racial profiling in traffic stops and in crafting \nlegislation to address this important civil liberties issue.\n  Nowhere is the tension between security and civil liberties more \nevident than in the matter of interrogating those detained in the war \non terrorism. In his responses to our committee's written questions, \nJudge Chertoff made it absolutely clear that he believes torture is \nwrong, no matter where it occurs. His commitment to upholding the due \nprocess rights of those detained for immigration violations was \nunambiguous.\n  His commitment to civil liberties is clear. At the same time, there \nis no doubt that he is a tough-minded enforcer of the law. As a Federal \nprosecutor, he built his strong reputation for aggressively fighting \norganized crime, corruption, and fraud in both the public and private \nsectors. His success in those fights was helped greatly by his \nwillingness to work closely with agencies that are now part of the \nDepartment of Homeland Security, such as Customs and the Secret \nService, as well as with first responders such as State and local \npolice.\n  In fact, on a recent trip to the Los Angeles area to study the \nsecurity of our ports, I asked a wide variety of law enforcement \nofficials what they thought of the nomination of Judge Chertoff. To a \nperson, they enthusiastically endorsed his nomination. They felt his \nlaw enforcement background was precisely what the Department needs at \nthis stage of this development.\n\n  I also point out, as head of the criminal division at the Department \nof Justice in the aftermath of September 11, Michael Chertoff underwent \na true trial by fire, managing a critical organization during a time of \ngreat stress. He knows what is needed to fight the war on terrorism, \nthe importance of strategic planning, and the need to constantly \nimprove information sharing and cooperation among agencies at all \nlevels of Government. Our Nation will benefit greatly from these \nattributes and from the experiences he has had.\n  The broad philosophy Judge Chertoff brings to this position is \nimpressive, but so is his understanding of the myriad nuts-and-bolts \nissues that comprise Homeland Security. I was so impressed, when I \nquestioned him in the first\n\n[[Page S1313]]\n\ninterview in my office, with his extraordinary knowledge of all facets \nof the Department and its programs and policies. Coming from a State \nthat is a major transportation center, Judge Chertoff knows the dangers \nwe face from land, air, and sea, and the specific dangers each mode of \ntransportation presents. But as he made clear to my committee, he also \nknows if we devote an inordinate share of scarce resources to one \ntransportation mode, it will only increase our vulnerabilities \nelsewhere.\n  I note that is one of the challenges this Congress is going to face \nin allocating Homeland Security grant moneys. If we focus too much of \nthe funding on large cities, inevitably it will be our smaller towns \nand communities that are exploited by terrorists. We should always \nremember that while their targets may be our large population centers, \nthe terrorists who trained prior to the September 11 attacks did so in \nsmall communities throughout our country. Indeed, two of the terrorists \non that terrible day started their journey of death and destruction \nfrom Portland, ME. Those are some of the challenges Judge Chertoff will \nface.\n  What most impressed me was Judge Chertoff's answer to my question of \nwhy, having just attained a lifetime position at the pinnacle of his \nprofession less than 2 years ago, a position as a judge on one of the \nmost prestigious courts in our country, he would sacrifice all that he \nhad gained to take on such a difficult job. I was so impressed with his \nresponse because it shows the measure of this man, his willingness to \nsacrifice for his country and his commitment to putting the needs of \nour Nation first before his own personal needs. Here is his answer:\n\n       September 11 and the challenge it posed was, at least by my \n     lights, the greatest challenge of my generation and it was \n     one that touched me both personally and in my work at the \n     Department of Justice. The call to serve in helping to \n     protect America was the one call I could not decline.\n\n  What inspiring words: The call to serve in helping to protect America \nwas the one call I could not decline. Judge Chertoff stepped forward to \nanswer the call of his country to serve in this difficult and demanding \npost and to give up a lifetime appointment on the Federal bench.\n  It is often pointed out that the job we are here to fill is so \nextraordinarily difficult because the stakes and the expectations are \nso high. We do not expect the Secretary of Transportation to eliminate \nall highway fatalities. We do not expect the Secretary of Labor to make \nlayoffs obsolete. But the Secretary of Homeland Security is allowed no \nmargin of error.\n\n  In his statement to my committee, Judge Chertoff said he cannot \npromise such perfection. Indeed, no one can. But he did promise to work \ntirelessly and to do everything within the law to keep our Nation safe. \nThat promise, combined with his character, qualifications, and \nextraordinary experience, makes it a privilege for me to \nenthusiastically present his nomination to my colleagues in the Senate.\n  That background is also why I personally am very disappointed the \nSenate did not act last week to confirm this nominee. It has now been \n13 days since Tom Ridge vacated the Office of Secretary of Homeland \nSecurity. It is an urgent task for the Senate to act to confirm his \nreplacement as soon as possible. I am disappointed a small minority on \nthe other side of the aisle has sought to delay this nomination, first \nby objecting to a prompt markup by the committee and now by asking for \nextended debate. I am pleased my colleagues recognized the need to move \nfairly quickly and agreed to a vote on this nominee last week. However, \ngiven the extraordinary qualifications of this nominee, his willingness \nto serve the country, the extraordinary demands of this job, and the \nurgent need for there to be a new Secretary in place as soon as \npossible, I simply do not understand the decision by a few of my \ncolleagues--and only a few of my colleagues--on the other side of the \naisle to hold up this nominee.\n  I hope we can conclude the debate expeditiously. It is so important \nwe confirm Judge Chertoff so he can begin the very hard work of taking \nover this Department and pursuing policies to help keep us safe and \nmake us more secure.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the time during quorum calls be equally \ncharged.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Ms. COLLINS. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that \nthe order for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, in considering the nomination \nof Mr. Chertoff, I want to share with the Senate a conversation I had \nwith him last week. It was about an issue that has plagued my State of \nFlorida since last August, since we were hit by four hurricanes in a \nrow within a 6-week period. That is enough that anybody should have to \nendure.\n  FEMA, which will be under the leadership of the new Secretary, once \nconfirmed, responded and did an admirable job to begin with. But since \nthen, we have had some problems. You heard me speak about them almost \nad infinitum over the course of the session in September and October, \nand then again when we came back after the election in our special \nsession. Congress stepped up and appropriated $13.6 billion in \nemergency funding for that natural disaster series. I thank our \ncolleagues for moving so quickly to address the needs of the people in \nFlorida especially but the other States that were affected as well.\n  I applaud the quick response, the coordination of the relief \nagencies, including FEMA, in the immediate aftermath of those four \nstorms. In Congress we specifically directed that $8.5 billion of that \nmoney was going straight to FEMA to help hurricane victims.\n  Well, I wish I could report that things are going smoothly. I cannot. \nI spoke with Judge Chertoff about these issues. I also spoke with FEMA \nDirector Mike Brown in a meeting with other members of the Florida \ndelegation.\n  Boiled down, we have two big issues: The very slow, if any, \nreimbursement for debris removal off of private rights of way; and then \na second issue, that money was being poured into areas that did not \nhave hurricane velocity winds, while for the places that got hit the \nhardest, it is so very difficult for them to get the funds they need, \nand now those counties and cities are having to pay themselves without \nFEMA reimbursement.\n  I hear on a daily basis from communities across our State that are \nhaving problems getting reimbursed for debris removal. Some of these \ncounties and cities have even had to borrow money to go out and pay \ntheir bills while they are waiting for FEMA reimbursement.\n  I will give you an example. Lake County, to the northwest of Orlando, \nsubmitted a $17 million bill for reimbursement months ago. Do you know \nhow much they have received thus far? Three thousand dollars. There is \nno excuse for that. Plus, these counties that are begging, pleading, \nguess who they are coming to. They are coming to their handy-dandy \nSenator. They are begging and pleading for consistent information.\n  I will give you an example. Santa Rosa County reports they submitted \na request for $27 million in October. They have seen no reimbursement, \nand they are receiving mixed signals from FEMA as to what further \ninformation they may have to submit in order to get their application \nfinally processed.\n  I will give you another example: Charlotte County. Charlotte County \nis down on the southwest coast of Florida. It is where the first \nmonster hit. Charley hit with full force, with winds of 145 miles an \nhour, right off the water. It came right off the Gulf of Mexico, up \nCharlotte Bay, and hit Punta Gorda in Charlotte County. The county \nofficials have stated that one day a FEMA official will declare some \npiles of debris eligible for reimbursement and the next day a different \ninspector will look at it and declare it is ineligible for \nreimbursement. This has to stop.\n\n  I will give you another example. Escambia County has received some \nrelief but Pensacola, which is the main city in Escambia County, has \nnot. This\n\n[[Page S1314]]\n\nis not how FEMA should be deciding to distribute our tax dollars.\n  Then there is the other major issue of the distribution of FEMA \ndollars to those counties that did not have hurricane force winds. FEMA \npaid out $29 million--and just last week FEMA Director Brown defended \nit--to Miami-Dade County, where the highest winds were 54 miles an \nhour. Hurricane velocity winds do not start until you get to 74 miles \nan hour.\n  I thank the chair of the committee, Senator Collins, who is in the \nChamber with us, and Senator Lieberman, who have acknowledged there is \nsomething that needs to be told here. They have started an \ninvestigation, and they are looking into these allegations.\n  So what do you expect is going on here? Well, that is what their \ninvestigation is going to get to the bottom of. I am looking forward to \nit.\n  As I speak, I am going to vote for Judge Chertoff. As I said to him \nlast week, he is going to be the leader of this gargantuan Department. \nHe needs to make sure the components of his Department are functioning \nas they should, because we need to fairly and efficiently distribute \nFEMA dollars that we appropriated. And we appropriated lots of them: \n$13.6 billion. Those moneys need to address the issues that are \nplaguing these States such as mine, so that when this occurs in the \nfuture we will not have all of this trauma that our citizens are going \nthrough.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I thank and commend the Senator from \nFlorida for his ongoing concern and interest in the operations of FEMA. \nAt the Senator's request, the Homeland Security and Governmental \nAffairs Committee has initiated an investigation into the FEMA \nexpenditures in his State as well as some other States where similar \nissues have arisen. We are working very closely with the Inspector \nGeneral in conducting that investigation. I appreciate the Senator's \ninterest in requesting the committee to conduct this investigation.\n  I note that the Senator's more recent concerns, in his discussions \nwith Judge Chertoff, are yet another reason why it is so critical we \nget Judge Chertoff confirmed and in place. The Department of Homeland \nSecurity faces a myriad of management challenges, and we need a strong \nSecretary on the job as soon as possible. The hearing the committee \nheld was almost 2 weeks ago. I think it is very unfortunate that we did \nnot move ahead and confirm the nominee last week.\n  I think the Senator from Florida has given yet another example of \nsome of the challenges Judge Chertoff will face. So I appreciate the \ncomments of the Senator, my colleague from Florida. We look forward to \ncontinuing to work with him on this investigation and to improve the \nefficiency and effectiveness of FEMA.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry: We are \nnow on the nomination of Judge Chertoff?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, would it be in order for this \nSenator to request 5 minutes to speak on an issue as in morning \nbusiness?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator can make that request \nby unanimous consent.\n  Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/02/14/senate-section/article/S1314-1", "month": "02", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1314-S1332]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            SOCIAL SECURITY\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, it absolutely baffles me, this \ndiscussion going on about Social Security of which the President has \nlaid out by sounding the alarm bell that something needs to be done, \nand yet the President has not come forth with a plan to address the \nfact that in 37 years, in the year 2042, Social Security will not be \nable to pay the full benefits, rather, 37 years in the future, would be \nable to only pay 73 cents on the dollar of Social Security benefits.\n  Where is the President's plan? The President has laid out that he \nwants to privatize Social Security with private accounts. Where is the \nPresident's plan? Why is there not a message from the White House to \nthe Congress? I can suggest a reason as to why there is no plan: \nbecause basically the privatization plan does nothing for the solvency \nof Social Security when it needs it in 37 years and, instead, does the \nopposite by whacking benefits and increasing the national debt \nconsiderably, whether you look at a 10-year or a 75-year period, \nwhatever one is calculating.\n  This Senator is not going to whack or cut Social Security benefits, \nnor is this Senator going to go with a plan that not only cuts benefits \nbut also adds trillions of dollars to the national debt when we are \nrunning at a deficit situation where in excess of $400 billion a year \nis spending in the red. And how do we get it? We go and borrow it. By \nthe way, guess where we borrow it from. Mostly from banks in Japan and \nChina. That doesn't sound too good from a defense posture of the \ncountry. This Senator is simply not going to support that. I will \nwork with the President on the question of the solvency when it needs \nit, and we know it needs it in 37 years. But where is the President's \nplan? Unfortunately, I read in the morning paper that the President has \ndecided that he is not going to send a plan. How can the President say, \nI have a plan, we have to do something about the solvency of Social \nSecurity, and not offer a plan?\n\n  What we need is a little common sense. What is happening is there is \nso much resistance to this idea of privatization of Social Security \nthat the White House is having a second thought about whether they \nshould come forth with this plan, and that is why they are waiting to \nreveal it. If there is a good faith attempt to do something about the \nlong-term solvency of Social Security, this Senator will definitely \ncooperate.\n  It was only because a Republican President, Ronald Reagan, and a \nDemocratic congressional leader, Speaker Tip O'Neill, came together and \nsaid, we are going to solve the problem in 1982, we are going to solve \nthe problem in a bipartisan fashion, and we are not going to play \n``gotcha'' politics, and it is going to be a substantive solution--that \nwas one of the finest moments of the Congress, coming together in \nbipartisanship to solve a major, thorny, highly risky kind of problem. \nThe Congress and the executive came together and did that. But that was \nin an environment and attitude and atmosphere of genuine bipartisanship \ninstead of this scoring of partisan points that seems to be done today.\n  I recommend that the White House come forth with its plan and do so \nin a bipartisan fashion, and then we can get the job done.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed \nto speak as in morning business and that the time not be deducted from \nthe debate time on Mr. Chertoff's nomination.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                            social security\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, President Bush and many of his supporters \nin Congress are trying to convince the American people about the so-\ncalled Social Security privatization plan. They are arguing that there \nis going to be a bargain by borrowing $2 trillion now instead of paying \nover $10 trillion later in the shortfall on Social Security. Once you \nlearn the reality of the President's Social Security bargain, you \nunderstand why Americans of all ages are unwilling to buy into this \nSocial Security privatization scheme.\n  The $2 trillion it would cost to transition to a privatized Social \nSecurity system would do absolutely nothing to solve Social Security's \nlong-term funding challenge. The argument on the other side was being \nmade yesterday by\n\n[[Page S1315]]\n\nthe chairman of the Republican conference, Senator Santorum of \nPennsylvania. He was on a television show on which I also appeared. He \nwas confronted with the cost of the transition for privatizing Social \nSecurity. He said:\n\n       I disagree with that. I mean, you remember the old Fram Oil \n     Filter commercial--``pay me now or pay me later.'' And if we \n     don't do something now to put a down payment for young people \n     so they have an opportunity to have a hope for something \n     better than the system now will provide them, we are looking \n     at huge tax increases down the line, big benefit cuts down \n     the line, and huge deficits.\n\n  As you look at the actual costs involved with the transition under \nprivatization, you understand why this is not the bargain that has been \ndescribed. The President wants to take $2 trillion out of the Social \nSecurity trust fund. He does this by saying we are going to let people \ninvest in their own private accounts, as he calls them, with money out \nof the Social Security trust fund. Unfortunately, he has made no \nsuggestion whatsoever on how we are going to pay back the amount of \nmoney being taken out of the Social Security trust fund. In fact, this \ntaking money out of the Social Security trust fund is not going to \nstrengthen it; it is going to weaken it.\n  Look at the President's proposal and what it means--the Social \nSecurity shortfall, the cost of other administration policies over the \nnext 75 years. Presently, there are key dates for Social Security; \ni.e., the date when benefits paid out exceed tax revenues coming in. \nUnder current law, it is 2018. Now we have a buildup, a surplus in \nSocial Security, so it will continue to pay out.\n  Under the President's proposal, benefits would exceed tax revenues in \n2012. Benefits exceed all revenues in 2028 under current law and, under \nthe President's proposal, in 2020. The year when the trust fund is \nexhausted is 2041 by the current law. Under the President's \nprivatization proposal, it is 2031.\n  What the President has proposed is no way to strengthen Social \nSecurity; it weakens it. This argument by Senator Santorum that we \neither incur this debt today of $2 trillion or face $10 trillion in the \nfuture ignores the obvious: that we would incur the debt today of $2 \ntrillion and the debt of $10 trillion in the future.\n  The President presents his idea to privatize Social Security as if it \nis a solution to the long-term funding challenge. As I have shown with \nthe chart, it is not. Based on the few details we have seen about the \nPresident's privatization, adding private accounts would accelerate the \ndate in which benefit payouts exceed tax revenues. This surplus that we \nwill continue to have until 2018 would disappear by 2012 under the \nPresident's proposal.\n  So why are we doing this? People have said: You Democrats are \ncriticizing a lot; where is your plan? If we are going to start with \nthe plan, we ought to start with some basic agreement, and it ought to \nbe this: Whatever you put on the table should make Social Security \nstronger, not weaker. It should not have a dramatic cut in the benefit \npayments being made by Social Security. Whatever you put on the table \nshould not incur a debt of many trillions of dollars for future \ngenerations. Sadly, the President's proposal fails on every single one \nof those suggestions. It does not strengthen Social Security. It cuts \nbenefits dramatically--up to 40 percent--according to a Boston College \nsurvey that came out last week, and it puts $2 trillion more debt on \nyounger people.\n  So the idea of being able to invest a little bit more of your money \nin something that may--if your investments are wise--mean more return \ndoesn't hold out much hope for a younger generation that sees the debt \nof America being driven up dramatically by the President's proposals.\n  In exchange for making the Social Security trust fund financing \nworse, the President wants to borrow $2 trillion. This sea of red ink \nshown on this chart is the story of the Bush economic policy. When the \nPresident came to office, we were actually generating a surplus in the \nTreasury. And a surplus in our budget meant we weren't borrowing as \nmuch from Social Security; we were making it stronger.\n  So the plan to strengthen Social Security was there when the \nPresident arrived, but the President said: I have a better idea. Let's \nstop doing things the way we did in the past and let's give tax cuts \nprimarily to the wealthiest people in America. That will really pay \noff.\n  Look what it paid off in--the biggest deficit in the history of the \nU.S. At a time when many of us warned the administration you cannot \nreally look into the future and say with any certainty what America \nwill face, be careful about cutting taxes, the administration said: \nStep aside, we have a majority and we are going to pass it. If you \ndon't like it, just step aside.\n  So a lot of us watched as these tax cuts were enacted. Look at the \ndeficit projected from the tax cuts. Now the President wants to make it \nworse. The President is proposing adding to this national debt by \nprivatizing Social Security and not paying for it. The President is \nsuggesting adding even more debt to future generations and doing so by \nmaking the tax cuts permanent.\n  Now, people like tax cuts. That is appealing. Every politician would \nlike to get up before every audience and say I am going to cut your \ntaxes and get a little round of applause. Then you look at it and ask, \nis that smart to do? The first obvious question is: Under President \nBush's tax cuts, who wins and who loses?\n\n  I can tell you what the numbers show. Of the tax cuts that will take \neffect this year, 90 percent will go to people making over $200,000 a \nyear. Over 50 percent of the new tax cuts will go to people with \nincomes of more than a million dollars a year. Half of the tax cuts \nthat will take effect this year will go to people making over a million \ndollars a year.\n  At a time when the budget cannot find enough money for health care, \nparticularly for the elderly in nursing homes and for children in poor \nfamilies with mothers working two or three low-wage jobs, this \nPresident want to make his tax cuts of hundreds of millions of dollars \nto those making over a million dollars a year permanent. At a time when \nwe are closing down Amtrak, when this administration is not properly \nfunding veterans health care, they want to make tax cuts to people \nmaking over a million dollars a permanent.\n  Well, it is a program that hasn't worked to this point. Over the last \n4 years, we have seen our deficits get dramatically worse. The \nPresident talks about the Social Security funding shortfall over an \neternity. It will be interesting to take a look at what, first, the \ncost of privatizing Social Security will be. The amount provided in the \nPresident's budget for Social Security is zero. That is why the \nPresident's proposal has exactly that much credibility--zero.\n  If the President really believed in his privatization plan, he would \nput it in the budget. Why didn't he? Because it costs so much money; \n$754 billion is the lowest estimate for the first 10 years of the \nPresident's plan.\n  Look at the next 10; it is $4.5 trillion. We talk about trillions of \ndollars here in Washington. The President won't talk about this at all. \nHe will not include the cost of his privatization plan in the budget \nbecause it costs too much. He cannot afford to pay it.\n  Take a look at, over the long haul, what it means. If he makes his \ntax cuts permanent through 2078--a long period of time--this is how \nmuch money will be taken out of the Treasury, $2 trillion. Then look at \nthe Social Security shortfall. It is one-third of that amount. If the \nPresident decided, here is a radical idea, we are not going to give tax \ncuts to people who make over a million dollars a year--you seem to be \ndoing OK in America; this country has treated you pretty nicely, so we \nare not going to give you a tax cut--if we just said that and put the \nmoney in Social Security, it would be strong.\n  Maybe there are other things we could do to make it even stronger. \nBut this administration is bound and determined to give these tax cuts \nto the wealthiest people in America.\n  I think when you take a look at this, you also have to remember \nsomething else. Who owns America's debt? Who holds America's mortgage? \nWho are the creditors we have to worry about? It turns out, it is \nforeign countries, primarily China and Japan. The U.S. economy is now \nincreasingly dependent on a handful of foreign central banks for our \neconomic stability and security. It is not only shortsighted to\n\n[[Page S1316]]\n\ncome up with privatization plans that you do not pay for, tax cuts for \nwealthy people that you don't pay for; it is shortsighted to be even \nmore dependent on foreign countries that hold our debt.\n  Listen to this. Last October the chief currency analyst at MG \nFinancial Group, one of the oldest companies in the retail foreign \nexchange industry, said as follows:\n\n       The stability of the bonds market is at the mercy of Asian \n     purchases of U.S. treasuries.\n\n  Let me translate. What if the mortgage on your home was in the hands \nof someone who on any day could call you and say ``pay it all off''? It \nis not like 15, 20, or 30-year mortgages but a mortgage they could call \nin tomorrow. What if they started worrying about your financial \ncircumstances? What if they worried that you would not have a paycheck \nnext week or somebody was sick in your home? Will they start worrying \nabout whether you are going to make the payments? Getting nervous, they \ncould call in that debt. It can happen. It can happen in this world. In \nthe world situation, when they lose confidence, as this gentleman is \nsuggesting, in the U.S. economy and the U.S. budget, we become even \nmore vulnerable, and foreign countries such as China and Japan can say, \nall right, we will not call in your mortgage, we will just raise the \ninterest rate. What will we do then? There is no place to turn. They \ncan say, incidentally, we are not that confident about your dollar. We \nare going to start saying you have to convert your dollar into euro \ndollars or some other currency.\n  All of these factors complicate our lives dramatically. The more we \nare in debt, the more we are dependent on foreign countries. These \ncountries, coincidentally, export to the United States dramatic amounts \nof goods and services that cost us valuable jobs in America. It is no \ncoincidence; Japan, China, Korea, other Asian countries that hold our \ndebt are also holding America's workers by the throat. They understand \nthey have us.\n\n  So what does this conservative administration, this Bush \nadministration propose? More debt, more dependence, more power to our \ncreditors, such as China and Japan. How can that make America any \nstronger? In fact, it makes us weaker.\n  I sometimes wonder when I look at the long-term view whether people \nin the White House are stepping back to look at the reality of the \nworld we live in; that here we are with a supplemental appropriation of \n$21 billion to fight the war in Iraq--and I will vote for that and \nevery penny for which this administration asks. If it were my son or \ndaughter, I would want them to have everything they need to be safe in \nthis war. But at the same time, we are so dependent on foreign oil, \nbuying it at record levels because we do not have a basic policy of \nenergy conservation in America.\n  A couple weeks ago, my wife and I bought a new hybrid car, a Ford. We \nare driving it around, getting used to it, hoping it works as promised. \nWhy is it that we are not pushing for more fuel-efficient vehicles so \nthere is less dependence on foreign oil? At the same time we are \nappropriating money to fight this war, we are sending money hand over \nfist to these oil-producing countries that, through the backdoor, are \nsending money to support terrorism. Does that make any sense? Why would \nwe not have an energy policy that also is about the security of \nAmerica, which means an energy policy that reduces our dependence on \nforeign oil. Why don't we have a budgetary policy that reduces our \ndependence on foreign lenders, such as China and Japan?\n  Exactly the opposite is coming out of this administration. It is \ntotally upside down. It lacks common sense.\n  Holdings of Treasury bonds by Japan were at $722 billion last \nOctober. China's rose to $191 billion. Steven Roach, the chief \neconomist at Morgan Stanley, said:\n\n       If all we have funding our current account imbalance is the \n     good graces of foreign central banks, we are increasingly on \n     thin ice.\n\n  So this bargain that the administration has proposed in privatizing \nSocial Security drives us deeper in debt, which the President will not \npay for, a debt for future generations and a debt held by foreign \ngovernments, and we become their debtors and at their mercy.\n  We have to understand this. The President's proposal makes Social \nSecurity's long-term finances worse. It worsens our short- and long-\nterm budget outlook by trillions of dollars. It leaves our \ngrandchildren to pay higher taxes on our national debt. And it makes us \nmore dependent on foreign countries, such as Japan and China. That is \nnot a good proposal for America.\n  Let me tell you what I think we should do. I have lived through this \nbefore. As a new Member of the House of Representatives back in the \n1980s, I no sooner arrived in town and they said Social Security is in \ntrouble; we need to do something, and we need to do it now. I thought \nto myself: I got here just in time.\n  So President Ronald Reagan, the leading Republican, turned to Speaker \nof the House Tip O'Neill, the leading Democrat, and said: Mr. Speaker, \nlet's do this together. Let's create an honest bipartisan commission \nand let them come back with some proposals.\n  Alan Greenspan, known as a Republican but respected as an economist, \ncame forward and headed up the Commission. They came up with a list. \nThey said here is what you have to do to Social Security to keep it \nstrong for a long time. Take your pick, but you have to do some of \nthese things and do them now, in the early 1980s. It was a big debate. \nThe debate went on for a long time.\n  Were we going to increase the age by which people could retire on \nSocial Security? Would we increase the payroll tax? Would we cut \nbenefits? None of it was really that appealing. The idea of Social \nSecurity missing a payment was totally unacceptable. So we came \ntogether, Democrats and Republicans. We agreed. We passed the bill. \nPresident Reagan signed the bill.\n  What happened as a result of our action? We bought 58 or 59 years of \nstrength and solvency in Social Security. And that is exactly what we \nshould do now. Set aside this privatization plan. It is headed nowhere. \nThe American people are not buying it. Instead, let's do this on a \nbipartisan basis. Let the President propose a real, honest bipartisan \ncommission and let them come up with honest, commonsense ways, when \nplayed out over 40, 50 years, that will make Social Security stronger.\n  We rose to that challenge--I was here when it happened--and we can do \nit again. But we need to detoxify this debate, pull the ideologues, \npeople who have these extreme views about getting rid of Social \nSecurity, get them out of the picture. We do not need them in the room. \nSocial Security needs to be here for future generations. Both parties \nare usually committed to that goal, and they should be committed to it \ntoday.\n  I suggest the President's privatization plan is a nonstarter. It is a \nplan that does not have the appeal that he thought it would. I am sure \nthere were some excited about it initially. It just is not getting off \nthe ground.\n  Republican leaders, such as the Speaker of the House, said last week \nin a front page interview in the Chicago Tribune that you cannot force \nan idea such as this down the throats of the American people. I think \nhe is right. I think he has recognized the reality. And I think he is \nwilling, on a bipartisan basis, to look at alternatives. That is the \nway we should all approach it--a bipartisan approach that truly \nstrengthens and does not weaken Social Security, a bipartisan approach \nthat does not make wholesale cuts in benefits and add dramatically to \nAmerica's debt. That is the way we should approach this issue.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cornyn). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, let me begin by saying I intend to vote to \nconfirm Judge Chertoff to be Secretary of the Department of Homeland \nSecurity based on what I know of him. What deeply troubles me is that \ninformation relevant to his confirmation has been arbitrarily denied to \nthe Senate by the Justice Department.\n\n[[Page S1317]]\n\n  In the course of preparing for the Homeland Security and Governmental \nAffairs Committee hearing on Judge Chertoff's nomination, a document \ncame to my attention bearing on Judge Chertoff's responsibilities when \nhe headed the Justice Department's Criminal Division. The document was \nrecently released by the FBI in response to a Freedom of Information \nAct, or FOIA, request by the American Civil Liberties Union. It is \ndated May 10, 2004. It indicates that FBI personnel working at the \nGuantanamo detention facility had major concerns about interrogation \ntechniques used on detainees from Afghanistan by Department of Defense \npersonnel, which techniques ``differed drastically'' from traditional \nmethods employed by FBI personnel, DOD and FBI techniques differed so \ndrastically that FBI agents decided they had to ``step out of the \npicture'' so as not to participate in DOD-led interrogations.\n  Department of Defense interrogation techniques have been the focus of \na number of investigations into detainee abuse allegations, including \nabuses graphically depicted in the photographs from Abu Ghraib prison. \nMG George Fay, who investigated detainee abuses by military \nintelligence personnel at Abu Ghraib, found that interrogators at that \nprison were improperly using harsh interrogation techniques that came \nfrom Guantanamo, including stress positions, isolation, nudity, and the \nuse of dogs to ``fear up'' detainees.\n  The report of the panel chaired by former Secretary of Defense James \nSchlesinger found that these ``more aggressive'' interrogation \ntechniques developed at Guantanamo ``migrated'' to Afghanistan and Iraq \nand contributed to widespread abuses.\n  The FBI document about which I am talking today makes clear that \nconcerns about DOD's interrogation techniques in use at Guantanamo, and \nso strenuously objected to by FBI agents, started at least as early as \nthe fall of 2002, before the abuses occurred at Abu Ghraib and \nelsewhere.\n  The document at issue indicates that FBI agents communicated \nregularly with Justice Department officials, including senior officials \nin the Criminal Division headed by Mr. Chertoff before he was appointed \nto the Federal bench. The FBI agents' communications expressed their \ndeep concerns about techniques employed by DOD personnel.\n  Let me read from the document at issue that we will be referring to \nthis afternoon which is displayed on the chart beside me. It is from an \nFBI e-mail to T.J. Harrington from an official whose name has been \nredacted. It reads in part as follows:\n\n       I went to GTMO with blank--\n\n  That is the first of many redacted items on this document.\n\n       I went to GTMO with blank early on. We discussed the \n     effectiveness of blank with the supervisory special agent. \n     We, BAU--\n\n  Which is the Behavior Analysis Unit--\n\n     and ITOS1 the International Terrorism Operations Section 1--\n     had also met with Generals Dunlevey and Miller explaining our \n     position, law enforcement techniques versus the Department of \n     Defense. Both agreed the Bureau has their way of doing \n     business and the DoD has their marching orders from the Sec \n     Def.\n       Although the two techniques differ drastically, both \n     generals believed that they had a job to accomplish . . . In \n     my weekly meetings with the DOJ, we often discussed BLANK \n     techniques and how they were not effective or producing Intel \n     that was reliable.\n\n  Then there is a series of blanks, which appear to be the individuals' \nnames which have been redacted or withheld from release, with the \nabbreviation ``SES'' after the names that were blotted out, indicating \nthat the individuals were members of the Senior Executive Service. The \ndocument then says, and these are the critical words, that all of those \nSES employees were from the Department of Justice's Criminal Division \nand that they ``attended meetings with the FBI.'' It goes on to say, \n``all agreed blank were going to be an issue in the military commission \ncases. I know blank brought this to the attention of blank.''\n  Now, it is those redactions, those names, and that information which \nhas been deleted, including the names of the senior officials in the \nCriminal Division of the Department of Justice participating in \nmeetings with the FBI agents, which thwart the Senate in its \nconstitutional role of deliberating on Judge Chertoff.\n  Judge Chertoff was head of the Criminal Division from April of 2001 \nuntil June of 2003. It is the division that he headed whose members are \nreferred to here but whose names are blotted out so that we are unable \nto know who they are and we are unable to talk to those members of \nJudge Chertoff's Criminal Division.\n  On February 4, 2005, a little more than a week ago, Senator Lieberman \nand I wrote to FBI Director Robert Mueller regarding this document. A \ncopy of that letter is displayed next to me. This is what Senator \nLieberman and I wrote:\n\n       We ask that an unredacted version of this three-page \n     document be provided to the Office of Senate Security where \n     we and staff members with appropriate clearance can review \n     it. Please provide an unredacted copy . . . by no later than \n     4 p.m. on Friday, February 4, 2005. If you will not provide a \n     copy of this document, please provide a legal justification \n     for doing so.\n\n  In a letter dated February 7, the Department of Justice, not the FBI \nto whom we wrote but the Department of Justice, wrote back denying our \nrequest. The Justice Department claimed that an unredacted copy would \nnot be provided to us because it contained, and it is referred to in \nthis letter next to me, ``information covered by the Privacy Act, . . . \nas well as deliberative process material.''\n  The Justice Department's reasons for denying the request of Senator \nLieberman and myself are not just unfounded and unacceptable. They are \nincredible. They are extreme. The Privacy Act is designed primarily to \nprevent the U.S. Government from disclosing personal information about \nprivate individuals who have not consented to that disclosure. It is \nnot intended to be a means of concealing the names of public officials \nengaged in Government conduct funded with taxpayers' dollars.\n  The Department of Justice's invocation of the Privacy Act to deny the \nSenate relevant information regarding a nomination before the Senate is \nan abuse of the Privacy Act and a dangerous precedent. Denying Congress \ndocuments relevant to our functions, if sustained, would effectively \nend most congressional oversight because Government employees are named \nin thousands of documents which Congress relies on in carrying out \nresponsibility.\n  Senator Lieberman and I have written to Attorney General Gonzalez \nrequesting that he reconsider the decision to withhold this \ninformation.\n  When I asked Judge Chertoff about this document at his nomination \nhearing on February 2, he could not recall discussions between FBI and \nDepartment of Justice Criminal Division officials concerning Department \nof Defense interrogation techniques at Guantanamo. He stated:\n\n       I don't recall having any discussion about techniques that \n     the Defense Department was using in Guantanamo, other than \n     simply the question of whether interrogations or questioning \n     down there was effective or not.\n\n  Judge Chertoff could not say who were the Criminal Division officials \nwhose names had been redacted from the document which was up here a \nmoment ago. Nor could he even confirm that the discussions referred to \nin the document between people from his Criminal Division and the FBI \nand Defense Department officials occurred during his tenure as head of \nthe Criminal Division.\n  If Judge Chertoff does not know that these discussions took place or \nwho in his division might have engaged in these discussions or when \nthey took place, does that not end the matter? If he is unable to say \nthat those people whose names are blotted out talked to him or anybody \nin their supervisory capacity who supervised them, does that not bring \nthis matter to an end? Of course it does not, and it cannot.\n  By denying the Senate access to the names listed in the document, the \nDepartment of Justice has prevented the Senate from finding out that \ninformation so we might refresh Judge Chertoff's recollection about the \nconversations referred to in the document, which involves senior \nCriminal Division personnel that he was the head of; conversations with \nthe FBI and Department of Defense personnel regarding DOD interrogation \ntechniques at Guantanamo.\n  Now, if the names of the Criminal Division personnel were known to \nhim, which they are not--they are obviously blotted over--or if they \nwere known to\n\n[[Page S1318]]\n\nus, surely we could ask those persons if they discussed these matters \nwith people who are higher up in the Criminal Division, their \nsupervisors, including possibly with the head of the Criminal Division, \nJudge Chertoff. We clearly have a right to find out their names to ask \nthem the same relevant questions that we could ask them if their names \nwere not redacted.\n  If we knew the names, in other words, surely it is relevant, it is \nappropriate for the Senate to ask these members of Judge Chertoff's \nCriminal Division, did you discuss these matters that you overheard and \nwere participating in with your supervisors at the Criminal Division? \nDid you ever bring these to the attention of now Judge Chertoff?\n  If the names were not redacted, if it is appropriate for us to ask \nthe names on that memo those questions, clearly we have a right to find \nout who they were so we can ask those same relevant questions.\n  By its contorted reliance on the Privacy Act, the Justice Department \nis denying the Senate information relevant to our consideration of \nwhether to give our consent to this nominee. Our constitutional mandate \nis clear. The Justice Department's decision to cover up this \ninformation is deeply disturbing. Not only is the Senate being \nthwarted, the American public is being denied relevant information. If \nthis misuse of the Privacy Act is not resisted, congressional oversight \nof our governmental activities will be controlled by the executive \nbranch that we are supposed to oversee. We cannot allow the Department \nof Justice's action to stand unchallenged.\n  The Congress obtains thousands of documents from the executive branch \nas part of our oversight responsibility, and we must. We had an \ninvestigation in the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations of the \noperation of the Comptroller of the Currency. Thousands of documents \nwere obtained with names of Government employees and we reached a \nconclusion that one of those employees had worked so closely with one \nof the banks that was being investigated that, in effect, he had \nabdicated his responsibility as a Government employee to oversee that \nbank he later took a job with.\n\n  The same thing has been true with the Boeing investigation. It is \ntrue with hundreds of investigations. We must be able to obtain \nGovernment documents, and we do obtain Government documents, all the \ntime in Congress as part of our oversight responsibility. If the names \nof Government employees who are paid with taxpayer dollars are \nredacted, are not available to Congress, because allowing their names \nto be in those documents violates their privacy, this will wipe out the \noversight responsibility of the Congress.\n  Senator Lieberman and I have sought this particular document and we \nhave done so because the document is relevant to this confirmation \nprocess. The refusal of the administration to produce this unredacted \ndocument thwarts our constitutional responsibility. There seems to be \nsomething ingrained in the administration to thwart congressional \noversight, particularly on the issue of detainee abuse. The history of \nthis detainee abuse is important as a backdrop to what my point is this \nafternoon.\n  A specialist by the name of Joseph Darby courageously came forward in \nthe Defense Department in January of 2004 with allegations and photos \nof terrible abuses at Abu Ghraib. The administration did not inform \nCongress of the existence, the nature and the scope of these \nallegations and photos until April 28, almost 5 months later in 2004.\n  They did come forward and notify Congress because that is the day the \npictures were aired on a major network news program. The Congress only \nlearned of the report of Major General Taguba who investigated the \nallegations of abuse by military police at Abu Ghraib between January \n31 and March 12, 2004, after his report was leaked to the press in \nearly May of 2004. We did not learn of White House Counsel Gonzales's \nmemo of January 25, 2002, advising the President that the protections \nof the Geneva Conventions were ``obsolete'' and ``quaint,'' to use his \nwords, until that memo was obtained by the press in mid-May 2004.\n  We did not learn of the August 1, 2002, memo by the Office of Legal \nCounsel on his novel interpretation of the anti-torture statute, the \nso-called torture memo, until it was obtained by the press in early \nJune of 2004. That was the memo that defined prohibited torture \nextremely narrowly; for example, that physical pain would have to be \nequivalent to organ failure, impairment of bodily functions, or death \nto count as torture under the anti-torture statute.\n  We now know of a second Office of Legal Counsel opinion from around \nthe same time as the August 1, 2002, torture memo, which analyzes the \nlegality of specific interrogation techniques. That memo has still not \nbeen made available to Congress.\n  The Armed Services Committee of the Senate made a standing request on \nMay 13, 2004, in a letter from Chairman Warner to Secretary Rumsfeld, \nfor ``all relevant documentation'' regarding the allegations of \nprisoner abuse and for ``all legal reviews and related documentation \nconcerning approval of interrogation techniques.''\n  The response to date can only be considered slow and partial.\n  The Defense Department has engaged in considerable foot-dragging in \ngetting to Congress the findings of its investigations into key aspects \nof the detainee abuse issue. Although the Department of Defense at one \npoint estimated that the report of General Formica regarding abuse \nallegations against Special Operations Forces in Iraq would be ready \nlast August, and this report was briefed to the Secretary of Defense \nover a month ago, only late last Friday afternoon did the Armed \nServices Committee receive this report. We have yet to receive the \nreport of Navy Inspector General Vice Admiral Church in the Department \nof Defense interrogation techniques in Guantanamo, Afghanistan, Iraq, \nand elsewhere. The Defense Department initially estimated that this \nreport would be ready 6 months ago. The Department's slow-rolling has \ndelayed additional public hearings on the detainee abuse issue.\n  It is astonishing to me that only after becoming aware of the \nallegations of detainee abuse at Guantanamo contained in the documents \nproduced by the FBI under this ACLU FOIA request did the Department of \nDefense direct that an investigation into those allegations be \ninitiated.\n  The FBI documents that have been released under the FOIA request, \nalthough redacted, nonetheless describe the FBI's battles during 2002 \nand 2003 with Department of Defense commanders at Guantanamo regarding \nthe use by the Department of Defense of ``aggressive'' and ``coercive'' \ninterrogation techniques. In response to an FBI internal inquiry, \nallegations of detainee mistreatment at Guantanamo surfaced during the \nsummer of 2004. This led the Bureau's Inspection Division in July of \n2004 to contact all employees who served at Guantanamo after September \n11, 2001, and request any information regarding detainee mistreatment \nat that facility.\n  FBI employees' responses to the FBI Inspection Division's request \nrelating to Guantanamo indicate that FBI personnel repeatedly raised \nconcerns regarding Department of Defense interrogation techniques, \nincluding with Department of Defense commanders at Guantanamo from late \n2002 into mid-2003. One e-mail, dated May 10, 2004, described how FBI \nofficials raised their concerns with General Dunlavey, who was in \ncharge of interrogation operations until October 2002, and with General \nMiller, who was commander of the facility from October 2002 until March \nof 2004. In these discussions the FBI officials were told:\n\n       DOD has their marching orders from the Sec Def [Secretary \n     of Defense].\n\n  The agent adds:\n\n       Although the two [agencies'] techniques differed \n     drastically, both Generals believed they had a job to \n     accomplish.\n\n  Another e-mail, dated December 9, 2002, states that it has two \nattachments: a description of an interrogation matter raised with the \ncommanding general at Guantanamo, presumably General Miller, and \nsecond:\n\n     . . . an outline of the coercive techniques in the military's \n     interviewing tool kit.\n\n  The FBI agent concludes by saying that he will bring back to \nheadquarters a copy of the military's interview plan for an unnamed \ndetainee, saying, ``You won't believe it!''\n\n[[Page S1319]]\n\n  The responses to the FBI's internal inquiry show that FBI officials \nhad many objections to DOD interrogation techniques. In his \nconfirmation hearing, Judge Chertoff suggested that FBI and DOD \ndifferences regarding interrogation techniques at Guantanamo might have \nrelated to whether Miranda warnings were to be provided, but that was \nnot the case. FBI agents had official guidance not to provide to \ndetainees at Guantanamo Miranda warnings. The differences between the \ntwo agencies' methods were different than that, and they went much \ndeeper.\n  Other FBI documents produced under the FOIA request show that agents \ncomplained about the effectiveness of DOD's methods for producing \nreliable intelligence compared to the FBI's interviewing techniques. \nOne agent reported telling DOD officials that the intelligence the \nDepartment of Defense was producing was ``nothing more than what FBI \ngot using simple investigative techniques.'' Another FBI official \ncomplained that when an agent would begin to develop a rapport with the \ndetainee, ``the military would step in and the detainee would stop \nbeing cooperative.''\n\n  Another major FBI concern was that Department of Defense \ninterrogators were impersonating FBI agents. In one e-mail dated \nDecember 5, 2003, an FBI agent complained that DOD interrogators had \nimpersonated FBI agents in attempting to produce intelligence. The FBI \nagents expressed a concern that should this detainee's story ever be \nmade public, the FBI would be left ``holding the bag'' because it would \nappear that ``these torture techniques were done [by] `FBI' \ninterrogators.''\n  A couple of the FBI e-mails challenged Defense Department officials' \npublic statements in 2004 regarding Department of Defense methods of \ninterrogation used at Guantanamo. For example, one e-mail dated May 13, \n2004, reacts to statements of MG Geoffrey Miller, who at that time had \nmoved from commanding the Guantanamo facility to Iraq, where he was in \ncharge of all detention facilities, including Abu Ghraib. This is what \nthat e-mail said:\n\n       Yesterday . . . we were surprised to read an article in \n     Stars and Stripes in which General Miller is quoted as saying \n     that he believes in the rapport-building approach. This is \n     not what he was saying at Gitmo when I was there--redacted--\n     and I did cartwheels. The battles fought in Gitmo while \n     General Miller was there are on the record.\n\n  Constant battles between the FBI, part of the Department of Justice, \nand the Department of Defense officials at GTMO.\n  The FBI agents' responses to the Inspection Division's request \nregarding Guantanamo refer to other documents reflecting the FBI \nagents' serious concerns over Department of Defense interrogation \ntechniques. Among the documents cited are a lengthy ``electronic \ncommunication'' drafted by the FBI's Behavioral Analysis Unit. That \ncommunication is dated May 30, 2003. It contrasts the Bureau's \ninterrogation methodology with that of the Department of Defense.\n  Another document is an electronic communication by the FBI's Military \nLiaison and Detention Unit in November of 2003:\n\n     . . . as to FBI's disapproval--redacted--regardless of \n     whether they [those are the Department of Defense \n     interrogation techniques] were approved by the Deputy \n     Secretary of Defense.\n\n  Another document is a ``must read'' electronic communication from the \nFBI's Miami division.\n  A December 2003 e-mail refers to a request by the Military Liaison \nand Detention Unit that:\n\n     . . . information be documented to protect the FBI [because \n     of their] longstanding and documented position against use of \n     some of DOD's interrogation practices. . . .\n\n  Either these documents remain unreleased to the public or, if \nreleased, their content has been almost entirely redacted.\n  Reflecting the position of the documents I referred to is a May 19, \n2004, memo to all divisions from FBI General Counsel Valerie Caproni. \nThis memo states that:\n\n       Existing FBI policy . . . has consistently provided that \n     FBI personnel may not obtain statements during interrogations \n     by the use of force, threats, physical abuse, threats of such \n     abuse or severe physical conditions,\n\nand that:\n\n     no interrogation of detainees, regardless of status, shall be \n     conducted using methods which could be interpreted as \n     inherently coercive, such as physical abuse or the threat of \n     such abuse to the person being interrogated or to any third \n     party, or imposing severe physical conditions.\n\n  This memo from the FBI General Counsel continues as follows: that FBI \npersonnel who participate in interrogations with non-FBI personnel \nshall comply with FBI policy at all times, and specifically:\n\n       FBI personnel shall not participate in any treatment or use \n     any interrogation technique that is in violation of these \n     guidelines regardless of whether the co-interrogator is in \n     compliance with his or her own guidelines.\n\n  Accordingly, the guidance to FBI personnel was to remove themselves \nfrom the situation if the interrogation is being conducted in a manner \nnot compliant with FBI policy.\n  In response to the FBI Inspection Division's request, several FBI \nagents reported observing ``aggressive treatment'' of detainees at \nGuantanamo. One agent reports witnessing on a couple of occasions \ndetainees ``chained hand and foot in a fetal position on the floor, \nwith no chair, food, or water.''\n  This FBI agent describes how oftentimes these detainees had urinated \nor defecated on themselves, having been left in this position for 18 or \n24 hours or more. One detainee subjected to these techniques had \napparently been ``literally pulling his own hair out throughout the \nnight.'' The agent speculated that these techniques were being used by \n``the military, government contract employees'' and a third group whose \nidentity has been redacted.\n  The FBI documents indicate that Bureau officials intended to notify \nthe Defense Department regarding the FBI Inspection Division's findings \nregarding Guantanamo abuse allegations. A summary of that internal \ninquiry states that 26 of the agents who responded to the Inspection \nDivision's request said they had observed some form of detainee \nmistreatment by non-FBI personnel.\n  After reviewing these statements, FBI General Counsel Valerie Caproni \ndeemed 17 of these incidents to involve ``appropriate DOD-approved \ninterrogation techniques.'' The remaining nine were determined to \nrequire followup interviews. The summary states that the FBI Inspection \nDivision was to prepare a report based on those followup interviews, to \nbe forwarded to General Counsel Caproni, who would, in turn, notify the \nDefense Department.\n  It is not clear whether this report was ever prepared or provided to \nthe Defense Department. If it does exist, the Defense Department has \nnot provided it to the Senate Armed Services Committee.\n  In addition, other FBI documents released under the FOIA request \ninclude a partially redacted letter dated July 14, 2004, from Thomas \nHarrington, who served as the head of the FBI team at Guantanamo, to MG \nDonald Ryder, who is commanding general of the Army Criminal \nInvestigation Command, detailing highly aggressive interrogation \ntechniques at Guantanamo. The incidents witnessed by FBI agents as \nearly as the fall of 2002 include what appeared to be a female \ninterrogator squeezing a male detainee's genitals and bending back his \nthumbs and the use of a dog to intimidate a detainee. Details of a \nthird incident were redacted from the letter, but according to the \npress, the letter describes a prisoner gagged with duct tape covering \nmuch of his head to prevent him from reciting from the Koran. Another \nincident involved a detainee suffering from extreme mental trauma after \nbeing kept in an isolation cell flooded with lights for 3 months.\n  The Harrington letter indicates that these incidents and other FBI \nconcerns were discussed with two officials in the Department of \nDefense's General Counsel's Office in mid-2003. Despite the Armed \nServices Committee's standing request for ``all relevant documentation \nrelating to the prisoner abuse issue,'' the committee was not told by \nthe Defense Department of receiving the Harrington letter last July, \nnor have we been informed regarding what actions the Department took in \nresponse to these allegations.\n  What the documents produced under the FOIA request indicate is that \nthe administration's policies on the meaning of torture and the \nlegality of specific interrogation techniques had opened the door to \nabuses. The document that Senator Lieberman and I\n\n[[Page S1320]]\n\nhave sought in the course of Judge Chertoff's nomination proceedings \nshows clearly that the FBI was raising its concerns about DOD \ninterrogation techniques as early as the fall of 2002.\n  That would be a few months after the Justice Department's Office of \nLegal Counsel issued its August 1, 2002, memo interpreting the Federal \nantitorture statutes.\n  The December 1, 2002, memo by Secretary Rumsfeld put the stamp of \napproval on interrogation techniques that went beyond those that were \nin existing Army doctrine, and these were for use in Guantanamo. These \nincluded stress positions, isolation, deprivation of light, auditory \nstimuli, 20-hour interrogation, nudity, and exploiting detainees' \nphobias such as the fear of dogs.\n  One month later, Secretary Rumsfeld rescinded his approval of those \ntechniques. He ultimately approved, in April of 2003, a narrower set of \ninterrogation techniques. Regardless of which memo was in effect at the \ntime of the FBI memo, Congress needs to find out whether the alleged \nmistreatment reflected the more aggressive DOD-approved interrogation \ntechniques temporarily authorized for Guantanamo in December of 2002, \nor went beyond even those.\n  The concerns that the FBI expressed to the Defense Department were \nclassified. But reports of abusive practices in Guantanamo were leaked \nto the press. The New York Times article from November of 2004 reported \non a confidential International Committee of the Red Cross report which \nfound that the highly refined system for the detention and \ninterrogation of detainees at Guantanamo was ``tantamount to torture.'' \nThe article also states that the report, based on an ICRC visit to the \nfacility the previous June, notes incidents of detainees being \nsubjected to loud, persistent music, prolonged cold, and ``some \nbeatings.''\n  The New York Times article dated January 1, 2005, cited anonymous \ninterviews with military officials who participated in interrogations \nat Guantanamo, confirming the use of the same kinds of aggressive \ninterrogation techniques which the FBI agents reported. These \ntechniques reportedly included shackling inmates for hours, leaving \nthem to soil themselves, or subjecting them to loud music. Again, as \nthe reports of General Fay and the Schlesinger panel concluded, it was \nthese aggressive techniques in use at Guantanamo which migrated, in \ntheir words, to Afghanistan and Iraq that contributed to the occurrence \nof detainee abuse there.\n  It was not just the FBI that objected to those techniques. We \nrecently learned of a June 2004 memo written by Defense Intelligence \nAgency Director VADM Lowell Jacoby to Under Secretary of Defense for \nIntelligence Stephen Cambone advising him that DIA interrogators had \nbeen threatened by U.S. special operations forces, instructed not to \nleave the compound, and ordered not to talk to anyone in the United \nStates when the DIA personnel observed and sought to document and \nreport that they had observed those personnel physically abusing \ndetainees during an interrogation in Iraq.\n  The Jacoby memorandum is another example of how this Congress has not \nbeen kept apprised and is only finding out after the fact about the \ndepth and breadth of the allegations of detainee abuse.\n  That is totally unacceptable and should energize the Congress. But \nwhat should doubly energize all of us is when the Department of Justice \ndenies us information relevant to our constitutional responsibilities, \nparticularly after there has been a specific request for that \ninformation.\n  My purpose in coming to the floor this afternoon is to alert the \nSenate to this direct challenge to our ability not only to perform our \nconfirmation responsibilities but our ability to perform our oversight \nfunction so essential to the system of checks and balances that serve \nas a brake on the powers of the executive branch regardless of who is \nin control of the executive branch.\n  It is not the first time the administration has asserted broad new \npowers to withhold information from Congress. A broad claim of \nexecutive power was made in the letter to Senator Warner and me from \nthe deputy general counsel of the Department of Defense on June 15, \n2004. The letter referred to ``the President's constitutional authority \nto withhold information the disclosure of which could impair foreign \nrelations, [or] national security, [or] the deliberative process of the \nExecutive.''\n\n  Presidents traditionally claim the constitutional authority to assert \nexecutive privilege when personally determining that it is necessary to \ndo so to protect their ability to receive candid advice from senior \nofficials in the executive branch.\n  But that is not the issue here.\n  The privilege asserted by that Department of Defense letter that \nSenator Warner and I received is not limited to cases involving \nPresidential deliberations and advice given to the President himself. \nThat letter asserts the power to make unilateral decisions to withhold \ndocuments relating to foreign relations, national security, or \ndeliberations within all parts of the executive branch.\n  That is a breathtaking claim which must be resisted--resisted on a \nbipartisan basis--by any Congress serious about the oath we have taken \nto defend the Constitution.\n  That Defense Department letter is a bald assertion of a privilege \nwhereby executive branch officials can withhold anything from Congress \nthat those officials, in their sole discretion, determine to be \nsensitive, embarrassing, or which make such officials uncomfortable. \nCongress insisted on access to documents of this kind in the past \nbecause they are essential to the conduct of our oversight functions.\n  The document withheld from us in the confirmation matter before us \ngoes beyond any previous assertion by any administration, as far as I \ncan determine. There has been no claim of executive privilege here. The \ndocument itself has no bearing on any advice given to the President by \nanybody.\n  All of us should object to the withholding of the complete May 4, \n2004, FBI memo which refers to the discussions at which members of the \nJustice Department's Criminal Division were present involving abuses at \nGuantanamo, when Judge Chertoff was head of the Criminal Division.\n  The Department of Justice's use of the Privacy Act takes the efforts \nto thwart congressional oversight to a new extreme. It is the latest \nmanifestation of the executive branch's determination to seize any \ncrumb of justification to prevent Congress access to executive branch \ndocuments relevant to carrying out our constitutional responsibilities \nof confirmation and oversight.\n  Congress should not sit idly by while the executive branch asserts \nsweeping authority to frustrate Congress's exercise of our \nconstitutional responsibility. Broad executive branch assertions of \nprivileged information and distortion of the Privacy Act threaten to \nreduce the Senate role in advising and consenting on senior level \nappointments to an exercise of rubberstamping the administration's \nnominees. The Senate should assert its constitutional power to get \ninformation relevant to the confirmation process and to our oversight \nresponsibilities.\n  We have not carried out our constitutional oversight \nresponsibilities, as far as I am concerned, in the area of detainee \nabuse as evidenced by the fresh revelations of abuse allegations in \nIraq, Afghanistan, Guantanamo, and elsewhere.\n  Those allegations did not come from our oversight activity. That \ninformation--those allegations--came from FOIA requests and media \ninitiatives.\n  The administration has not lived up to its promise to keep Congress \ninformed on the issue of prisoner abuse. The administration has \neffectively stifled even modest congressional efforts at oversight.\n  As I said at the beginning, based on the information that is \navailable, I will vote to confirm Judge Chertoff. I believe most or all \nMembers will, but all Members should stand up to the administration's \ndenial of a document which is relevant to his confirmation. We should \nact in unison to affirm and carry out the Senate's traditional \noversight activities, regardless of which party controls this body or \nthe White House.\n  I yield the floor, reserve the balance of my time, and I note 20 \nminutes of that time I would like to allocate to Senator Dodd.\n\n[[Page S1321]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Omaha.\n  Mr. COBURN. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business and that the time be taken out of the time allocated \nto speak on the nomination.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                   Medicare Prescription Drug Benefit\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President and colleagues, on Friday, the President \nsaid he would veto any changes that would, in his words, undermine the \nMedicare prescription drug benefit.\n  As one Democratic Senator who voted for the program and who wants to \nwork very much in a bipartisan way to fix this program, I would ask \nthis afternoon, with all due respect, that the President of the United \nStates reconsider his position.\n  The President says that making changes to the Medicare drug benefit \nis going to take away benefits our seniors need. But I believe that \nsmart changes now are the key to preserving seniors' benefits. Wise \nchanges are not going to endanger the Medicare drug benefit, but, mark \nmy words, refusing to mend it could end it. Spiraling costs and the low \nlevels of participation we have seen thus far may jeopardize the very \nsurvival of the Medicare drug benefit.\n  Colleagues, the reason I believe that is the combination of these \ncosts that continue to soar--they were originally appraised at about \n$400 billion; now they are upwards of $700 billion, and there are some \nestimates of $1 trillion--the combination of the escalating costs and \nthe paltry rate of seniors signing up, at least to date, means this \nprogram will require a great deal of money to be spent on a relatively \nsmall number of people. That is not a prescription for the program to \nsurvive.\n  I, for one, as someone who voted for this program and who feels \npassionately that it is important to get this right, hope the Senate \ncomes together to try to put in place the changes that the program \nneeds to get it back on track. I simply believe ignoring the obvious \nproblems I have mentioned and the threat to veto any bipartisan \nsolution is not a productive or responsible reaction.\n  Making changes to contain costs and increase participation--making \nthose changes on a bipartisan basis--is precisely what the Congress and \nthe administration ought to be spending their time doing. I, for one, \nthink the legislation that Senator Snowe and I have worked on for more \nthan 3 years is a very good place to start. But, obviously, colleagues \nof both parties have other ideas.\n  I see my friend, the distinguished Senator from Oklahoma, in the \nChamber. He and I served in the House on the Health Committee. He has \nexcellent ideas with respect to ways to hold down some of the costs in \nthe Medicare program overall, particularly in the preventive area. I \nthink he is dead on target. Senator Snowe and I have what we think is a \nbipartisan first step with respect to getting the prescription drug \nprogram back on track. But certainly colleagues in this body have other \nideas.\n  The reason Senator Snowe and I advocate the approach we are taking is \nthat it essentially builds on what is going on in the private sector. \nFor the life of me, I cannot figure out why Medicare will not be a \nsmart shopper the way everybody else is in the private sector. I have \nsaid that Medicare, as a purchaser, is pretty much like the fellow in \nPrice Club buying toilet paper one roll at a time. Nobody would shop \nthat way. It defies common sense because all across the country, if you \nare interested in purchasing something, and you are already going to \npurchase a certain amount, and you agree to buy more of it, then people \ngive you a discount. It is just economics 101. Yet Medicare has not \ngotten that message.\n\n  So under the legislation that Senator Snowe and I have been pursuing, \nwe take a sharp-pencil, fact-based, cost-containment approach that \nessentially builds on what is going on in the private sector across the \ncountry.\n  In addition to the effort to use those private sector cost-\ncontainment techniques, we would provide that drug prices be monitored \nto make sure artificial price increases do not negate the benefit to \nolder people. We would make sure that seniors have the information \nabout real savings so they can choose the plan that best makes sense \nfor them.\n  It seems to me, by refusing the opportunity to make any improvements \nto this program, the White House is writing a prescription for a \nprogram that cannot survive. I do not want to see that happen. A number \nof us in this body took some real risks to be part of this bipartisan \nplan. What I want to do is roll up my sleeves and work with the \nPresident, work with colleagues of both political parties, on a \nbipartisan, cost-containment strategy that will save this program. That \nis what this effort ought to be all about: saving this program.\n  I am not the only one who believes that Medicare's needs ought to \ntake precedence at this time. Here is what David Walker, the \nComptroller General of the Government Accountability Office, said \nrecently:\n\n       The Medicare problem is about seven times greater than the \n     Social Security problem and it has gotten much worse. It is \n     much bigger, it is much more immediate and it is going to be \n     much more difficult to effectively address.\n\n  The President has said he is going to tackle Medicare when he is done \nwith Social Security. But the facts are the facts, and the timetable \nfor trouble in Medicare is a lot tighter. At the very least now, \nchanges should be made to shore up the newest element of Medicare: the \nhard-won prescription drug benefit, that every time we turn around the \ncosts go up and up.\n  So it is time to introduce the cost-containment, attention-to-detail, \nand sharp-pencil accounting that has been lacking in this program so \nfar. I want to make it clear, failure to put in place those kinds of \napproaches jeopardizes, in my view, the very survival of this program. \nI do not want to see that happen.\n  Like a lot of colleagues--and the Senator from Oklahoma has devoted \nhis professional life to health care--I feel very strongly about this \nsubject. I got involved in health care back in the days when I was \ncodirector of the Oregon Gray Panthers and I could only dream about \nthis kind of opportunity for public service and to get this issue \nright.\n  The reason I voted for the legislation initially is I thought it was \na first step. I thought it was a constructive step because it would \nhelp people with very big bills and very low incomes. There were a lot \nof other deficiencies in it, but I thought: At least we are getting \nstarted because we are helping two groups where the need is very great. \nBut I think the events of the last few months, as I say, raise real \nquestions about whether this program can survive. I do not think, \nfrankly, the prescription drug benefit program can stand a whole lot \nmore bad news.\n  So what I would hope we would do, in addition to having the debate \nabout exactly how much this has gone up--it is very obvious it has gone \nup and up repeatedly, and is sure to go up even more--is spend our time \nwith our sleeves rolled up, working in a bipartisan way, working with \nthe President of the United States, to make sure this program delivers \non its promise.\n  A good prescription drug benefit is something this country can't \nafford not to have. Senator Coburn knows about this. He has probably \nheard exactly the same experience I hear from physicians in Oregon who \ntell me that they have actually put seniors in hospitals because there \nis not an outpatient prescription drug benefit. That is pretty bizarre, \neven by the standards of Washington, DC, to have people go into a \nhospital, roll up these enormous costs under what is called Part A of \nMedicare, because we don't have a sensible, well-designed prescription \ndrug benefit on an outpatient basis under Part B of the program.\n  When people say we cannot afford to do this, I think we can't afford \nnot to do it. But it has to be properly designed. It has to be \nstructured so as to make the best possible use of taxpayer resources \nduring a belt-tightening time in our Government.\n\n[[Page S1322]]\n\n  I hope the President will reconsider his position. I hope the \nPresident will recall his threat to veto changes to the Medicare drug \nbenefit. I assure colleagues, particularly colleagues on the other side \nof the aisle, that I want to work with them in a bipartisan way. Having \nvoted for this legislation and having the welts on my back to show for \nit, I want this legislation to succeed. So Congress has some heavy \nlifting ahead to make sure there are responsible, practical adjustments \nto this program that are going to save it for the future and to get the \njob done right for the country's older people.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Martinez). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I start my remarks by putting this debate \nin context. Senator Levin, with whom I proudly serve not only on the \nHomeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee but also on the \nSenate Armed Services Committee, catalogued some of the interrogation \ntechniques used by certain DOD personnel that for many months have \ndisturbed all of us. They have led us to hold hearings in the Armed \nServices Committee and they have led the Intelligence Committee to \nembark upon an investigation of the interrogation techniques used by \ncertain CIA employees. But today's debate is about Michael Chertoff. It \nis about whether Michael Chertoff, who has repeatedly assured us by \ndirect testimony under oath and in written responses to questions that \nhe has had nothing to do with the interrogation policy, should be \nconfirmed to be Secretary of Homeland Security.\n  I want to make that very clear. The debate today is not about the \ninterrogation policies, the techniques that led to abuses that disturb \nand concern us all. The debate today is about the fitness, the \nqualifications, and the character of Judge Michael Chertoff for this \nvery important position.\n  I turn to some of the testimony that Judge Chertoff gave in response \nto questions from Senator Levin and other members of the committee. I \nnote that his testimony before the committee was sworn testimony. He \nwas under oath, as are all of the nominees who come before our \ncommittee. As this chart shows, Judge Chertoff testified as follows:\n\n       I was not aware during my tenure at the Department of \n     Justice . . . if there were practices in Guantanamo that \n     would be torture or anything even approaching torture.\n\n  In response to another question, he said:\n\n       I don't recall having any discussion about techniques that \n     the Defense Department was using in Guantanamo other than \n     simply the question of whether interrogations or questioning \n     down there was effective or not. I was never informed or had \n     no knowledge at the time . . . about any use of techniques in \n     Guantanamo that were anything other than what I would \n     describe as kind of plain vanilla.\n\n  Again, in response to a posthearing question submitted for the record \nby Senator Levin:\n\n       [T]he tenor of the discussion was what information was \n     being furnished by detainees and whether detainees should be \n     encouraged to talk by providing offers of favorable treatment \n     in return for information. I recall no discussion of \n     mistreatment of detainees.\n\n  Mr. President, I quote from those responses because they are \nunambiguous. In addition, in the prehearing questions, Judge Chertoff \nstated unequivocally his opposition to torture, no matter where it \nmight occur.\n  Senator Levin has expressed his concern that the Department of \nJustice has refused to release information redacted from an e-mail \ndiscussing the interrogation techniques at Guantanamo Bay. I do not \nbelieve the information Senator Levin seeks is relevant to the \nimportant issue at hand, the nomination of Judge Michael Chertoff to be \nthe Secretary of Homeland Security.\n  Nonetheless, let's review what we know about this e-mail. The first \nquestion that my colleagues might well ask about this e-mail is: Did \nMichael Chertoff write the e-mail? The answer to that question is no.\n  Then my colleagues might say: Was the e-mail addressed to him? Again, \nI inform my colleagues that it was not. The answer is no.\n  My colleagues might ask: Was he a recipient of this e-mail? Was he \ncc'd on it, or bcc'd on the e-mail? Again, the answer is no.\n  Well then, you might ask: Was Michael Chertoff named in the e-mail? \nAgain, the answer is no.\n  In fact, you may ask: Had Michael Chertoff even seen the e-mail prior \nto the day of his nomination hearing? Again, the answer is no.\n  Is it surprising that Judge Chertoff testified that he had never seen \nthe e-mail prior to the day of the hearing? Again, the answer is no, it \nis not surprising at all because the e-mail was drafted a year after \nJudge Chertoff had left the Department.\n  The real question, then, is what an unredacted copy of this e-mail \ncould possibly add to our evaluation of Judge Chertoff's qualifications \nfor the job of Secretary of Homeland Security? Senator Levin has said \nthat since this e-mail refers to some discussions that may have taken \nplace while Judge Chertoff was at the Department of Justice--even \nthough the e-mail was written more than a year after he left the \nDepartment of Justice--Senator Levin says that if we got the names of \nthe Criminal Division staff who met with the FBI regarding the \ninterrogation techniques, we could attempt to question the officials \nmentioned in the e-mails in order to, and I am quoting Senator Levin, \n``refresh Judge Chertoff's recollection of these matters.''\n  First, I must say that the contention that we would need to know the \nnames and then go back and question Judge Chertoff in order to refresh \nhis recollection is, in my judgment, demeaning to Judge Chertoff. He \nwas straightforward in his testimony. He answered all the questions \nthat were posed to him, both before the hearing, at the extensive \nhearing, and after the hearing. He was unequivocal in his testimony on \nthis issue. As I have shown you with the previous posters, he said:\n\n       I was not aware during my tenure at the Department of \n     Justice if there were practices at Guantanamo that would be \n     torture or anything even approaching torture.\n\n  Second, the suggestion that we should question DOJ officials about \nJudge Chertoff's sworn testimony is one that I reject outright because \nwhat we are saying is that it assumes Judge Chertoff was not being \ncandid with the committee. There is no evidence of that. There is no \nindication at all that he was not completely truthful and forthright \nwith the committee.\n\n  Judge Chertoff has already testified under oath. I see no reason why \nwe should not take his testimony, his sworn testimony, at face value. \nThis is particularly true when there is nothing in the e-mail that \nsuggests his testimony was not accurate. We have no reason to believe \nit was not accurate. I would have to ask, have we become so cynical \nabout the good people who are making extraordinary sacrifices to serve \ntheir country? If this is what the confirmation process is becoming all \nabout, then I fear that very good people are going to say, No. They are \ngoing to say, It is not worth having my honesty questioned when all I \nam trying to do is to serve my country.\n  I remind my colleagues that Judge Chertoff is giving up a lifetime \nappointment on one of the most prestigious courts in our country in \norder to answer the call to serve in one of the most difficult, the \nmost thankless jobs in the Federal Government. It troubles me deeply \nthat we have delayed his nomination, that there are some who are \nsaying, No, I want to check on this testimony more, when there is no \nevidence to suggest that is warranted.\n  We need a strong leader in place at the Department of Homeland \nSecurity. It has been 13 days since Secretary Ridge has vacated that \nposition. We know the Department has problems--that there are \nmanagement problems, there are policy challenges. We need to get the \nSecretary in place as soon as possible. He needs to be able to get his \nteam in place to tackle the serious security issues and management \nchallenges facing the Department.\n  I think our country is very fortunate to have someone with the \nbackground, the experience, the intellect, the qualifications, and the \nintegrity of Judge Chertoff who is willing to serve. I think\n\n[[Page S1323]]\n\nwe should have confirmed him last week, and I think we need to get him \nin place without further delay.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, first, let me comment on the statement of \nmy dear friend, Senator Collins, that somehow or other seeking \ninformation is questioning anybody's integrity. We are seeking \ninformation because it is relevant to a confirmation process.\n  Senator Lieberman and I wrote a letter seeking information which \nrelates to the confirmation process in a very important way. We are not \ngoing to get that information because the Department of Justice has \ndecided they will not unredact the names of Government employees who \nwere present at discussions relative to the procedures used, the \ntechniques used at Guantanamo during the period that Judge Chertoff was \nhead of the Criminal Division and where those Government employees were \nmembers of his Criminal Division. That is not a challenge to anybody's \nintegrity. That is not demeaning. That is simply carrying out a \nresponsibility that this Senate has to be fully informed as to the \nfacts that relate to a nominee. It is that simple. It is that \nimportant.\n  For the Department of Justice to say the names of Government \nemployees somehow or other should remain secret when those employees, \npaid by the taxpayer, were present during conversations at which the \nFBI strongly objected to the techniques and tactics which were being \nused by the Department of Defense to obtain information is simply \nsomething that we as a Senate cannot accept.\n  We cannot be denied relevant information. We cannot and should not be \ndenied relevant information.\n  There is only one question here, it seems to me; that is, the request \nof Senator Lieberman and myself for relevant information. If it is \nrelevant information, every one of us should support the request. If it \nis not relevant information, it is a totally different issue. But is it \nrelevant?\n  If members of Judge Chertoff's staff, whose names have been covered \nup by the Department of Justice--if we are denied those names, is it \nrelevant that members of the Department of Justice Criminal Division \nwho were present during conversations apparently after conversations--\nwe at least know of one--where there were heated disputes between the \nFBI and the Department of Defense over the tactics which were used at \nGuantanamo Bay--Judge Chertoff doesn't remember those discussions. He \nsaid that twice in his answers. I don't disagree with him at all. If he \ndoesn't remember, I take him at his word--he doesn't remember.\n  That is not the question. The question is, Are there members of his \ndivision who were present so that we can ask them whether they informed \ntheir supervisors, and whether, just possibly, Judge Chertoff, then \nhead of the Criminal Division, was informed. If he doesn't remember \nbeing informed, I don't doubt that. I am not doubting that at all.\n  But I guess the most direct question I can ask is this: If those \nnames were not redacted, if instead we had those four names there, is \nthere any doubt in any Senator's mind that we could ask those people \nwhose names we know whether they informed their supervisors of this \nheated debate between the FBI and the Department of Defense personnel?\n  The FBI in memo after memo after memo was strongly objecting to the \npractices of military members of the Department of Defense, some of \nwhom were pretending they were FBI members. This was not one casual \nconversation. There was a major confrontation going on between the FBI, \nstrongly, heatedly, telling the Department of Defense: We can't \nparticipate in what you are doing. We object to what you are doing. \nThose techniques are wrong. We cannot participate. We are going to \nwithdraw from these techniques.\n  Then, if at least in one of these conversations--you have four SESs, \nexecutives in Judge Chertoff's division, which he headed, who were \npresent at the discussions--he says: I don't remember. Fine. I take him \nat his word.\n  But--at least if we do not have the responsibility--we surely have \nthe right, if we know those names, to ask those folks: Look. You were \npresent at these conversations. You were representing the Criminal \nDivision of the Department of Justice. The FBI was strongly objecting \nto what was going on.\n  These were abusive techniques that were being used which have created \nso much problem for this country and for our military. You were \npresent. Our question to you is this, Did you inform any of your \nsupervisors of what you heard? And, by the way, perhaps for a different \nhearing, if not, why not? But if they say no, that means obviously \nthere is nothing with which to refresh Judge Chertoff's memory.\n  The good Senator from Maine asked a number of questions to which the \nanswers were clearly no. Did he write these documents? He did not. Did \nhe receive a copy of this document? He did not. But the question that \nyes is the answer to is, if the names of those employees of the \nCriminal Division were written out in this document and not redacted, \nwould it be appropriate for a Member of the Senate or our staff to ask \nthose employees, Did you inform your supervisors of these debates going \non, which were raging debates between the FBI, the Department of \nJustice on one side and the Department of Defense on another? The \nanswer to that question, I think, is yes.\n\n  I think, without any doubt, if those names were there and not covered \nover by the Department of Justice, that it would be perfectly \nappropriate for any of us to ask John Doe: Did you report those \ndiscussions in which you were participating? Were you both, apparently, \nputting forward objections to the techniques being used and heard the \nFBI objecting to those techniques? Did you let your supervisors know?\n  If that is a legitimate question to ask those unnamed employees, if \nwe had their names, if that is a legitimate question to ask them, is it \nnot legitimate to find the names of those employees so we can ask a \nlegitimate question? I think the answer is yes.\n  I don't disagree at all with the Senator from Maine when she says \nthat Judge Chertoff didn't write it--apparently didn't receive it and \ndid not name those questions at all--and answered yes. But there are a \ncouple of questions which also have to be answered yes. If we knew the \nnames of those employees who were present at those discussions, could \nwe ask them whether they notified their supervisors? I think the answer \nis yes. That is an appropriate question.\n  Second, if so, is it an appropriate question to ask, Did you ever \ntalk to Judge Chertoff about it?\n  That doesn't challenge his integrity. He says on a number of \noccasions that he doesn't recall having any discussion about \ntechniques. I take him at his word.\n  But if they recall talking to their supervisors, then, it seems to \nme, we are in an area which is perfectly appropriate to a confirmation \nprocess.\n  There is no intent to challenge his integrity. In fact, I am going to \nvote for Judge Chertoff based on what I know. As I explained before, I \nam going to vote for Judge Chertoff based on the information before us.\n  But I think as a body we should reject unanimously--all of us--the \nexcuse given by the Department of Justice. If the Privacy Act is not \nallowed in naming Federal employees who were parties to discussions, we \nhave to reject that argument, or else we can forget congressional \noversight.\n  We get tens of thousands of documents a year that have names of \nFederal employees we need and to whom we need to talk. They cannot be \nprotected by the Privacy Act. The Privacy Act is intended to protect \nthe privacy of citizens of this country. It is not to protect from \ncongressional oversight Federal employees engaged in their duties. That \nis a misuse of a statute by the Department of Justice that has found \nall kinds of reasons over the years to deny this branch of Government \naccess to documents.\n  The issue here is a broader issue. This is an example of a problem \nthat we have in terms of getting documents. I laid this out in an \nearlier speech this afternoon in terms of the difficulty of getting \ndocumentation from this administration and other administrations--at \nthe moment, this administration--that is relevant to our oversight \nfunction and that is relevant to our confirmation process.\n  I think we have done a very inadequate job of oversight relevant to\n\n[[Page S1324]]\n\nprisoner abuse. The reasons given by myself were set forth earlier this \nafternoon. They are unacceptable.\n  We have a responsibility to our troops. Our troops are in danger \nbecause of what we did to other people. It endangers the men and women \nin our military. We cannot mock or demean the Geneva Convention. We \ncannot engage in practices which are not allowed by the Geneva \nConvention. When we do, we endanger not just our troops, as important \nas that is, but we also endanger the security of this Nation.\n  That is the backdrop here. This is not an oversight hearing we are \ntalking about. This is a confirmation proceeding of one man whose \nreputation is superb, whose integrity is unquestioned by me. And I do \nnot know of anyone who questions his integrity. The question is, As \npart of the confirmation proceeding, do we have a right--maybe not a \nresponsibility, although I could argue that question, but clearly the \nright--to ask people who were in his division who were present at these \ndiscussions whether they passed along this intense conflict between the \nDepartment of Justice and the FBI on the one hand and the Department of \nDefense on the other hand?\n  The document in question is, indeed, as the Senator from Maine said, \na 2004 document. But the reference is to events that occurred in 2002 \nand 2003. The way we know that is because the document itself makes \nreference to the two generals who were present in Guantanamo Bay in \n2002 and 2003 and were responsible for running the detention facility. \nWe also know it comes after the events in question because the purpose \nof this document is to go back into the record and to look for previous \ndocumentation that related to this subject.\n\n  Here is what triggered this document. It was an email that asked the \nfollowing question: Has there been any written guidance given to FBI \nagents in either GTMO or Iraq about when they should stand clear \nbecause of the interrogation techniques being used by DOD or DHS?\n  That is what set in motion the review of prior emails that exist, \nprior activities that existed. So this document was clearly written \nwhen that became a major issue in 2004. But it was precipitated by the \nrequest to go back and see whether there has been any written guidance \nto FBI agents.\n  Again I expect that most or all Members will vote for Judge Chertoff. \nI will, based on what I know.\n  The disagreement I have is with the Department of Justice as to what \nwe are not allowed to see, although it is relevant to this confirmation \nprocess.\n  Senator Lieberman and I wrote a letter. I ask unanimous consent this \nbe printed in the Record, as well as the response to Senator Lieberman \nand my letter, along with a three-page email, May 10, 2004.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n         U.S. Senate, Committee on Homeland Security and \n           Governmental Affairs,\n                                 Washington, DC, February 4, 2005.\n     Hon. Robert S. Mueller III,\n     Federal Bureau of Investigation, J. Edgar Hoover Building, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Director Mueller: The Homeland Security and \n     Governmental Affairs Committee is currently considering the \n     nomination of Judge Michael Chertoff to be Secretary of the \n     Department of Homeland Security (DHS). The enclosed document \n     came to our attention during preparation for the nomination \n     hearing, and the purpose of this letter is to request an \n     unredacted copy for review.\n       The document consists of three FBI internal emails dated \n     May 10, 2004, marked by Bates Nos. 2709 to 2711. The redacted \n     version was recently released by the FBI in response to a \n     request by a private party under the Freedom of Information \n     Act. The document indicates that FBI personnel were deeply \n     concerned about interrogation techniques which were being \n     used in Guantanamo Bay by the Department of Defense and DHS \n     personnel. It further indicates that FBI personnel \n     communicated with personnel in the Department of Justice, \n     including the Criminal Division, regarding their concerns \n     about interrogation techniques in use at Guantanamo Bay. \n     Based on the content of the document, we believe many of the \n     referenced events occurred during the tenure of Judge \n     Chertoff as head of the Criminal Division, and an unredacted \n     copy of this document will allow a fuller understanding of \n     the events being discussed.\n       We ask that an unredacted version of this three-page \n     document be provided to the Office of Senate Security where \n     we and staff members with appropriate clearance can review \n     it. Please provide an unredacted copy to the Senate Security \n     Office no later than 4:00 p.m. on Friday, February 4, 2005. \n     If you will not provide a copy of this document, please \n     provide a legal justification for doing so.\n       Thank you for your attention. If your staff has any \n     questions, please have them contact Elise J. Bean (Sen. \n     Levin) or Laurie Rubenstein (Sen. Lieberman).\n           Sincerely,\n     Joseph Lieberman.\n     Carl Levin.\n                                  ____\n\n                                            Department of Justice,\n\n\n                                Office of Legislative Affairs,\n\n                                  Washigton, DC, February 7, 2005.\n     Hon. Carl Levin,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Levin: This responds to your letter to FBI \n     Director Mueller, dated February 4, 2005, which requested the \n     unredacted version of a classified three-page FBI document, \n     dated May 10, 2004, regarding the interrogation of detainees \n     at Guantanamo Bay.\n       We have carefully considered your request, but concluded \n     that the unredacted document cannot be released in response \n     to your request because it contains information covered by \n     the Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. 552a, as well as deliberative \n     process material. We note, however, that the document is \n     comprised of FBl messages that were not sent by or addressed \n     to Judge Chertoff and it contains no reference to him by name \n     or otherwise.\n       We hope that this information is helpful. We are sending an \n     identical letter to Senator Lieberman, who joined in your \n     letter to us. Please do not hesitate to contact me if you \n     would like additional assistance regarding any other matter.\n           Sincerely.\n                                             William B.

Both agreed the Bureau \n     has their way of doing business and DoD has their marching \n     orders from the Sec Def. Although the two techniques differed \n     drastically, both Generals believed they had a job to \n     accomplish. It was our mission to gather critical \n     intelligence and evidence ------ in furtherance of FBI cases. \n     In my weekly meetings with DOJ we often discussed ------ \n     techniques and how they were not effective or producing Intel \n     that was reliable. ------ (SES), ------ (SES) ------ (now \n     SES) ------ at the time) and ------ (SES Appointee) all from \n     DOJ Criminal Division attended meetings with FBI.

We (DoD 3 Star Geoff Miller, \n     FBI, CITF ------ etc) had a VTC with the Pentagon Detainee \n     Policy Committee.

I note in closing the part of this denial of the \nDepartment of Justice that is unsustainable and should be rejected \nunanimously by Congress is the statement that the material cannot be \nreleased because it contains information covered by the Privacy Act as \nwell as deliberative process material. The Privacy Act reliance is \ntotally out of the ballpark. It is so far afield from any argument the \nexecutive branch has used that we must reject that. If we do not, if we \naccept the use of the Privacy Act to deny this Congress documents that \nrelate to activities of Government employees carried out in the \nperformance of their duties, we will have struck a major blow to the \noversight responsibilities of this Congress.\n  As to the second reason given, deliberative process material, there \nare no conversations whatever that I can see that are with the \nPresident of the United States. That reference to deliberative process \nmaterial also should be unacceptable to all Members of Congress \nregardless of what side of the aisle we happen to be sitting on.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Vitter). The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. My good friend from Michigan is one of the best debaters \nin the Chamber. He is a thoughtful Member. I suspect he may at one time \nin his career have been an extraordinary trial lawyer.\n  However, we are not putting Judge Chertoff on trial. This is a \nconfirmation hearing. This debate is not about the names of certain \nemployees within the Justice Department. It is about whether we feel \nthe need to challenge the sworn testimony of a distinguished public \nservant. Judge Chertoff has already told us, under oath, that he was \nnot aware of any practices at Guantanamo that ``even approach \ntorture.''\n  So what does my good friend from Michigan want to ask these Justice \nDepartment officials? The answer is, whether they talked to Michael \nChertoff about interrogation techniques, the precise question that \nJudge Chertoff has already answered in the negative. There is no basis \nto doubt Judge Chertoff's sworn testimony before the committee. He has \nanswered all of the questions over and over again. The only reason to \nget the names of these Justice Department employees is to challenge the \nveracity of his answers. There is no basis for that. There is nothing \nin his background, in his testimony, in his answers to us that should \nlead us to question him further about this unless there is new evidence \nthat appears that suggests he was less than truthful with the \ncommittee. There is no such evidence. This issue is not related to his \nfitness to serve in this very important position.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank my good friend for what I think were flattering \nreferences, but in any event I thank her because she is an absolutely \nsuperb Member of this body and a great chairman of our committee. It \nhas been my pleasure to serve with her for a long time.\n  On this one, there are two questions which I want to repeat. I think \nthe answer to the questions has to be yes. The way I phrase the first \nquestion is this: If those members of the Criminal Division's names \nwere on that document, would it be appropriate to ask them if they had \nany conversations with their supervisors? Is that an appropriate \nquestion? The answer is, clearly, yes.\n  This does not challenge anybody's integrity. As a matter of fact, \nJudge Chertoff said in a number of places, ``I don't recall having any \ndiscussion.'' At another point he said he did have a discussion. The \nquestion is whether his recollection is different from someone else's. \nThat does not challenge his honesty or integrity. That simply says that \npeople's recollections are different, and when that is true, sometimes \npeople's recollections are refreshed.\n  It is a straightforward, legitimate question to ask people who worked \nin his division, whether they notified their supervisor of these heated \nconversations, these discussions that they participated in and \noverheard between the Department of Justice and the Department of \nDefense. If the answer to that question is yes, which I think it must \nbe, that it would be legitimate to ask those people if, when they heard \nthat debate, that heated discussion over tactics at Guantanamo, did \nthey inform their supervisors that the FBI strongly objects to the DOD \ntechniques and is not going to participate in any of those techniques, \nwould it be appropriate to ask them whether they notified their \nsupervisors if we knew their names?\n  The answer is yes, I think. If I am right, it is appropriate to ask \nthose four people that question, then it is appropriate to have the \nnames of those four people. That is as simple as I think I can make the \nargument.\n  This is not, again, a challenge to anyone's honesty or integrity. It \nis an effort to be thorough in a confirmation process about the events \nwhich have torn this country away from some of our strongest allies, \nthe activities at Guantanamo which drifted over to Iraq and to Abu \nGhraib. According to the generals who investigated this matter, these \nhorrors, these abuses started in Guantanamo Bay.\n  Members of the Criminal Division, while Judge Chertoff was head of \nthat Criminal Division, heard of the debate relative to these \nactivities and these actions. They strongly objected to those actions \non the part of the DOD. I spent 20 or 30 minutes or more earlier today \ngoing into the whole background of Guantanamo. This is not some minor \nevent that occurred somewhere in dusty history or in a history book. \nThese are recent events at Guantanamo which engendered heated \ndiscussions, debates between the FBI, on the one hand, which said we \ncannot participate in those techniques, and the Department of Defense, \non the other hand.\n\n[[Page S1326]]\n\n  Now, when the administration, the Department of Justice, denies the \nCongress an opportunity to ask legitimate questions, which we have the \nright to ask--and if my dear friend from Maine does not think we have \nthe responsibility to ask them, that is a judgment which I do not \nchallenge; if she does not feel the need to ask these questions of \nthose employees, I do not challenge her decision on that whatsoever--\nbut given the entire setting of Guantanamo, and what it led to, and the \nheated discussions that occurred there, with the FBI challenging the \nDOD, and with Judge Chertoff's division employee members being present \nduring those discussions, some of us feel a responsibility to ask those \nemployees whether they passed along the information they were privy to.\n  So this is a bigger issue. It is a much bigger issue. As I say, I am \ngoing to be voting for Judge Chertoff based on the information I have. \nBut we should not be denied this other information.\n  Again, I thank my friend from Maine. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine is recognized.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, the Senator from New Mexico wishes to \nspeak for up to 15 minutes as in morning business on an issue unrelated \nto this nomination. I ask unanimous consent that he be so recognized \nbut that the time he consumes be taken from the minority side on this \ndebate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from New Mexico is recognized.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Maine for her \ncourtesy, and my colleague from Michigan.\n\n\n            Science and Technology In The President's Budget\n\n  Mr. President, I rise as in morning business to speak about the \nbudget that has been submitted by the President, and particularly to \nspeak about the science and technology portions of the budget, the \nportions of the budget that are intended to support science and \ntechnology in this country.\n  In his recent State of the Union Message, President Bush said:\n\n       By making our economy more flexible, more innovative, and \n     more competitive, we will keep America the economic leader of \n     the world.\n\n  I agree with the President that strong economic growth is vital to \ncontinued American leadership. I also believe innovation is the key to \nthat growth. But the reality of his proposed budget to spur innovation \nfor the next year does not square with the rhetoric we heard last week.\n  I fear this budget will do serious harm to our Nation's scientific \nand technological capacity. And because it shortchanges our children \nand threatens to deprive them of the prosperous America we have \nenjoyed, the shame will be on us if we allow it to be enacted as it has \nbeen presented to us.\n  We are about to embark on an intense debate about the priorities of \nthe Nation. This debate is all about the Nation's future growth and \nprosperity, and that, in turn, is about our Nation's investment in the \nfoundations of discovery and innovation.\n  What will not be in dispute in this several month long debate is that \nscience, and the technology that flows from it, is recognized as the \nprincipal engine of our economic growth. Nor will there be any \ncontention about the fact that America's present strength, prosperity, \nand global preeminence depend upon the fundamental research we do in \nthis country. The scientific and economic record of the past 50 years \nis overwhelming proof on both of those points.\n  Regrettably, knowing full well that economic growth is the \nprerequisite for opportunity, and that scientific research is a basic \nprerequisite for growth, this budget blueprint for the next fiscal year \nfalls far short of meeting our long-term national goals. It is unsuited \nto the challenges of our time, it is built on short-term political \ncalculations and it weakens one of the pillars of our country's future \neconomic health. It is not a clearly thought out strategy to ensure the \npreeminence of the U.S. scientific enterprise.\n  The budget proposes much larger cuts in domestic discretionary \nresearch and development programs than is generally understood. The \nless than straightforward numbers of the Office of Management and \nBudget have the effect of obscuring the true impact of the cuts that \nare proposed. Moreover, once one gets past 2006, the proposed budgets \nin the outyears for domestic discretionary programs throughout the \nGovernment would be cut below the 2004 and 2005 levels, even before \ninflation is taken into account.\n  Many of these research and development programs that are being \ncurtailed or cut back have provided the cornerstone for our recent \neconomic progress and have spurred the creation of high-paying jobs and \nrecord prosperity.\n  Basic research is the primary source of the new knowledge that \nultimately drives the innovation process. The Federal Government \nsupports a majority of the Nation's basic research, and the Federal \nGovernment supports nearly 60 percent of the research and development \nperformed at U.S. universities. Equally important, federally funded \nresearch and development at universities and colleges plays a key role \nin educating the next generation of scientists and engineers and \nproviding a technically skilled workforce.\n  So scientific investments have never been more important to our \nNation's future. And never have we stood on the verge of so many \nstunning advances in technology and science. Cutting back now would be \nlike cutting back our defense budget at the height of the Cold War.\n\n  Increases are disproportionately concentrated primarily in two \nDepartments--Defense and Homeland Security--while other research and \ndevelopment funding agencies are left with very modest increases or \nwith increases for some agencies that are offset by flat funding or \ncuts in other agencies. In the name of national security, we are \nbuilding a swaying tower of insecurity with regard to our long-term \nfuture.\n  In order to make room for huge tax cuts and to address the record \nbudget deficits they have helped to create, the administration now \nproposes major cuts in the research our country depends on to maintain \nits technical leadership and ensure that Americans continue to enjoy \ngrowing prosperity and high-paying jobs.\n  The budget distinguishes between Federal R spending and Federal \nspending for ``Federal science and technology.'' The Federal science \nand technology designation, recommended by the National Academy of \nScientists, is intended to highlight ``activities central to the \ncreation of new knowledge and technologies more consistently and \naccurately than the traditional R data.''\n  It includes the full budgets for the National Institutes of Health \nand the National Science Foundation, the Defense 6.1 and 6.2 research \nprograms, the various Energy Department R programs, and a variety of \nresearch efforts at other agencies. Overall, this Federal science and \ntechnology designation encompasses nearly all of Federal basic \nresearch, more than 80 percent of Federal applied research, and about \nhalf of civilian development.\n  It does not include defense development, testing, and evaluation.\n  The overall Federal science and technology budget suffers a 3-percent \ndecrease in real buying power under the proposal we have received. \nBusinesses have always looked to the Federal Government to support the \nlion's share of basic research that has led to business successes in \nmodern aircraft and computing and in many other areas.\n  For Federal science and technology, the President's budget proposes a \nreduction of $877 million, to $60.2 billion. Among other things, it \nprovides a death sentence for the Advanced Technology Program, and it \nslashes funding for kindergarten through twelfth grade science and math \neducation.\n  President Bush's proposed 2006 budget flat-lines or cuts funding for \nkey Federal medical and health research agencies. Today's miracles of \nmodern medicine are the result of past research in physics, chemistry, \nmathematics, computer sciences, and engineering, most of which was \ncarried out in universities by faculty and student researchers and \nsupported by the National Science Foundation, the National Institutes \nof Health, the Department of Energy, and several defense agencies.\n  The National Science Foundation, in this proposed budget, is woefully \nunderfunded. Two years ago the President\n\n[[Page S1327]]\n\nsigned a bill authorizing the doubling of the budget of the National \nScience Foundation, the premier agency supporting basic research in all \nfields of science and engineering in the Nation's outstanding \nuniversities, and tasked with promoting investments in science, math, \nand engineering education. The administration's request next year for \nthe NSF is $2.91 billion or 34 percent below the fiscal year 2006 level \nthat was authorized in the bill signed by the President. Adjusted for \ninflation, the real purchasing power of NSF actually declines in next \nyear's budget. The National Science Foundation education programs \ncontinue to be devastated. They are down another 24 percent from last \nyear's level.\n  If the administration believes in closing the gap in science and math \nperformance between our students and the rest of the world, how is that \npossible when proposing major cuts in science and math education \nprograms?\n  The National Institutes of Health, the Nation's principal source of \nfunding for the treatment of cancer, AIDS, diabetes, and Alzheimer's, \nwould decline 1.4 percent in constant dollars. The number of research \nproject grants funded by the NIH in fiscal year 2006 would drop. This \nproposal, if enacted, will be the worst NIH budget since 1970.\n  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, critical in preparing \nus for potential epidemics from possibly devastating new infectious \ndiseases and biological terror, is proposed to be cut by 9 percent in \nconstant dollars, while the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality \nwould be flat funded at $319 million.\n  At the Department of Energy, the Federal science and technology \nbudget would drop by $278 million or 5 percent. The science programs in \nthe Department of Energy that support much of the Nation's premier work \nin physics and material sciences are cut 6 percent in real spending. \nWhile the President's rhetoric during the State of the Union supported \nrenewable energy sources and energy efficiency, the budget does not. \nRenewable energy research is cut 9 percent in constant dollars. Energy \nefficiency is cut 5 percent. All other energy programs--nuclear, fossil \nfuel, transmission, and distribution--are proposed for a decline of 9 \npercent.\n\n  The administration is also undercutting efforts to support a \ntechnology-driven economy by slashing the budgets for the National \nInstitute of Standards and Technology. The fiscal year 2006 request is \n24 percent less than the fiscal year 2005 appropriated level of $708 \nmillion. The request eliminates the Advanced Technology Program, \nincluding $43 million of funding for ongoing projects that companies \nare relying on and planning to complete. The Advanced Technology \nProgram is an industry-led, competitive, cost-share program that allows \nU.S. companies to develop the next generation of breakthrough \ntechnologies. It enables them to compete aggressively against foreign \nrivals.\n  According to its 2004 annual report, returns from just 41 of the 736 \nATP projects have exceeded $17 billion in economic benefits, more than \neight times the amount of money spent for all of the 736 projects. The \nNational Academy of Sciences has found ATP to be an effective program \nthat could use more funding and use it wisely.\n  Buried within the Department of Defense budget are cuts to \ninvestments in science and technology that will substantially undermine \nour warfighting capabilities 10 to 15 years from now. Defense research, \nboth basic and applied, are starved and, when inflation is factored in, \nwe will end up buying less research than we did before. The Federal \nscience and technology budget at the Department of Defense would drop \nby $905 million or 14 percent. For decades possession of superior \ntechnology has been the cornerstone of U.S. military strategy. \nMaintaining this technological edge has become even more important as \nour military faces new and formidable dangers to countering chemical, \nbiological, nuclear, and high explosive threats and attacks. This \nbudget makes a grave mistake in saying that America's greatest military \nassets are no longer our greatest research universities.\n  Overall, the Federal budget for science and technology would decline \nby over 3 percent and would decline by 4 percent in the absence of the \nrequested increase for manned spaceflight.\n  I have a chart that sums up all of these figures I have gone through \nand points out that at every agency of the Government, every department \nexcept NASA, we are seeing cuts proposed for basic research, science, \nand technology in this budget that has been presented.\n  Given the fierce competition that U.S. businesses face from China and \nIndia and other nations, even in high technology products, this is a \nparticularly dangerous time for America to be cutting back on support \nfor innovation. Many of our senior industry, military, and academic \nleaders are expressing alarm that real Federal spending in basic \nresearch has stalled. They worry whether we are starting to lose our \nedge in basic scientific research. They wonder if we are losing sight \nof the importance of long-term investments in creating the conditions \nof prosperity. Their fear is that the administration's other \npriorities, combined with the enormous deficits we face, will squeeze \nout these productivity-enhancing investments. They are concerned that \nfunding for Federal nondefense basic science and technology programs \nwill continue to stagnate or decline. And if we allow such an erosion \nof America's ability to innovate, they warn, then be prepared for the \nwrenching, turbulent social and economic change that surely will \nfollow.\n  There are many powerful arguments for expanding the basic research \nagenda in this country, even in these difficult economic times. I hope \nthe President and this Congress will step up to the task of rethinking \nand realigning our budget proposals to reflect the importance of our \ninvestments in science and technology.\n  The greatest tragedies, of course, will be the missed opportunities. \nHow many excellent research proposals will be left on the National \nScience Foundation's cutting room floor, how many fewer students with \nfewer National Institutes of Health grants will be pursuing research \ncareers, how many advances in conquering disease will be slowed, and \nhow many new lifesaving technologies will be delayed in reaching our \nwarfighters?\n  This failure of intellectual leadership could not come at a worse \ntime.\n  Now is precisely when we need enlightened national leaders who fully \nunderstand the value of basic research in science and technology. High-\ntech R is so enmeshed in our economy that it is part and parcel of \nthe jobs and growth issue.\n  The issue of outsourcing high-tech, high-wage jobs--reverse brain-\ndrain--has moved front and center to our economic worries. American \nworkers, facing rising economic insecurity, are filled with anxiety and \nunease because they realize that almost any service that can be \ndelivered in bits and bytes and does not require face-to-face \ninteraction with customers is up for grabs.\n  We are on the brink of a new industrial and commercial world order. \nThe successful competitors in the increasingly fierce global scramble \nfor supremacy will not be those who simply make products faster and \ncheaper than anyone else. The big winners will be those who develop \ntalent, techniques, and tools so advanced that there is no competition.\n  That means the United States must secure unquestioned superiority in \nnanotechnology, biotechnology and information technology. And that \nmeans upgrading and protecting the investments that have given us our \npresent national stature and our unsurpassed standard of living.\n  Coming to grips with this issue is important if we wish to remain at \nthe epicenter for the ongoing revolution in research and innovation \nthat is driving 21st century economies all over the world. The reality \nis that in this 21st century global economy, China, India, and other \nnations which were once considered economic backwaters have discovered \nhow to build strong economies around sophisticated technology. We \nshould be concerned about our competitive position relative to our \nglobal rivals' investments in research and development. While we are \nlimiting our budget increases in the civilian arena, other countries' \ninvestments are moving up very substantially.\n  In the European Union, the United Kingdom is planning on boosting its \nR spending to 2.5 percent of its gross domestic product. The French \nare aiming at investing 3 percent of their budget in research and \ndevelopment.\n\n[[Page S1328]]\n\nSpain announced an ambitious plan to lift R funding by 25 percent \nbetween now and 2008, while excluding military spending from the \nequation.\n  On the Pacific Rim, China is doubling the proportion of GDP it spent \nin the last decade on R, India is raising its funding of science \nagencies by 27 percent, and Japan is increasing its investments in life \nsciences research by 32 percent, while South Korea is upgrading \nresearch spending by 8.5 percent. They are resolved to reach \ntechnological parity with the West.\n  What do we do about these international challenges? We have \nabsolutely no choice but to emphasize what we do best in this coming \nrivalry. Our most important strength has always been innovation. Our \ncan-do spirit of commercializing technological innovation has always \nheen America's core competence. We do it far better than anyone else. \nBut faced with these other potential innovators on the global scene, we \nmust start doing it even better.\n  As our Federal R commitments shrink, so too does the pool of \ntechnically trained talent, forcing industry and academia to look \nabroad for skilled knowledge workers. Education and training of \nscientists and engineers are tied to Federally sponsored research \nperformed in the Nation's laboratories and universities.\n  The best course is to increase Government funding for basic research \nand to spend more on graduate education in science and engineering, not \nto spend less in these important areas, which the President has \nproposed. I hope those involved with the Appropriations Subcommittee \nwill focus on this in their deliberations this spring.\n  America has always been a Nation built on hope--hope that we can \nbuild a prosperous, healthy world for ourselves and for our children. \nBut it is clear that these long-standing American aspirations depend \ncritically on our far-sighted investment in science and technology \nwhich lies at the center of this hope. Leadership in science and \nengineering and the world's best education and training system are \nessential for ensuring Americans well-paying jobs and essential for our \nsecurity.\n  When J. Robert Oppenheimer, the renowned physicist, warned President \nFranklin D. Roosevelt in 1943, about Germany's plan to build an atomic \nweapon, FDR replied in a secret letter that ``whatever the enemy may be \nplanning, American science will be equal to the challenge.'' Never has \na prediction been so prescient.\n  We know with every fiber of our being that the dominance of our \nfundamental research enterprise is a core American strength that must \nbe preserved--and we must not let our position erode and compromise our \nfuture economic and national security.\n  By sustaining our investments in basic research, we can ensure that \nAmerica remains at the forefront of scientific capability, thereby \nenhancing our ability to shape and improve our Nation's and the world's \nfuture.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I am proud to rise today to express my \nsupport for the nomination of the Honorable Michael Chertoff to be \nSecretary of the Department of Homeland Security. I do so as the \nranking Democrat on the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs \nCommittee, the committee that had the responsibility, opportunity, and \nhonor to bring forward the legislation that created the Department of \nHomeland Security just a few years ago in the aftermath of the attack \nagainst America of September 11, 2001.\n  So any nomination of an individual to head this Department is taken \nwith real seriousness by our Committee in general and by this Senator \nin particular.\n  Judge Chertoff has an impressive record of public service and an \nimpressive record in the private sector as well. He has served his \ncountry as a prosecutor, an assistant attorney general, and a Federal \njudge. He comes to this moment in his career and to this responsibility \nwith a reputation as a strong, intellectually demanding leader who \nworks very hard. Those are characteristics that will serve him well if \nand when he is confirmed for this job for which he has been nominated.\n  Judge Chertoff's dedication to public service surely is illustrated \nby his willingness to give up a lifetime appointment to the Federal \nbench to take on the challenge--and it is a real challenge--of heading \nthis critically important Department. I respect him for that. I \nappreciate his patriotism, and his dedication to our country and to the \nsecurity of the American people.\n  The Secretary of Homeland Security is clearly one of the most \ndifficult jobs in our Federal Government today, not only for the \nawesome responsibility it carries to safeguard the American people from \nterrorist attack--or in some cases natural catastrophe--but also \nbecause of the serious work that still needs to be done to make the \nDepartment, still young, the success it needs to be. Since it was \ncreated two years ago, the Department has become the leader among \nGovernment agencies protecting the American people at home, which, of \ncourse, is exactly why Congress created it.\n\n  Secretary Tom Ridge launched this process and admirably led the \nDepartment through the initial steps of merging 22 separate agencies \nand programs, each with a different culture, a different structure, and \ndifferent priorities. This was a tough, sometimes painful, job. After \nall, to the best of our knowledge, it is the largest governmental \nreorganization in half a century. We knew this transformation would be \na monumental task and that it would take time for the Department to \nemerge as a coordinated, focused agency, even more so after--\nunfortunately--it became clear that the Administration was not \nproviding the resources to this Department that it needed.\n  Understandably, the Department and its 180,000 employees--it is a \nlarge department--still face significant challenges in many areas, \neverything from its strategic vision to its day-to-day operations. But \nI will stop here on the Senate floor, as I have done in our committee, \nand thank Tom Ridge for the excellent job he did in getting this \nDepartment up and running. It still has a way to go. It is probably no \nlonger in its infancy, it is in its childhood now, but it needs \nsomebody to bring it to full maturity. It needs support from the \nAdministration and Congress to enable the new Secretary to do exactly \nthat.\n  The lack of a focused, long-term homeland security strategy is one of \nthe greatest omissions thus far with this Department. No organization, \nespecially one as large and complicated as this one, can succeed \nwithout a clear strategy and priorities. Given the importance of the \nDepartment's mission, the new Secretary will immediately need to \ndevelop an updated strategy that clarifies not only the Department's \npriority, roles, and responsibilities but those of other key partners \nas well. Consultation will have to occur with others in the \nadministration--for instance, at the Department of Defense, the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services, and the Department of Justice \nto ensure an integrated and overarching vision, a kind of to-do list of \nhow our government will tackle every dimension of defending our \nhomeland and the American people.\n  One of the changes recommended by experts that our Committee has \nheard is the creation of an Undersecretary for Policy and Planning to \nperform the kind of long-range thinking within the Department of \nHomeland Security that has been needed. I am pleased that this \nDepartment is underway and it should ease the new Secretary's burden \nconsiderably. I know the chairman of the Committee--who is in the \nchamber, I am glad to note--is focused on the possibility that we may, \nthrough our Committee's work, assist the Department in doing just that.\n  If confirmed, Judge Chertoff and his deputies will need to have some \nbasic tools that the Secretary is now lacking--here I am talking as \nfundamentally as adequate professional staff. The Secretary and the \nDeputy Secretary of the Department must have sufficient numbers of \nassistants to adequately manage 180,000 employees.\n  We heard testimony before our Homeland Security and Governmental\n\n[[Page S1329]]\n\nAffairs Committee that the Deputy Secretary's Office currently has five \nstaff members. Our distinguished colleague from Virginia, Senator \nWarner, a member of the committee, former Deputy Secretary of the Navy, \nrecalled that when he was Secretary of the Navy he had a staff of well \nover 100 and therefore wondered how the Deputy Secretary of Homeland \nSecurity could manage with just five.\n  DHS employees must also be adequately trained to perform new and more \ncomplex tasks than they performed before the challenge rose on \n9/11, and we must help them do that.\n  Looking beyond these internal problems, the Department also has to \nstep up its efforts to eliminate persistent vulnerabilities in a \nvariety of areas of activity, both public and private. The security of \nour borders and ports, for instance--they are still vulnerable. There \nare vulnerabilities within our rail and transit systems and at the \nNation's core: energy, telecommunications, water, transportation, and \nfinancial networks. Those systems, those pieces of our national life, \nare not protected as well as they should be and need to be, three years \nafter September 11, 2001.\n  The Coast Guard, a proud, historic agency, a service of our \nGovernment, is in dire need of having its fleet modernized. At the \ncurrent rate of funding it is going to take 20 years to complete the \nupgrades that the Coast Guard believes it needs to take on the \nadditional responsibilities beyond its traditional ones which it has so \nlong performed so well, of protecting our coastlines from terrorism.\n  The administration must do more and we must do more with it to \nprepare the Nation, also, for a bioterrorist attack. This is one of \nthose areas of vulnerability that keeps a lot of us up at night.\n  We must also do a better job of enlisting the private sector as a \nnecessary partner in our shared security, since the private sector \ncontrols 85 percent of our critical infrastructure. When we think about \nsecurity from terrorism, we tend to think about public infrastructure. \nBut 85 percent of our critical infrastructure is controlled by the \nprivate sector. We need to engage them more.\n  We know, for example, that an attack on a chemical facility could put \nthe lives of hundreds of thousands of our fellow citizens at risk. One \nestimate that I saw recently--and this is the number most often cited \nbut it is not the total number--noted that there are 123 chemical \nplants in our country. If there were an accident or an attack, the \nresulting problem could endanger the lives of a million Americans.\n  Then you have to go one step beyond that. There are 700 chemical \nfacilities, smaller than the first 123, that if there were an attack on \nthem by terrorists, it would injure 100,000 people living around them.\n  Then there are 3,000 additional chemical facilities, smaller still, \nbut nonetheless an attack on them would endanger 10,000 people living \naround them. Those are jarring numbers, and all the more so because we \nknow from published information that al-Qaida has examined and sought \ninformation about chemical facilities here in this country. Yet \naccording to testimony given to our committee by Richard Falkenrath, \nwho served as deputy homeland security adviser to the President, now at \na think tank here in Washington, he said: ``We have done essentially \nnothing''--and that is the word he used--``to reduce the inherent \ninsecurity of our chemical facilities.''\n  We have the most advanced and powerful and effective military in the \nworld, in the history of the world. One of the reasons is that we have \nthe most extraordinary trained, patriotic, brave soldiers, military \nservice men and women. But another reason is that we have invested \nhundreds and hundreds of billions of dollars--trillions of dollars--\nover the years, to give us the most powerful military in the history of \nthe world to protect our security around the world.\n  On September 11, 2001, we found that notwithstanding all of that \nprotection, we could be attacked right here at home. So we must invest \nin our homeland security if it, too, is to be the best in the world, \nparticularly since those fanatics, as someone else has said, hate us \nAmericans more than they love their own lives. They hate us more than \nthey love their own lives and so are prepared to give their lives as we \nsaw on September 11 to take some of ours.\n\n  They are so focused on America that we need the best homeland defense \nin the world. Last year, I believe--in a budget that was in some ways \nshocking--the administration proposed cuts for first responders. Now \nthose cuts are increased. That is, funding for first responders, \nbelieve it or not, is further reduced in the budget submitted by the \nPresident last week for fiscal year 2006. That is wrong. We are all \naware of the funding realities and the deficit situation of our \nGovernment. We also know that it is impossible to protect every \npotential terrorist target. But our first responders in particular, who \nrisk their lives so the rest of us may be safe--in many ways the first \npreventers of terrorist attacks--they deserve the training and \nequipment they need to do their jobs for us.\n  They have to have the basic capability to talk to one another. We saw \nthis most painfully in the World Trade Center, that the inability for \nlaw enforcers, first responders, to talk to each other led--according \nto independent experts--to the loss of too many lives of first \nresponders who were on the scene.\n  That was not the first time that happened. We really need to do all \nwe can from the Federal Government to enable our first responders--\npolice, firefighters, emergency medical personnel--to have \ninteroperable communications equipment. What does that mean? In a \ncrisis, quite simply, to be able to talk to one another. We have to \nexplore technological breakthroughs that can enable us to make that \npossible at the lowest possible cost.\n  This is a daunting list of responsibilities, of work on homeland \ndefense yet undone, that will face the new Secretary of Homeland \nSecurity. But it is real, and I do believe, to help Judge Chertoff \nachieve these aims quickly, all of us need to regain that sense of \nanger, hurt, resolve, urgency that propelled us forward as one in the \naftermath of September 11.\n  I am confident Judge Chertoff, too, feels that sense of urgency and \nwill act upon it. That is most certainly the conclusion I reached when \nhe appeared before the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs \nCommittee to answer quite an array of questions from committee members, \nincluding several on his role in the prosecution of the war on terror \nand the advice he provided on anti-torture laws when he was head of the \nJustice Department's Criminal Division. Judge Chertoff assured us that \nhe was mindful of the historic tension between two values, two \nattributes that define us as a nation, which is to say life and \nliberty, and the need to protect ourselves against those who would deny \nus either one.\n  I thought his exact words were eloquent and right to the point and \nvery reassuring, so I quote Judge Chertoff. He said:\n\n       I believe that we cannot live in liberty without security, \n     but we would not want to live in security without liberty.\n\n  Striking the right balance will be an ongoing challenge.\n  I am pleased that those who know him best say Judge Chertoff is more \nthan up to the task. His background in the law prepares him to balance \nsecurity and liberty. His record, not just as a law enforcer but as a \nlaw clerk for former Supreme Court Justice Brennan, certainly prepared \nhim to protect our liberty while enhancing our security.\n  When our colleague and friend from New Jersey, Senator Corzine, \nintroduced Judge Chertoff, his friend, before our committee at the \nhearing we held on this nomination, he referred to Judge Chertoff's \nwork with the New Jersey State Senate investigating and legislating \nagainst racial profiling. Senator Corzine described that experience as, \n``a test of balancing the protection of the American public or \nprotecting the New Jersey public and our civil liberties.''\n  No one, he said, could have balanced those competing interests ``more \nintelligently'' than Judge Chertoff had.\n  I also welcomed Judge Chertoff's expression of his belief on the \nOffice of Legal Counsel's definition of torture from the August 2002 \nmemo written by Assistant Attorney General Bybee--as discussed during \nthe nomination proceedings for Attorney General Gonzales--Judge \nChertoff expressed before our committee that he felt the\n\n[[Page S1330]]\n\nBybee definition of torture was too narrow.\n  Of course, I and others are troubled by how the Justice Department \nhandled the detention of numbers of Muslim men and Arabic men who were \nrounded up in the aftermath of September 11. It has been extensively \ndocumented and validated and backed up by an Inspector General report \nthat many of the detainees were held under the flimsiest of pretexts, \nwere incarcerated for a long time without having their cases \ninvestigated, and often denied access to lawyers and family members.\n  According to the Inspector General's report, some of them were \nactually physically abused by guards in the prisons where they were \nheld. Judge Chertoff, in his testimony before our committee, said he \nfelt that mistakes were clearly made in the detention and treatment of \nthose detainees.\n  I wish the Department of Justice had acknowledged the same failures \nwhen the Department of Justice Inspector General released its report in \n2003. I hope and have confidence that the Department of Justice has \nlearned the same lesson that Judge Chertoff told us before our \ncommittee that he has learned from that experience.\n  Judge Chertoff said when he appeared before us that while the PATRIOT \nAct has engendered great public opposition, the evidence does not back \nup the fear that it would be used to deprive large numbers of people in \nthis country of their fundamental liberties. On the other hand, the \napprehension and taking into prison of more than 700 Arabic and Muslim \nmen in the aftermath of September 11 and the way in which they were not \njust taken into custody but the denial in a very un-American way of \nbasic due process guaranteed by the Constitution proves something to \nus--that some of those so concerned about the PATRIOT Act also ought to \nlook at the absence of due process protection in our immigration laws, \nwhich have been used to deprive people of their constitutional rights. \nWe ought to act to close those gaps in those immigration laws.\n  There are also lessons that I know others can take and will take from \nthe episode, as Judge Chertoff did in his previous position at the \nDepartment of Justice.\n  As Secretary of Homeland Security, Judge Chertoff will be running a \ndepartment with many different agencies with many different missions. \nIncluded within the Department are the agencies that deal with our \nNation's immigrant community. That relationship must not--and according \nto law should not--be based primarily on prosecution and law \nenforcement. We are, after all, a nation of immigrants. Those of us who \nourselves, our parents, or our grandparents, or our great-grandparents \nwere lucky enough to come to this country ought not to forget that \nhistory, and ought to treat immigrants today with the same respect our \nfamilies expected as well. I have every confidence Judge Chertoff \nunderstands that and will conduct this Department accordingly.\n\n  I am voting for Judge Chertoff, as I have said, because I believe he \nis the right man for this job. But I do not want that decision to \nobscure the fact that I share some of the concerns--more specifically, \nobjections--that Senator Levin has expressed this afternoon and \npreviously to the Justice Department's and the FBI's unwillingness to \nshare with members of the Committee an uncensored version of the \ndocument Senator Levin referred to earlier, which says that certain \nemployees of the Criminal Division of the Justice Department were at a \nmeeting with representatives of the FBI in which the FBI members who \nhad been at Guantanamo expressed concern about the way in which \ndetainees were being treated there.\n  This is in part the ongoing dialog between Administrations and \nCongress over most of our history about the sharing of information. But \nI must say it is the latest chapter or episode in a rather intense \nseries of conversations between this particular Administration and \nCongress because of its reluctance to share information with Congress \nthat I believe, as representatives of the people, we have a right to \nexpect. This has particularly been the case with our Homeland Security \nand Governmental Affairs Committee--during the time I was chairman of \nthe committee as well as ranking member--when we conducted oversight, \nor were considering nominations. Senators duly elected by their States \ncertainly have a right to see the material they believe necessary to \ncarry out their constitutional duty regarding advice and consent, \nunless there is a Presidential invocation of executive privilege, or \nsome other clear statutory prohibition on sharing the particular \ninformation which Members of the Senate feel they need to carry out \ntheir responsibilities. In this case, the President does not claim \nprivilege.\n  The statute which the Justice Department cites for being unwilling to \nshare the names currently redacted from this document of FBI personnel \nwho were at this meeting pertaining to what has been happening at \nGuantanamo--the Privacy Act--in my opinion simply doesn't apply. The \nPrivacy Act, I have always believed, was there to protect the privacy \nof individual Americans, not the names of Federal employees whom \nSenators believe they needed to know to carry out our constitutional \nduties of advice and consent.\n  Indeed, as the Senator from Michigan has pointed out, the Justice \nDepartment's position that the Privacy Act requires the administration \nto withhold the names of high-level Government officials from a \ndocument and from simply mentioning the officials attending an official \nmeeting, would be to allow for a stunning expansion of the Privacy Act \nthat could thwart even the most basic of congressional oversight \nactivities.\n  In other words, in any number of areas where Congress might want to \nexercise our responsibility to oversee our Government, perhaps to \nprevent fraud or the waste of billions of dollars of taxpayer money, to \nsay that you cannot get the name of an individual at a meeting because \nof the Privacy Act would be truly unbelievable, and unacceptable, \nunsustainable expansion of the Privacy Act. Therefore, I associate \nmyself with that part of Senator Levin's expression of concerns. I hope \nevery Member of the Senate will pay some attention to what Senator \nLevin has said regarding this because it undercuts the authority of the \nMembers of the Senate to act. The Privacy Act was not meant to do that.\n\n  Having said that, why do I nonetheless go ahead and strongly support \nJudge Chertoff? I believe Judge Chertoff in his testimony before the \ncommittee responded to concerns that something in that redacted \ndocument might disqualify him for this position. In the first place, he \nwas not at the meeting. Second, in response to questions filed with him \nafter the hearing and general statements he made at the hearing, he \nspecifically said under oath to the best of his recollection he was \nnever informed while head of the Criminal Division of the Justice \nDepartment that there was any mistreatment of detainees at Guantanamo. \nI accept that statement given by a Federal judge under oath.\n  I truly resent the withholding of the names of the people who were at \nthat meeting from the Senate. I conclude, nonetheless, that this \ndocument does not at all go against Judge Chertoff's otherwise \nextraordinary qualifications to lead this Department.\n  These are, obviously, not ordinary times. We are in a new chapter of \nour history. In some sense every American feels insecure, more insecure \nthan before September 11. We have done a lot of things to raise \npeople's sense of security, including the capture of so many members of \nal-Qaida, our victories militarily in Iraq and Afghanistan, and the \nsetting up of the Department of Homeland Security. This is, \nnonetheless, a department whose leadership demands an extraordinary \ncommitment. Judge Chertoff has made that commitment, and he will bring \nto this position an admirable record. He is a very strong choice to \nlead the Department of Homeland Security's continuing transformation \ninto a strong, cohesive, well-operating force to secure the safety of \nthe American people; therefore, I urge all of my colleagues to support \nthis nomination.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I thank my good friend and the ranking \nDemocratic member on the committee for his statement. He has applied \nhis usual good judgment in coming to the conclusion that Judge Chertoff \ndeserves\n\n[[Page S1331]]\n\nhis support and in urging our colleagues to vote for him when the vote \nfinally occurs tomorrow.\n  The Senator from Alabama is seeking to speak on the nomination. I \nyield 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama is recognized.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I thank the chairwoman of the committee, \nSenator Collins, for the leadership she and the Senator from \nConnecticut have given to a number of issues and the fact that they \nboth have agreed Judge Chertoff should be confirmed as Secretary of \nHomeland Security. Judge Chertoff was reported out of committee without \nopposition.\n  The Homeland Security Secretary has three primary missions: One, to \nprevent terrorist attacks within the United States--to protect our \nhomeland, to reduce America's vulnerability to terrorism, and to \nminimize the damage from potential attacks and natural disasters in our \ncountry. It takes a special individual to lead this Department. In my \nview, Judge Chertoff represents one of those special individuals.\n  Judge Chertoff knows Rudy Guiliani, former mayor of New York and \nhimself a former high official in the Department of Justice and U.S. \nattorney. I remember, when Rudy was leaving as U.S. attorney, someone \nasked him about his successor and who it should be and what he should \nbe. He simply said this: Well, I hope they appoint somebody who can \ncontribute to the discussion every now and then.\n  Judge Chertoff can contribute to the discussion about homeland \nsecurity issues. He has an extraordinary record, and he is one of the \nmost able lawyers in America and one of the most committed lawyers in \nthis country to public service. He graduated--I know the Presiding \nOfficer is a Wake Forest man; it is a great law school--but he went to \nHarvard, graduated from undergraduate school magna cum laude in 1975, \nand also from Harvard Law School in 1978 the same--magna cum laude. Top \nof his class at Harvard Law School.\n  He then clerked for a circuit judge on the Second Circuit Court of \nAppeals. It is always quite an honor for a lawyer graduating from any \nlaw school to be accepted to clerk for one of those judges. Not only \nthat, he was one of the very few--a rare few--chosen to clerk for a \nJustice on the U.S. Supreme Court. He clerked for Justice William \nBrennan on the U.S. Supreme Court. He comes at this with, certainly, \nproven academic and intellectual abilities to handle the job.\n  Judge Chertoff has had great experience in areas that provide him an \nopportunity to learn many of the things necessary to be a successful \nSecretary of Homeland Security. He started out as an assistant U.S. \nattorney in the Southern District of New York, which they like to think \nis ``the'' Southern District of New York. When I was U.S. attorney in \nthe Southern District of Alabama, I always thought we were ``the'' \nSouthern District. They certainly always had the reputation of hiring \nsome of the best lawyers in America. It was very competitive to be \nselected as an assistant U.S. attorney in the Southern District of New \nYork. He did a great job there. He then moved to New Jersey to become \nfirst assistant U.S. attorney. That is a big deal.\n  By the way, when he was in the Southern District of New York, he \nprosecuted mafia cases, organized crime cases, racketeering cases and \nmajor fraud cases. He was clearly involved in some of the most \nsignificant cases in that most significant district of Federal law \nenforcement in the country.\n  He goes to New Jersey as the first assistant U.S. attorney. As such, \nhe was the right arm of the U.S. attorney. In fact, he took on a great \ndeal of the responsibilities in that very large office. There is just \none office for the entire State of New Jersey. He did a good job there.\n  Soon he was appointed U.S. attorney--the boss--of that office by \nPresident Bush. He served with distinction. At one time, he prosecuted \nthe very famous Mafia Commission case which charged the bosses of all \nfive New York La Cosa Nostra families with operating a pattern of \nracketeering such as extortion, loan sharking, and murder, one of the \nbiggest cases ever brought against mafia. He prosecuted one of the more \nimportant cases, criminal cases, that has been brought in the United \nStates, I suspect in the century; I would say it was at least in the \ntop 50 most important cases in the century. The case was prosecuted \nunder his leadership there. He did a lot of other cases of that kind.\n  He served as counsel to the committee on Whitewater. He handled \nhimself well there. As such, he has learned the responsibilities of \npublic service: to handle yourself carefully and conduct yourself with \nhigh standards. He won a good report, from everyone who watched the \nconduct of his activities on that committee, as being a fair and able \nattorney--in general, and I think he won great acclaim for that.\n\n  One of the key characteristics of a Secretary of Homeland Security is \nthat they understand State and local law enforcement and governmental \nagencies, that they can work with them, that they can get them together \nand talk with them and communicate with them. To do that, when you take \nthe office, you need to understand those agencies, what they are about, \nwhat their responsibilities are, what their daily duties are, and how \nthey operate.\n  Judge Chertoff, first as an assistant U.S. attorney and then as a \nU.S. attorney, had as his duty to work with State and local agents. \nEach U.S. attorney is required to form and moderate and lead a law \nenforcement coordinating committee. He did that in the State of New \nJersey. I suspect he knows the sheriffs and the chief law officers \nthroughout that State, and probably in New York, too, on a first-name \nbasis. You have to do that in that position. He understands their \ndifficulties, and he understands the challenges and the responsibility \nof the Federal Government to work with and to utilize the capacities of \nState and local law enforcement.\n  Indeed, most of the law enforcement officials in America, by far, are \nin State and local government, probably 90 percent. We can never be \neffective against terrorists, people who come here illegally to harm \nour country, without being able to work with and utilize and support \nState and local law enforcement. He understands that very clearly.\n  I believe that will be one of his best characteristics that will help \nhim achieve the job of making this entity known as Homeland Security \nwork.\n  I must say, when this new Homeland Security Department was formed, as \none who worked with many of the agencies that were brought into it \nunder one new Secretary, I knew that it was going to be a challenge, a \nvery real, difficult challenge. Agencies were brought in that \nDepartment, such as Immigration, Customs, and others, to all work \ntogether with other agencies, such as the Coast Guard, to try to fight \nterrorism and defend our homeland. That is a difficult task. Agencies \ndo not work well together. I remember the difficulties it took just to \nget our Federal agencies to work together when I was a U.S. attorney. I \nknow Mr. Chertoff saw the same thing in his office.\n  Now he will have the responsibility of melding these agencies \ntogether and have them work effectively and efficiently for a common \ngoal. It will not be easy. Most Americans probably would be surprised \nto know they communicate with one another like foreign nations. They \nsit down and sign memoranda of understanding or a treaty or something \non how they are going to handle this or that problem. I exaggerate a \nlittle bit in the sense that at the grassroots level, most of the \nagents, the various agencies, work together for the common good, but \nthere clearly is a bureaucracy problem of all Federal agencies, and it \nis a real challenge to reform this new Homeland Security Department. \nMr. Chertoff, having first been an assistant U.S. attorney and then \nhaving been a U.S. attorney and serving as the Chief of the Criminal \nDivision in the U.S. Department of Justice, understands that. He has \nlived with it. Nobody who has held that position could be naive about \nthe difficulties of these issues. He, I am sure, had to work through \nthem in the past, and he will hit the ground with no misconceptions \nabout the challenge, no misconceptions about the good qualities of \nFederal law enforcement and other officers throughout our country, but \nwith no misunderstanding about how difficult it is to make these \nbureaucracies merge. So I believe that is\n\n[[Page S1332]]\n\ngoing to be one of his great challenges, but he has the experience and \nability to make it to work.\n  I, frankly, am one who is of the opinion that if a person has been in \nthe field actually prosecuting cases, actually working at night with \nIRS agents and Customs agents and Immigration agents and FBI agents and \nDEA agents, and all of these law enforcement officers, dealing with \ntheir supervisors and bosses, they know something that somebody who has \nnever done that cannot understand. They have a comprehension of the \ndifficulty of our Government to work efficiently and productively. They \nalso, if they are good at it, have proven to be successful at it. That \nis how you judge success in leadership, such as being a criminal \ndivision chief or a U.S. attorney--how well you can get these agencies \nto work together.\n\n  So I am excited about that. I have known him for a long period of \ntime. I can say, without hesitation, that when he was selected as U.S. \nattorney in New Jersey, and I was a U.S. attorney myself at that time, \neveryone knew that was a promotion on merit. His reputation for \nexcellence and skill and legal ability had been known throughout the \nDepartment of Justice for some time. His appointment there was received \nthroughout the entire Department of Justice with great pride and hope \nfor success. And indeed, he had a highly successful record.\n  So I just want to say from my personal experience with him, having \nserved with him, having known him for many years, and having known his \nreputation among those who worked closely with him, that he has all the \ngifts and graces that are required to be a great Secretary of Homeland \nSecurity.\n  I know they say: Well, he should turn over these documents. First, \nlet me say this: They are not his documents. These are documents of the \nU.S. Department of Justice, memorandums they have. There is a \nlegitimate concern about Members of this Congress using every \nconfirmation we have to see what they can drag out so they can dig \nthrough memoranda and documents that represent private conversations \nwithin the executive branch.\n  What would we think in the Senate if the President got mad at us and \nsaid: I want to see every document that was sent between you and your \nlegislative assistant on all these issues. We would not like that. We \nwould say: Well, we ought to have some right to talk to our staff and \ncommunicate with one another and have private conversations and think \nthrough these issues. If we tell our staff that everything they say is \ngoing to be made public the next day or they cannot put something in a \nmemorandum because it may be on the front page of a newspaper the next \nday, maybe that would diminish the natural quality of our \ncommunication. In fact, it might inhibit good communication.\n  Back on February 7 of this year, the Department of Justice responded \nto this request that was sent to Mr. Mueller of the FBI. It requested \n``the unredacted version of a classified three-page FBI document, dated \nMay 10, 2004, regarding the interrogation of detainees at Guantanamo \nBay.'' The Justice Department's response was this. It was not Judge \nChertoff's response. He has been on the Federal bench as a Federal \njudge, with a lifetime appointment, which he is willing to give up, \nfrom the appellate court, a highly prestigious thing in itself, to \nserve his country to be involved in protecting this country.\n  Indeed, when asked why he was willing to do that, he said: When asked \nto serve in a way to protect my country, I could not say no.\n  They said this:\n\n       We have carefully considered your request, but concluded \n     that the unredacted document cannot be released in response \n     to your request because it contains information covered by \n     the Privacy Act, 5 United States Code 552a, as well as \n     deliberative process material.\n\n  That is not an insignificant matter. Deliberative process material \ninvolves efforts by the executive branch to study an issue, to \ndeliberate on it and formulate a position.\n  The decision an agency makes is public, but everything they do in \ndeliberating that should not be produced willy-nilly just because \nsomebody in Congress wants to go on a fishing expedition.\n  It goes on to say:\n\n       We note, however, that the document is comprised of FBI \n     messages that were not sent by or addressed to Judge Chertoff \n     and it contains no reference to him by name or otherwise.\n\n  I don't think this is anything unusual and dramatic and unexpected \nthat this document should be rejected. I believe the Department of \nJustice has considered it carefully and rendered an opinion that is \nfair and just. I support them on it. I know there are certain times \ndocuments need to be produced, but there are reasons why documents \nshould not be produced willy-nilly. The Department has considered this \ncarefully and rendered this opinion.\n  I admire Judge Michael Chertoff. He is a first-rate lawyer. He is a \nman of incredible experience. As chief of the Criminal Division of the \nDepartment of Justice, he had an opportunity to see firsthand the \ndifficulties and challenges of the war against terrorism. He performed \nadmirably in that position, as he has in every other position he has \nheld in our Government. He can make so much more money in private \npractice. He could take a quiet position and stay as a lifetime-\nappointed Federal circuit judge. But he turned that down to serve our \ncountry. This Nation will benefit from his service. I am so glad the \ncommittee voted to refer him out positively. I am confident he will be \nconfirmed.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burr). The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Alabama for his \nexcellent statement. I appreciate the perspective he brings. Given his \nown experience as a U.S. Attorney, he has a special appreciation for \nthat part of Judge Chertoff's career, and his endorsement will carry a \nlot of weight with our colleagues.\n  How much time is remaining for the debate today?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine has 76 minutes \nremaining. The minority is out of time.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I inquire of the Presiding Officer, the \n76 minutes is for today's debate, as opposed to tomorrow's; correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I know of no further requests for time on \nour side this evening so I am prepared to yield back, and I do, the 76 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Time is yielded back.\n  Ms. COLLINS. I thank the Chair.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I would like to thank my colleagues for \nsupporting S. 5, the Class Action Fairness Act, which we passed last \nweek and which is set to be considered in the House this week. This \nlittle bill that Senator Kohl and I first introduced back in the 105th \nCongress is finally at the finish line. Little did I know it was going \nto take five Congresses to get it done. But we had to do it. The abuses \nin the class action system are real, and this is a good first step at \nfixing some of them.\n  Although the Class Action Fairness Act was always a bipartisan bill, \nwe had to negotiate numerous compromises to garner enough support to \ndefeat a filibuster here in the Senate. In the end, this bill is a good \nexample of what we can accomplish when we work together in a bipartisan \nfashion. The final passage vote of 72 to 36 is proof positive of that.\n  So I am pleased that we are on the verge of getting class action \nreform to the President's desk. There are many\n\n[[Page S1333]]\n\ncolleagues that I would like to thank in the Senate for their \nleadership and support--Majority Leader Frist, Republican Whip \nMcConnell, Chairman Specter, Senator Hatch, Senator Sessions, Senator \nKohl, and Senator Carper. I also want to thank their staff as well for \na job well done--Allen Hicks, Eric Ueland and Sharon Soderstrom with \nthe majority leader; John Abegg and Kyle Simmons with Senator \nMcConnell; Harold Kim, Michael O'Neill and David Brog with Chairman \nSpecter; Kevin O'Scanlin with Senator Hatch; William Smith and Cindy \nHayden with Senator Sessions; and John Kilvington with Senator Carper. \nI would like to acknowledge in particular Jeff Miller with Senator \nKohl, who worked closely with my staff on this bill over the years. \nFinally, I would like to thank Rita Lari Jochum, my Judiciary Committee \nchief counsel, who has worked on this bill since 1998, and whose legal \nskills and determination were instrumental in getting this bill passed \nin the Senate.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I regret that I was unable to vote on \nfinal passage of S. 5. I was traveling with President Bush in \nPennsylvania.\n  I wish to express my support of the Senate passage of S. 5, the Class \nAction Fairness Act. As a cosponsor of this legislation, I am pleased \nthat the Senate passed a bill that will help prevent the serious \nproblem of class action abuse.\n  The Class Action Fairness Act is a modest bipartisan bill that \naddresses some of the most serious abuses by allowing more large \ninterstate class actions to be heard in Federal court, and by \nimplementing a ``Consumer Class Action Bill of Rights'' to protect \nconsumers.\n  S. 5 will expand Federal jurisdiction over large, interstate class \nactions. Since the founding of this country, Federal diversity \njurisdiction has existed over cases between citizens of different \nStates involving large amounts of money. However, because of the way \nthat some have interpreted the law, class action cases involving \nparties from many states and millions of dollars largely have been \nexcluded from this rule and are confined to State court. The Class \nAction Fairness Act closes this loophole by creating Federal \njurisdiction over large multi-State class actions.\n  I ask that the Record reflect that, had I been here, I would have \nvoted in favor of S. 5, the Class Action Fairness Act. In passing this \nlegislation in the Senate, we have taken a constructive step in \naddressing the abuses in the civil justice system while maintaining the \nrights of consumers.\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the Class Action \nFairness Act of 2005. As both a lawyer and a citizen, I am a strong \nbeliever in class actions as a way for ordinary people who have been \nwronged by a corporation to band together and seek justice. Some of our \ngreat advances in civil rights and consumer protections have come from \nthese actions.\n  But there is overwhelming evidence that there are abuses in the class \naction system that should be addressed. When multimillion dollar \nsettlements are handed down and all the victims get are coupons for a \nfree product, justice is not being served. And when cases are tried in \ncounties only because it's known that those judges will award big \npayoffs, you get quick settlements without ever finding out who's right \nand who's wrong.\n  Every American deserves their day in court. This bill, while not \nperfect, gives people that day while still providing the reasonable \nreforms necessary to safeguard against the most blatant abuses of the \nsystem. I also hope that the Federal judiciary takes seriously their \nexpanded role in class action litigation, and upholds their \nresponsibility to fairly certify class actions so that they may protect \nour civil and consumer rights. Senator Specter has pledged to work on \nthese issues and address these serious concerns in the future, and I \nlook forward to joining him so we can improve this law.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/02/14/senate-section/article/S1333-1", "month": "02", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1333-S1336]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           RULES OF PROCEDURE\n\n  Mr. LUGAR.

Meetings of subcommittees shall not be \n     scheduled to conflict with meetings of the full Committee.\n       The proceedings of each subcommittee shall be governed by \n     the rules of the full Committee, subject to such \n     authorizations or limitations as the Committee may from time \n     to time prescribe.\n\n\n                            rule 3--meetings\n\n       (a) Regular Meeting Day.--The regular meeting day of the \n     Committee on Foreign Relations for the transaction of \n     Committee business shall be on Tuesday of each week, unless \n     otherwise directed by the Chairman.\n       (b) Additional Meetings.--Additional meetings and hearings \n     of the Committee may be called by the Chairman as he may deem \n     necessary. If at least three members of the Committee desire \n     that a special meeting of the Committee be called by the \n     Chairman, those members may file in the offices of the \n     Committee their written request to the Chairman for that \n     special meeting. Immediately upon filing of the request, the \n     Chief Clerk of the Committee shall notify the Chairman of the \n     filing of the request.

Issues of procedure which may arise from time \n     to time shall be resolved by decision of the Chairman, in \n     consultation with the Ranking Member. The Chairman, in \n     consultation with the Ranking Member, may also propose \n     special procedures to govern the consideration of particular \n     matters by the Committee.\n       (f) Closed Sessions.--Each meeting of the Committee on \n     Foreign Relations, or any subcommittee thereof, including \n     meetings to conduct hearings, shall be open to the public, \n     except that a meeting or series of meetings by the Committee \n     or a subcommittee on the same subject for a period of no more \n     than fourteen calendar days may be closed to the public on a \n     motion made and seconded to go into closed session to discuss \n     only whether the matters enumerated in paragraphs (1) through \n     (6) would require the meeting to be closed followed \n     immediately by a record vote in open session by a majority of \n     the members of the Committee or subcommittee when it is \n     determined that the matters to be discussed or the testimony \n     to be taken at such meeting or meetings--\n       (1) will disclose matters necessary to be kept secret in \n     the interests of national defense or the confidential conduct \n     of the foreign relations of the United States;\n       (2) will relate solely to matters of Committee staff \n     personnel or internal staff management or procedure;\n       (3) will tend to charge an individual with crime or \n     misconduct; to disgrace or injure the professional standing \n     of an individual, or otherwise to expose an individual to \n     public contempt or obloquy, or will represent a clearly \n     unwarranted invasion of the privacy of an individual;\n       (4) will disclose the identity of any informer or law \n     enforcement agent or will disclose any information relating \n     to the investigation or prosecution of a criminal offense \n     that is required to be kept secret in the interests of \n     effective law enforcement;\n       (5) will disclose information relating to the trade secrets \n     or financial or commercial information pertaining \n     specifically to a given person if--\n       (A) an Act of Congress requires the information to be kept \n     confidential by Government officers and employees; or\n       (B) the information has been obtained by the Government on \n     a confidential basis, other than through an application by \n     such person for a specific Government financial or other \n     benefit, and is required to be kept secret in order to \n     prevent undue injury to the competitive position of such \n     person, or\n       (6) may divulge matters required to be kept confidential \n     under other provisions of law or Government regulations.\n       A closed meeting may be opened by a majority vote of the \n     Committee.\n       (g) Staff Attendance.--A member of the Committee may have \n     one member of his or her personal staff, for whom that member \n     assumes personal responsibility, accompany and be seated \n     nearby at Committee meetings.\n       Each member of the Committee may designate members of his \n     or her personal staff, who hold a Top Secret security \n     clearance, for the purpose of their eligibility to attend \n     closed sessions of the Committee, subject to the same \n     conditions set forth for Committee staff under Rules 12, 13, \n     and 14.\n       In addition, the Majority Leader and the Minority Leader of \n     the Senate, if they are not otherwise members of the \n     Committee, may designate one member of their staff with a Top \n     Secret security clearance to attend closed sessions of the \n     Committee, subject to the same conditions set forth for \n     Committee staff under Rules 12, 13, and 14. Staff of other \n     Senators who are not members of the Committee may not attend \n     closed sessions of the Committee.\n       Attendance of Committee staff at meetings shall be limited \n     to those designated by the Staff Director or the Minority \n     Staff Director.\n       The Committee, by majority vote, or the Chairman, with the \n     concurrence of the Ranking Member, may limit staff attendance \n     at specified meetings.\n\n\n                            rule 4--quorums\n\n       (a) Testimony.--For the purpose of taking sworn or unsworn \n     testimony at any duly scheduled meeting a quorum of the \n     Committee and each subcommittee thereof shall consist of one \n     member.\n       (b) Business.--A quorum for the transaction of Committee or \n     subcommittee business, other than for reporting a measure or \n     recommendation to the Senate or the taking of testimony, \n     shall consist of one-third of the members of the Committee or \n     subcommittee, including at least one member from each party.\n       (c) Reporting.--A majority of the membership of the \n     Committee shall constitute a quorum for reporting any measure \n     or recommendation to the Senate. No measure or recommendation \n     shall be ordered reported from the Committee unless a \n     majority of the Committee members are physically present. The \n     vote of the Committee to report a measure or matter shall \n     require the concurrence of a majority of those members who \n     are physically present at the time the vote is taken.\n\n\n                            rule 5--proxies\n\n       Proxies must be in writing with the signature of the absent \n     member. Subject to the requirements of Rule 4 for the \n     physical presence of a quorum to report a matter, proxy \n     voting shall be allowed on all measures and matters before \n     the Committee. However, proxies shall not be voted on a \n     measure or matter except when the absent member has been \n     informed of the matter on which he is being recorded and has \n     affirmatively requested that he or she be so recorded.\n\n\n                           rule 6--witnesses\n\n       (a) General.--The Committee on Foreign Relations will \n     consider requests to testify on any matter or measure pending \n     before the Committee.\n       (b) Presentation.--If the Chairman so determines, the oral \n     presentation of witnesses shall be limited to 10 minutes. \n     However, written statements of reasonable length may be \n     submitted by witnesses and other interested persons who are \n     unable to testify in person.\n       (c) Filing of Statements.--A witness appearing before the \n     Committee, or any subcommittee thereof, shall file a written \n     statement of his proposed testimony at least 48 hours prior \n     to his appearance, unless this requirement is waived by the \n     Chairman and the Ranking Member following their determination \n     that there is good cause for failure to file such a \n     statement.\n       (d) Expenses.--Only the Chairman may authorize expenditures \n     of funds for the expenses of witnesses appearing before the \n     Committee or its subcommittees.\n       (e) Requests.--Any witness called for a hearing may submit \n     a written request to the Chairman no later than 24 hours in \n     advance for his testimony to be in closed or open session, or \n     for any other unusual procedure. The Chairman shall determine \n     whether to grant any such request and shall notify the \n     Committee members of the request and of his decision.\n\n\n                           rule 7--subpoenas\n\n       (a) Authorization.--The Chairman or any other member of the \n     Committee, when authorized by a majority vote of the \n     Committee at a meeting or by proxies, shall have authority to \n     subpoena the attendance of witnesses or the production of \n     memoranda, documents, records, or any other materials. At the \n     request of any Member of the Committee, the Committee shall \n     authorize the issuance of a subpoena only at a meeting of the \n     Committee. When the Committee authorizes a subpoena, it may \n     be issued upon the signature of the Chairman or any other \n     member designated by the Committee.\n       (b) Return.--A subpoena, or a request to an agency, for \n     documents may be issued whose return shall occur at a time \n     and place other than that of a scheduled Committee meeting. A \n     return on such a subpoena or request\n\n[[Page S1335]]\n\n     which is incomplete or accompanied by an objection \n     constitutes good cause for a hearing on shortened notice. \n     Upon such a return, the Chairman or any other member \n     designated by him may convene a hearing by giving 2 hours \n     notice by telephone to all other members. One member shall \n     constitute a quorum for such a hearing. The sole purpose of \n     such a hearing shall be to elucidate further information \n     about the return and to rule on the objection.\n       (c) Depositions.--At the direction of the Committee, staff \n     is authorized to take depositions from witnesses.\n\n\n                            rule 8--reports\n\n       (a) Filing.--When the Committee has ordered a measure or \n     recommendation reported, the report thereon shall be filed in \n     the Senate at the earliest practicable time.\n       (b) Supplemental, Minority and Additional Views.--A member \n     of the Committee who gives notice of his intentions to file \n     supplemental, minority, or additional views at the time of \n     final Committee approval of a measure or matter, shall be \n     entitled to not less than 3 calendar days in which to file \n     such views, in writing, with the Chief Clerk of the \n     Committee, with the 3 days to begin at 11:00 p.m. on the same \n     day that the Committee has ordered a measure or matter \n     reported. Such views shall then be included in the Committee \n     report and printed in the same volume, as a part thereof, and \n     their inclusion shall be noted on the cover of the report. In \n     the absence of timely notice, the Committee report may be \n     filed and printed immediately without such views.\n       (c) Rollcall Votes.--The results of all rollcall votes \n     taken in any meeting of the Committee on any measure, or \n     amendment thereto, shall be announced in the Committee \n     report. The announcement shall include a tabulation of the \n     votes cast in favor and votes cast in opposition to each such \n     measure and amendment by each member of the Committee.\n\n\n                            rule 9--treaties\n\n       (a) The Committee is the only Committee of the Senate with \n     jurisdiction to review and report to the Senate on treaties \n     submitted by the President for Senate advice and consent. \n     Because the House of Representatives has no role in the \n     approval of treaties, the Committee is therefore the only \n     congressional committee with responsibility for treaties.\n       (b) Once submitted by the President for advice and consent, \n     each treaty is referred to the Committee and remains on its \n     calendar from Congress to Congress until the Committee takes \n     action to report it to the Senate or recommend its return to \n     the President, or until the Committee is discharged of the \n     treaty by the Senate.\n       (c) In accordance with Senate Rule XXX.2, treaties which \n     have been reported to the Senate but not acted on before the \n     end of a Congress ``shall be resumed at the commencement of \n     the next Congress as if no proceedings had previously been \n     had thereon.''\n       (d) Insofar as possible, the Committee should conduct a \n     public hearing on each treaty as soon as possible after its \n     submission by the President. Except in extraordinary \n     circumstances, treaties reported to the Senate shall be \n     accompanied by a written report.\n\n\n                          rule 10--nominations\n\n       (a) Waiting Requirement.--Unless otherwise directed by the \n     Chairman and the Ranking Member, the Committee on Foreign \n     Relations shall not consider any nomination until 6 calendar \n     days after it has been formally submitted to the Senate.\n       (b) Public Consideration.--Nominees for any post who are \n     invited to appear before the Committee shall be heard in \n     public session, unless a majority of the Committee decrees \n     otherwise.\n       (c) Required Data.--No nomination shall be reported to the \n     Senate unless (1) the nominee has been accorded a security \n     clearance on the basis of a thorough investigation by \n     executive branch agencies; (2) in appropriate cases, the \n     nominee has filed a financial disclosure report and a \n     confidential statement with the Committee; (3) the Committee \n     has been assured that the nominee does not have any interests \n     which could conflict with the interests of the government in \n     the exercise of the nominee's proposed responsibilities; (4) \n     for persons nominated to be chief of mission, ambassador-at-\n     large, or minister, the Committee has received a complete \n     list of any contributions made by the nominee or members of \n     his immediate family to any Federal election campaign during \n     the year of his or her nomination and for the 4 preceding \n     years; and (5) for persons nominated to be chiefs of mission, \n     a report on the demonstrated competence of that nominee to \n     perform the duties of the position to which he or she has \n     been nominated.\n\n\n                            rule 11--travel\n\n       (a) Foreign Travel.--No member of the Committee on Foreign \n     Relations or its staff shall travel abroad on Committee \n     business unless specifically authorized by the Chairman, who \n     is required by law to approve vouchers and report \n     expenditures of foreign currencies, and the Ranking Member. \n     Requests for authorization of such travel shall state the \n     purpose and, when completed, a full substantive and financial \n     report shall be filed with the Committee within 30 days. This \n     report shall be furnished to all members of the Committee and \n     shall not be otherwise disseminated without the express \n     authorization of the Committee. Except in extraordinary \n     circumstances, staff travel shall not be approved unless the \n     reporting requirements have been fulfilled for all prior \n     trips. Except for travel that is strictly personal, travel \n     funded by non-U.S. Government sources is subject to the same \n     approval and substantive reporting requirements as U.S. \n     Government-funded travel. In addition, members and staff are \n     reminded of Senate Rule XXXV.4 requiring a determination by \n     the Senate Ethics Committee in the case of foreign-sponsored \n     travel.\n       Any proposed travel by Committee staff for a subcommittee \n     purpose must be approved by the subcommittee chairman and \n     ranking member prior to submission of the request to the \n     Chairman and Ranking Member of the full Committee.\n       When the Chairman and the Ranking Member approve the \n     foreign travel of a member of the staff of the committee not \n     accompanying a member of the Committee, all members of the \n     Committee shall be advised, prior to the commencement of such \n     travel of its extent, nature, and purpose.\n       (b) Domestic Travel.--All official travel in the United \n     States by the Committee staff shall be approved in advance by \n     the Staff Director, or in the case of minority staff, by the \n     Minority Staff Director.\n       (c) Personal Staff.--As a general rule, no more than one \n     member of the personal staff of a member of the Committee may \n     travel with that member with the approval of the Chairman and \n     the Ranking Member of the Committee. During such travel, the \n     personal staff member shall be considered to be an employee \n     of the Committee.\n       (d) Personal Representatives of the Member (PRM).--For the \n     purposes of Rule 11 as regards staff foreign travel, the \n     officially-designated personal representative of the member \n     (PRM) shall be deemed to have the same rights, duties, and \n     responsibilities as members of the staff of the Committee on \n     Foreign Relations. Furthermore, for the purposes of this \n     section, each Member of the Committee may designate one \n     personal staff member as the ``Personal Representative of the \n     Member.''\n\n\n                          rule 12--transcripts\n\n       (a) General.--The Committee on Foreign Relations shall keep \n     verbatim transcripts of all Committee and subcommittee \n     meetings and such transcripts shall remain in the custody of \n     the Committee, unless a majority of the Committee decides \n     otherwise. Transcripts of public hearings by the Committee \n     shall be published unless the Chairman, with the concurrence \n     of the Ranking Member, determines otherwise.\n       (b) Classified or Restricted Transcripts.--\n         (1) The Chief Clerk of the Committee shall have \n     responsibility for the maintenance and security of classified \n     or restricted transcripts.\n         (2) A record shall be maintained of each use of \n     classified or restricted transcripts.\n         (3) Classified or restricted transcripts shall be kept in \n     locked combination safes in the Committee offices except when \n     in active use by authorized persons for a period not to \n     exceed 2 weeks. Extensions of this period may be granted as \n     necessary by the Chief Clerk. They must never be left \n     unattended and shall be returned to the Chief Clerk promptly \n     when no longer needed.\n       (4) Except as provided in paragraph 7 below, transcripts \n     classified secret or higher may not leave the Committee \n     offices except for the purpose of declassification.\n       (5) Classified transcripts other than those classified \n     secret or higher may leave the Committee offices in the \n     possession of authorized persons with the approval of the \n     Chairman. Delivery and return shall be made only by \n     authorized persons. Such transcripts may not leave \n     Washington, DC, unless adequate assurances for their security \n     are made to the Chairman.\n       (6) Extreme care shall be exercised to avoid taking notes \n     or quotes from classified transcripts. Their contents may not \n     be divulged to any unauthorized person.\n       (7) Subject to any additional restrictions imposed by the \n     Chairman with the concurrence of the Ranking Member, only the \n     following persons are authorized to have access to classified \n     or restricted transcripts.\n       (i) Members and staff of the Committee in the Committee \n     rooms;\n       (ii) Designated personal representatives of members of the \n     Committee, and of the Majority and Minority Leaders, with \n     appropriate security clearances, in the Committee's Capitol \n     office;\n       (iii) Senators not members of the Committee, by permission \n     of the Chairman in the Committee rooms; and\n       (iv) Members of the executive departments involved in the \n     meeting, in the Committee's Capitol office, or, with the \n     permission of the Chairman, in the offices of the officials \n     who took part in the meeting, but in either case, only for a \n     specified and limited period of time, and only after reliable \n     assurances against further reproduction or dissemination have \n     been given.\n       (8) Any restrictions imposed upon access to a meeting of \n     the Committee shall also apply to the transcript of such \n     meeting, except by special permission of the Chairman and \n     notice to the other members of the Committee. Each transcript \n     of a closed session of the Committee shall include on its \n     cover a description of the restrictions imposed upon access, \n     as well as any applicable restrictions upon photocopying, \n     note-taking or other dissemination.\n       (9) In addition to restrictions resulting from the \n     inclusion of any classified information in the transcript of \n     a Committee meeting, members and staff shall not discuss with\n\n[[Page S1336]]\n\n     anyone the proceedings of the Committee in closed session or \n     reveal information conveyed or discussed in such a session \n     unless that person would have been permitted to attend the \n     session itself, or unless such communication is specifically \n     authorized by the Chairman, the Ranking Member, or in the \n     case of staff, by the Staff Director or Minority Staff \n     Director. A record shall be kept of all such authorizations.\n       (c) Declassification.--\n       (1) All restricted transcripts and classified Committee \n     reports shall be declassified on a date twelve years after \n     their origination unless the Committee by majority vote \n     decides against such declassification, and provided that the \n     executive departments involved and all former Committee \n     members who participated directly in the sessions or reports \n     concerned have been consulted in advance and given a \n     reasonable opportunity to raise objections to such \n     declassification.\n       (2) Any transcript or classified Committee report, or any \n     portion thereof, may be declassified fewer than twelve years \n     after their origination if:\n       (i) the Chairman originates such action or receives a \n     written request for such action, and notifies the other \n     members of the Committee;\n       (ii) the Chairman, Ranking Member, and each member or \n     former member who participated directly in such meeting or \n     report give their approval, except that the Committee by \n     majority vote may overrule any objections thereby raised to \n     early declassification; and\n       (iii) the executive departments and all former Committee \n     members are consulted in advance and have a reasonable \n     opportunity to object to early declassification.\n\n\n                      rule 13--classified material\n\n       (a) All classified material received or originated by the \n     Committee shall be logged in at the Committee's offices in \n     the Dirksen Senate Office Building, and except for material \n     classified as ``Top Secret'' shall be filed in the Dirksen \n     Senate Building offices for Committee use and safekeeping.\n       (b) Each such piece of classified material received or \n     originated shall be card indexed and serially numbered, and \n     where requiring onward distribution shall be distributed by \n     means of an attached indexed form approved by the Chairman. \n     If such material is to be distributed outside the Committee \n     offices, it shall, in addition to the attached form, be \n     accompanied also by an approved signature sheet to show \n     onward receipt.\n       (c) Distribution of classified material among offices shall \n     be by Committee members or authorized staff only. All \n     classified material sent to members' offices, and that \n     distributed within the working offices of the Committee, \n     shall be returned to the offices designated by the Chief \n     Clerk. No classified material is to be removed from the \n     offices of the members or of the Committee without permission \n     of the Chairman. Such classified material will be afforded \n     safe handling and safe storage at all times.\n       (d) Material classified ``Top Secret,'' after being indexed \n     and numbered shall be sent to the Committee's Capitol office \n     for use by the members and authorized staff in that office \n     only or in such other secure Committee offices as may be \n     authorized by the Chairman or Staff Director.\n       (e) In general, members and staff undertake to confine \n     their access to classified information on the basis of a \n     ``need to know'' such information related to their Committee \n     responsibilities.\n       (f) The Staff Director is authorized to make such \n     administrative regulations as may be necessary to carry out \n     the provisions of these regulations.\n\n\n                             rule 14--staff\n\n       (a) Responsibilities.--\n       (1) The staff works for the Committee as a whole, under the \n     general supervision of the Chairman of the Committee, and the \n     immediate direction of the Staff Director; provided, however, \n     that such part of the staff as is designated Minority Staff, \n     shall be under the general supervision of the Ranking Member \n     and under the immediate direction of the Minority Staff \n     Director.\n       (2) Any member of the Committee should feel free to call \n     upon the staff at any time for assistance in connection with \n     Committee business. Members of the Senate not members of the \n     Committee who call upon the staff for assistance from time to \n     time should be given assistance subject to the overriding \n     responsibility of the staff to the Committee.\n       (3) The staff's primary responsibility is with respect to \n     bills, resolutions, treaties, and nominations.\n       In addition to carrying out assignments from the Committee \n     and its individual members, the staff has a responsibility to \n     originate suggestions for Committee or subcommittee \n     consideration. The staff also has a responsibility to make \n     suggestions to individual members regarding matters of \n     special interest to such members.\n       (4) It is part of the staff's duty to keep itself as well \n     informed as possible in regard to developments affecting \n     foreign relations and in regard to the administration of \n     foreign programs of the United States. Significant trends or \n     developments which might otherwise escape notice should be \n     called to the attention of the Committee, or of individual \n     Senators with particular interests.\n       (5) The staff shall pay due regard to the constitutional \n     separation of powers between the Senate and the executive \n     branch. It therefore has a responsibility to help the \n     Committee bring to bear an independent, objective judgment of \n     proposals by the executive branch and when appropriate to \n     originate sound proposals of its own. At the same time, the \n     staff shall avoid impinging upon the day-to-day conduct of \n     foreign affairs.\n       (6) In those instances when Committee action requires the \n     expression of minority views, the staff shall assist the \n     minority as fully as the majority to the end that all points \n     of view may be fully considered by members of the Committee \n     and of the Senate. The staff shall bear in mind that under \n     our constitutional system it is the responsibility of the \n     elected Members of the Senate to determine legislative issues \n     in the light of as full and fair a presentation of the facts \n     as the staff may be able to obtain.\n       (b) Restrictions.--\n       (1) The staff shall regard its relationship to the \n     Committee as a privileged one, in the nature of the \n     relationship of a lawyer to a client. In order to protect \n     this relationship and the mutual confidence which must \n     prevail if the Committee-staff relationship is to be a \n     satisfactory and fruitful one, the following criteria shall \n     apply:\n       (i) members of the staff shall not be identified with any \n     special interest group in the field of foreign relations or \n     allow their names to be used by any such group;\n       (ii) members of the staff shall not accept public speaking \n     engagements or write for publication in the field of foreign \n     relations without specific advance permission from the Staff \n     Director, or, in the case of minority staff, from the \n     Minority Staff Director. In the case of the Staff Director \n     and the Minority Staff Director, such advance permission \n     shall be obtained from the Chairman or the Ranking Member, as \n     appropriate. In any event, such public statements should \n     avoid the expression of personal views and should not contain \n     predictions of future, or interpretations of past, Committee \n     action; and\n       (iii) staff shall not discuss their private conversations \n     with members of the Committee without specific advance \n     permission from the Senator or Senators concerned.\n       (2) The staff shall not discuss with anyone the proceedings \n     of the Committee in closed session or reveal information \n     conveyed or discussed in such a session unless that person \n     would have been permitted to attend the session itself, or \n     unless such communication is specifically authorized by the \n     Staff Director or Minority Staff Director. Unauthorized \n     disclosure of information from a closed session or of \n     classified information shall be cause for immediate dismissal \n     and may, in the case of some kinds of information, be grounds \n     for criminal prosecution.\n\n\n                 rule 15--status and amendment of rules\n\n       (a) Status.--In addition to the foregoing, the Committee on \n     Foreign Relations is governed by the Standing Rules of the \n     Senate which shall take precedence in the event of a clear \n     inconsistency. In addition, the jurisdiction and \n     responsibilities of the Committee with respect to certain \n     matters, as well as the timing and procedure for their \n     consideration in Committee, may be governed by statute.\n       (b) Amendment.--These Rules may be modified, amended, or \n     repealed by a majority of the Committee, provided that a \n     notice in writing of the proposed change has been given to \n     each member at least 48 hours prior to the meeting at which \n     action thereon is to be taken. However, Rules of the \n     Committee which are based upon Senate Rules may not be \n     superseded by Committee vote alone.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/02/14/senate-section/article/S1336-1", "month": "02", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1336-S1337]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            RULES OF PROCEDURE--COMMITTEE ON INDIAN AFFAIRS\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, Senate Standing Rule XXVI requires each \ncommittee to adopt rules to govern the procedures of the committee and \nto publish those rules in the Congressional Record not later than March \n1 of the first year of each Congress. On January 26, 2005, the \nCommittee on Indian Affairs held a business meeting during which the \nmembers of the committee unanimously adopted rules to govern the \nprocedures of the committee. Consistent with standing rule XXVI, today \nI ask unanimous consent to print in the Record the rules of the Senate \nCommittee on Indian Affairs.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                RULES OF THE COMMITTEE ON INDIAN AFFAIRS\n\n       Rule 1.

Public notice shall be given of the date, place \n     and subject matter of any hearing to be held by the Committee \n     at least one week in advance of such hearing unless the \n     Chairman of the Committee determines that the hearing is \n     noncontroversial or that special circumstances require \n     expedited procedures and a majority of the Committee involved \n     concurs. In no case shall a hearing be conducted with less \n     than 24 hours notice.\n       (b). Each witness who is to appear before the Committee \n     shall file with the Committee, at least 72 hours in advance \n     of the hearing, an original, printed version of his or her \n     written testimony.

The Chairman and Vice Chairman or the ranking Majority \n     and Minority Members present at the hearing may each appoint \n     one Committee staff member to question each witness. Such \n     staff member may question the witness only after all Members \n     present have completed their questioning of the witness or at \n     such time as the Chairman and Vice Chairman or the Ranking \n     Majority and Minority Members present may agree.\n\n\n                        BUSINESS MEETING AGENDA\n\n       Rule 5(a).

Nothing in this rule \n     shall be construed to limit the authority of the Chairman of \n     the Committee to include legislative measures or subject on \n     the Committee agenda in the absence of such request.\n       (b). Notice of, and the agenda for, any business meeting of \n     the Committee shall be provided to each Member and made \n     available to the public at least two days prior to such \n     meeting, and no new items may be added after the agenda is \n     published except by the approval of a majority of the Members \n     of the Committee.

A measure may be ordered reported from the Committee \n     unless an objection is made by a Member, in which case a \n     recorded vote of the Members shall be required.\n       (c). One Member shall constitute a quorum for the purpose \n     of conducting a hearing or taking testimony on any measure \n     before the Committee.\n\n\n                                 VOTING\n\n       Rule 7(a). A Recorded vote of the Members shall be taken \n     upon the request of any Member.\n       (b).

Witnesses in Committee hearings may be required to \n     give testimony under oath whenever the Chairman or Vice \n     Chairman of the Committee deems it to be necessary. At any \n     hearing to confirm a Presidential nomination, the testimony \n     of the nominee, and at the request of any Member, any other \n     witness, shall be under oath.\n       Every nominee shall submit a financial statement, on forms \n     to be perfected by the Committee, which shall be sworn to by \n     the nominee as to its completeness and accuracy. All such \n     statements shall be made public by the Committee unless the \n     Committee, in executive session, determines that special \n     circumstances require a full or partial exception to this \n     rule.

Mr. President, I am proud to join the Senator from \nVermont today introduce the Artist-Museum Partnership Act. He and I \nhave introduced this legislation in the past, and we hope that our \ncolleagues will see this bill for what it is: a reasonable solution to \nan unintentional inequity in our tax code.\n  This legislation would allow living artist to deduct the fair-market \nvalue of their art work when they contribute their work to museums or \nother public institutions. As the tax code is currently written, art \ncollectors are able to deduct the fair market value of any piece of art \nthey donate to a museum. However, if the artist who created that same \npiece of work were to donate it, he or she would only be able to deduct \nthe material cost of the work, which may be nothing more than a canvas, \na tube of paint, and a wooden frame. Thus, there exists a disincentive \nfor artists to donate their work to museums. The solution is simple: \ntreat collectors and artists the same way. This bill would do just \nthat.\n  Certainly, this bill would benefit artists, but more importantly, the \nbeneficiaries would be the museums that would receive the art work and \nthe general public who would be able to view it in a timely manner. \nThis change in the tax code would increase the number of original \npieces donated to public institutions, giving scholars greater access \nto an artist's work during the lifetime of that artist, as well as \nprovide for an increase in the public display of such work.\n  I would like to thank Senator Leahy for his work on this bill. I urge \nmy colleagues to support this common-sense legislation. The fiscal \nimpact of the Artist-Museum Partnership Act on the federal budget would \nbe minimal, but the benefit to our nation's cultural and artistic \nheritage cannot be overstated. This minor correction to the tax code is \nlong overdue, and the Senate should act on this legislation to remedy \nthe problem.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/02/14/senate-section/article/S1337-1", "month": "02", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1337-S1338]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  RULES OF PROCEDURE--BUDGET COMMITTEE\n\n  Mr. GREGG.

Each standing committee, including any subcommittee of \n     any such committee, is authorized to hold such hearings, to \n     sit and act at such times and places during the sessions, \n     recesses, and adjourned periods of the Senate, to require by \n     subpoena or otherwise the attendance of such witnesses and \n     the production of such correspondence, books, papers, and \n     documents, to take such testimony and to make such \n     expenditures out of the contingent fund of the Senate as may \n     be authorized by resolutions of the Senate. Each such \n     committee may make investigations into any matter within its \n     jurisdiction, may report such hearings as may be had by it, \n     and may employ stenographic assistance at a cost not \n     exceeding the amount prescribed by the Committee on Rules and \n     Administration.

The majority leader or his designee shall \n     announce to the Senate whenever consent has been given under \n     this subparagraph and shall state the time and place of such \n     meeting. The right to make such announcement of consent shall \n     have the same priority as the filing of a cloture motion.\n       (b) Each meeting of a committee, or any subcommittee \n     thereof, including meetings to conduct hearings, shall be \n     open to the public, except that a meeting or series of \n     meetings by a committee or a subcommittee thereof on the same \n     subject for a period of no more than fourteen calendar days \n     may be closed to the public on a motion made and seconded to \n     go into closed session to discuss only whether the matters \n     enumerated in clauses (1) through (6) would require the \n     meeting to be closed, followed immediately by a record vote \n     in open session by a majority of the members of the committee \n     or subcommittee when it is determined that the matters to be \n     discussed or the testimony to be taken at such meeting or \n     meetings--\n       (1) will disclose matters necessary to be kept secret in \n     the interests of national defense or the confidential conduct \n     of the foreign relations of the United States;\n       (2) will relate solely to matters of committee staff \n     personnel or internal staff management or procedure;\n       (3) will tend to charge an individual with crime or \n     misconduct, to disgrace or injure the professional standing \n     of an individual, or otherwise to expose an individual to \n     public contempt or obloquy or will represent a clearly \n     unwarranted invasion of the privacy of an individual;\n       (4) will disclose the identity of any informer or law \n     enforcement agent or will disclose any information relating \n     to the investigation or prosecution of a criminal offense \n     that is required to be kept secret in the interests of \n     effective law enforcement;\n       (5) will disclose information relating to the trade secrets \n     of financial or commercial information pertaining \n     specifically to a given person if--\n       (A) an Act of Congress requires the information to be kept \n     confidential by Government officers and employees; or\n       (B) the information has been obtained by the Government on \n     a confidential basis, other than through an application by \n     such person for a specific Government financial or other \n     benefit, and is required to be kept secret in order to \n     prevent undue injury to the competitive position of such \n     person; or\n       (6) may divulge matters required to be kept confidential \n     under other provisions of law or Government regulations.\n       (c) Whenever any hearing conducted by any such committee or \n     subcommittee is open to the public, that hearing may be \n     broadcast by radio or television, or both, under such rules \n     as the committee or subcommittee may adopt.\n       (d) Whenever disorder arises during a committee meeting \n     that is open to the public, or any demonstration of approval \n     or disapproval is indulged in by any person in attendance of \n     any such meeting, it shall be the duty of the Chair to \n     enforce order on his own initiative and without any point of \n     order being made by a Senator. When the Chair finds it \n     necessary to maintain order, he shall have the power to clear \n     the room, and the committee may act in closed session for so \n     long as there is doubt of the assurance of order.\n       (e) Each committee shall prepare and keep a complete \n     transcript or electronic recording adequate to fully record \n     the proceeding of each meeting or conference whether or not \n     such meeting or any part thereof is closed under this \n     paragraph, unless a majority of its members vote to forgo \n     such a record.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n\n  Guidelines of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions With Respect to Hearings, Markup Sessions, and Related Matters\n\n\n                                hearings\n\n       Section 133A(a) of the Legislative Reorganization Act \n     requires each committee of the Senate to publicly announce \n     the date, place, and subject matter of any hearing at least \n     one week prior to the commencement of such hearing.\n       The spirit of this requirement is to assure adequate notice \n     to the public and other Members of the Senate as to the time \n     and subject matter of proposed hearings. In the spirit of \n     section 133A(a) and in order to assure that members of the \n     committee are themselves fully informed and involved in the \n     development of hearings:\n       1. Public notice of the date, place, and subject matter of \n     each committee or subcommittee hearing should be inserted in \n     the Congressional Record seven days prior to the commencement \n     of such hearing.\n       2.

The committee and its subcommittee should, to the \n     maximum feasible extent, enforce the provisions of rule 9 of \n     the committee rules as it relates to the submission of \n     written statements of witnesses twenty-four hours in advance \n     of a hearing. When statements are received in advance of a \n     hearing, the committee or subcommittee (as appropriate) \n     should distribute copies of such statements to each of its \n     members.\n\n\n         executive sessions for the purpose of marking up bills\n\n       In order to expedite the process of marking up bills and to \n     assist each member of the committee so that there may be full \n     and fair consideration of each bill which the committee or a \n     subcommittee is marking up the following procedures should be \n     followed:\n       1. Seven days prior to the proposed data for an executive \n     session for the purpose of marking up bills the committee or \n     subcommittee (as appropriate) should provide written notice \n     to each of its members as to the time,\n\n[[Page S1341]]\n\n     place, and specific subject matter of such session, including \n     an agenda listing each bill or other matters to be considered \n     and including:\n       (a) two copies of each bill, joint resolution, or other \n     legislative matter (or committee print thereof) to be \n     considered at such executive session; and\n       (b) two copies of a summary of the provisions of each bill, \n     joint resolution, or other legislative matter to be \n     considered at such executive session; and\n       2.

Mr. President, I rise to honor the life of Frederick \nDouglass as we celebrate his 187th birthday this month. Frederick \nDouglass was an American who devoted his life to enacting permanent and \npositive change for all Americans by advocating the abolition of \nslavery and equal rights for women.\n  Born into slavery in 1818 and abandoned by his mother, Frederick \nDouglass rose above a debilitating situation to become one of America's \ngreatest abolitionists and orators. He escaped slavery when he was 20 \nyears old by disguising himself as a sailor. Mr. Douglass traveled \nnorth and settled in New Bedford, MA where he discovered the profound \nimpact his oratory and literary talents had on others.\n  Always believing in himself and taking advantage of every opportunity \nhe could, Frederick Douglass set an example for all Americans by \nworking toward a greater purpose and racial equality. He became a \nrespected advisor to President Lincoln, he traveled extensively in \nEurope to speak about his experience in America, and he inspired those \nhe encountered to fight for better lives for African Americans and \nwomen. We are grateful for Frederick Douglass' life and work.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/02/14/senate-section/article/S1341-2", "month": "02", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1341]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              PITTSBURGH STEELERS AND PHILADELPHIA EAGLES\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, football is a staple in our \ncommunities--bringing families and friends together and helping to \nbuild connections and affiliations. Fantasy football has taken the game \none step further and individuals can now draft their own team and \ncompete weekly for the championship. Fans live and die with their \nteam--they sport their colors, sing their chants, and collect team \nmemorabilia. Personally, I have a Pittsburgh Steelers' ``Terrible \nTowel'' behind my desk. Most significantly, football gives us a chance \nto be a part of something bigger than ourselves.\n  To that end, I was proud to be a Pennsylvanian this football season \nand to join with others to cheer on the Pittsburgh Steelers and \nPhiladelphia Eagles. Both teams had an outstanding season and did not \nlet their fans down.\n  The Pittsburgh Steelers, my hometown team, had an incredible season. \nThis was a historic year for the Black and Gold having secured the most \nwins in Steelers history, the most wins by a rookie quarterback, and \nthe largest home attendance for a Steelers season. They also made an \nappearance in the AFC championship game.\n  The Eagles had quite an impressive year as well, capturing the NFC \nChampionship and playing in the Super Bowl.\n  A day before the big game, Eagles head coach Andy Reid shared his \nfeelings on being a part of the Super Bowl: ``This is what it is all \nabout. You want your football team to have an opportunity to play in \nthe Super Bowl. You're here and you're ready to go. I think every head \ncoach has that goal. We're lucky enough for it to be a reality.''\n  The Super Bowl is the pinnacle of every football season, and it is \nimpressive that the Eagles made it that far. As I watched the game, it \nwas remarkable to hear the chants of thousands of Eagles fans in \nJacksonville shouting, ``Fly Eagles Fly'' and witness the amount of \nsupport for the Philadelphia team.\n  The Eagles had an outstanding Super Bowl game, and despite the \noutcome of the game, should be proud of their efforts. I join the \nthousands of Eagles fans and Pennsylvanians in saying that I was proud \nto have the Eagles representing Pennsylvania in the Super Bowl for the \nfirst time since 1981.\n  What a tremendous season it was to have both Pennsylvania teams make \nit to their respective conference championships. The spirit and \nenthusiasm of the fans and the determination of the players on the \nfield this season was an incredible sight to behold. I look forward to \nnext season, when both teams have another chance to represent their \nrespective Pennsylvania cities and win big for their fans.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/02/14/senate-section/article/S1341-3", "month": "02", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1341]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2005\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the need for \nhate crimes legislation. Each Congress, Senator Kennedy and I introduce \nhate crimes legislation that would add new categories to current hate \ncrimes law, sending a signal that violence of any kind is unacceptable \nin our society. Likewise, each Congress I have come to the floor to \nhighlight a separate hate crime that has occurred in our country.\n  Last July, an 18-year-old Alabama man was bound, beaten, strangled, \ncut, and set on fire by his housemates. His decomposed body was found \nin the woods along a dirt road 4 days after the savage attack. The \nnature of the wounds suggests that the motive behind the murder was the \nfact that the victim was gay.\n  I believe that the Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, \nto defend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act is a symbol that can become substance. I \nbelieve that by passing this legislation and changing current law, we \ncan change hearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/02/14/senate-section/article/S1341-4", "month": "02", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1341-S1342]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             TRIBUTE TO CAPTAIN FRANK A. MANSON, 1920-2005\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today to commemorate the life of \nCAPT Frank Albert Manson, an outstanding Virginian who served his \ncountry with valor during World War II and the Korean War. While \nCaptain Manson passed from this earth on January 20, he has left an \nexceptional legacy through his humanitarian vision, his insightful \nobservation of naval conflict, and especially in the hearts of his \nloving wife, three children, and ten grandchildren. His daughter \nJennifer Joy Wilson was a longtime member of my staff and remains a \nvalued advisor.\n  Born in Oklahoma in 1920, Frank Manson earned a bachelor of science \nin education from Northeastern Oklahoma State University in 1941. \nFollowing 2 years of teaching at the high-school level, he attended \nofficer candidate school at Cornell University and gained his \ncommission for the United States Navy.\n  Like many other brave young men who answered the call of duty in \nWorld War II, then-Lieutenant Manson was sent to combat in the Pacific \nTheater. Appointed as the communications officer on the USS Laffey \nDD724, he was responsible for providing the media with the detailed \naccounts that followed the Laffey's triumphant efforts of April 16, \n1945. On that fateful day, the ship and its resilient crew outlasted an \nattack of at least twenty-two Japanese aircraft, the worst offensive \nendured by any United States ship that remained afloat. While bombs \nstrafed its deck and as many as eight planes crashed into the ship, the \nLaffey responded with courage befitting an American vessel. Eight \nplanes were shot down, and another six were harmed despite the \nextensive damage inflicted by the enemy forces upon ``the ship that \nwould not die.'' During his briefing with reporters covering the war, \nthe young officer recounted the infamous words of the Laffey's \ncommanding officer, LCDR Julius T. Becton, who had stated so admirably, \n``I'll never abandon ship as long as a gun will fire.''\n  Captain Manson distinguished himself as an excellent writer during \nand\n\n[[Page S1342]]\n\nafter his military career. Following his noble service in World War II, \nCaptain Manson was reassigned to the Pentagon. He coauthored three \nvolumes of the Navy's Battle Report Series, the branch's official \nhistory of action in the war. Again, during the Korean War, he was \ncalled upon for his skills as a historian. Captain Manson traveled on a \nnumber of ships and spoke with many of his fellow seamen before co-\nauthoring the exceptional work, ``The Sea War in Korea.'' A thoroughly \nresearched and well written official history of the Navy's role in \nbattle, his book was republished in seven languages and was selected \nfor permanent inclusion in the White House Library. Before retiring \nfrom the Navy in 1968, Captain Manson served as Chief Public Affairs \nNATO Allied Command Europe and Chief of Public Information for the \nSupreme Allied Commander Atlantic, ADM Thomas Moorer. He was valued as \na speechwriter for many naval leaders of the 1950s and '60s, including \nAdmirals Robert Carney, Arleigh Burke, and John S. McCain, Jr. Over the \ncourse of his naval career, he assisted in high command policy \nformulation, strategy, and tactics through his service on the personal \nstaff of fourteen four-star admirals and four chiefs of naval \noperations.\n  While he was a courageous sailor and a noteworthy historian, perhaps \nthe best known of Captain Manson's efforts was his idea for the ``Great \nWhite Fleet.'' Working from the Pentagon after the Korean War, he \nreflected upon the poverty and disease that he had encountered as a \nsoldier on the battlefields of World War II. Understanding that the \nNavy maintained a surplus of vessels, Captain Manson began to \ninvestigate previous naval capacities for hospital and auxiliary ships. \nFrom his research he developed a concept to create, in his own words, \n``an entire fleet of mercy ships grain ships, hospital ships, education \nships, power ships--a fleet designed to make the benefits of the free \nenterprise system available to the entire human race.'' Recognizing his \nfellow citizens' desire for peace and the willingness of Americans to \ncontribute to ``sensible'' foreign aid, Captain Manson gained \nresounding support for the fleet in the United States and abroad. \nChampioned by Senators George Aiken and Hubert Humphrey, legislation \nfor the humanitarian ships passed in this chamber, and his vision was \nrealized with the inaugural voyage of Project Hope, a seafaring \nbenefactor of medical care.\n  Even during his years of retirement, Captain Manson provided his \nexpertise to the American Legion, the Reserve Officers Association, and \nthe Veterans of Foreign Wars.

Mr. President, today I congratulate a special group \nof teachers in the Hawaii Public School System, those who have \nsuccessfully earned the designation National Board Certified Teacher. \nDuring 2004, a new cadre of 24 consummate professionals demonstrated \nthat their teaching practice is consistent with the rigorous \nrequirements for the profession as set by the National Board for \nProfessional Teaching Standards. By demonstrating that their practice \nmeets or exceeds the most rigorous set of standards for a K-12 teacher \nin the United States, they have successfully achieved National Board \nCertification. Their achievement brings the number of teachers working \nin the schools in Hawaii who have attained this prestigious credential \nto 80.\n  These dedicated teachers are distributed throughout the educational \nsystem of Hawaii. Some teach at the elementary level, some in middle \nschools, while others teach in high school classrooms. Some teach on \nOahu, some are on the Big Island, some work on Maui and others on \nKauai. Some teach language arts, some teach math, while others teach \nother disciplines. Some teach special needs students, a few are \ngeneralists, others are specialists, and one is a librarian. But all of \nthem have one thing in common, their dedication to helping the \nschoolchildren of Hawaii achieve all they can. I am proud to enter \ntheir names into the Record of this august body.\n  During the 2004 year the following teachers received the credential: \nCynthia Acierto, Kalihi-Kai Elementary School, Oahu; Deborah Anderson, \nHonokaa High and Intermediate School, Hawaii; Laura Brown, Pearl Ridge \nElementary School, Oahu; Lorraine Ching, Lunalilo Elementary School, \nOahu; Laurianne Chun, Hawaii Center for the Deaf and Blind, Oahu; \nSharon Chun, Maemae Elementary School, Oahu; Scott Fieux, Honokaa \nElementary School, Hawaii; Jilda Hoffman, Kailua Intermediate School, \nOahu; Michael Ida, Kalani High School, Oahu; Tracey Idica, Aiea High \nSchool, Oahu; Shari Kaneshiro, Hokulani Elementary School, Oahu; Patti \nLaba, Dole Middle School, Oahu; Angela Miyashiro, Hilo High School, \nHawaii; Diane Murakami, Kaahumanu Elementary School, Oahu; Sunny Seal-\nLaplante, Kalanianaole Elementary and Intermediate School, Hawaii; \nLinda Seals, Wahiawa Middle School, Oahu; Ralph Soderberg, Kealakehe \nIntermediate School, Hawaii; Lynne Sueoka, Moanalua High School, Oahu; \nKimberly Tadaki, Holomua Elementary School, Oahu; Terri Takabayashi, \nMaemae Elementary School, Oahu; Saundra Takara, Aliamanu Elementary \nSchool, Oahu; Joanne Thompson, Kilauea Elementary School, Kauai; Gail \nVan De Verg, Heeia Elementary School, Oahu; Laurie Waite Flores, Hauula \nElementary School, Oahu.\n  During the 2003 year the following teachers received the credential: \nJerri Anderson, Kealakehe High School, Hawaii; Kristilyn Atalig, \nHolomua Elementary School, Oahu; Cynthia Chun, Kapolei High School, \nOahu; Phyllis Clemmer, Keaau Middle School, Hawaii; Colleen Collins, \nPahoa Elementary School, Hawaii; Marian Crocco, Alvah Scott Elementary \nSchool, Oahu; Denise Darval-Chang, Kailua High School, Oahu; June \nDavids, Keaau Middle School, Hawaii; Karen DeBrum, Lanai High and \nElementary School, Maui; Elizabeth Delyon, Makawao Elementary School, \nMaui; Laura Fukumoto, Aliamanu Elementary School, Oahu; Jonathan \nGillentine, Benjamin Parker Elementary School, Oahu; Nancy Graf, Kapaa \nMiddle School, Kauai; Maria Hawkins, Kaimiloa Elementary School, Oahu; \nPhyllis Ida, Windward District Office, Oahu; Michael Kline, Kalaheo \nElementary School, Kauai; Roberta Kokx, Kihei Elementary School, Maui; \nHennan Leong, Radford High School, Oahu; Sandra Linskey, Castle High \nSchool, Oahu; Judy Locke, Kihei Elementary School, Maui; Michael \nOliver, Baldwin High School, Maui; Liane Otani-Nakagawa, Kihei \nElementary School, Maui; Cristina Rathyenn, Moanalua High School, Oahu; \nCarol Seielstad, Hanalei Elementary School, Kauai; Cherie Synnott, \nPearl Harbor Elementary School, Oahu; Maria Vasquez, Waialua Elementary \nSchool, Oahu; Anna Fern White, Kohala High School, Hawaii; Kara Yasui, \nHolomua Elementary School, Oahu.\n\n  During the 2002 year the following teachers received the credential: \nRena Arakawa, Kaahumanu Elementary School, Oahu; Carla Brooks, \nRoosevelt High School, Oahu; Dewey Gottlieb II, Pearl City High School, \nOahu; Jamie Hamada, Barbers Point Elementary School, Oahu; Leslie \nHamasaki, Kalani High School, Oahu; Loraine Hotoke, Liholiho Elementary \nSchool, Oahu; Sandra Kaneshiro, Central Middle School, Oahu; Carolyn \nKirio, Kaolei High School, Oahu; Kalen Kitagawa, Waialua Elementary \nSchool, Oahu; Sandra Maruyaba, Leilehua High School, Oahu; Patricia \nMiyahira, Leeward District Office, Oahu; Jami Muranika, Kaimuki High \nSchool, Oahu; Karen Muronaga, Lincoln Elementary School, Oahu; \nKathleenl Nagaji, Pearl Ridge Elementary School, Oahu; Pascale Pinner, \nHilo Intermediate School, Hawaii; Anne Torige, Kaimuki\n\n[[Page S1343]]\n\nHigh School, Oahu; Julie Tomomitsu, Maemae Elementary School, Oahu; \nJenny Wells, Windward District Office, Oahu; Julia Williams, Hawaii \nDistrict Office, Hawaii.\n  During the 2001 year the following teachers received the credential: \nLisa Houston, Iliaha Elementary, Oahu; Teresa Tugadi, Pohakea \nElementary School, Oahu; Lisa Yanase, Waialua Elementary School, Oahu.\n  During the 2000 year the following teachers received the credential: \nJill Hirota, Waialua Elementary School, Oahu; Bess Anne Jennings, \nHawaii District Office, Hawaii; Charlene Miyashiro, Waiakeawaena \nElementary School, Hawaii.\n  During the 1999 year the following teachers received the credential: \nDerek Minafami, Kailua High School, Oahu; Tammie Reynolds, Mililani \nHigh School, Oahu.\n  During the 1998 year the following teacher received the credential: \nLinda Sciaroi, Chiefess Kamakahelie Middle School, Kauai.\n  I offer my heartfelt congratulations to them all. They have worked \nvery hard to earn the designation, National Board Certified Teacher.\n  The National Board for Professional Teaching Standards, the \norganization that confers this designation, is a teacher-led \nassociation, which grants national certification to a teacher only \nafter a long and very comprehensive process. It requires the \npreparation and submission of a portfolio featuring videotaped \nclassroom presented lessons, including a written analysis of the \nlesson, lesson plans and student work samples. The teacher must also \nsubmit written discussion, analysis, and reflective commentaries \nconcerning other curriculum used in the classroom. A third component of \nthe portfolio includes records of activities benefiting the larger \nschool community, including families and activities that help to \nimprove the teaching profession. The candidate has 3 years to complete \nthese activities, although most complete this portfolio during one \nschool year. Also required for this certification is successful \ncompletion of a rigorous set of examinations assessing the content \nknowledge of the teacher. This is a very arduous process. But in Hawaii \nhelp is available. The Hawaii Teacher Standards Board, along with the \nHawaii State Teachers Association, provides support groups for teachers \nundertaking this process. These sessions are held on the islands of \nOahu, Maui, Kauai and the Big Island, and they provide a support \nnetwork for the candidates as they go through the process. Most often \nthis will be a facilitator, a teacher who has already earned the \ndesignation of National Board Certified Teacher. It is also a place to \nmeet with other teachers undergoing the process, support each other, \nand sometimes to commiserate. This support goes a long way in making \nthis very difficult process doable.\n\n  National Board Certification does not replace the teacher licensure \nrequirements as maintained by the Hawaii Teacher Standards Board, but \nidentifies the recipient as an exemplary practitioner, someone at the \ntop of his or her profession. It signifies the teacher as someone who \nis a recognized leader in the art and science of teaching. And research \nhas shown time and again that students in classrooms with National \nBoard Certified Teachers show larger gains on assessments than do \nstudents in classrooms not staffed with nationally certified teachers. \nIt is the only nationally based teacher evaluation and certification \nprogram to successfully undergo a rigorous scientifically based set of \nevaluations, and to show improved results for the students. I am very \nproud to honor these newly recognized teachers.\n  At a time when the country is working to improve education, when the \nNo Child Left Behind Act is demanding a highly qualified teacher in \nevery classroom, where schools, district and states are under the gun \nto make adequate yearly progress, where increasingly students must \ndemonstrate achievement as measured by a high stakes test to graduate \nfrom high school, where districts and States are working to find, hire \nand retain professionals in this very difficult field, and where \nresearch has shown the ability of the classroom teacher is the most \nimportant factor affecting the learning of the students, I am proud to \nsay to these newly certified teachers ``Well Done,'' and ``Mahalo Nui \nLoa.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/02/14/senate-section/article/S1343-1", "month": "02", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1343]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/02/14/senate-section/article/S1343-2", "month": "02", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1343]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/02/14/senate-section/article/S1343-3", "month": "02", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1343]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 12:30 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 418.

A bill to provide for college quality, affordability, and \ndiversity, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it should be our common purpose to extend \nthe promise of a quality education to all from birth through college. \nThe strength, security, and future of our Nation lie in the education \nand character of our people.\n  Every student with the talent, desire, and drive to go to college \nshould be able to go to college, unstopped by inability to pay.\n  Jobs requiring post-secondary education are expected to account for \nover 40 percent of total job growth over the next decade. Workers with \na bachelor's degree earn $1 million more over a lifetime than workers \nwithout a degree.\n  But only 40 percent of whites, 30 percent of African Americans, and \n16 percent of Latinos age 18 to 24 attend college. Just as unsettling, \nis that over 40 percent of those who do attend college fail to earn a \nbachelor's degree within 6 years of their initial enrollment, and for \nminorities the percentage is far worse.\n  We have to do more to help qualified students attend and finish \ncollege unburdened by crushing debt, and we must do more to help \ncolleges train more and better teachers so that future college students \nare better prepared.\n  Today, along with Democratic colleagues on the Health, Education, \nLabor and Pensions Committee, I am introducing the College Quality, \nAffordability, and Diversity Improvement, QUAD, Act of 2005 to \nhighlight our proposals to extend college opportunity.\n  First and foremost, our bill helps more needy and middle class \nstudents be able to attend college. It increases the maximum Pell grant \nby $1,000 next year in order to keep pace with tuition increases. It \ndoubles the maximum Hope Scholarship Tax Credit, makes it available for \n4 years of education instead of the current 2, and makes it refundable.\n  Our bill helps alleviate student debt burden by eliminating \norigination fees on subsidized loans. It enables over 5 million \nborrowers with consolidated loans to refinance their loans just as they \nwould a home mortgage to take advantage of lower interest rates.\n  Our bill provides a new incentive to colleges to go into the Direct \nLoan program. The Direct Loan program saves the government and \ntaxpayers money--11 cents on every dollar lent, according to the \nPresident's latest budget and Congressional Budget Office estimates. \nUnder this bill, no one is forced into the Direct Loan program, but \ncolleges in that cost-efficient program will get more funding dedicated \nto helping needy students. If private lenders are inspired to match or \nbeat Direct Loan program associated benefits with their ``school as \nlender'' program, so be it. Either way, this proposal is a win for \ncolleges, students and taxpayers.\n  Our bill provides increased support for minority and first-generation \ncollege students through increased funding for successful programs such \nas TRIO and GEAR Up, as well as support for minority-serving \ninstitutions. It also creates a new program to help ensure poor and \nminority students stay in and finish college.\n  To help meet our goal under No Child Left Behind to ensure a \nqualified teacher in every classroom, the bill expands and strengthens \nprograms to recruit, train, and retain highly qualified teachers, \nparaprofessionals, principals, and superintendents.\n  Because of the high costs of higher education for everyone, and \nbecause each individual's private interest in a college education is in \nour common interest, our bill works to help both low-income and hard-\npressed middle income families send their children to college and \ngraduate.\n  I hope the majority will look carefully at all the proposals \ncontained in this legislation to see where we can find common ground.\n  We should all commit that cost will never be a barrier to a college \ndegree. Just as Social Security is a promise to senior citizens, we \nshould make ``education security'' a promise to every young American. \nIf you work hard, if you finish high school, if you are admitted to a \ncollege, we will guarantee that you can afford the cost of college \neducation.\n  That should be a goal we can all agree on.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LEAHY (for himself, Mr. Bennett, Mr. Bingaman, Ms. \n        Cantwell, Mr. Cochran, Mr. Conrad, Mr. Dodd, Mr. Durbin, Mr. \n        Jeffords, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. Lugar, Mr. \n        Stevens, and Mr. Warner):\n  S. 372. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \nthat a deduction equal to fair market value shall be allowed for \ncharitable contributions of literary, musical, artistic, or scholarly \ncompositions created by the donor; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I rise today again with Senator Bennett to \nintroduce the ``Artist-Museum Partnership Act.'' This bipartisan \nlegislation will enable our country to keep cherished art works in the \nUnited States and to preserve them in our public institutions, while \nerasing an inequity in our tax code that currently serves as a \ndisincentive for artists to donate their works to museums and \nlibraries. This is the same bill we introduced the past three \nCongresses. It was also included in the Senate-passed version of the \nPresident's 2001 tax cut bill, and in the Senate-passed version of the \n2003 Charity Aid, Recovery, and Empowerment, CARE, Act. I would like to \nthank Senators Bingaman, Cantwell, Cochran, Conrad, Dodd, Durbin, \nJeffords, Kennedy, Kerry, Lieberman, Lugar, Stevens and Warner for \ncosponsoring this bipartisan bill.\n  Our bill is sensible and straightforward. It would allow artists, \nwriters, and composers who donate works to museums and libraries to \ntake a tax deduction equal to the fair market value of the work. This \nis something that collectors who make similar donations are already \nable to do. Under current law, artists who donate self-created works \nare only able to deduct the cost of supplies such as canvas, pen, paper \nand ink, which does not even come close to their true value. This is \nunfair to artists and it hurts museums and libraries--large and small--\nthat are dedicated to preserving works for posterity. If we as a nation \nwant to ensure that art works created by living artists are available \nto the public in the future--for study or for pleasure--this is \nsomething that artists should be allowed to do.\n  In my State of Vermont, we are incredibly proud of the great works \nproduced by hundreds of local artists who choose to live and work in \nthe Green Mountain State. Displaying their creations in museums and \nlibraries helps\n\n[[Page S1347]]\n\ndevelop a sense of pride among Vermonters and strengthens a bond with \nVermont, its landscape, its beauty, and its cultural heritage. Anyone \nwho has contemplated a painting in a museum or examined an original \nmanuscript or composition, and has gained a greater understanding of \nboth the artist and the subject as a result, knows the tremendous value \nof these works. I would like to see more of them, not fewer, preserved \nin Vermont and across the country.\n  Prior to 1969, artists and collectors alike were able to take a \ndeduction equivalent to the fair market value of a work, but Congress \nchanged the law with respect to artists in the Tax Reform Act of 1969. \nSince then, fewer and fewer artists have donated their works to museums \nand cultural institutions. The sharp decline in donations to the \nLibrary of Congress clearly illustrates this point. Until 1969, the \nLibrary of Congress received 15 to 20 large gifts of manuscripts from \nauthors each year. In the four years following the elimination of the \ndeduction, the Library received only one such gift. Instead, many of \nthese works have been sold to private collectors and are no longer \navailable to the general public.\n  For example, prior to the enactment of the 1969 law, Igor Stravinsky \nplanned to donate his papers to the Music Division of the Library of \nCongress. But after the law passed, his papers were sold instead to a \nprivate foundation in Switzerland. We can no longer afford this massive \nloss to our cultural heritage. Losses like this are an unintended \nconsequence of the 1969 tax bill that should now be corrected.\n  Congress changed the law for artists more than 30 years ago in \nresponse to the perception that some taxpayers were taking advantage of \nthe law by inflating the market value of self-created works. Since that \ntime, however, the government has cut down significantly on the abuse \nof fair market value determinations. Under this legislation, artists \nwho donate their own paintings, manuscripts, compositions, or scholarly \ncompositions would be subject to the same new rules that all taxpayer/\ncollectors who donate such works must now follow. This includes \nproviding relevant information as to the value of the gift, providing \nappraisals by qualified appraisers, and, in some cases, subjecting them \nto review by the Internal Revenue Service's Art Advisory Panel.\n  In addition, donated works must be accepted by museums and libraries, \nwhich often have strict criteria in place for works they intend to \ndisplay. The institution must certify that it intends to put the work \nto a use that is related to the institution's tax exempt status. For \nexample, a painting contributed to an educational institution must be \nused by that organization for educational purposes and could not be \nsold by the institution for profit. Similarly, a work could not be \ndonated to a hospital or other charitable institution that did not \nintend to use the work in a manner related to the function constituting \nthe recipient's exemption under Section 501 of the tax code. Finally, \nthe fair market value of the work could only be deducted from the \nportion of the artist's income that has come from the sale of similar \nworks or related activities.\n  This bill would also correct another disparity in the tax treatment \nof self-created works--how the same work is treated before and after an \nartist's death. While living artists may only deduct the material costs \nof donations, donations of those same works after death are deductible \nfrom estate taxes at the fair market value of the work. In addition, \nwhen an artist dies, works that are part of his or her estate are taxed \non the fair market value.\n  The Joint Committee on Taxation has previously estimated that our \nbill would cost $50 million over 10 years. This is a moderate price to \npay for our education and the preservation of our cultural heritage.\n  I want to thank my colleagues again for cosponsoring this bipartisan \nlegislation. The time has come for us to correct an unintended \nconsequence of the 1969 law and encourage rather than discourage the \ndonations of art works by their creators.

A bill to amend the Farm Security and Rural Investment Act of \n2002 to provide for a program to develop and demonstrate the cost-\neffective operation of a fleet of renewable\n\n[[Page S1348]]\n\nhydrogen passenger vehicles; to the Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, over the past several years, among the \nmost challenging issues for this Congress has been reform of the \nNation's energy policy.\n  Despite rising fuel costs and growing dependence on imported oil, \ndespite evidence of global warming and concerns about the quality of \nour air and water, despite all the recent advances in renewable energy \ntechnology, we hobble along on an energy policy that is more than a \ndecade out of date.\n  Fortunately, there are several initiatives in energy policy on which \nthere is wide bipartisan support.\n  Perhaps the best example of an idea on which there is solid agreement \nis the importance of developing our hydrogen economy.\n  Hydrogen has the potential to transform completely the way we think \nof transportation, with vehicles that consume no foreign oil, spew no \nsmog, no toxic emissions, and zero greenhouse gases. But only if we \nmake it the right way.\n  You see, to get energy out of hydrogen, first you have to make it. \nAnd the way we make it is going to make all the difference to our \nenergy future.\n  Right now, the main way we make hydrogen is from natural gas.\n  Natural gas is a clean-burning fuel, but its price is volatile. And \nas a fossil fuel, it is a finite resource and releases carbon dioxide \nand other greenhouse gases when burned.\n  Ultimately, we hope to form hydrogen from pollution-free water, using \nwind or solar energy to extract the hydrogen--the H2--from the H2O. But \nthis technology is still too expensive to make a significant \ncontribution to our energy needs today.\n  Thanks to research at some of the country's leading institutions, \nincluding those in my state of Iowa, a cost-effective technology is now \navailable to produce hydrogen from another clean, renewable energy \nsource: one that we grow right here at home.\n  Hydrogen can now be formed from ethanol made entirely from corn and \nother agricultural products grown right here on American farms.\n  Ethanol is an increasingly important source of fuel. It is made from \ncorn and other agricultural products from farms throughout the Midwest \nand increasingly in other parts of the country. It is manufactured in \nplants scattered across rural America, and has become one of the most \nimportant value-added enterprises for our rural economies.\n\n  Today, ethanol is made from corn, as well as from crop residues, \nstalks, and other low-cost biomass.\n  By blending ethanol into conventional gasoline we reduce our \ndependence on foreign oil, support rural economies, and make a cleaner-\nburning fuel. But even blended fuel produces some pollution, and we \nstill depend on imported oil for the gasoline component.\n  A vital next step is to begin using ethanol to make hydrogen. \nHydrogen from ethanol produces little in the way of pollution. Whatever \ncarbon dioxide is released gets absorbed by next year's crop as it \ngrows; and it's possibly the most economical way to make renewable \nhydrogen for the foreseeable future.\n  Imagine hydrogen ``Made in the USA'' from crops ``Grown in the USA'' \nwith generating facilities in rural communities in desperate need of \njobs and economic growth.\n  So why aren't all of our cars being converted to run on renewable \nfarm-based hydrogen? As we all know, the fuel cells needed to convert \nthat hydrogen efficiently into usable energy are still years from being \ncommercially ready.\n  However, hydrogen-powered internal combustion hybrid electric engines \nhave been developed that can achieve over 90 percent of the \nenvironmental benefits and 100 percent of the reduced oil import \nbenefits of fuel cells, and this technology is ready for demonstration \nright now.\n  American businesses are ready to show the world that hydrogen can be \nproduced from clean, farm-based renewable sources, and that renewable \nhydrogen can be used as a fuel for our cars and trucks.\n  As we debate the bigger picture of our Nation's energy policy, we \nhave the opportunity to make a small investment with huge potential.\n  Now is the time for a renewable hydrogen transportation demonstration \nprogram.\n  I am introducing the Renewable Hydrogen Passenger Vehicle Act of 2005 \nto provide a testing ground for renewable farm-based hydrogen \ntransportation technology. We need to get renewable hydrogen production \nout into fueling stations, where it can be put through its paces, \nanalyzed and improved for the day when fuel cells arrive, so we can \nsupply our fuel cells with clean, renewable hydrogen right from day \none.\n  This bill would authorize $5 million over three years to develop and \ndemonstrate the cost-effective operation of a small hydrogen-from-\nethanol reformer and a fleet of at least 10 internal combustion hybrid \nelectric vehicles converted to run on that hydrogen.\n  The program would allow investors, manufacturers and entrepreneurs to \nsee first-hand that clean renewable hydrogen can be cost-effectively \nproduced from farm-based fuels; that the technology to run our vehicles \non renewable hydrogen is here and ready to deploy; and that renewable \nhydrogen is ready for the day that fuel cell vehicles arrive in local \nshowrooms.\n  The successful demonstration will help stimulate development of \nhydrogen fueling systems at existing gasoline fueling stations to \nconvert ethanol to hydrogen onsite, thereby significantly accelerating \nthe adoption of super-clean domestic renewable hydrogen as an \nalternative to gasoline made from imported oil.\n  It includes monitoring of emissions and fuel economy data, quick \nstart-up and rapid deployment--all for a tiny fraction of the funds \nalready being invested in fuel cell research.\n  This is not a large or costly initiative, but it is one that has the \npotential to take us a big step towards a clean, renewable hydrogen-\nbased economy. I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 373\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

RENEWABLE HYDROGEN TRANSPORTATION DEMONSTRATION \n                   PROGRAM.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) reductions in local air pollution, greenhouse gas \n     emissions, and oil imports resulting from the introduction of \n     vehicles with gasoline-powered internal combustion hybrid \n     electric engines will be only temporary, as improved fuel \n     economy of the hybrid vehicles is offset by increases in \n     vehicle miles traveled;\n       (2) direct substitution of farm-based renewable fuels for \n     gasoline in gasoline-powered internal combustion hybrid \n     electric engines will result in further reductions in local \n     air pollution, greenhouse gas emissions, and oil imports;\n       (3) for permanent reductions in criteria pollutants, \n     greenhouse gas emissions, and oil imports, Congress should \n     establish as a national goal the development of renewable \n     hydrogen as a clean effective energy carrier;\n       (4) the development of vehicles powered by hydrogen derived \n     from domestic renewable resources such as ethanol, energy \n     crops, agricultural waste, landfill gas, municipal solid \n     waste, wind power, and solar electricity, will--\n       (A) substantially and permanently reduce local air \n     pollution and greenhouse gas emissions;\n       (B) improve the energy security of the United States; and\n       (C) create domestic jobs;\n       (5) notwithstanding paragraph (4), as of the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the fuel cell technology required to \n     make the most efficient use of renewable hydrogen is too \n     costly and has not achieved the reliability necessary for \n     consumer acceptance in the near term;\n       (6) in the near term (before affordable and reliable fuel \n     cell vehicles are developed), hydrogen-powered internal \n     combustion engine hybrid electric vehicles have been \n     developed that can achieve more than 90 percent of the \n     environmental benefits and 100 percent of the oil import \n     reduction benefits of fuel cell vehicles;\n       (7) in addition to robust research and development for fuel \n     cell vehicles, a program to develop and demonstrate renewable \n     hydrogen production and distribution technology is justified;\n       (8) reforming ethanol at a vehicle fueling station may be \n     the least costly method of producing renewable hydrogen;\n       (9) a low cost renewable hydrogen vehicle demonstration \n     program that will yield valuable information regarding an \n     interim transition strategy of using hydrogen-powered \n     internal combustion engine hybrid electric\n\n[[Page S1349]]\n\n     vehicles to pave the way for fuel cell vehicles once fuel \n     cell vehicles become affordable and reliable can be \n     implemented in 1 year; and\n       (10) the introduction of commercial hydrogen internal \n     combustion engine hybrid electric vehicles can provide the \n     economic incentives to help stimulate development of hydrogen \n     fueling systems at existing gasoline fueling stations to \n     convert ethanol to hydrogen onsite, thereby significantly \n     accelerating the adoption of super-clean renewable hydrogen \n     as an alternative to gasoline made from imported crude oil.\n       (b) Program.--Section 9007 of the Farm Security and Rural \n     Investment Act of 2002 (7 U.S.C. 8107) is amended by adding \n     at the end the following:\n       ``(c) Demonstration Program.--\n       ``(1) In general.--The Secretary of Energy, in coordination \n     with the Secretary, shall conduct a 3-year program to develop \n     and demonstrate the cost-effective operation of a fleet of at \n     least 10 direct hydrogen passenger vehicles based on existing \n     commercial technology under which the hydrogen is derived \n     from ethanol or other domestic low-cost transportable \n     renewable feedstocks.\n       ``(2) Goals.--The goals of the program shall include--\n       ``(A) demonstrating the cost-effective conversion of \n     ethanol or other low-cost transportable renewable feedstocks \n     to pure hydrogen suitable for eventual use in proton exchange \n     membrane fuel cell vehicles at 1 or more local fueling \n     stations, including hydrogen compression and storage \n     necessary to fill vehicle tanks to their operational \n     pressure, using existing commercial reforming technology or \n     modest modifications of existing technology to reform ethanol \n     or other low-cost transportable renewable feedstocks into \n     hydrogen;\n       ``(B) converting 10 or more commercially available internal \n     combustion engine hybrid electric passenger vehicles to \n     operate on hydrogen;\n       ``(C) installing and operating an ethanol reformer or \n     reformer of another low-cost transportable renewable \n     feedstock (including onsite hydrogen compression, storage, \n     and dispensing) at the facilities of a fleet operator not \n     later than 1 year after commencement of the program;\n       ``(D) operating the 10 or more hydrogen internal combustion \n     engine hybrid electric vehicles for a period of 2 years;

A bill to provide compensation to the Lower Brule and Crow \nCreek Sioux Tribes of South Dakota for damage to tribal land caused by \nPick-Sloan projects along the Missouri River; to the Committee on \nIndian Affairs.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Tribal Parity \nAct. I am proud to be joined by my colleague from South Dakota, Senator \nJohnson, in introducing this legislation.\n  Several Indian tribes that border the Missouri River in South Dakota \nhave been compensated for damage to their tribal lands caused by Pick-\nSloan projects. Unfortunately, the compensation provided to those \ntribes has not been consistent. This legislation will allow the Lower \nBrule and Crow Creek Sioux Tribes to be fairly compensated.\n  The Tribal Parity Act passed the Senate three times during the 108th \nCongress, after being reported out of the Indian Affairs Committee \nwithout objection. This legislation has also been endorsed by the \nGovernor of my home State, Governor Rounds, and a similar bill has been \nintroduced in the U.S. House of Representatives.\n  I am committed to working with my colleagues to get this compensation \nfor the Lower Brule and Crow Creek Sioux Tribes. I hope we can pass it \nin an expeditious manner and send it to the House for timely \nconsideration.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CONRAD (for himself, Mr. Thomas, Mr. Baucus, Mr. Salazar, \n        Mr. Johnson, Mr. Dorgan, Mr. Reid, Mr. Bingaman, and Mr. \n        Domenici):\n  S.J. Res. 4. A joint resolution providing for congressional \ndisapproval of the rule submitted by the Department of Agriculture \nunder chapter 8 of title 5, United States Code, relating to risk zones \nfor introduction of bovine spongiform encephalopathy; to the Committee \non Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, today I am introducing a resolution \npursuant to the Congressional Review Act to disapprove of the final \nrule promulgated by USDA that designates Canada as a Minimal-Risk \nRegion for Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy or BSE.\n  I am taking this action because opening our border to Canadian cattle \nimports at this time is premature. Allowing the BSE rule to go forward \ncould have very serious consequences for the human and animal health in \nthis country. Reopening the border poses serious economic risks for the \nU.S. cattle industry. And it complicates our efforts to reopen export \nmarkets.\n  BSE is an extremely dangerous disease. After BSE was first identified \nin England in 1986, Europe was forced to destroy millions of head of \ncattle. And, around the world, dozens of human deaths from Creutzfeld--\nJacob's Disease have since been linked to BSE. So we must be very \ncareful before we consider opening our border to imports from a country \nknown to have BSE.\n  Since the European outbreak, scientists from around the world have \nbeen engaged in efforts to learn more about the disease. They have \ndeveloped methods to test, control, and eradicate BSE. Through the \nInternational Organization for Animal Health, known as the OIE, experts \nhave designed science-based standards for the safe trade of beef \nproducts and live cattle from countries that have or may have BSE. In \nparticular, because BSE is transmitted through livestock feed \ncontaminated with animal proteins containing BSE, it is critical that \ncountries adopt measures to ensure that animal proteins and other \nspecified risk materials are not present in cattle feed.\n  Unfortunately, the USDA does not appear to have fully followed OIE \nguidelines in developing its rules. Moreover, with respect to Canada, \nUSDA has not done a thorough evaluation to ensure that Canada's cattle \nfeed is not contaminated with animal proteins.\n  The United States has appropriately blocked cattle imports from \nCanada since Canada confirmed its first indigenous case of BSE in May \nof 2003. Concerns were only heightened when BSE was confirmed in a \ndairy cow of Canadian origin in Washington State in December of 2003. \nThis case resulted in many important U.S. trading partners banning the \nimportation of U.S. cattle and beef products--a situation that \ncontinues today with regard to some of our most important customers.\n  So it is very important that USDA move slowly and deliberately and \nevaluate all possible risks before re-opening the border to Canadian \ncattle.\n  But the USDA rule does not do this. In particular, Canada has not \neffectively implemented measures to contain and control BSE for 8 \nyears, as required by the OIE. Moreover, USDA has applied a very loose \nand flexible interpretation to the specific recommendations developed \nby the OIE.\n\n  Since USDA announced its proposed final rule designating Canada as a \nMinimum-Risk Region for BSE, Canada has confirmed two additional BSE \ncases. The most recent one is particularly disturbing because it \ninvolves a cow born several months after Canada implemented its ban on \nanimal proteins in cattle feed. This raises serious questions about \nwhether the Canadian feed ban is being effectively enforced.\n  These questions are only reinforced by other evidence of lax \nenforcement in Canada.\n  For example, numerous Canadian newspapers have reported that Canadian \nFood Inspection Agency tests indicate a disturbingly high level of non-\ncompliance with Canada's overall livestock feed regulations.\n  An article in the Vancouver Sun indicates that secret tests found \nanimal proteins that violated Canada's feed regulations in 41 of 70 \nCanadian feed samples. More than half of these ``vegetarian'' feed \nsamples contained animal proteins. More than half. Clearly, feed \nregulation compliance in Canada is not up to par.\n  Since October, 2003, our own Food and Drug Administration has issued \n19 import alerts concerning imported Canadian feed products that are \ncontaminated with illegal animal proteins. Eight of those import alerts \nagainst Canadian livestock feed manufacturers are still in force.\n  Finally, Canada has recently issued new rules to further restrict the \nUse of animal proteins in livestock feed as well as in fertilizer. \nCanada's own justification for tightening its regulations is to reduce \nthe potential for the cross contamination of livestock feed products \nand fertilizers with animal proteins that might contain the BSE prions. \nTo me, this suggests that even\n\n[[Page S1350]]\n\nCanadian officials are concerned that the enforcement and compliance \nwith existing regulations may be inadequate.\n  In addition, as noted in a letter I, along with Senators Harkin, \nJohnson and Salazar, recently sent to Secretary of Agriculture Johanns, \nthere is concern, that not enough time has elapsed to be sure that \nCanada's education, surveillance and testing measures are truly \nindicative of their level of BSE risk.\n  The bottom line is this. Canada has not achieved the necessary level \nof compliance with OIE rules to justify designating it as a minimal \nrisk region.\n  Canada's failure to enforce its BSE measures could have serious \nconsequences if USDA proceeds to reopen the border.\n  First and most obviously, it would create potential dangers for \nconsumers in this country.\n  Second, it would pose dangers for the health of our U.S. cattle herd.\n  Third, even if we do not end up with BSE-tainted imports, the \nperception of heightened risk for consumers could have adverse economic \nconsequences for the U.S. cattle industry.\n  Finally, our major export markets have remained closed to U.S. beef \nexports, even though there has been no indigenous case of BSE in the \nU.S. I fear that reopening the border now, before we have reached \nagreement on reopening our export markets, will only give our trade \npartners an excuse to further delay reopening these critical markets \nfor U.S. producers.\n  Yesterday's announcement by Secretary Johanns to restrict the \nimportation of Canadian beef products to those from cattle under 30 \nmonths of age is a small step in the right direction. However, this \nannouncement does not address the unresolved concerns about Canada's \ncompliance with its feed regulations, which has been cited as the \nprimary basis for extending a Minimal-Risk Region designation to \nCanada.\n  It was my hope that our new Secretary of Agriculture would withdraw \nthe proposal to resume trade with Canada when he learned of these \nserious issues. But it now appears that the only way to stop this rule \nfrom going forward is for the Congress to block it. Therefore, I hope \nmy colleagues will join me in supporting this resolution of \ndisapproval.\n  Then perhaps we can have a meaningful dialogue on how to move forward \nin a way that will ensure the safety of the U.S. cattle herd and help \nopen export markets.

Res. 54\n\n       Whereas John Hume is one of the greatest advocates of peace \n     and non-violence of our time;\n       Whereas throughout the long and difficult years of civil \n     strife and turmoil, John Hume has dedicated his life to \n     achieving a peaceful, just, and lasting settlement of the \n     conflict in Northern Ireland;\n       Whereas throughout the turbulent years in Northern Ireland, \n     John Hume never lost faith in the belief that violence and \n     terrorism are wrong, that a negotiated settlement is the only \n     realistic hope for peace, and that ancient antagonisms cannot \n     be settled by bombs and bullets;\n       Whereas John Hume deserves enormous credit for the peace \n     process in Northern Ireland, which led to the 1998 Good \n     Friday Agreement;\n       Whereas John Hume's enduring vision of reconciliation, \n     based on equal respect and recognition for both the \n     Protestant and Catholic traditions in Northern Ireland, has \n     served as an inspiration to those seeking peaceful resolution \n     of conflicts in many other parts of the world;\n       Whereas John Hume has worked consistently for the rights of \n     the members of his community, beginning with the launching of \n     a credit union to provide assistance to the minority \n     community to purchase housing;\n       Whereas John Hume's commitment was to effective programs \n     and peaceful works, at a time when others in his community \n     increasingly urged or acquiesced to bombs and bullets;\n       Whereas John Hume's ideas and eloquence lit a candle in the \n     darkness of the violence in Northern Ireland, kindled an \n     increasing sense of hope in the minority community, and \n     created new possibilities for understanding between the \n     opposing sides of the conflict;\n       Whereas John Hume's community activity and involvement led \n     directly to his long and distinguished political career;\n       Whereas John Hume brought together a broad coalition of \n     leaders who advocated non-violence and together they founded \n     the Social Democratic and Labour Party in 1970, which has \n     been at the forefront of years of significant efforts to \n     achieve peace in Northern Ireland;\n       Whereas John Hume was the first to emphasize the necessity \n     of establishing an on-\n\n[[Page S1357]]\n\n     going Anglo-Irish framework as the cornerstone for \n     institutionalizing the process of reconciliation to heal the \n     divisions within Northern Ireland, between North and South in \n     Ireland, and between Great Britain and Ireland;\n       Whereas in 1983, largely as a result of the efforts of John \n     Hume, the principal political parties in Ireland and the \n     Social Democratic and Labour Party in Northern Ireland \n     established the far-reaching New Ireland Forum;\n       Whereas the New Ireland Forum developed alternatives for \n     progress and prepared the report that laid the groundwork for \n     an unprecedented new dialogue on Northern Ireland between \n     Britain and Ireland, culminating in November 1985 with the \n     signing of the historic Anglo-Irish Agreement by Prime \n     Minister Margaret Thatcher of the United Kingdom and \n     Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald of Ireland;\n       Whereas John Hume conducted talks with Gerry Adams, the \n     leader of Sinn Fein, before the Irish Republican Army agreed \n     to a cease-fire, showing great courage by taking significant \n     personal and political risks to achieve a lasting peace;\n       Whereas those talks, together with the December 1993 Joint \n     Declaration by the British and Irish Governments, led to the \n     August 1994 cease-fire by the Irish Republican Army and the \n     October 1994 cease-fire by the Loyalist paramilitaries and \n     ultimately to the Good Friday Agreement in 1998;\n       Whereas John Hume served as the Deputy Leader of the Social \n     Democratic and Labour Party in Northern Ireland until 1979, \n     and its leader from 1979 to 2001;\n       Whereas John Hume's political career has also included \n     serving as a member of the Northern Ireland Assembly, the \n     European Parliament, and the British House of Commons;\n       Whereas in his many visits to the United States, John Hume \n     has been a consistent ambassador for peace, urging the cause \n     of reconciliation and educating Congress and the country \n     about the issues in Northern Ireland;\n       Whereas John Hume is well respected in the United States \n     and has had an important influence on United States policy \n     and on the American dimension of the Northern Ireland \n     question;\n       Whereas John Hume is a courageous leader of exceptional \n     achievement and was honored for his leadership in the cause \n     of peace in Northern Ireland with the Nobel Peace Prize in \n     1998, along with the leader of the Ulster Unionist Party, \n     David Trimble;\n       Whereas respect for John Hume was the single most important \n     influence in the development of the Friends of Ireland in the \n     United States Congress and in convincing leaders of the \n     Irish-American community throughout the United States to \n     oppose political, financial, or other support for the \n     violence in Northern Ireland; and\n       Whereas John Hume is retiring this year after a long and \n     brilliant career dedicated to the people of Northern Ireland \n     and to the cause of peace: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) pays tribute to John Hume for his lifetime commitment \n     to promoting reconciliation and achieving a lasting peace in \n     Northern Ireland; and\n       (2) calls on all the parties in Northern Ireland to \n     redouble their effort to restore the trust that is necessary \n     to fully implement the Good Friday Agreement and to achieve \n     stable democratic institutions, peace, and justice in \n     Northern Ireland.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url":

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of S. Res. 51, submitted earlier \ntoday by Senator Feinstein.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 51) recognizing the importance of the \n     writings of Dashiell Hammett to American literature and \n     culture on the 75th anniversary of the first publication of \n     ``The Maltese Falcon.''\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to support passage of a \nresolution I submitted recognizing the importance of the writings of \nDashiell Hammett on the 75th anniversary of the first publication of \nThe Maltese Falcon. This novel has had a notable impact on American \nliterature and culture, as well as a profound influence on my hometown \nof San Francisco--the home of hard-boiled detective stories.\n  Dashiell Hammett's work exemplifies a unique and original American \nliterary style. Drawing upon his own experiences in detective work and \namateur sleuthing, Hammett brought realism and fact into the crime \nnovel: He did not tolerate inaccurate details, and even once wrote a \ncolumn for the New York Evening Post to note incorrect facts in others' \nworks, to aid would-be writers who were never detectives and would not \nknow the difference between an automatic pistol and a revolver.\n  The Maltese Falcon, his best-known work, one of the most historically \nsignificant crime novels in history, portrayed its protagonist, Private \nInvestigator Sam Spade, in the rough and tumble San Francisco \nunderworld of the 1920s. The novel was the third of the five published \nHammett novels. After its 1930 publication as a novel, it also appeared \nas a comic book and was syndicated in newspaper supplements. It became \na giveaway for soldiers serving during World War II. And it has been \nprinted in hundreds of editions in 50 countries and in over 30 \nlanguages.\n  It is not only in print that The Maltese Falcon has soared. Within a \nyear of its initial publication, it had already been adapted for the \nscreen in 1931, followed by a second adaptation in 1936. The final, and \nmost faithful, adaptation is the 1941 film starring Humphrey Bogart and \nMary Astor by first time director John Huston. The American Film \nInstitute rated this version as one of the top films of the twentieth \ncentury and it can be found on the countless other ``Great Films'' \nlistings.\n  Much of Dashiell Hammett's formative experience that led to his \nstories was found in San Francisco. In fact, in one of his short \nstories, ``The Scorched Face,'' some of the action takes place in a \nhouse set on the street where I lived as a child. Because of Hammett's \nworks, San Francisco is still the preferred setting for crime noir and \ndetective stories on the page and on the screen.\n  On February 14 and throughout this year, literary organizations \nacross the\n\n[[Page S1358]]\n\ncountry will be celebrating this important anniversary, including a \nlecture organized by the Center for the Book in the Library of Congress \nand cosponsored by the Mystery Writers of America, by Dr. Richard \nLayman, a literary scholar and Hammett specialist.\n  The National Council of Teachers of English, which will hold its \nannual conference in San Francisco, has invited Hammett's daughter to \npresent a lecture. The Friends of the Library USA will dedicate 891 \nPost Street, where Hammett lived when he wrote The Maltese Falcon, as a \nNational Literary Landmark, on March 19.\n  The San Francisco Public Library will also commemorate the \nanniversary with an exhibition--The Maltese Falcon at 75--of Hammett \nmemorabilia connected with the novel and will have discussions with \nHammett's granddaughter. This collection could even become a traveling \nexhibit.\n  I hope that my colleagues will join me in commemorating this \nimportant anniversary in American literary history.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the resolution \nbe agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, the motion to reconsider be \nlaid upon the table, with no intervening action or debate, and that any \nstatements relating to the resolution be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of S. Res. 52, submitted earlier \ntoday by Senator Clinton.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 52) honoring Shirley Chisholm for her \n     service to the Nation and expressing condolences to her \n     family, friends, and supporters on her death.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I add my voice to so many in New York \nand Washington who are mourning the loss of Representative Shirley \nChisholm of New York. Shirley Chisholm was a bold pioneer who fought \nfor civil rights and equality with an energy that forever changed the \nway American politics deals with matters of race and gender.\n  When she was elected to Congress in 1968, Representative Chisholm \nbecame the first African-American congresswoman. She overcame the twin \nobstacles of racism and sexism to win election. But she didn't stop \nthere. When she reached Congress she spoke with a loud, clear voice, \nand she quickly lived up to her slogan of being ``unbought and \nunbossed.'' She was a cofounder of the Congressional Black Caucus in \n1969, and she fought to improve the lives and opportunities of inner \ncity children and families. She opposed the Vietnam war and the \nmilitary draft. And she bravely declaimed the sexism and racism she \nencountered in a political world that, prior to her arrival, had been \nexclusively white and almost exclusively male.\n  Her positions on the issues and her statements about race and gender \nmade her a lightning rod for criticism. But despite the intense \npressure of being both outspoken and a ``first,'' Representative \nChisholm continued to blaze a path to greater equality. In 1972, she \nbecame the first woman to run for the Democratic Presidential \nnomination. Despite being largely ignored by the media, her committed \nrun for the Presidency, and the 152 delegates she won, proved to the \nentire country that a woman was up to the task of taking on a serious \nrun for national office.\n  Representative Chisholm was a powerful symbol, an ``historical \nperson'' as she put it. But perhaps her greatest achievement was \nreminding us that the purpose of fighting for equality is not to simply \nmake a point or become a symbol; it is to work for that day when we can \nall enjoy the quiet responsibility of being equal. As she explained in \nher 1969 speech to the House in favor of the equal rights amendment: \n``A woman who aspires to be the chairman of the board or a member of \nthe House does so for exactly the same reason as any man . . . She \nthinks she can do the job and she wants to try.''\n  Arthur Ashe said that heroism ``is not the urge to surpass all others \nat whatever cost, but the urge to serve others at whatever cost.'' \nRepresentative Chisholm was a heroine. She knew that ``there is little \nplace in the political scheme of things for an independent, creative \npersonality, for a fighter. Anyone who takes that role must pay a \nprice.'' She paid that price in order to serve Americans who were not \nbeing served by the political establishment. She fought injustice and \ndiscrimination and refused to be cowed by a history of exclusion. And \nin so doing, she served not only the constituents of her time but all \nAmericans for all times.\n  Shirley Chisholm's legacy is undeniable; 13 African-American women \nserved in the House in the 108th Congress. We are grateful for her \nlife, and we are grateful for the doors she opened and the barriers she \nbrought down on behalf of us all.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the resolution \nand preamble be agreed to en bloc, the motions to reconsider be laid \nupon the table en bloc, and that any statements relating to the \nresolution be printed in the Record, without intervening action or \ndebate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
