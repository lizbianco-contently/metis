Mr. President, like everyone else in America, we need to \ntighten our belts and learn how to do more with less. For the first \ntime in over 8 years in the Senate, we will reduce spending in an area \nof the budget known as entitlement spending--for the first time in 8 \nyears.\n  As we all know, entitlement spending represents over 54 percent of \ntotal Federal spending today. It is going to continue to grow steadily \nin the years ahead.\n  The infrequency with which this body addresses entitlement \nlegislation underscores the importance of the bill we are about to vote \nupon.\n  For the first time since 1997, this body, the Senate, is taking \naction to reduce or slow that growth in Federal entitlement spending. \nThe legislation before us today will reduce spending nearly $40 billion \nover the next 5 years. If you extrapolate that out to 10 years, it is \nabout $100 billion.\n  For some, particularly on the other side of the aisle, this \nlegislation--and I want to put that in quotation marks--``cuts too \nmuch.''\n  Let me respond by saying entitlement spending is projected to grow \nfrom $1.3 trillion to over $1.7 trillion in 2010--$1.3 trillion to over \n$1.7 trillion over the next 5 years. If you add that up, over the next \n5 years, the cumulative entitlement spending will top $7.8 trillion.\n  The bill we have before us reduces that figure, the $7.8 trillion, by \na total amount of $40 billion. That is about a half of 1 percent.\n  ``Cuts too much?''\n  Furthermore, the bill doesn't--that is why I put it in quotation \nmarks--cut entitlement spending, spending which, if we don't pass this \nbill, will grow at 5.4 percent. Once we pass this bill, it will be \nslowed to 5.4 percent. That is not a cut. The legislation, as tough as \nit has been to negotiate--and much of it has played out on the floor of \nSenate itself--reflects tremendous work over the past several months. \nIt is a small downpayment against greater challenges that confront our \ncountry in the years ahead.\n  Last week, the Congressional Budget Office issued a report entitled \n``The Long-Term Budget Outlook.'' Let me read the very first line of \nthat report.\n\n       As health care costs continue to grow faster than the \n     economy and the babyboom generation nears entitlement for \n     Social Security and Medicare, the United States faces \n     inevitable decisions about the fundamentals of its spending \n     policies and its means of financing those policies.\n\n  What it boils down to is the entitlement spending path we are on is \nsimply not sustainable. The legislation we are about to vote on is a \ngood first step on putting us back on a sustainable glidepath. But it \nis only the first step.\n  I am proud of the work on this bill to control Federal spending. I \ncongratulate the chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, Senator \nGregg, who worked nearly 9 months ago on passage of the budget \nresolution. The 2006 budget resolution that put in motion this process \nhas brought us to this point of deficit reduction in this \nreconciliation bill today. Indeed, this final conference bill exceeds \nthe goals set out last spring in that resolution by nearly $6 billion.\n  I also thank the chairmen of the reconciliation committees and the \nmany staff who have worked so hard in putting this bill together.\n  It is time we bring this year's budget process to an end with passage \nof this legislation today. With the New Year only a couple of weeks \naway, it is time for us to prepare and actually renew our focus on the \ncontinued challenges that lie ahead.\n  The bill shows fiscal restraint. It shows we are going to cut \nwasteful Washington spending. A ``yes'' vote demonstrates we are \ngoverning with meaningful solutions to ensure America's long-term \nprosperity.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Democratic leader.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/12/21/senate-section/article/S14200-8", "month": "12", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14200-S14202]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         BUDGET RECONCILIATION\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the matter now before the Senate of the \nUnited States is a budget. But it isn't a budget based on mainstream \nAmerican values; it is an ideologically driven, extreme, radical \nbudget. It caters to lobbyists and an elite group of ultraconservative \nideologues here in Washington, all at the expense of middle Americans, \nthose with the greatest of needs, and future generations.\n  I rise today to express my strong opposition to the budget \nreconciliation conference report before this body. Rather than sharing \nthe sacrifices\n\n[[Page S14201]]\n\nneeded to get this Nation's fiscal house in order, this Republican \nbudget and this legislation target ordinary Americans by cutting \nprograms such as student aid, Medicare, Medicaid--all to pay for \nanother round of budget-busting tax breaks for special interests and \nmultimillionaires. This budget is an attack on the middle class and \nthose in greatest need on behalf of lobbyists for the powerful. This \nbudget is un-American. In fact, as the leading clergy of Protestants in \nthis country has said, it is immoral.\n  It is important to consider what is happening in America today. Of \ncourse, we know there needs to be fiscal constraint in this country. We \nare spending $2 billion a day in Iraq alone. Middle-class Americans are \nbeing squeezed. Their wages have been stagnant now for several years. \nMeanwhile, their costs are increasing for everything from a visit to \nthe family physician--if, in fact, they are fortunate enough to be able \nto get in to one--to college tuition, home heating, gasoline for their \ncars. As a result, more Americans are struggling to make ends meet.\n  This administration and this Congress should be helping middle-class \nfamilies deal with these family issues. Democrats have developed a \nvariety of proposals to do so. Unfortunately, every one of our \nproposals has been repeatedly blocked by the Republican majority.\n  We are debating a reconciliation bill, the centerpiece of a \nRepublican budget that not only fails to address the middle-class \nsqueeze but makes it worse and saddles our children--my 5 children and \nmy 15 grandchildren--with billions and billions of dollars in \nadditional debt.\n  This budget which is before the Senate has a name. Every piece of \nlegislation that comes before this body has a name. The name given to \nthis piece of legislation by the Republican majority is the Budget \nDeficit Reduction Act of 2005. Try that one on. The Budget Deficit \nReduction Act of 2005. It increases the deficit of this country because \nof the tax cuts they are giving to those who don't need them by some \n$50 billion over and above these cuts. Budget Deficit Reduction Act? Is \nthat Orwellian doublespeak?\n  This legislation includes the largest student aid cut in this \nNation's history. We have read all the articles about the costs of \ncollege increasing. You go to a State university now in Nevada. They \nare considering that everyone can go to school at the University of \nNevada--Reno or UNLV--or the community college system. There were no \nbasic academic requirements. If you graduate from high school, you can \ngo to college. They are considering raising qualifications to get in \nthose schools to a B average--eliminating people like me from being \nable to go to college. That is wrong. That is what this legislation is \ndoing. A child's ability to be educated should not be dependent upon \nhow much money their parents have.\n  This legislation, instead of helping middle-class families struggling \nwith these increased burdens, simply increases their costs and makes it \neven worse for them. Rather than opening doors of opportunity to all \nAmericans, this bill will close the doors for many. Higher fees on \nstudents increase the rate of interest on student loans, weaken the \nfinancial foundation of higher education, and, I submit, weaken our \ncountry. Forcing middle-class families to pay more for college in order \nto partially pay for another fiscally irresponsible round of special \ninterest tax breaks is not fair. It is bad economic policy.\n  In today's global and high-tech economy, America's competitive edge \ndepends increasingly on our commitment to education. It used to be that \nwe could go to India and grab all the engineers and bring them here. \nIndia needs them now. We cannot do that anymore. We need to educate our \nown students. We should be increasing a commitment to educating our \nchildren. Instead, this bill goes in the opposite direction.\n  Beyond the cuts in student aid, this bill also contained harmful \nhealth care cuts that will increase costs and deny access to millions \nof Americans. For example, Part B premiums for Medicare will go up, up \nfor all seniors. Home health services are cut. I can remember 20 years \nago, I went--a physician asked me to--to Las Vegas to visit his \npatients who were in hospitals. He said: They shouldn't be here, but \nunder the rules we have, I cannot give them their medication at home. \nHe said: Think how much money this is costing the Federal Government.\n  We changed it so that people could stay home and be taken care of. We \nare changing that. We do not save money, we lose money.\n  While at the last minute the Republican leadership decided under \ncertain provisions to protect certain favored health care interests, \nthey did not provide such protections for ordinary American seniors.\n  Even more troubling than the cuts in Medicare are the cuts in \nMedicaid. Medicaid--health care for the neediest of all Americans. This \nbill targets Americans with the greatest needs and the fewest resources \nby forcing them to pay more for health care, cutting benefits, and \nmaking it harder for them to get the prescription drugs they need. Many \nof these people are hurricane survivors. We saw the huddled masses on \ntelevision. We saw them in New Orleans because of the disaster, but \nthere are many communities all over America, and the huddled masses are \nthere, also. We just did not see them on TV. What do we do to help \nthem? Nothing. Nothing.\n  Many people in America are struggling to survive. These people need \nmore help with their health care, not less. This bill cuts what little \nhealth coverage they have, if any, and increases their costs. For what? \nTo pay for another round of tax breaks for special interests, \nmultimillionaires, and billionaires. That is immoral.\n  This legislation rips and tears at Medicare and Medicaid. This bill's \ncuts to Medicare and Medicaid are largely why this legislation is \nstrongly opposed by all seniors. The largest seniors organization in \nAmerica, the American Association for Retired Persons, does not like \nthis legislation. Their chief executive officer, Bill Novelli, writes \nthe following:\n\n       The final conference agreement does not ask for shared \n     sacrifices to achieve budgetary savings. Rather it protects \n     the pharmaceutical industry, the managed care industry, and \n     other providers at the expense of low-income Medicaid \n     beneficiaries and Medicare beneficiaries who will foot this \n     bill.\n\n  That is not Senator Reid speaking, that is Bill Novelli, CEO of the \nAARP.\n  Unfortunately, this bill's Medicare and Medicaid reductions are not \nthe only cuts to this Nation's safety net. The bill cuts funding for \nchild support enforcement.\n\n  When I was a young lawyer, I went after some deadbeat dads. Oh, they \nwere hard to trap. They would move from jobs, move from towns. They \ncould always get ahead of their children. But we changed the law so \nthat now we have law enforcement provisions to go after these \ndeadbeats. My son-in-law's sister, in the District Attorney's Office in \nLas Vegas, spends her full time going after these deadbeat dads. Well, \nwe are going to cut back on this.\n  This legislation cuts foster care--foster care. Think about that. We \nall know of people who are foster parents. They have big hearts. They \nhave big needs. And we are going to cut them back.\n  This legislation cuts back programs for low-income seniors and people \nwith disabilities. I see the Senator from Illinois is in the Chamber. \nWe were together in Arizona. I don't remember the man's name, but there \nwas a man who was an Indian. He testified before us and he talked about \nhow little money he made. He was handicapped. But he worked. And he \nended his presentation by saying: I am a proud American. He had a \nlittle difficulty of speech, but it was clear what he said. There are \nmany proud Americans who are people with disabilities and low incomes. \nThey need our help. This legislation cuts the ability to help them.\n  It reduces the availability of housing for families in need. It \neliminates FHA's ability to rehabilitate housing. The legislation \nbefore this body also badly weakens the Temporary Assistance for Needy \nFamilies programs which help move low-income Americans from welfare to \nwork. There was an overwhelming bipartisan consensus in the Senate that \nwe should not change TANF in this fast track. But the Republican \nleadership ignored that and decided, in the dead of the night, to make \nthe most significant change to welfare policy in a decade.\n\n[[Page S14202]]\n\n  The bill apparently includes very expensive and unfunded new \nrequirements on States, reducing their already limited flexibility. \nMeanwhile, the legislation badly underfunds the childcare that parents \nwill need to move from welfare to work. The majority is happy to harm \nthose with the greatest needs. They have gone out of their way to \naccommodate lobbyists for special interests. For example, lobbyists for \nHMOs won a huge victory when the conferees rejected the Senate's \nproposal to eliminate the discredited HMO slush fund. Lobbyists for the \npharmaceutical industry saved the industry from adjustments in Medicaid \nrebates. And lobbyists for certain types of medical equipment won \nspecial accommodations as well.\n  All these favors for special interests should not come as a surprise. \nAfter all, that is what we have come to expect from this Congress. The \npolicies being pursued by this Congress are a corruption of our \nNation's values. How can it be that we are about to cut student loans, \nMedicare and Medicaid, and then turn around and provide even more tax \nbreaks to special interests and multimillionaires? Have they no sense \nof decency? Have they no sense of shame?\n  The capital gains and dividend tax breaks called for in the \nRepublican budget that are so important to President Bush and this \nleadership would provide almost half their benefits to those with \nincomes of more than $1 million. They will get a tax break of more than \n$30,000 a year.\n  Meanwhile, the losers won't just be the ordinary Americans who will \nsuffer cuts in student loans, Medicaid and Medicare, all Americans will \nlose because the tax breaks backed by the Republican leadership will \ncost substantially more than their spending cuts will save. As a \nresult, the deficit will go up, interest rates will rise, the economy \nwill suffer, and the burdens on our children and grandchildren will \nincrease.\n  Finally, this budget is wrong for many other reasons and in many \nother dimensions. It is wrong to target middle-class families already \nstruggling to send their kids to college. It is wrong to target \nMedicare and Medicaid, which serve seniors and Americans with the \ngreatest needs. It is wrong to use these cuts to help pay for tax \nbreaks that largely benefit those with incomes over $1 million. It is \nwrong to do all this while handing out favors to special interests and \ntheir lobbyists. And it is wrong to approve a budget that will increase \nthe deficit and burden future generations.\n  This is not a budget based on mainstream American values. It is an \nideologically driven, extreme budget that caters to lobbyists and an \nelite group of ultra-conservative ideologues in Washington, all at the \nexpense of middle-class Americans, those with the greatest needs.\n  This budget will be approved unless enough reasonable Senators on the \nother side stand up and do the right thing. I hope they will. And I \nhope we can finally persuade the leadership in this body, the \nRepublican leadership, that it is time--it is long past time--to stop \ncatering to special interests and to start putting the American people \nfirst.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/12/21/senate-section/article/S14202-1", "month": "12", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14202]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Under the previous order, the \nSenate will resume consideration of the conference report to accompany \nS. 1932, which the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       Conference report to accompany S. 1932, an act to provide \n     for reconciliation pursuant to section 202(a) of the \n     concurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal year 2006.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, there \nwill be 5 minutes each for the Senator from New Hampshire and the \nSenator from North Dakota.\n  The Senator from the great State of North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, the legislation before us suggests that it \nis deficit reduction. There are three chapters to this book on \nreconciliation. You have to read all three chapters to understand the \nmeaning of the book. The first chapter provides spending cuts of $40 \nbillion over 5 years. Those spending cuts disproportionately take from \nthose who have the least among us. Chapter 2 provides $70 billion of \ntax cuts. So the combined effect of chapters 1 and 2 is not to reduce \nthe deficit, it increases the deficit. And the tax cuts give to those \nwho have the most among us.\n  The Chaplain, in his prayer this morning, asked us to lead lives that \nwill be living sermons--lives that will be living sermons. I do not \nknow of any church that teaches to take from those who have the least \namong us to give to those who have the most among us.\n  The third chapter in this book provides for a debt limit increase of \n$781 billion--one of the largest increases in the debt of our country, \nin the history of our country.\n  This first chapter, as I have indicated, contains $40 billion of \nspending cuts over 5 years. But the second chapter will cut taxes by \n$70 billion over that same period. The net result is not deficit \nreduction; it is an increase in the deficit.\n  If we are to focus just on this first chapter, and put it into \nperspective, here is what we see: spending cuts of $40 billion. It is \nalmost indecipherable how much that is in relationship to what we will \nbe spending over the next 5 years. We will be spending $14.3 trillion \nover the next 5 years. So our colleagues on the other side have managed \nto cut one three-hundred fiftieth--one three-hundred fiftieth--of the \nspending. But then in chapter 2 they are going to come here and \neliminate that deficit reduction by the tax cuts--again, spending \nreductions from those who have the least among us to give to those who \nhave the most among us. And the extraordinary irony of all of this is \nthat all of this--if this is implemented, the budget that is being \npassed--is building a wall of debt that is unprecedented in the history \nof our country.\n  If this budget is actually implemented over the next 5 years, it will \nincrease the debt of our country from $7.9 trillion to $11.3 trillion. \nThis is not just my estimate, this is the estimate of the people who \nhave written this package.\n  This is from their own document. They say the debt of the country \nwill increase each and every year by over $600 billion. This is before \nthe baby boomers retire. If you like deficits and debt, if you want to \npass on a massive debt to our children, this is your chance. Vote for \nthis package.\n  It took 42 Presidents 224 years to run up a trillion dollars of \nexternal debt, debt held by foreigners. This President has more than \ndoubled that amount in 5 years. This is going in the wrong direction. \nThe result is, we now owe Japan over $680 billion. We owe China almost \n$250 billion. We owe the ``Caribbean Banking Centers'' more than $100 \nbillion.\n  In addition to the explosion of deficits and debt, these provisions \nin this chapter of the book are unfair to those who have the least \namong us: Medicaid cuts targeting low-income beneficiaries, child \nsupport enforcement cuts, foster care cuts, on and on it goes. The \nspending cuts are being done to make room for more tax cuts. House Ways \nand Means Committee Chairman Bill Thomas told a group of GOP lobbyists \nthe spending cuts are necessary to make room for the tax-cutting \nlegislation.\n  I will be making points of order against this bill because we believe \nthis bill has violated the rules of this body in instance after \ninstance after instance, repeated violations of the rules. At the \nappropriate time, I will bring a point of order.\n  I conclude as I began: This legislation, taken as a whole, all of the \nchapters of reconciliation, will increase the deficit and debt of our \ncountry, will have one of the largest increases in debt, $781 billion, \nin our Nation's history. In addition to that, this has the wrong \npriorities, taking from the least among us to give to those who have \nthe most among us. That is wrong.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. What is the time situation?\n\n[[Page S14203]]\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New Hampshire has \n5 minutes.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, every so often in this body--and it is \nquite rare--we come to a point where a vote must be cast in order to \ndetermine whether the words you speak are going to be complied with. \nThat is this vote. All of us in this Congress tend to talk about fiscal \nresponsibility. We all are concerned about our children and the type of \nNation we are going to leave them. We know that because of the \nretirement of the baby boom generation, our children will face huge \nfinancial stress from the costs of Government. We know that we have on \nthe books approximately $44 to $55 trillion of unfunded liability in \nthe area of Medicaid, Medicare, and Social Security accounts that \nbenefit seniors. That huge number is a result of the fact that there is \na huge generation about to retire called the postwar baby boom \ngeneration.\n  The question for us, as stewards of this Nation and as stewards of \nour children and our grandchildren's future, is whether we are going to \npass on to them this type of debt or whether we are going to step on to \nthe turf of trying to address that issue before it overwhelms us. \nWhether our children have an opportunity to live as good as our \ngeneration has, to send their children to college, to own a home, to be \nable to live in an America which is prosperous, will be determined by \nwhether we, as a government, are responsible in what debt and \nobligations we pass on to them.\n  For 8 years, we have ignored this problem. Today we have an \nopportunity to address it. This will be the first time that this \nCongress in 8 years has stepped onto the turf, put our toe in the \nwater--actually, we are going up to our ankles--to address the issue of \nfuture responsibilities and how we control the spending of the Federal \nGovernment in the outyears.\n  We have addressed the issues on the appropriations side, \ndiscretionary spending, but we have refused, over the last 8 years, to \naddress the issue of mandatory spending or entitlement programs. This \nis not a major step forward. I wish it was bigger. The Senator from \nNorth Dakota held up charts which show how unfortunate it is in its \nsize, that it is not larger. He has pointed out that it is $40 billion \non $14 trillion of spending. He calls that one three hundred fiftieth \nof a percent. It is actually about a half a percent of the spending \nduring that period. But the point is, if we do not proceed at this \ntime, if we do not go forward, it is still going to be $40 billion of \ndebt that we pass on to our children. That is what this vote is about.\n  It is not about the tax issue. This isn't a tax bill. It is not about \nthe debt issue in the sense that it is not the debt extension vote. It \nis the one vote that we will have as a Congress to try to control the \noutyear debt of this country through restraining spending. It will be \nthe first time that we have stepped forward on the issue of one of the \nmajor entitlements, specifically Medicaid. We don't do a great deal on \nthe numbers side of Medicaid. I wish we had done a lot more, and I \ntried to do a lot more. But we do take significant steps in the area of \npolicy, on how we address Medicaid by essentially taking what the \nGovernors have proposed, in a bipartisan approach, and putting that \nlanguage into this bill to give the Governors more flexibility as to \nhow they deliver Medicaid in the States, thus allowing them to deliver \nmore services to more people at less of a rate of growth.\n\n  That is reflected in this chart. We can see that dedicated spending \nis going to go up 40 percent under this bill. It would go up 40 percent \nunder the law, generally. We essentially reduce the rate of growth, not \ndramatically, but we put in place policies which will allow us to \nimprove the system and care for more children more effectively.\n  This is it, folks. This is the only chance we are going to have this \nyear. It is the only chance in the last 8 years to actually step \nforward and do something about deficit spending on the entitlement \nside.\n  This is our responsibility to our children. We should pass this bill, \nor else we should ask ourselves what type of public policy are we \npursuing and what type of stewards are we of our children's future. \nThis is the one vote we will have to reduce the rate of growth of the \nFederal Government.\n  I believe we have now used the 5 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. GREGG. On both sides?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. GREGG. I ask unanimous consent that as we debate the issue of \npoints of order, which the Senator from North Dakota is going to make, \nwe have 4 minutes on both sides.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Has the Senator yielded?\n  Mr. GREGG. Yes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, could the Chair advise us, what is the \nparliamentary circumstance we confront? My understanding is I am to be \nrecognized to make a point of order at this point.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, this bill contains many violations of the rules. We \nare here because the majority insisted on ramming through bad \nlegislation at the last moment with little or no public scrutiny. This \n774-page bill was written behind closed doors with no input from the \nminority. It was filed in the dead of night and voted on in the House \nat the crack of dawn. Then House Members left town.\n  Let's remember that reconciliation is a special parliamentary process \nthat allows legislation to be passed with fast-track procedures that \nrestrict a Senator's right to debate and amend. Because of these fast-\ntrack procedures, the Byrd rule was adopted to prohibit extraneous, \nnonbudget-related provisions from being included.\n  The points of order that I am raising are all violations of the Byrd \nrule. I now raise these three points of order:\n  One, striking the Medicaid medical liability provision, which allows \nhospitals to deny treatment to low-income individuals who are unable to \npay. Not only is the majority raising copayments on low-income Medicaid \nbeneficiaries, but they are shielding hospitals from medical liability \nif they refuse to treat those low-income people who are unable to pay. \nThat is wrong.\n  Two, striking the foster care provision that would prohibit \ngrandparents from receiving foster care payments. The conference report \nincludes a provision to overturn a Ninth Circuit Court case that \nallowed grandparents with limited incomes to receive foster care \npayments when parenting vulnerable children. That is as mean spirited \nas it is ill-conceived. We know that placing foster kids with their \ngrandparents puts them in the most stable and healthy environment. \nProhibiting support for grandparents who take in foster children is \nwrong.\n  Three, I am also raising points of order against reports focusing on \npolicy matters that do not belong in a reconciliation bill. These \nreports have no budgetary effect whatsoever and should not be here.\n  I hope my colleagues will support these points of order so we can \nsend this bill back to House. Let's use this opportunity to create a \nbetter product for the American people.\n  Mr. President, I raise the point of order pursuant----\n  Mr. GREGG. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Let me conclude first.\n  Mr. GREGG. My question is whether I should make my statement before \nthe Senator makes the point of order.\n  Mr. CONRAD. That is fine.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, the Senator from North Dakota has been \ncooperative and very fair, as he always has been when proceeding on \nthese bills. He is a true professional. I know the Chair has been \nadvised as to what the four points of order are.\n  I have a parliamentary inquiry: Does the Chair deem the foster care \npoint of order to be well taken if that question is put to the Chair?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Chair does not believe that \nparticular point of order is well taken.\n  Mr. GREGG. Basically, if I may continue, we would be dealing with \nthree points of order as being well taken if they are put to the Chair?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. That is correct.\n\n[[Page S14204]]\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, might I inquire, on the other three points \nof order that I have raised, would the Chair rule that those points of \norder are in fact in order and appropriate?\n  Mr. GREGG. Not at this time is the question.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Yes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. When it is time, under the rule, \nthe Chair will in fact so rule.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank the Chair. I thank my colleague. We have worked \nin a professional and cooperative way. I thank the Chairman for his \ninquiry.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, the Democratic leader on the bill has every \nright to make a point of order. Clearly, the Chair will rule they are \nwell taken. Let's talk about the substance quickly.\n  They are essentially technical points of order. Two deal with reports \nand the other with an issue of liability which is very narrow, dealing \nwith what people are told when they come into an emergency room. \nEssentially, the practical effect of doing these technical attacks on \nthis bill will be that the bill must go back to the House of \nRepresentatives and the House of Representatives is going to agree and \nknock that language out. But the House is not here.\n  So what is the real practical effect of this? It is that the Katrina \nmoney in this bill will not be spent. The TANF Program, the welfare \nprogram, will lapse. The Medicare physicians payments increase, which \nbasically makes Medicare physicians whole, will not occur. Transitional \nmedical assistance for families who worked their way off welfare will \nbe lost. And the therapy caps for seniors who suffer strokes will be \nlost during this interim period.\n  Why would we want to do that simply to go through a technical \nexercise? It makes no sense at all, other than the fact that the other \nside of the aisle wants to delay the process. But in the process of \ndelaying for purely technical reasons--I mean, two reports are being \nchallenged. We get thousands of reports in this institution. To delay \nthe Katrina benefits for the people in the gulf coast region who have \nsuffered is outrageous, over two reports.\n  To potentially stop welfare payments for up to a month because the \nHouse cannot get back here is outrageous, over two reports. To stop \ntransitional medical assistance is outrageous, over two reports. To say \nnothing of the other reports. I realize if we don't enact this bill by \nthe end of this year, there are $18 billion worth of subsidies that are \ngoing to flow to corporate lenders which are totally inappropriate, \nwhich the HELP Committee has said we have to stop. But those subsidies \nwill go to those lenders. The money will potentially be lost, and that \nmoney that was going to be used to reduce debt and give students more \nloans will be lost, potentially, unless we get this bill done by the \nend of the year.\n  We have serious issues that have to be addressed. They should not be \ntied up over technicalities. That is what these points of order are \nabout.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I support the point of order raised by \nSenator Conrad on the budget reconciliation bill. Under the Byrd rule, \nany provisions in a final budget reconciliation bill that are \nextraneous to changing the budget can be stricken. Section 6043, the \nemergency room copayments for non-emergency care provisions, clearly \nviolates the Byrd rule.\n  Section 6043 makes far-reaching policy changes never debated in the \nSenate that have no place in a budge reconciliation bill. Although the \nprovision makes major changes to Medicaid, the Emergency Medical \nTreatment and Labor Act, EMTALA, and even State medical malpractice \nliability policy, it only generates net savings of $11 million over 5 \nyears, one-tenth of a percent of the original budget target.\n  Section 6043 allows States to impose new higher costs for Medicaid \npatients seeking emergency room care and allows hospitals to turn \npatients away if they cannot pay when the hospital says there is no \nemergency. Under current law, Medicaid requires hospitals to provide \naccess to emergency care when it is medically needed. In fact, Medicaid \nHMOs are required to cover care in cases where the individual \nreasonably believes there is an emergency, even when no emergency \nexists. And Federal law requires hospitals to screen and stabilize \npatients regardless of their ability to pay.\n  Section 6043 turns current law on its head. It will deter emergency \nroom use by Medicaid beneficiaries and make it harder to enforce the \nFederal guarantee of access to emergency care for all.\n  The provision also includes language that makes it harder for \npatients to sue hospitals and doctors for poor treatment decisions \nabout whether they need emergency care. This language would tip the \nburden of proof from a ``preponderance of the evidence'' to a ``clear \nand convincing'' evidence standard. The ``preponderance'' standard is \nthe usual standard in State medical malpractice claims. It is a \nstandard that strikes the balance between the patient and the provider. \nThe ``clear and convincing'' standard tips the burden of proof toward \nthe patient and makes it more difficult for a patient to prove his or \nher claim.\n  Similarly, the provision also changes the standard of liability from \nthe usual State standard of ``negligence'' to a heightened standard of \n``gross negligence.'' It is more difficult for a patient to prove \n``gross negligence'' than ``negligence.'' Thus, the language changes \nthe standard of liability to impose greater burdens on the injured \npatient and less accountability for the providers. This actually makes \nan end run around State medical malpractice liability law, lowering the \nstandard of liability.\n  Neither State medical malpractice law nor EMTALA standards were the \nsubject of this bill. Neither was discussed in the Senate, even though \nboth are of great concern to many in the Senate. This provision was \nnever discussed or considered at any point in the Senate debate, in \ncommittee or on the floor. It was omitted from the Senate version.\n  Given this section's extremely small pricetag and its oversize policy \neffect, this provision is ripe for exclusion under the Byrd rule. For \nthese reasons, I support Senator Conrad's point of order to strike \nsection 6043.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. There is 1 minute 29 seconds.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, some of these matters are technical \nmatters. But we have rules in this body for a reason. This legislation \nhas many violations of the rules. I have chosen a few to raise today. \nWhy? Because, colleagues, we could be voting all day on my points of \norder against this bill. I have tried to reduce it to one vote to \naccommodate colleagues. I could be here raising 12 or 15 points of \norder and ask for a vote on every single one of them. I have not done \nthat. Yes, some of these matters are technical, but they are because we \nhave rules.\n  I would say that the question of Medicaid liability is not a \ntechnicality. This is a question that allows hospitals to deny \ntreatment to low-income individuals who are unable to pay. Not only is \nthe majority raising copayments on low-income Medicaid beneficiaries, \nbut they are shielding hospitals from medical liability if they refuse \nto treat those low-income people who are unable to pay. That is wrong.\n  Let me just say, on the foster care matter, we have a difference with \nthe Parliamentarian. I believe there is a violation.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Again, I believe the foster care question that prohibits \ngrandparents from receiving foster care payments is also well taken, \nbut we understand there is a difference.\n  I raise the point of order pursuant to section 313(b)(1)(A) of the \nCongressional Budget Act of 1974 against section 5001(b)(3) and section \n5001(b)(4) of the conference report because those provisions of title V \nregarding Medicaid produce no budgetary changes in outlays or revenues; \nand pursuant to section 313(b)(1)(D) of the Congressional Budget Act of \n1974 against section 7404 regarding foster care, and the portion of \nsection 6043 beginning on page 92, line 19, through page 93, line 2, \nwhich relates to the negligent standard for hospitals and physicians \nwho treat Medicaid patients because any changes in outlays or revenues \nassociated with those two provisions are merely incidental to the \nnonbudgetary components of those provisions.\n  I hope my colleagues will vote to sustain this point of order.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I move to waive section 313 of the \nCongressional\n\n[[Page S14205]]\n\nBudget Act for consideration of sections 5001(b)(3), 5001(b)(4), and \nthe relevant sections of 6043 of the conference report to accompany S. \n1932.\n  I understand the Chair is going to rule that the fourth point of \norder relative to foster care is not well taken.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there a sufficient second? There \nis a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  The yeas and nays resulted--yeas 52, nays 48, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 362 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--52\n\n     Alexander\n     Allard\n     Allen\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Burr\n     Chambliss\n     Coburn\n     Cochran\n     Coleman\n     Collins\n     Cornyn\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     DeMint\n     DeWine\n     Dole\n     Domenici\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Frist\n     Graham\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Hatch\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Isakson\n     Kyl\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     Martinez\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Murkowski\n     Roberts\n     Santorum\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Sununu\n     Talent\n     Thomas\n     Thune\n     Vitter\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n\n                                NAYS--48\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Byrd\n     Cantwell\n     Carper\n     Chafee\n     Clinton\n     Conrad\n     Corzine\n     Dayton\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Harkin\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     Mikulski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Obama\n     Pryor\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Rockefeller\n     Salazar\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Smith\n     Snowe\n     Stabenow\n     Wyden\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Martinez). On this vote, the yeas are 52, \nthe nays are 48. Three-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn not \nhaving voted in the affirmative, the motion is rejected.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, am I recorded?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recorded.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, could we have order in the Chamber?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chamber will please be in order. Senators \nwill please take their conversations off the floor.\n  The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, it is my understanding I would now have \nthe right to offer a second point of order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The unanimous consent agreement did authorize \nthat.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Has the Chair ruled on the point of order?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair is about to do so.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, the Chair is about to rule on the points of \norder which were just offered, is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Correct. The point of order is sustained \nagainst section 5001(b)(3), section 5001(b)(4), and that portion of \nsection 6043(a) proposing a new subsection (e)(4) to section 1916A of \nthe Social Security Act as added by section 6041 and as amended by \nsection 6042 of this act. The point of order is not sustained against \nsection 7404.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank the Chair. I now ask if it is in order that I \nwould offer a second point of order under the unanimous consent \nagreement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The unanimous consent agreement did so \nauthorize.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, colleagues, I see no need to ask \ncolleagues to cast another vote. Therefore, I will withhold on the \nsecond point of order and we could go right to passage of the \nreconciliation conference report.\n  Mr. GREGG. I suggest that is a good approach.\n\n\n                           ty8rd-party payors\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise to engage the chairman of the Finance \nCommittee in colloquy regarding clarification of some Medicaid \nprovisions relating to strengthening the government's ability to \nidentify and collect payment from liable third party payors.\n  Under current law, Medicaid is the payor of last resort. In general, \nfederal law requires available third parties must meet their legal \nobligation to pay claims before the Medicaid program pays for the care \nof an individual.\n  The conference report amends the list of third parties named in \nsection 1902(a)(25) of the Social Security Act for which States must \ntake all reasonable measures to ascertain the legal liability to \ninclude, among others, pharmacy benefits managers.\n  Once only the back office to health plans, employers, and State \ngovernments, pharmacy benefit managers have expanded their business \nmodel to include serving as risk-bearing entities under the Medicare \nPart D program.\n  I would like to clarify that the addition of pharmacy benefit \nmanagers to the definition of liable third parties is in the instance \nwhen they are at risk for the underlying benefit, such as operating as \na plan sponsor for purposes of providing health benefits or as a \nriskbearing entity under the new Medicare Part D program as a stand-\nalone PDP. This addition is not meant to make pharmacy benefit managers \nliable when they are acting merely in an administrative capacity on \nbehalf of a liable third party.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I thank the Senator from Missouri. Yes, I want to \nclarify the intent is not to create an additional liability where none \nexists today. Pharmacy benefit managers mayor may not be liable third \nparties. It is dependent upon whether they are ultimately responsible \nfor the payment of a claim. It is my understanding that the health plan \nor employer contracting with the pharmacy benefit manager is ultimately \nat risk for the underlying claim, so it is my belief this will not \ncreate new liability for the pharmacy benefit manager.\n  Mr. BOND. I thank the Chairman.\n\n\n  Bona Fide Services--Clarifying the Treatment of Distributor Service \n       Fees under the New Medicaid Pharmacy Reimbursement Metric\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I again commend Chairman Grassley for the \nleadership role he has taken in crafting much needed reductions in the \nmandatory spending programs that fall under his jurisdiction as \nchairman of the Senate Finance Committee. Regarding the changes to the \nMedicaid pharmacy reimbursement formula, we both share a strong \ncommitment to ensuring that the Federal dollar is spent in a wise and \nproper manner while maintaining patient access to their medicines.\n  I do want to take this opportunity to clarify specifically how bona \nfide services fees, which are negotiated between a manufacturer and \npharmaceutical distributor, should be treated under the new Medicaid \npharmacy reimbursement metric.\n  Manufacturers pay bona fide service fees for specific services \nprovided by the distributor. Service fees are a relatively new business \nmodel to the pharmaceutical distribution industry and how they should \nbe treated under Federal reimbursement programs first came into \nquestion as the new Average Sales Price, ASP, metric under the Medicare \nModernization Act was being implemented. I am pleased to note that \nCongress specifically did not include service fees as a price \nconcession to be incorporated into the ASP calculation and CMS \nsubsequently confirmed that, ``Bona fide service fees that are paid by \na manufacturer to an entity, that represent fair market value for bona-\nfide service provided by the entity, and are not passed on in whole or \nin part to a client or customer of the entity should not be included in \nthe calculation of ASP.''\n  In light of this, I wanted to make it clear that it was not the \nChairman's intent to have manufacturers include such bona fide services \nfees in the new Medicaid pharmacy reimbursement equation.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. The Senator from Mississippi is correct. It was not the \nintent of the conferees to suggest that by dropping bona fide services \nfees from the final agreement that those service fees should be \nincluded in the calculation of the Medicaid Average Manufacturer Price, \nAMP, based reimbursement methodology as established in the pharmacy \nreimbursement provisions of the conference agreement.\n  I thank my colleague from Mississippi for seeking this clarification.\n\n[[Page S14206]]\n\n                  continued dumping Subsidy offset act\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I rise to commend Chairman Gregg on his \nleadership regarding the Deficit Reduction Act. The Budget Committee \nhas had to make hard decisions and has labored to do so fairly. I have \nseen first-hand and appreciate the Chairman's dedication to the \nintegrity of this process.\n  On behalf of myself and Senator Burns, I would like to state for the \nrecord our understanding of the effect of the language in the bill \nregarding repeal of the Continued Dumping Subsidy Offset Act CDSOA.\n  We understand that the bill requires distribution of all antidumping \nand countervailing duties finally determined, ultimately assessed on \nany and all imports of merchandise that are entered, or withdrawn from \nwarehouse, for consumption by the deadline of October 1, 2007.\n  Further, we understand that liquidation or assessment of duties need \nnot occur prior to the deadline of October 1, 2007, as a condition of \ndistribution and that the duties ultimately assessed will be \ndistributed regardless of the date on which they are finally determined \nand collected.\n  In other words, while appeals to U.S. courts or NAFTA panels or other \nproceedings at administrative agencies may prevent final assessment and \ncollection of the duties owed until after the deadline of October 1, \n2007, so long as the imports are entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, \nfor consumption by that date, the duties ultimately assessed will be \ndistributed annually under the processes currently specified in law.\n  Finally, we understand that subsection (b) specifies that the CDSOA \nshall operate ``as if'' there had been no repeal; meaning that Customs \nwill maintain all existing aspects of the program codified at 19 U.S.C. \nSec. 1675c, and contained in accompanying regulations, including all \naccounting procedures, all administrative and other mechanisms, and all \ninfrastructure in place to collect, account for, track, and distribute \nduties on merchandise entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for \nconsumption by the deadline of October 1, 2007. And at all times we \nwould expect that collections of duties are to be pursued aggressively \nby U.S. Customs and Border Protection.\n  Mr. FRIST. It is my understanding that my colleague is correct in his \ninterpretation of the language agreed to by the conferees. In essence, \nthe Continued Dumping Subsidy Offset Act will remain in effect for all \nimports of merchandise that are entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, \nfor consumption by the deadline of October 1, 2007. However, duties \ncollected on products entering on or after October 1, 2007, will be \ndeposited with the U.S. Treasury. Since the WTO has declared the CDSOA \nas putting us out of compliance with our WTO obligations, other nations \nhave begun to retaliate against our exports. This will bring us into \ncompliance with that ruling and hopefully will bring to an end the \nsanctions U.S. companies are currently facing.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I thank the leader for that clarification and I appreciate \nall of his hard work in reaching this compromise language.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise today in support of S. 1932, the \nDeficit Reduction Act of 2005, but I want to take a few minutes to \ndiscuss a specific aspect of that bill--the reauthorization of the \nwelfare reform law. As many of my colleagues have heard me say, I \nbelieve the 1996 welfare reform law is one of the great legislative \nsuccesses during my time in the U.S. Senate. Since the bi11's \nenactment, welfare caseloads have been cut in half, more than 7 million \nindividuals and 2 million families have exchanged a welfare check for a \npaycheck, and welfare reform has lifted 2.3 million children out of \npoverty.\n  We must build upon this success to move the 2 million families that \nremain on welfare into the workforce by ending the Practice of simply \nextending the program and passing a legislative reauthorization of the \nwelfare reform law. On January 24, 2005, I introduced S.6, the MORE \nAct, that included a reauthorization of TANF. A bipartisan \nreauthorization bill, S. 667, passed the Senate Finance Committee with \nmy support on March 9, 2005. While I continue to believe that such \nreauthorization would have been best suited by moving the Senate \nFinance Committee reported bill, S. 667, under regular order; we \nunfortunately have been unable to reach an agreement with our \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle to bring this bill to the \nfloor.\n  After over 3 years of trying to move forward on this reauthorization, \nour colleagues in the House have included TANF reauthorization in their \nbudget reconciliation bill. Going into this process, I was concerned \nthat some provisions in the House legislation regarding work hours, \nparticipation rates, child support enforcement and access to child care \ndid not strike the appropriate balance needed to meet the needs of \nthese families as they strive to move from welfare to work. I was \npleased that the House had included provisions to encourage healthy \nmarriages, promote responsible fatherhood, and support strong families. \nAt the end of the day, the Deficit Reduction Act is not my preferred \nvehicle, but I am glad we are making some improvements in the program \nwithout upsetting the necessary balance.\n  The conference report reauthorizes the welfare program--the Temporary \nAssistance for Needy Families program or TANF--through fiscal year 2010 \nat its current funding level of $16.9 billion annually. The bill \nprovides an additional $1 billion for child care over 5 years for a \ntotal of $2.917 billion annually. While I understand and have heard \nfrom many that they want a higher amount for child care, this bill will \nincrease the investment in child care for working families by $1 \nbillion, and if we don't do this bill there will be no increase in \nchild care at all. It is important to get this increase done this year.\n  I am very pleased that the conference report provides $100 million \nannually for healthy marriage promotion, and $50 million annually for \nthe promotion of responsible fatherhood. The need for these programs is \nclear. Children growing up in married, two-parent homes are less likely \nto be victims of abuse, engage in high risk behaviors, and suffer from \nemotional problems. Children who live absent their biological fathers \nare, on average, five times more likely to be poor, and at least two to \nthree times more likely to use drugs, to experience educational, \nhealth, emotional and behavioral problems, to be victims of child \nabuse, and to engage in criminal behavior than their peers who live \nwith both parents.\n\n  However the benefits are also clear. Married families are 5 times \nless likely to be in poverty than are single-parent families. Adults \nbenefit from marriage through lower mortality rates, better health, \ngreater financial well-being, less suicide, greater happiness, and \nsuffer less violence by intimate partners. Children with involved, \nloving fathers are significantly more likely to do well in school, have \nhealthy self-esteem, exhibit empathy and pro-social behavior, and avoid \nhigh-risk behaviors such as drug use, truancy, and criminal activity \ncompared to children who have uninvolved fathers. These grants can be \nused to provide information on the value of marriage, conflict \nresolution, relationship skills and financial management. Increasing \nhealthy two-parent marriages is a proven means to reduce poverty and \nimprove child well-being.\n  This conference report also makes modest changes in the \nimplementation of the TANF program. First, it updates work \nparticipation rates. The 1996 Welfare Reform Act, P.L. 104-193, \ncontemplated that all states would meet a 50-percent participation rate \nby 2002. Because the current caseload reduction credit is based on the \n1995 caseload level, most States--including my home State of \nPennsylvania--have an actual participation rate standard of zero. \nStates currently achieve their credit because of their ability to count \na decade-old caseload decline. The conference report updates the credit \nto the more relevant date of 2005, thereby ensuring that the intent of \nthe 1996 welfare reform act is realized.\n  The bill also closes a loophole on work participation rates. To avoid \nhaving to meet caseload requirements, some states set up separate \nprograms and moved their harder-to-place clients to those programs to \navoid the work requirements. The bill removes the ability to game the \nsystem by including these separate state programs in the work \ncalculation, closing a loophole.\n\n[[Page S14207]]\n\n  I have seen a number of reports that indicate that this bill changes \nwork requirements, narrows what is considered work, et cetera. I want \nto be clear that this bill maintains the current work requirements. The \nbill does not change the current-law standard of 30 hours and maintains \nthe separate 20-hour standard for adults with a child six years of age \nand under. It also maintains current-law activities that count as work, \nincluding allowing 12 months for education and training. The measure \nleaves it to the states to determine whether activities may be counted \nas work activities, and how to count and verify reported hours of work.\n  I have heard a number of my colleagues say that this bill ``cuts'' \nmoney from child support enforcement. I hope they go back and read the \nbill. The changes in child support actually increase child support \nenforcement and gets support to the families. The conference report \nincludes provisions that increase States' ability to improve child \nsupport collection. Under current law, much of the child support that \nis owed to families on welfare is assigned to the State. The conference \nagreement would allow $423 million owed to families on welfare and \nthose who have left welfare to go directly to those families--a \nsignificant improvement over current law.\n  The supposed ``cut'' is a restoration of the current state-matching \nrequirement. Currently, States are required to match certain Federal \nfunds with state funds, showing a State investment in the child support \nenforcement program. However, States have been taking Federal funds \nfrom one grant and then using them as the ``Federal'' matching funds \nrather than using State funds. The conference report prevents States \nfrom ``double dipping'' by using Federal funds to draw down additional \nmatching federal funds for child support enforcement.\n  Additionally, the conference report provides $100 million for grants \nto ensure that the safety, permanence and well-being needs of children \nare met in a timely manner. The funds may also be used for the training \nof judges, attorneys, and other legal personnel in child welfare cases.\n  The measure also provides an increase of $200 million for the Safe \nand Stable Families program. The purpose of this program is to enable \nStates to develop, expand or operate coordinated programs of community-\nbased family support services for family preservation services, family \nreunification services, and adoption promotion.\n  A number of organizations may have misunderstood the changes relating \nto the alleged ``cuts'' in foster care. There are two provisions \nrelating to foster care that might have led to this misperception, so \nlet me speak on them for a minute.\n  First, the conference agreement restores long-standing foster care \neligibility criteria relating to the Rosales v. Thompson decision. That \ndecision from the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals broadened eligibility \nfor Federal foster care benefits to include almost every child in \nfoster care in the nine affected States--California, Oregon, \nWashington, Arizona, Montana, Idaho, Nevada, Alaska and Hawaii--instead \nof only children removed from low-income homes that TANF is intended to \nhelp. The conference agreement again ensures the same policy applies \nnationwide. As this decision did not apply in Pennsylvania, this change \ndoes not affect my home State.\n  Second, the bill limits the amount of administrative expenses when \nStates are slow to place children in safe and suitable situations. I \nshould be clear that this proposal does not reduce foster care benefits \nbecause the funds in question do not support payments to families. \nInstead, the proposal addresses how much Federal funding States may \nclaim to operate their foster care programs and under what \ncircumstances Federal funding may be claimed. Current law requires the \nplacement of a child in a licensed foster family home or a child care \ninstitution as a condition of eligibility for federal foster care \nmaintenance payments. As part of meeting this duty, States may make \ncertain administrative claims on behalf of ``candidates'' for federal \nfoster care. ``Candidates'' are children who have not been removed from \ntheir homes but are at imminent risk of removal.\n  The proposal allows the State to claim Federal administrative funds \nfor up to 12 months while children are ``candidates'' for Federal \nfoster care and the State is working to license the home as safe and \nappropriate for the child. In January 2005, the Department of Health \nand Human Services, HHS, issued a proposed regulation making this \nchange. So States have been on notice that this issue was of concern \nfor almost a year. Fourteen States have indicated that they would be \naffected by the proposed regulation; however Pennsylvania was not one \nof those States.\n  In summary, millions of our fellow citizens have replaced the \ndependency on government handouts with the dignity and opportunity of \nwork. Children and families will now have opportunities to strengthen \ntheir families through programs to support marriage and responsible \nfatherhood. Thousands of children will have access to childcare through \nthe $1 billion in new funding. And we have strengthened our child \nwelfare programs. On balance, I think the reconciliation bill, as it \nrelates to welfare reform, is a step in the right direction. I remain \ncommitted to ensuring that work remains a gateway to opportunity for \nall Americans and urge my colleagues to support passage of S. 1932, the \nDeficit Reduction Act of 2005.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I once again rise to reluctantly, but \nadamantly, oppose the budget reconciliation bill before us today. I say \nreluctantly because the Senate ought to use the reconciliation \nprocedure for the purposes for which it was intended: making difficult \nchoices to reduce spending. We have an obligation to bring our Nation's \nbudget back into balance so we don't saddle future generations with \nendless debt and economic ruin. However, this budget fails on every \nlevel to achieve this goal. And even worse, the budget cuts that this \nbill does make fall squarely on lower-income Americans who can least \nafford them.\n  One provision in this conference agreement that I support relates to \nextension of the Milk Income Lost Contract, MILC, program. MILC, which \nexpired at the end of the last fiscal year, provides countercyclical \nsupport for the Nation's dairy sector. It is targeted. It is fair. It \nis essential. Moreover, it enjoys the President's support. It makes \nsense as part of the balanced Agriculture package in this bill.\n  But even this one bright spot is not enough to save this bill or the \nbudget plan of which it is a part. This bill is just one piece of a \nfraudulent, fiscally, and morally bankrupt budget which I cannot \nendorse. While the conference agreement we are now voting on cuts \nalmost $40 billion in spending, waiting in the wings is a tax-cut bill \nthat will likely cost more than $70 billion in tax cuts for the \nwealthy. The math simply doesn't add up. You can't pass a bill to cut \nspending by $40 billion and follow it up with a tax bill that will cost \nmore than $70 billion and claim you are reducing the deficit it's \nsimply untrue and irresponsible.\n  I am willing to make the hard choices to bring our budget deficit \ndown, but this conference agreement does not reflect our Nation's \npriorities. I cannot support taking vital services away from families \nthat need them the most--and use those cuts as a fig leaf to hide tax \nbreaks for those who need them the least.\n  I am particularly disappointed that the House and Senate conference \ncommittee has come back with an agreement that is actually worse than \nthe original Senate-passed bill. This so-called compromise causes more \nharm to low-income Americans while shielding powerful special \ninterests, such as pharmaceutical companies and the managed care \nindustry, from any sacrifice.\n  This conference report achieves much of its savings by requiring low-\nincome Medicaid beneficiaries to pay more out-of-pocket for health \ncare, and taking away health care services for which many beneficiaries \nare currently covered. Even more egregious, negotiators dropped a \ncommon-sense provision in the Senate-passed bill that would have saved \nbillions of dollars by eliminating a slush fund for private insurance \ncompanies in the Medicare prescription drug program.\n  This bill before us also fails our Nation's students who are \nstruggling to pay for college. Student loans help to\n\n[[Page S14208]]\n\nensure that every student in America can choose higher education \nregardless of his or her financial or social background. These programs \nare an investment in our future and an investment in a diverse, \neducated population who will lead this country in the 21st century.\n  At a time of rising tuition costs, this conference report would \nactually make college less affordable. It would establish a fixed \ninterest rate instead of maintaining today's lower variable rates--\nleaving the typical student borrower, who has $17,500 in student loan \ndebt, having to pay up to an additional $5,800 in order to repay his or \nher college loans. It is simply unacceptable to make the largest raid \non the student aid program in history at a time when millions of \nfamilies are struggling to keep up with skyrocketing tuition costs. And \nit is inexcusable to do this in order to pay for tax breaks for the \nwealthiest in our society.\n  I urge my colleagues to reject this bill--and the irresponsible and \ncruel budget of which it is a part. It does not reflect the right \nbudget priorities, and it certainly does not reflect the values of \nAmerican families. And adding insult to injury, these harmful cuts will \nnot even help our country dig its way out of a large and growing budget \ndeficit. This bill will soon be combined with tax breaks for the \nwealthiest Americans that exceed, by tens of billions of dollars, the \nvalue of the cuts themselves, and leave our fiscal situation in even \nworse shape than before. We should reject this reckless budget plan and \ninstead work to make the responsible choices that the American people \nexpect.\n\n\n                        expiring tax provisions\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, the Senate is wrapping up legislative \nbusiness shortly, but there are a few expiring tax provisions that have \nunfortunately not been extended yet. Chief among them is the protection \nfrom the onerous alternative minimum tax, or AMT. Both the higher \nexemption level and the protection for personal nonrefundable credits \nexpire on December 31, and because of this, 17 million taxpayers face a \ntax increase next year if we fail to act. Further, a great number of \nU.S. businesses rely on important tax credits, such as the research and \ndevelopment tax credit and the work opportunity tax credit, both of \nwhich expire at the end of the year. This is not the first time this \nunfortunate situation has occurred, but it is my hope and intention \nthat as soon as the Senate reconvenes next year, that we would take up \nthese items and ensure that they are extended without any intervening \nlapse. Is that also the intention of my good friend from Iowa, Chairman \nGrassley?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I thank you, Senator Baucus for raising the issue. \nProviding relief from the alternative minimum tax for millions of \nAmerican families is critically important. The alternative minimum tax \nis badly in need of reform and I know he is anxious to work with me on \nthat important task. Until such time, we must provide annual relief to \nprevent further expansion of that tax's reach. I was proud that we were \nable to accomplish that objective as part of the tax reconciliation \nbill that passed the Finance Committee and the Senate at the end of \nNovember. I remain committed to seeing that AMT relief enacted into \nlaw. In addition, we should act quickly on other expiring tax \nprovisions to provide simplification and certainty for individuals and \nbusinesses, alike.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I thank the Chairman for his statement. I look forward to \nworking with him to pass legislation as quickly as possible to provide \na seamless extension of these provisions. This will ensure the fewest \ndisruptions for taxpayers and administrative problems for the IRS.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to express my support for the \nbudget reconciliation bill conference report. As I have stated here \nduring the different stages of debate on this year's budget, the most \nnotable thing about this reconciliation bill is not the size of the \nreduction of the spending growth but rather the fact that it \neffectively takes the foot off the accelerator of spending growth and \nbegins to touch on the brakes.\n  But to get us there, the conferees had to make some hard choices. I \nwill be frank--I would prefer that we pass a bill similar to the one \nthe Senate passed in November. That bill met our budgetary goals, and \nit struck the right balance. The conference report changes some social \nprograms, and I understand the concerns many throughout Utah have \nexpressed about how these changes will impact care.\n  That is why I spoke with Health and Human Services Secretary Michael \nLeavitt last night to discuss how this bill might affect social \nservices in Utah. His assurances that the budget bill will not hurt our \nmore vulnerable citizens were key to my decision to support S. 1932. \nSecretary Leavitt, who spent more than a decade serving as Utah's \nGovernor, also committed to maintaining a watchful eye over \nimplementation of this law to make sure that all Utahns' interests are \nprotected.\n  So despite this, my paramount concern was that we act now to curb the \ngrowth in entitlement spending because it threatens every one of our \nchildren and grandchildren with an unbearable tax burden. This \nconference report marks the beginning of a much needed change--a change \nthat must occur if we are to gain control of the fiscal future of this \ncountry. As many of my colleagues have pointed out, this conference \nreport, if enacted, will represent the first time since 1997 that we \nhave been able to reduce spending growth in entitlement programs.\n  The conference report before us includes a reduction in Federal \noutlays totaling almost $40 billion over the next 5 fiscal years. This, \nI am pleased to see, is nearly $5 billion more than the Senate version \nof the bill that we passed last month. While I am certainly not happy \nwith all of the individual changes in the conference report, I do like \nits direction toward more savings growth.\n  One reason I am so anxious to turn the comer in slowing spending \ngrowth on these entitlement programs is that the long-term projections \nfor Federal spending on the three largest entitlement programs--Social \nSecurity, Medicare, and Medicaid--are truly alarming. In fact, a new \nreport released last month by the Heritage Foundation states that fully \nfunding these three programs will force Federal spending, as a share of \nGDP, to increase from today's level of 20 percent to almost 33 percent \nby 2050.\n  Moreover, according to the report, the cost of these three programs \nalone could jump from 8.4 percent of GDP today to 18.9 percent of GDP \nby 2050. Failing to curb the growth in these programs leaves us with \nthree very unattractive and dangerous alternatives. The first would be \nto raise taxes dramatically. As we know, such a move would choke off \neconomic growth and leave us vulnerable to economic recessions which \nwould exacerbate rather than help the problem.\n  The second alternative is equally untenable--eliminate all other \nspending, eventually to include all discretionary spending. This, of \ncourse, is absurd since our defense, homeland security, and other vital \nspending is included in this category. The final alternative is to \ncontinue to allow the deficits to continue to build up as we try to \nkeep on financing the growing debt with loans from other countries.\n  Therefore, our only real choice is to begin to slow down the growth \nin these programs. This conference reports does start us on this path.\n  However, I acknowledge this conference report is far from perfect. It \nretains some flaws from the Senate version of the bill, and it came \nback from conference with some new flaws.\n  That being said, I believe this legislation is a step in the right \ndirection. The Medicare provisions are more in line with the Senate \nversion, and overall it targets Medicare's resources to better serve \nour seniors and disabled. The conference report ensures that \nbeneficiaries don't lose their doctors because of budget cuts, and it \nexpands services while making significant budget savings in noncritical \nareas.\n  While I do not agree with everything in this bill, I am pleased that \nthe legislation restores the stabilization fund for the Medicare \nAdvantage regional PPOs and allows the Medicare Part B penalty to be \nwaived for international missionaries. It also will expand the Program \nof All Inclusive Care for the Elderly, PACE, to beneficiaries living in \nrural areas. PACE offers alternative services to individuals who may \nneed nursing home care but want to live at\n\n[[Page S14209]]\n\nhome if possible. This provision will provide another important choice \nfor long-term care services for beneficiaries in rural areas. I filed \nall three of these policies as amendments when the Finance Committee \nconsidered the budget reconciliation bill.\n  For Medicare beneficiaries this legislation encourages preventive \ncare for seniors and the disabled. Some of the important provisions in \nthis area include the following: preventive screening tests for \nabdominal aortic aneurysm; exemption for colorectal cancer screening \ntests from the Medicare deductible; a 1.6-percent update to the \ncomposite rate for end stage renal disease, ESRD, services in 2006; and \nan expansion of Medicare reimbursement for services at federally \nqualified health centers, FQHC, by allowing them to provide diabetes \nself-management training services and medical nutrition therapy \nservices.\n  In addition, this legislation makes needed reforms to home health \npayments in order to reduce disparities in provider payment and improve \nquality and transparency. First, the bill calls for a 1-year, 5-percent \nadd-on payment for home health agencies that serve rural beneficiaries \nwhich will help many home health agencies in Utah. Rural home health \nagencies have much lower Medicare margins than urban home health \nagencies, and as a Senator who represents a primarily rural State, I \nbelieve that this needs to be addressed. The legislation freezes home \nhealth payments in 2006. In its March 2005 report to Congress, the \nMedicare Payment Advisory Commission recommended this freeze in home \nhealth payments because Medicare pays home health agencies \napproximately 17 percent more than it costs agencies to provide home \nhealth services. Finally, the legislation also provides financial \nincentives to home health agencies that report quality data beginning \nin 2007.\n  One of the most important provisions in this legislation protects \nphysicians from a 4.4-percent scheduled reduction beginning on January \n1, 2006 and, instead, allowed the 2005 payment rates to continue \nthrough 2006. I am still committed to fixing this problem once and for \nall, and I hope that we may accomplish this in 2006 since this issue \nwill need to be addressed once again since physicians are estimated to \ncontinue to receive negative cuts of approximately 5 percent from 2006 \nto 2011. Congress needs to enact a long-term solution as quickly as \npossible.\n\n  With regard to therapy services, for years Congress has worked to \nfind a permanent solution to the problem of overutilization of therapy \nservices. Although I have consistently supported a moratorium on \ntherapy caps, this bill leaves a January 2006 expiration of the \nmoratorium in tact, and I am committed to continue encouraging my \ncolleagues to reinstate this important moratorium.\n  Now, let me turn to Medicaid. This has been a tremendously successful \nprogram but also a very costly one. We have a responsibility to address \nthe dramatic growth in spending, but I was not happy that some of the \nkey provisions have not been considered thoroughly by the Senate. Given \nexpressions of concern voiced to me by my constituents, I only \nreluctantly give my support to the overall measure.\n  I would have preferred the Senate language, which did not change the \nlaw with respect to beneficiary eligibility. That is why I will be \nworking closely with Secretary Leavitt and other Cabinet-level \nofficials to ensure Utah is treated fairly as this law is implemented.\n  I would like to take a couple of minutes to share my thoughts on some \naspects of the Medicaid portion of this bill. One issue that was \ndebated in both the House and the Senate was the real asset transfer \nrules. Under current law, Medicaid asset transfer rules are easily \nskirted--courses are offered to teach attorneys how to circumvent the \nlaw. This is plain wrong. The reforms in the Deficit Reduction Omnibus \nReconciliation Act will make it more difficult for these transfers to \noccur and will allow more Medicaid resources to go to those who are in \ngenuine need.\n  Our current asset transfer policy is flawed. The policy not only \nallows for exploitation, it encourages it. The current statute has \nloopholes that allow wealthy seniors to qualify for Medicaid. Let me \nmake one point clear--Medicaid exists to protect the most vulnerable, \nnot the most wealthy.\n  We need a fair, equitable policy. We need to protect the Medicaid \nProgram for those who need it most. The legislation before us today \naddresses this situation by closing the loopholes in Medicaid. First, \nit prevents seniors from intentionally protecting their assets--people \nshould not be allowed to hide their money in order to receive Medicaid \nnursing home coverage. Second, the bill changes the lookback period as \nwell as the penalty period. Today, an older American can shelter half \nof his or her assets the day before applying for Medicaid.\n  The conference report starts the penalty period clock when a senior \napplies for Medicaid, and the lookback period is changed from 3 years \nto 5 years. Currently, an older person will face a penalty if assets \nare transferred for the purposes of qualifying for Medicaid within 5 \nyears of applying for Medicaid. This provision significantly \nstrengthens the asset transfer policy.\n  The new law does not allow an individual with more than $500,000 in \nhome equity to be able to qualify for Medicaid. It does provide State \nflexibility to increase the cap to $750,000. This is sound policy. \nThose with home equity over $500,000 should not take Medicaid money \nfrom those for whom the Medicaid Program was designed: low-income \nchildren, pregnant women, and individuals with disabilities. Also, the \npolicy only applies to individuals. It does not apply to applicants who \nhave a spouse or a dependent child at home. In theory, the State is \nsupposed to be able to put a lien on that home anyway.\n  Finally, seniors who have a hardship can apply for a waiver. The \npolicy strengthens protections for seniors seeking an undue hardship \nwaiver beyond current law or the Senate-passed version. I don't want to \nmake it harder for people who really need the Government's help. But I \ndo want to prevent seniors from intentionally taking advantage of the \nsystem. We need to protect Medicaid for those who need it most.\n  I discussed this matter in great detail with the Utah Medicaid \nDirector and was assured that, in my home State of Utah, individuals \nwho are under suspicion for transferring assets inappropriately are \nalways given the right to appeal if their request for Medicaid coverage \nis in question. I understand there are several States, such as Utah, \nwho handle this matter in fair and thoughtful way.\n  The budget reconciliation conference agreement also makes existing \nFederal reimbursement rates for drugs more accurate. It makes the \naverage manufacturer price, AMP, of drugs available to the public so \nthat pharmacists and wholesalers will get lower prices through greater \ncompetition, and excludes prompt pay discounts paid to wholesalers from \nthe new pharmacy reimbursement rates.\n  AMP is the average price at which manufacturers sell their drugs to \nwholesalers, but starting in 2007, the Federal Government will not pay \nmore than 250 percent of the AMP of the lowest cost version of a \ngeneric drug. Under current law, the Federal upper limit is 150 percent \nof the lowest published price. The new payment rates are based on the \nexisting rules governing generic drugs.\n  The AMP data will also be made available to States and the public. \nThis will create more transparency and competition in drug pricing. CBO \nhas estimated that transparency will help reduce drug costs by hundreds \nof millions of dollars. Competition and transparency will bring prices \ndown for consumers and protect the taxpayer from needless waste.\n  The final bill also requires the Secretary to work with private \ncompanies that routinely monitor and track drug payment rates for \nprivate health plans. The Secretary will then be required to share this \ninformation, known as retail sales prices, with States. This will \nprovide State officials with better information about actual market-\nbased prices, such as the rates paid by the Federal Employee Health \nBenefit Plans pay for prescription drugs. All of this information will \nprovide greater accountability and ensure that Medicaid is paying \npharmacists fairly for all drugs, and I am pleased that these \nprovisions were included in the legislation.\n\n[[Page S14210]]\n\n  The Deficit Reduction Omnibus Reconciliation Act also contains \nimportant reforms that will provide Medicare beneficiaries, seniors, \nand the disabled with better options to manage their care. Under the \nDeficit Reduction Omnibus Reconciliation Act, States will now be able \nto provide home and community-based services as an optional benefit to \nseniors, the disabled, persons with a developmental disability, mental \nretardation, or a related condition. Coverage of these services will \nallow more individuals to receive better health care and other \nassistance. These services will also mean that more persons can remain \nin their homes, without needing to go into nursing homes. These reforms \nwill help reduce spending by allowing individuals to receive the kinds \nof care they want, in the settings they prefer, at prices far below \nwhat Medicaid usually pays for nursing home care. In addition, no one \nwho currently is receiving care through an institution will be forced \nto leave that institution in order to receive community-based care.\n  The final conference report also will allow every State to establish \na Long-Term Care Partnership Program. Long Term Care Partnership \nPrograms allow individuals to protect a portion of their assets from \nMedicaid recoveries if they purchase long-term care insurance. \nCurrently only four States (California, Connecticut, Indiana and New \nYork) are allowed to have these programs. By expanding access to these \nprograms, the new law will help create incentives for people to \npurchase long term-care insurance. Encouraging the purchase of long-\nterm care insurance will mean that more people will be able to pay for \ntheir own nursing care, and fewer will have to rely on Medicaid as a \nsafety net to meet their long-term care needs.\n\n  Another area that is addressed in this legislation is Medicaid \nbeneficiary cost-sharing. There is a lot of misinformation about this \nprovision, and I would like to explain this provision in more detail. \nUnder current law, States may require cost-sharing but it is not \nenforceable. In other words, if a beneficiary does not pay his or her \ncopayment, the health care provider is forced to absorb the \nbeneficiary's copayment. This is why we have such difficulty \nencouraging providers to participate in the Medicaid Program. Many will \nnot, and all Medicaid beneficiaries suffer as a result.\n  I believe that the conference report includes reasonable policy that \nallows States to ask beneficiaries over the poverty line to participate \nin the cost of their own care. Let me make one clarification--the \nHouse-passed legislation required States to impose cost-share \nrequirements on beneficiaries with no income. I do not agree with that \npolicy, and it is included in this bill.\n  A beneficiary who is above the poverty line may pay up to percent of \nhis or her monthly income to the cost of their care, but that is only \nif the State decides to impose additional cost-sharing requirements. \nAnd let me assure my colleagues that no state is required to impose \ncost-sharing requirements on these beneficiaries. I will add that even \nthe National Governors Association support reasonable responsible cost-\nsharing. In fact, Governors testified before the Senate Finance \nCommittee earlier this year and told committee members that they \nsupport this policy.\n  I am aware that substantial concerns have been raised about the \nprovision permitting States to provide Medicaid coverage to children \nunder age 19 through ``benchmark'' or ``benchmark equivalent'' \ncoverage. In short, some fear this language might abrogate the right of \nthose children to receive Early Periodic Screening, Diagnostic and \nTesting, EPSDT, benefits.\n  For the benefit of my colleagues, I will ask unanimous consent that a \nstatement just issued by Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services \nAdministration, Mark McClellan, M.D., Ph.D., be printed in the Record\n  As Dr. McClellan has made quite clear, children through age 18 will \ncontinue to receive EPSDT. It is my hope this assurance will make many \nchild advocates more comfortable with this bill.\n  With regard to the welfare portion of the conference report, I was \ndisappointed to see Congress's efforts to reduce the budget contain \nlimitations on welfare, childcare, and child support policy. These \nvital programs should have been reauthorized through the normal \nlegislative process, not tucked away in a protected budget \nreconciliation bill which is designed to reduce the Federal deficit. \nThe welfare, childcare, and child support language included in the \nbudget reconciliation bill has almost nothing to do with reducing the \ndeficit and everything to do with changing the rules of these important \nprograms without proper legislative scrutiny or debate.\n  While I am completely frustrated with the Senate's inability to \nreauthorize the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, TANF, \nlegislation using the normal legislative process, I do not believe it \nis in the best interest of the participants of these programs to \ninclude sweeping policy changes in a bill designed to reduce the \ndeficit.\n  However, I am appreciative of Chairman Grassley's efforts to ensure \nthat childcare funding was increased. Although the increase is limited \nto $1 billion over the next 5 years, I am hopeful we will be able to \nsecure even larger increases in childcare funding in the near future. \nProviding quality childcare to low-income families is crucial when we \nare scrambling to help families become self-sufficient, and I am \ncommitted to ensuring the Federal Government continues to help these \nchildren and families.\n  As well, I am appreciative of the chairman's efforts to secure 3 \nyears of supplement TANF grants. The State of Utah has been a large \nbeneficiary of these grants, and as we work to meet the stricter TANF \nwork requirements outlined in this bill, we will continue to have \nsupplemental grants from HHS to help us train and prepare our TANF \nrecipients.\n  Now I would like to discuss the portion of the deficit reduction \nconference report that addresses the Continued Dumping and Subsidy \nOffset Act, which is commonly refereed to as the Byrd amendment. The \nByrd amendment amended the Tariff Act of 1930 to require that duties, \ncollected as a result of antidumping and countervailing duty laws, be \ndistributed to the affected entities. At the time it was introduced, I \nsupported this measure as a commonsense proposal.\n  However, since that time, the World Trade Organization has allowed \nour trading partners to impose tariffs on various U.S. goods, and the \nByrd amendment has gone from a commonsense solution to an impediment to \nU.S. companies' ability to sell their goods abroad.\n  First, I must reemphasize my strong support for laws that not only \nmake trade free but fair. Accordingly, I have spoken directly to the \nSecretary of Commerce, Carlos Gutierrez, and United States Trade \nRepresentative, Ambassador Rob Portman, about the vital importance of \nvigorous enforcement of our trade laws.\n  Though I have never and will never advocate modifying our laws \nbecause of outside pressure, American companies and employees in Utah \nand all over the country have come to me and asked for my help in \nrepealing the Byrd amendment. Currently, the United States is \nnegotiating, as part of the Doha Round talks, a new trade regime in \nwhich international markets would become even more open to U.S. goods \nand services. If completely successful, the Institute for International \nEconomics estimates that American households could gain as much as an \nadditional $5,000 per year. If today's international trade barriers \nwere reduced by just a third, the average American family of four would \nenjoy $2,500 per year in additional income, according to a University \nof Michigan study.\n  Freer trade helps more than just Americans. The poorest countries \nstand to gain considerably. According to a Center for Global \nDevelopment study, a successful conclusion to the Doha Round would \nresult in an additional $200 billion flowing to developing nations, \nreducing poverty and economic hardship. Not to mention, the Institute \nfor International Economics estimates that trade liberalization over \nthe last 50 years has brought an additional $10,000 per year to the \ntypical American household.\n\n  In order to achieve our objectives in the Doha Round, many of our \ntrading partners will be required to make substantial concessions on \nimport duties and subsidies. However, those who oppose our noble goals \ncould use our refusal to repeal the Byrd amendment as\n\n[[Page S14211]]\n\na means to hinder our negotiating strategy. Simply put, these opponents \nwill state that if the United States cannot follow the existing rules \nof trade, rules which our Nation largely crafted and implemented, how \ncan we be trusted if most trade barriers are repealed?\n  Therefore, as I said before, I admire the Byrd amendment's \ncommonsense approach, but I believe under the present circumstances the \ntime has come for this legislation to be modified, in order to \nstrengthen the ability of our Nation to achieve the larger goal of \nbringing down foreign barriers to U.S. goods and services.\n  Therefore, I support the changes incorporated in the Deficit \nReduction Conference Report. This legislation achieves a fair \ncompromise by repealing the Byrd amendment; however, at the same it \nwould permit Byrd amendment payments to U.S. companies through October \n1, 2007. This should provide an adequate time for companies to plan for \nthe future while preserving a strong negotiating position for U.S. \ninterests.\n  Despite its shortcomings in some areas, this reconciliation package \ncontains several very important provisions in the intellectual property \narea that benefit the Nation and my home State of Utah.\n  I am pleased that a hard date for the transition from analog to \ndigital television was included in the final package. This important \nprovision will free up crucial radio spectrum that is currently \noccupied by broadcaster's analog television signals. Although the \ndigital transition inevitably resolves a number of difficult issues, it \nalso has several important benefits. It is my understanding that over \n$7 billion of the proceeds from the eventual auction of spectrum \nlicenses is expected to be used for deficit reduction. Perhaps more \nimportantly, the transition will provide both the necessary funding and \navailable spectrum for public safety officials and emergency personnel \nacross the country to upgrade their communications infrastructure. And, \nfinally, a portion of the anticipated proceeds will be used for various \nprograms intended to minimize any negative financial impact on \nconsumers, rural broadcasters, and others affected by the transition.\n  I am particularly pleased that a provision setting aside a small \nfraction of the proceeds to help fund the upgrade of television \ntranslator stations was included. This provision responds to a serious \nconcern that I have had regarding the financial viability of upgrading \nthe network of translator stations across Utah that are used to serve \nmany of the rural communities in my home State. In the context of the \ndebate over the digital transition, it came to my attention that \nupgrading these translators, which retransmit television signals to \ncommunities beyond the reach of the primary broadcast towers, would \nimpose a substantial--and disproportionate--financial burden on \nbroadcasters that were primarily located in mountainous western States. \nDue to the vast area covered by the Salt Lake City television market \nand the high concentration of translator stations in the State, there \nwas a substantial concern that upgrading the cost of these translators \nwould be prohibitive. The approach taken in the reconciliation package \nis similar to the proposal contained in S. 1600, which I cosponsored \nwith Senator Snowe, and I would like to take this opportunity to thank \nSenators Snowe, Stevens, and Inouye--and their respective staffs--for \ntheir help on this issue.\n  As with other portions of this bill, there are aspects to the \neducation provisions I support and others I don't. However, I am \npleased overall with the significant amount of savings while still \nallowing for spending on important programs.\n  The major area of savings comes from the reduction in corporate \nlender profits on student loans, in the form of a requirement that \nlenders rebate the Federal Government the difference between the \nborrower rate and the lender rate when the borrower rate exceeds the \nlender rate. In addition, guaranty agencies are required to deposit 1 \npercent of their collections in the Federal Reserve Fund; there is a \nreduction of borrower origination fees by .50 percent for each award, \nand there is an elimination of the recycling of 9.5 percent loans.\n  Even with these much needed savings, I disagreed with fixing the \ninterest rate for undergraduate and graduate nonconsolidation borrowing \nat 6.8 percent, preferring a choice of a fixed or variable rate.\n  However, I am very pleased with increasing grant aid for students \nstudying math and science, named SMART grants. I was involved in the \noriginal creation of the SMART Grants Program through my work on the \nHELP Committee. These grants will give first year students awards of \n$700 and $1,300 for second year students, provided they have completed \nrigorous programs at the secondary level. Third and fourth year \nstudents may receive up to $4,000 in grant aid if they major in math, \nscience, or foreign language.\n  I know these programs will give Utah students, particularly those of \nlow or moderate means, greater access to a college education and will \nboost our local and national economy as we seek to meet the demands of \nthe 21st century workforce.\n  Again, this legislation is not perfect. It is not a perfect answer to \nseveral of the social policy problems that confront our Nation. It is \nnot a perfect answer to the growing Federal budget deficit either. It \nis not Draconian and it is not mean-hearted. This deficit reduction \nconference report is merely a good first step in stemming the tide of \nred ink that runs down the pages of the Federal budget, stealing \ntaxpayer dollars to service a monstrous Federal debt and robbing our \nchildren of a safe and secure financial future. For these important and \nself evident reasons, I support this bill.\n  I ask unanimous consent the statement issued by the Centers for \nMedicare and Medicaid Services Administration to which I referred \nearlier be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nStatement by Mark B. McClellan, M.D., Ph.D, Administrator, Centers for \n                      Medicare & Medicaid Services\n\n       Questions have been raised about the new section 1937 of \n     the Social Security Act (SSA) (as added by the Deficit \n     Reduction Act of 2005) that permits states to provide \n     Medicaid benefits to children through benchmark coverage or \n     benchmark equivalent coverage. If a state chooses to exercise \n     this option, the specific issue has been raised as to whether \n     children under 19 will still be entitled to receive EPSDT \n     benefits in addition to the benefits provided by the \n     benchmark coverage or benchmark equivalent coverage. The \n     short answer is: children under 19 will receive EPSDT \n     benefits.\n       After a careful review, including consultation with the \n     Office of General Counsel, CMS has determined that children \n     under 19 will still be entitled to receive EPSDT benefits if \n     enrolled in benchmark coverage or benchmark equivalent \n     coverage under the new section 1937. CMS will review each \n     State plan amendment (SPA) submitted under the new section \n     1937 and will not approve any SPA that does not include the \n     provision of EPSDT services for children under 19 as defined \n     in section 1905(r) of the SSA.\n       In the case of children under the age of 19, new section \n     1937(a)(1) is clear that a state may exercise the option to \n     provide Medicaid benefits through enrollment in coverage that \n     at a minimum has two parts. The first part of the coverage \n     will be benchmark coverage or benchmark equivalent coverage, \n     as required by subsection (a)(1)(A)(i), and the second part \n     of the coverage will be wrap-around coverage of EPDST \n     services as defined in section 1905(r) of the SSA, as \n     required by subsection (a)(1)(A)(ii). A State cannot exercise \n     the option under section 1937 with respect to children under \n     19 if EPSDT services are not included in the total coverage \n     provided to such children.\n       Subparagraph (C) of section 1937(a)(1) permits states to \n     also add wrap-around or additional benefits. In the case of \n     children under 19, wrap-around or additional benefits that a \n     state could choose to provide under subparagraph (C) must be \n     a benefit in addition to the benchmark coverage or benchmark \n     equivalent coverage and the EPSDT services that the state is \n     already required to provide under subparagraph (A) of that \n     section. Subparagraph (C) does not in any way give a state \n     the flexibility to fail to provide the EPSDT services \n     required by subparagraph (A)(ii) of section 1937(a)(1).\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, across the country, more than 6 million \nchildren live with relatives, and of those, 4.5 million live with \ngrandparents. A majority of relatives providing care for children are \nnot part of the child welfare system. In fact, only a quarter of all \nrelatives caring for a child receive either a foster care payment or \nanother source of payment. Most relatives do not receive any Federal \nfinancial support, and sadly, nearly 20 percent of all grandparents \nraising their grandchildren live in poverty.\n\n[[Page S14212]]\n\n  Unfortunately, the conference agreement on the Deficit Reduction Act \nof 2005 severely cuts Federal assistance to foster care funding and \nmakes it significantly harder for relatives to provide care for a \nchild. I believe this is a step in the wrong direction, and I oppose \nthese cuts.\n  Kinship care is an important option for permanency for children in \nthe child welfare system and often appropriate when adoption is not \npossible. Subsidized guardianship makes it possible for a relative to \nstep in and care for a child. In my State of New Mexico, subsidized \nguardianship is available, and nearly 10 percent of children live with \nnonparent relatives. Grandparents and other relative caregivers are \noften the best chance for a loving and stable childhood for a child in \ntheir care, and it is important that we acknowledge their hard work and \ndedication.\n  I commend grandparents and other relatives who step forward to care \nfor a child. Their efforts help keep children out of foster care and \nprovide safe, permanent and stable homes, often at great personal \nsacrifice. Supportive programs like subsidized guardianship allow \ncaring relatives to provide care that they may not otherwise be able to \ngive, and help children exit foster care into the care of nurturing \nrelatives. I would like to express my gratitude and appreciation for \nthe invaluable care provided by relatives for children in need.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I join many of my colleagues today in \nexpressing sincere disappointment in the conference report to the \nbudget reconciliation legislation. I could certainly echo the \nsentiments that we have already heard regarding the Medicaid and TANF \nprovisions included in this conference report--two sections that will \ndirectly penalize hard working families, and prevent many from moving \ntowards self-sufficiency. Or I could repeat the comments that this \nreport represents not a compromise between the House and Senate bills, \nbut an abuse of power that will harm rather than help, millions of \nfamilies.\n  While I share my colleagues' dissatisfaction with this conference \nreport, I would like to highlight a section that may have been \noverlooked. The conferees made interesting decisions in the area of \nchild support--they chose to include provisions that would allow States \nto ``pass through'' child support payments to families, provisions that \nI have fought to pass for several years. Yet in the same conference \nreport, they chose to make deep cuts to the Child Support Enforcement \nProgram, cuts that may inhibit States ability from actually passing \nthrough those child support dollars.\n  I believe the inclusion of the child support ``pass through'' \nprovisions is one of the few successes of this legislation. These \nprovisions are similar to those included in S. 321, the Child Support \nDistribution Act. Senator Snowe and I have worked together for the past \nseveral years on this legislation, which allows States to ``pass \nthrough'' more child support collections to the families that need \nthem, rather than send those dollars to the Federal Government.\n  Specifically, the conference report has three major provisions \nrelated to the Child Support Distribution Act. The conference report \neliminates pre-assistance assignment rules--families applying for the \nTemporary Assistance to Needy Families program would no longer be \nrequired to turn over their right to child support that accrues before \nthey are receiving assistance. In addition, the Conference Report gives \nstates the option to distribute more child support to families who have \nleft assistance. Finally, for families currently receiving assistance, \nit allows States to let families keep more child support, rather than \nsending it to the Federal Government.\n  These changes were included in the bipartisan, Senate Finance \nCommittee-passed welfare reauthorization legislation. It is \nunfortunate, given the wide support for these provisions, that the cuts \ncontained in this bill will place such a financial burden on the States \nthat they will unlikely be able to actually pass through the funding to \nthe families.\n  The original House bill included a 40-percent cut to Federal child \nsupport funding. Thus, it would seem that the $5 billion cut included \nin the conference report before us is somehow less significant. This \ncould not be further from the truth. According to the Congressional \nBudget Office, this conference report would mean that more than $8 \nbillion in child support payments would go uncollected over the next 10 \nyears. I will say that again so that my colleagues are clear: $8 \nbillion in funds will not go to hardworking, single parent families; $8 \nbillion that is owed to these families, that they rely on to meet their \nchildren's needs.\n  These payments would go uncollected because the conference report \nretains a provision that 74 of my colleagues voted against last week. I \noffered a motion to instruct that asked conferees to reject the \nprovisions in the House bill that would restrict the ability of States \nto draw down matching funds on child support incentive payments. In \naddition, I sent a letter to conferees that was signed by 49 Senators \nasking that this restriction not be included in the conference report.\n  I have heard some of my colleagues argue that this is simply closing \na loophole, that this funding source was not what Congress intended. I \nsay to my colleagues that this is not the case. The reforms made to the \nchild support system in 1998 created the performance-based system that \nhas been proven to be so successful. Since this system was put in \nplace, States have doubled their collection rates and have \nsignificantly improved their performance on every other measure.\n  The changes in this conference report would undo these successes. In \nfact, the cuts will actually drive up costs in other programs, such as \nTANF, food stamps, and Medicaid. That is why these cuts are opposed by \nthe National Governors Association, the National Association of \nAttorneys General, and the National Conference of State Legislatures, \namong others.\n  It is highly ironic that the conference report gives States the \noption to pass through more child support to families that deserve it, \nwhile also passing on a financial burden that will directly restrict \ntheir ability to do so. This bill will hurt millions of families, and \nit should have been defeated.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, we all know that times have been getting \ntougher for low- and middle-income working families. Compared to 5 \nyears ago, more Americans now live in poverty, the median household \nincome has dropped, and more live without the security of health \ninsurance. Clearly, Congress should be adopting budget policies aimed \nat improving these troubling trends. But instead, this misguided budget \nreconciliation conference report would make things worse.\n  This legislation takes funds from important programs like Medicaid, \nstudent loans, child support enforcement, foster care assistance, and \nSupplemental Security Income for the elderly and disabled poor. The \nstated purpose of these nearly $40 billion in cuts and harmful program \nchanges is to trim the deficit, but we all know that these savings will \nnot ultimately be used toward that goal; they are designed to pave the \nway for the $50 billion to $100 billion in new tax cuts that the \nmajority will attempt to push through early next year. We should not be \nmaking cuts to vital services simply so the President and the majority \ncan finance more tax cuts that mainly benefit the wealthiest among us.\n  Under this bill, families that rely on Medicaid will face significant \nincreases in the costs for access to health care services and \nmedications, which will lead many of our most vulnerable citizens to \nforgo needed care. The Congressional Budget Office, CBO, estimates that \nthe increases in Medicaid copayments and premiums and the reductions in \nMedicaid benefits will total $16 billion over the next 10 years. Also \nof particular concern to Michigan is a provision that eliminates the \nState's provider managed care assessment. When that provision goes into \neffect, it will cost Michigan $280 million per year.\n  The conference agreement also makes things worse for those who use \nstudent loans. Despite already soaring education costs, this conference \nreport cuts funding for student loan programs by $12.7 billion over 5 \nyears, nearly one-third of the total cuts imposed by this legislation. \nMost of these reductions are achieved by increasing interest rates and \nfees paid by students and parents. In the fight for global \ncompetitiveness, a highly educated workforce is one of America's best \nassets. It\n\n[[Page S14213]]\n\nis shortsighted to cut investments in education.\n  This legislation will make also substantial changes to the Temporary \nAssistance for Needy Families, TANF, program. The changes include \nimposing harsh new work requirements without providing nearly enough \nchildcare assistance. The CBO estimates that States will need over $12 \nbillion in new funding over the next 5 years to maintain current \nchildcare programs and meet the new work requirements by increasing \nparticipation in welfare-to-work programs. The conference agreement, \nhowever, includes just $1 billion in childcare funding over the next 5 \nyears. The shortfall means that many States will need to scale back \nchildcare slots for poor working families not on welfare, forcing \nfamilies to choose between lower quality, less stable childcare or not \nworking at all.\n  Unfortunately, this conference agreement also contains a House \nprovision that would repeal the Continued Dumping and Subsidy Offset \nAct, CDSOA, of 2000, despite an overwhelming 71 to 20 Senate vote \ninstructing conferees to reject the provision. The CDSOA was enacted in \n2000 to enable U.S. businesses and workers to survive in the face of \ncontinued unfair trade by allowing Customs to distribute duties \ncollected on unfairly traded imports to those U.S. companies and \nworkers injured by continued dumped and unfairly subsidized imports. I \ndo not believe we should repeal this law, nor do a bipartisan majority \nof Senators.\n  Additionally, under this bill, Federal funding for child support \nenforcement will be cut about $1.5 billion over the next 5 years. As a \nresult, the CBO estimates that $2.9 billion in child support owed to \nchildren will go uncollected over 5 years.\n  The hardships that will be caused by this legislation are significant \nand broad-reaching. Yet the three-part budget reconciliation package \nthat includes this conference report will not even make a dent in our \ndeficits. Both the House and Senate have passed tax reconciliation \nbills that cut revenues far more than this bill cuts spending. As most \ngrade school math students can tell you, when you bring in less money \nthan you spend, you will end up in trouble. And that is where the \nPresident's tax policies have put us today.\n  We have got over $8 trillion in debt. Financing further tax cuts with \ndebt is simply fiscally irresponsible. In the most recent fiscal year, \nwe spent over $350 billion just to pay the interest on our debt. That \nis 14 percent of the Federal Government's spending last year. We simply \ncannot afford to continue building up this massive debt.\n  One of a few positive aspects about this conference report is the \ninclusion of an extension of the Milk Income Loss Compensation, MILC, \nProgram, which was set to expire this year. Milk is Michigan's largest \nagricultural commodity, and the MILC Program has been essential in \npreserving our dairy farms in times of dairy price declines.\n  Mr. President, the reconciliation process is supposed to bring \nGovernment programs and tax policies passed over the years in line with \nthe broader budgetary goals of the Congress. It should be a fiscal \nsanity check, making sure our policies support our goals. At a time \nwhen one in six American children lives in poverty, our budget goals \nshould be to help, not hurt, the neediest among us. Our goals should \nalso focus on reducing the mountain of debt that we are leaving for our \nchildren and grandchildren. Unfortunately, by cutting vital programs to \nfinance tax cuts that mainly benefit the wealthy, this legislation \nmoves us in the wrong direction on both counts. I will oppose this \nconference report.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, today the Senate approved the Deficit \nReduction Omnibus Reconciliation Act of 2005. I voted in favor of this \nbill because it is the first comprehensive deficit reduction \nlegislation approved by the Senate since 1997, and it will save $39.7 \nbillion over the next 5 years. This is an important first step toward \ncontaining the unsustainable growth of entitlement programs and putting \nus on the road to a balanced budget.\n  None of us is happy about everything that is included in a big bill \nlike this. One area in which I am disappointed is language \nreauthorizing the welfare reform program, also known as Temporary \nAssistance for Needy Families, TANF. This is a program that needs to be \nreauthorized on a more permanent basis, instead of the temporary \nextensions that have been approved year after year.\n  In thinking about reauthorization of welfare reform, I believe three \nthings need to happen. First, States need more authority to decide what \nwill work best in their State. Second, States need more flexibility to \nallow educational activities to count toward work hours. I have been \ntold by TANF offices in Tennessee that if they can get TANF recipients \ninto school, they do not see them on the welfare rolls again. Third, we \nneed more money for child care. If the TANF program is going to require \npoor parents--including single mothers--to work, these parents must \nhave safe child care for their children. Last year, I supported--and \nthe Senate passed by a vote of 78 to 20--an amendment to increase child \ncare funding by $6 billion. This bill only includes a $1 billion \nincrease for child care.\n  Unfortunately, the welfare reform language included in the deficit \nreduction bill falls short in all three of these areas. I would have \npreferred that the Senate hold a full debate on TANF reauthorization, \nwith Senators able to offer amendments. However, I understand that the \nSenate conferees felt that the deficit reduction bill represented the \nbest chance of reauthorization after years of delay and temporary \nextensions.\n  In the coming year, I look forward to working with Chairman Grassley \nand other colleagues to craft legislation that addresses some of these \nshortcomings and continues the successful transformation of the TANF \nprogram that began with enactment of the landmark welfare reform law in \n1996.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, this budget reconciliation package that \narrived from the House-Senate conference will leave our country's \nbudget and the American people in a far worse state of affairs than \nthey are today. I am disappointed that congressional leaders have \nchosen to use the budget reconciliation process to achieve \ncontroversial goals that will make life harder for those Americans in \ngreatest need of help, and I will oppose this legislation.\n  As I stated when this bill passed the Senate, using reconciliation to \npush through legislation that will worsen our budget deficit and add \nbillions more to the mountain of debt our children and grandchildren \nwill have to pay is a perversion of a process designed to expedite \nmeasures to reduce the deficit.\n  Reconciliation was intended to help facilitate the enactment of \nmeasures to reduce the deficit and therefore secure the Nation's \nfinancial stability. It is ironic that it should be used to enact \nmeasures that not only aggravate our budget deficits and increase our \nmassive debt, but also makes cuts to programs that help many Americans \nmaintain their financial security.\n  There are substantial and unprecedented changes to the Medicaid \nprogram included in this bill. Rather than cut the wasteful, $10 \nbillion Medicare Advantage slush fund that gives superfluous payments \nto insurance companies, conferees have chosen to cut benefits and shift \ncosts onto the poorest in America. Usage of Medicaid is expected to \ndrop significantly, forcing beneficiaries to become sicker and \neventually utilize emergency room care. In fact, the Congressional \nBudget Office estimates that 17 million people will pay more for health \nservices under Medicaid over 10 years, half of whom would be children. \nIs this how we want to take care of the needy in our society? This will \nbe harmful not only to those in need of health care, but also to our \nhospitals, which will be burdened with more patients who are unable to \npay. This shift of health care costs from the Government to Medicaid \nbeneficiaries will only cost our hospitals and taxpayers more money in \nthe long run--and this is being done under the guise of saving money \nand balancing our budget.\n  Perhaps the most worrying changes to our health care programs are the \nstatutory changes to Medicaid and Medicare. This conference agreement \ninstitutes systemic limitations on services that will have effects for \ndecades to come. Included in the bill are provisions that will force \nunlimited charges onto the poor for their health care where previously \nthere were protections for those in near poverty. As if\n\n[[Page S14214]]\n\nloss of these protections were not enough, this will also allow health \ncare providers to deny health care to people too poor to afford these \ncharges.\n  This legislation also freezes Medicare payments to home health care \nproviders. Home health is the most cost-efficient and comfortable way \nto provide long term care. By freezing home health care payments, \naccess will drop, and many of the sickest in our country will be denied \nthis option.\n  In addition to cutting into people's health care, this report cuts \ninto welfare and child care funding on which many American families \ndepend. Last week, the Senate passed a motion to instruct conferees \nthat urged welfare reauthorization to be removed from the budget \npackage. I voted for this motion, which passed overwhelmingly. Despite \nthe success, the House chose to include welfare reauthorization anyway. \nThis was done under the radar in a move that was largely unseen by \npeople who will be affected by the changes. And the changes are \nsignificant. This reauthorization represents the largest change in \nwelfare policy since 1996, and it will impose expensive new work \nrequirements on states with no additional funding provided. So those on \nwelfare will be working more hours, and what will they do with their \nchildren? Child care funds have been cut by $1 billion in this bill. \nThis is $7.4 billion less than CBO estimates to be the cost to states \nof meeting the new work requirements, and more than $11 billion less \nthan what states will need to ensure that their current child care \nprograms can stay afloat through all the additional changes in the \nbudget package. These are unconscionable cuts to programs that serve as \nsafety nets for the most vulnerable.\n  I am also deeply troubled that almost one-third of the savings in the \nbudget reconciliation bill come at the expense of the student loan \nprogram. I regret that a portion of the savings within the student loan \nprogram is achieved by increasing fees paid by student and parent \nborrowers. While I may support provisions in this agreement that \neliminate unnecessary subsidies for lenders, the money saved through \nthis elimination should go toward making college more affordable and \nincrease grant aid such as Pell Grants. I regret that this money is not \nfunneled back towards increased aid for America's students.\n  This agreement also increases the maximum subsidized loan amounts \nthat first and second year students can borrow and increases the \nmaximum amount of unsubsidized loans that graduate students can borrow. \nWhile increasing loan limits will help students cover the costs of \ntheir education, I find it disheartening that we as a Congress are \npushing more of a financial burden on these students as tuition rates \naround the country increase. Rather than cutting money from the student \nloan program and requiring students to borrow more and pay more in \nfees, we should instead be working to find ways to make a college \neducation affordable to all students.\n  While I welcome the addition of some new grant aid for Pell-eligible \nstudents, I have heard concerns from my constituents in Wisconsin that \nthe requirements accompanying the increased aid will make the program \ndifficult to administer and could exclude many of the Pell-eligible \nstudents from receiving this aid. One requirement for freshman and \nsophomore Pell-eligible students to receive this aid is the condition \nthat the student must have completed a ``rigorous secondary school \nprogram''. Under the agreement, the Secretary of Education determines \nwhether or not the student has fulfilled that requirement. What is not \nclear, however, is how the Secretary will actually measure which \nprograms are deemed rigorous and therefore which students will receive \nthe aid. I am concerned that students who attend disadvantaged schools \nwill not be eligible for the aid under the wording in this agreement.\n  Another troubling aspect of the new grant aid is the requirement that \nstudents attend school full-time during their first year of college. \nThis provision would eliminate many Pell-eligible students who attend \nschool part-time and work part-time. Again, I think this sends the \nwrong message to our youth who are considering attending college and \nattempting to finance their education.\n  We can do better for young Americans in Wisconsin and around the \nnation by working to increase aid in an inclusive manner and working to \nmake a college education more affordable to all. These cuts to the \nstudent loan program are another reason that I will vote to oppose this \nconference agreement.\n  If there is a silver lining to this sham of a budget reconciliation \npackage, it is the conference committee's decision to retain the \nSenate's extension of the Milk Income Loss Contract, MILC, program and \nreject cuts to Food Stamps. Even this support for these two vital \nprograms is tempered by short-sighted cuts to other agriculture \nprograms such as the limits placed on conservation programs that assist \nfarmers in their stewardship of the land.\n  I will not support using reconciliation to enact harmful, \ncontroversial policies that will worsen budget deficits and increase \nthe debt. No matter how many pieces you slice it into, the \nreconciliation instruction in the budget resolution will leave us with \nbigger deficits, not smaller ones.\n  This budget sends the message that those living in poverty are \nCongress' lowest priority: and this reveals a profound lack of empathy \nand kindness for the most defenseless in our society. When Congress and \nthe White House become serious about cleaning up the fiscal mess they \ncreated, and when they are willing to spread the burden of that clean \nup across all programs--defense and non-defense discretionary programs, \nentitlements, and the spending done through the Tax Code--I am ready to \nhelp. But so long as we see reconciliation measures that cut aid to \nthose most vulnerable, and cuts to Government spending is done on the \nbacks of the poor, I must oppose them.\n  Mr. SPECTER. On a close call I have decided to vote for the \nconference report on the reconciliation bill because the benefits \nslightly outweigh the disadvantages in evaluating the tradeoffs.\n  I start with the proposition that the savings of $40 billion over 5 \nyears in the conference report is closer to the $35 billion passed by \nthe Senate than to the $50 billion cuts passed by the House of \nRepresentatives. This deficit reduction amounts to less than one-half \nof 1 percent of total Federal spending, an estimated $13.8 trillion \nover the next 5 years.\n  Medicaid was a special concern where the conference report of a $4.8 \nbillion reduction was much closer to the Senate figure of $4.3 billion \nthan to the House cut of $11 billion. While I would have preferred \ntargeting different reductions, the conference report does give the \nStates flexibility in the use of Medicaid funds so that the States will \nbe in a position to ameliorate hardships resulting from the proposed \nreductions.\n  It was important that the conference report included $1 billion in \nadditional budget authority in fiscal year '07 for the Low Income Home \nEnergy Assistance Program, LIHEAP, which the Congressional Budget \nOffice estimates will result in $625 million in outlays as we approach \nthe fiscal year 07 winter season which is likely to be very harsh. It \nis anticipated that there will be an additional $2 billion for fiscal \nyear '06 added to LIHEAP in the Defense appropriations bill although \nthat is not a certainty because the Senate will not act on that bill \nuntil after the vote on reconciliation.\n  I am further encouraged by the elimination of some $700 million on \ncuts for the Food Stamp Program and the rejection of the House passed \n$5 billion reduction in child support enforcement to aid local \ngovernments which finally came in at a $1.5 billion cut.\n  After visiting many first responders around the State, I was pleased \nto see the reconciliation bill add $1 billion for first responders who \nwill be very important in any prospective emergency situation.\n  I was also pleased to see the one year moratorium on inpatient \nrehabilitation hospital provisions which require 50 percent of Medicare \nbeneficiaries to meet certain ailment criteria for 2 years.\n  I was opposed to the repeal of the Continued Dumping and Subsidiary \nOffset Act, CDSOA, program but there was finally a compromise to give \nthe program 2 more years.\n  Of special significance to Pennsylvania was the addition of $998 \nmillion\n\n[[Page S14215]]\n\nfor the Milk Income Loss Compensation, MILC, Program which is very \nimportant to the financial status of nearly 9,000 dairy farms in the \nState.\n  In making judgments on legislation like the reconciliation bill, we \nare really faced with a Hobson's choice. None of the options is \ndesirable. We are constantly choosing among the lesser of the evils.\n  In the overall context of discretionary spending which is involved in \nthe reconciliation bill and in the appropriations bill for Labor, \nHealth and Human Services and Education, there are palpably \ninsufficient funds available for such domestic programs. As chairman of \nthe Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services and Education, it \nwas my responsibility to structure legislation that came within the \nallocations approved by the Budget Committee and Appropriations \nCommittee.\n  With a 1-percent cut at the outset and another projected one percent \nacross the board cut and the failure to keep up with inflation, the \nsubcommittee sustained a cut in real dollars approaching $7 billion. At \nthe conference on the bill for the Departments of Labor, Health and \nHuman Services, and Education, I said publicly that I would not support \nthe bill unless my vote was indispensable for its passage. If the bill \nis not passed, we face the alternative of a continuing resolution which \nwill be $3 billion less than the bill, so there is no alternative, as a \nmatter of basic arithmetic, but to support the bill.\n  I have already put my Senate colleagues on notice, including the \nleadership, that I will not support next year's budget unless there is \nadequate funding for domestic discretionary programs with special \nemphasis on Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education. I will \nalso work to correct any inequities or hardships which result from the \nreconciliation bill.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I cannot support the devastating cuts to \nhealth care that are in the budget reconciliation conference report. I \nhave fought to slow health care spending, but that is not what is in \nthis conference report. This conference report slashes and bums the \nhealth care countryside like the barbarians descending on Rome. This \nconference report is not about reform or creating a decent health \nsystem for the poor and for seniors--it is about dismantling the system \nas we know it.\n  For starters, the Senate-passed bill increased drug rebates so that \nMedicaid beneficiaries would get better prices on their drugs. The \nSenate bill increased the minimum rebates that drug manufacturers are \nrequired to pay the Medicaid Program for drugs. The Senate package also \ncontained a provision that would have expanded the rebate to include \nmanaged care drug plans. None of these improvements, which would have \nproduced savings of $10.5 billion over 10 years and have helped ensure \nMedicaid participants get better prescription drug prices, is included \nin the conference report.\n  The conference report reopens the Medicare Modernization Act, MMA,--\nnot to make improvements in the drug benefit but to push those with a \nlittle more income to pay higher Part B premiums sooner. It seems to me \nthat given the confusion, the unhappiness, the need for more and better \ncounseling for seniors on their choices, and the need to assure cost \ncontainment in the Part D drug benefit, you should have gone farther \nthan what is in the product before us and made real improvements. One \nimprovement that won a majority of 51 votes on the Senate floor was an \namendment I offered with Senator Snowe to allow Medicare to use its \npurchasing power to benefit seniors. Giving Medicare that power would \nhave produced a real benefit for seniors, but that is not included \nhere. ``\n  The home health cuts in this conference report will hurt a service \nthat is vital to seniors. The conference report freezes home health \npayments for a year. Home health care has been demonstrated to be cost \neffective alternative to institutional care in both the Medicare and \nMedicaid Programs. In Oregon, what is proposed here will compound the \nnegative impact of other cuts. Since 1997, when Congress first enacted \ncuts in home health, Oregon has lost 30 home health agencies. Oregon's \nhome health agencies' profit margins are already at a negative 21.75 \npercent, and 33 of 60 home health agencies are in rural areas. I fear \nwhat will happen to Oregon's seniors when home health agencies' \npayments are frozen, but their costs keep going up.\n  The conference report increases copayments and premiums for the poor. \nI happen to believe that everyone should pay something on the spot for \ncare unless they destitute, but the increases required here will force \npeople who can get care today to for go care tomorrow. Oregon has \nlearned from experience in this area. When Oregon instituted strict \ncopayment and premium payment policies 55,000 people dropped off \nMedicaid, and most of those were people with chronic health problems, \nlike high blood pressure and diabetes. The reconciliation bill says \nStates can increase substantially the copayments that many Medicaid \nbeneficiaries are required to pay to access health services and \nmedications. Sure, there will be savings, but they will be achieved \nbecause people just won't get care or just won't seek care. That is \nnot, in my view, good public health policy, and completely undermines \nthe purpose of Medicaid.\n  The conference report makes it harder for people to qualify for \nMedicaid long-term care. The conference report embraces the House \nprovisions that restrict eligibility for Medicaid long-term care \nservices and squeeze more savings out of those who need Medicaid. These \nprovisions are far more onerous than the Senate passed bill, casting a \nwide net that will force every applicant to prove they had not \ntransferred assets years before a disabling accident, stroke, heart \nattack, broken hip, or diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease simply in order \nto catch a few who intentionally transfer assets. These provisions even \ngo after to middle-class Americans who make modest gifts to relatives \nlike their grandchildren or who contribute to charity. How can anyone \nexpect the average American who experiences a decline in their health \nyears after having made a contribution to charity or given their \ngrandchild some money toward a college fund to keep records on all of \nthis? People won't be able to document many of the things they will be \nrequired to so that families or nursing homes will end up eating the \nmoney during the period in which their loved ones are not qualified.\n  Lastly, the conference report negates a court decision concerning \ndisproportionate share payments. One of the lawsuits brought on this \nissue was brought by a number of Oregon hospitals. The result of \norturning the decision in this case is that many hospitals will be \nharmed because those people who are part section 1115 waivers as an \n``expansion population'' would no longer be counted for the purposes of \ncalculating Medicare disproportionate share payments. This harms safety \nnet hospitals.\n  There are many other reasons to reject this conference report, but \nthe truly harmful health care provisions stand out starkly among a sea \nof damaging provisions. These, alone, are reason enough to reject this \nbudget document.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the 2\\1/2\\ \nmillion grandparents acting as primary caregivers to their \ngrandchildren. The situation may occur as a result of a death in the \nfamily, a parent being away in the military, or the effect of abuse and \nneglect.\n  I commend grandparents and other relatives who step forward to care \nfor these children, often at great personal sacrifice, providing an \nalternative to foster care and giving them a safe, stable home. \nSupportive programs like subsidized guardianship help children exit \nfoster care into the permanent care of caring and nurturing relatives.\n  In my State of New Jersey, 8 percent of the children live with \nnonparent relatives. Grandparents and other relative caregivers are \noften the best chance for a loving and stable childhood for the \nchildren in their care, but their hard work and dedication often go \nunnoticed.\n  I am deeply saddened that today the Senate made cuts in the budget \nthat would deprive so many kinship caregivers of critical Federal \nsupport. We should be expanding support for these caregivers, not \nreducing it.\n  Mr. President, today I offer my formal acknowledgement and deepest \nappreciation for the ongoing service of\n\n[[Page S14216]]\n\nthese caregivers to our country and our Nation's most valuable asset, \nour children. I commend Generations United for their hard work in \nhelping improve the lives of our children.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, it has been said that a great test of \nmorality is what people do when they have power. The fast-track budget \nreconciliation rules mean that the majority party can essentially do \nwhatever it wants in a reconciliation bill if they act in lockstep. The \nreason is simple. Reconciliation debates in the Senate can only last 20 \nhours and the final version of the bill--a reconciliation conference \nreport--only can be debated for 10 hours.\n  The majority party can even orchestrate a single meeting with \nconferees and immediately gavel it over almost when it starts, doing \neverything behind-the-scenes with no consultation and without sharing \ndrafts of even sweeping policy changes in proposed major laws.\n  They not only can do such things, they just did them.\n  But let me start at the beginning. The President's budget proposal \nfor programs under the oversight of the Judiciary Committee, issued in \nFebruary of this year, called for a user fee on the manufacture and \nimportation of gunpowder and other explosives of two cents per pound. \nThe President requested that Congress enact these user fees--some \ncalled it a tax--to raise $600 million over the next five years. \nBecause of that White House proposal on gunpowder and other explosives, \nthe budget resolution of the other body called for the Judiciary \nCommittee to meet a target of $600 million.\n  The Senate-passed budget resolution did not require any cuts to be \nmade by the Judiciary Committee. This is the usual approach for the \nJudiciary Committee since the Committee controls few, yet very \nimportant, mandatory spending programs. For example, it is difficult to \nmake significant reductions to mandatory programs, including: pensions \nfor U.S. Judges; the Crime Victim's Trust Fund; salaries of U.S. \nMarshals; the Radiation Exposure Compensation Trust Fund; the Copyright \nOwners' Fund; the diversion control fee account of the Drug Enforcement \nAgency; border patrol salaries and expenses; the assets forfeiture fund \nfor U.S. Marshals, and other sources. It is also difficult to increase \nPatent and Trademark Office fees or Copyright Office fees since there \nis not a compelling reason to do so.\n  In the end, in order to comply with the budget resolution, the \nJudiciary Committee of the Senate and the Judiciary Committee of the \nother body were required to come up with $300 million in revenue or to \nmake $300 million in cuts.\n  The first casualty in this process was the White House proposal to \ntax gunpowder and other explosives. There was little support by the \nmajority party for even making half the President's proposed increases \nin the gunpowder tax. Many other alternatives were considered by the \nmajority party.\n  Finally, a proposal was worked out in the Judiciary Committee that \nhad my support, and the strong support of universities and many \nbusiness leaders. For example, the National Association of State \nUniversities and Land-Grant Colleges, Motorola, Oracle, Sun \nMicrosystems, Texas Instruments, Intel, Microsoft, Hewlett-Packard, \nQualcomm, for high-tech workers. The House also included immigration \nfees in their proposal.\n  However, after an aborted conference meeting which started at 9 p.m. \nlast Friday night, and ended a few minutes later, what has the Majority \nparty proposed as a compromise on the immigration fees? They came up \nwith increasing fees on all citizens to get into federal courts and \ninto bankruptcy court. The bankruptcy fee increase raises some ironies. \nThe increase in fees for citizens trying to seek judicial relief \nnarrows access to courts.\n  So we have gone from the President's proposal to tax gunpowder and \nother explosives and mysteriously ended up with a tax on citizens to \nget into federal court and bankruptcy court. Nevertheless, the majority \nparty--as long as they are in lockstep together--has nearly absolute \npower in a reconciliation bill that enjoys only limited debate. History \nwill record what they have done with that power.\n  What is especially unfortunate is that the version of the \nreconciliation bill reported out by the Senate Judiciary Committee, and \napproved by the full Senate by unanimous consent to the Budget \nReconciliation Act, was a bipartisan amendment offered by Senator \nSpecter and myself to allocate the extra $278,000,000 in revenue \nprovided from the Judiciary Committee markup on reconciliation to \nsupplement funding that is demonstrably needed for the Bulletproof Vest \nPartnership Fund, programs authorized by the Justice For All Act, and a \nCopyright Royalty Judges Program.\n  The Judiciary Committee markup on its reconciliation title provided \n$278,000,000 more in revenue than was mandated by the Budget Resolution \ninstructions.\n  The Specter-Leahy Senate proposal approved by the full Senate--would \nhave provided $60,000,000 over the next five years for such initiatives \nas the Bulletproof Vest Partnership Program, to help law enforcement \nagencies purchase or replace body armor for their rank-and-file \nofficers.\n  Recently, concerns over body armor safety surfaced when a \nPennsylvania police officer was shot and critically wounded through his \nnew vest outfitted with a material called Zylon, which is a registered \ntrademark. The Justice Department has since announced that Zylon fails \nto provide the intended level of ballistic resistance.\n  Unfortunately, an estimated 200,000 vests outfitted with that \nmaterial have been purchased--many with Bulletproof Vest Partnership \nfunds--and now must be replaced. Law enforcement agencies nationwide \nare struggling to find the funds necessary to replace defective vests \nwith ones that will actually stop bullets and save lives. Our Senate \nJudiciary provisions would have funded those efforts. Unfortunately, \nthe majority party dropped this language.\n  Our Senate Judiciary language--approved by the full Senate--also \nprovided more than $216,000,000 for programs authorized by the Justice \nFor All Act of 2004, a landmark law that enhances protections for \nvictims of Federal crimes, increases Federal resources available to \nState and local governments to combat crimes with DNA technology, and \nprovides safeguards to prevent wrongful convictions and executions.\n  The Senate Judiciary Committee language also would have funded \ntraining of criminal justice and medical personnel in the use of DNA \nevidence, including evidence for post-conviction DNA testing. It would \nhave promoted the use of DNA technology to identify missing persons. \nWith these funds, State and local authorities would have been better \nable to implement and enforce crime victims' rights laws, including \nFederal victim and witness assistance programs.\n  State and local governments would have been able to apply for grants \nto develop and implement victim notification systems to share \ninformation on criminal proceedings in a timely and efficient manner. \nThat language would have helped improve the quality of legal \nrepresentation provided to both indigent defendants and the public in \nState capital cases.\n  Last, but certainly not least, our amendment provided $6,500,000 over \nfive years for the Copyright Royalty Judges Program at the Library of \nCongress. The Copyright Royalty Distribution Reform Act of 2004 created \na new program in the Library to replace most of the current statutory \nresponsibilities of the Copyright Arbitration Royalty Panels program. \nThe Copyright Royalty Judges Program was supposed to determine \ndistributions of royalties that are disputed and set or adjust royalty \nrates, terms and conditions, with the exception of satellite carriers' \ncompulsory licenses. The Senate-passed language would have helped pay \nthe salaries and related expenses of the three royalty judges and three \nadministrative staff required by law to support this program.\n  Unfortunately, instead of raising more funds than we needed through \nwidely supported increases in immigration fees and using them for these \nlaw-enforcement and other programs we are instead going to increase the \ncost of access to federal courts and not fund any of these other \npriorities.\n  What may be the most troubling aspect of this abuse of power is that \nby substantially increasing fees to get\n\n[[Page S14217]]\n\ninto federal courts the majority party raised $253 million more in \nrevenue than it needed to meet the reconciliation target. That means \nthat all the above priorities in the Senate-passed bill including \nbulletproof vests for law enforcement, use of DNA technology to \nidentify missing persons, and better enforcement of crime victims' \nrights laws could have been included at only slightly reduced levels of \nsupport.\n  The Republican Congress has missed a great opportunity in this abuse \nof power.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I also must express my opposition to the \nirresponsible domestic budget policy that has been forwarded by the \nmajority party. The Senate is being asked to approve spending and \nbudget bills that make deep cuts to programs that serve some of our \ncountry's neediest citizens. A time of year typically signified by \nwishes of goodwill towards all, it is difficult to be anything but \noutraged by this attack on critical components of our social safety \nnet.\n  While many in the majority party have claimed that these bills are \nneeded in order to reduce the deficit, with the knowledge that the \nleadership will make passing massive tax cuts benefiting some of the \nwealthiest among us a priority during the next session, this argument \nis simply disingenuous.\n  Instead of putting the country on the road to fiscal security, these \nbills expose the agenda of the majority that blatantly undermines \nAmerican families and make clear where the priorities of the majority \nparty lie. It is not with the family that relies on Medicaid for their \nhealth insurance, the student who, without student aid, cannot afford \nto attend college, or the mother who needs childcare so that she can go \nto work and put food on the table for her family. Nor is it with the \nsingle mother who has been abandoned without child support, the \ngrandparent raising their grandchild on a fixed income, or the worker \nwho has lost his or her job and is trying to be retrained.\n  No, the priorities of this majority party consistently lie with the \npowerful special interests and big drug companies. At every opportunity \nthe Republican leadership has had to choose between supporting the \nAmerican people or wealthy corporate interests, and they have sided \nwith the corporate interests. Even by the standards of this first \nsession of the 109th Congress, with the consistent erosion of consumer \nprotections and support for American working families, these bills sink \nto new lows. As a result, dozens of health, education, labor, and human \nservices programs will be cut and millions of people who rely on these \nprograms will suffer.\n  Some of the most egregious policies in these bills expose the \ndisparity between the treatment of big drug companies and those \nindividuals who must rely on Medicaid as their primary form of health \ncare. With numerous options on the table, the Republican leadership \nchose to use the budget reconciliation bill to increase Medicaid co-\npayments and premiums, potentially eliminated federal standards for \ncomprehensive Medicaid care, and created highly restrictive rules \ngoverning the transfer of assets for those who require care in a \nnursing home. Rather than do away with an unnecessary multi-billion \ndollar slush fund for insurers and drug companies, a small group of \nCongressional budget writers has chosen to freeze home health payments \nthat ensure seniors are able to receive care in the comfort of their \nown homes.\n  In addition, this year's Labor, Health and Human Services, Labor-HHS, \nappropriations bill shortchanges our country's rural health programs. \nFor instance, the bill eliminates five programs, including funding for \nRural EMS and Health Education Training Centers, which are critical to \nthe fragile network of the rural health care infrastructure.\n  One of the most disappointing aspects of the Labor-HHS Bill was the \ntreatment of the National Institutes of Health, NIH. Not since 1970 has \nthe NIH been provided an increase as small as the one contained in this \nbill. As a result, the vital medical research being done around the \ncountry, including in my home state at the University of Vermont, will \nsuffer. The search for cures to innumerable diseases will be slowed and \nforeign competitors will be given a chance to exploit our short-\nsightedness.\n  Not only will this Congress take the step of cutting education for \nthe first time in ten years, these will be the biggest cuts in history \nto student loan programs. A remarkable $12.7 billion will be cut from \nstudent aid programs so that there will be no increase to the Pell \nGrant for an astonishing fourth year in a row. While making changes to \neliminate loopholes in student loan lending laws, it appears that small \nlenders that specialize in providing comprehensive loan counseling to \nstudents have been given short-shrift. It appears that from almost \nevery angle, students are assaulted by these policies.\n  For those education programs that are lucky enough to escape the \nknife, they will either be frozen or given minimal increases. I am \ncurious to know how our Nation's schools can be expected to meet and \nexceed the standards set forth in the No Child Left Behind Act, when \nCongress is content to slash funding by three percent, leaving these \nprograms to sink more than $13 billion below their authorized levels. \nIt has been almost 5 years since Congress passed this legislation, and \nwe have consistently failed to meet our commitment to students, parents \nand teachers.\n  In what is becoming a hallmark of this Republican leadership, these \nconference reports are loaded down with controversial legislation \napproved by neither body. Despite bipartisan support for legislation \napproved by the Senate Finance Committee earlier this year, Senators \nare being asked to approve a five-year reauthorization of the Temporary \nAssistance to Needy Families Program that would impose strict new \nworking requirements with only nominal new funding for child care \nsupport. At the same time Congress asks single mothers to work longer \nhours, it cuts money for child support enforcement, dollars that are \nused to track down deadbeat dads.\n  Though it is a sad commentary on the current state of affairs when \none of the lone bright spots for health and human service programs is \nthat this bill includes no cuts to the Food Stamp program, I would be \nremiss if I did not mention my appreciation that this program remained \nunscathed. While protecting Food Stamps should be hailed as a victory, \nthe Community Food and Nutrition Program, a modestly sized program that \nhelps support anti-hunger advocacy groups, was not so fortunate. The \nwork being done on the local levels by these groups is extremely \nimportant, and it is my hope that these funds will be restored next \nyear.\n  The programs and services I have mentioned are but a few of the \ndozens of cuts that will negatively impact families across the country. \nAs we usher out the final days of 2005 and the 1st Session of the 109th \nCongress, I am saddened that the last actions of this body will be to \npass such harmful bills. After more than 30 years in the Senate, I know \nthat we can do better and it is my sincere hope that when we return \nnext year, we will reverse the wayward direction set by such policies \nand implemented by such legislation.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, for most Americans, the holiday season is a \ntime for giving. But for the Congress, it seems, the holiday season is \nalso a time for taking, at least judging by the budget reconciliation \nlegislation before this body.\n  Americans around the country, are concerned about their economic \nsecurity. Whether they work in a factory or behind a desk, they are \nfeeling increasingly vulnerable to the volatilities of the global \neconomy. While American families are concerned about economic security, \nthis budget reconciliation legislation would cut the safety net that \nprotects them. The burden would fall most heavily on working Americans, \nin particular, on low-income parents and children, the elderly, and \npeople with disabilities. Moreover, while supporters of this bill cite \nfiscal discipline as the rationale for making harmful cuts, when this \nbill is considered in combination with its companion tax reconciliation \nlegislation, the total package would increase the deficit rather than \nreduce it. For these reasons I cannot support this funding cut \nreconciliation bill.\n  I have been a strong proponent of fiscal responsibility throughout my \nservice in this body. I have introduced and supported pay-as-you go \nbudget rules; supported the landmark Gramm-Rudman-Hollings budget \nprocess reforms;\n\n[[Page S14218]]\n\nand, during the 1990's, voted to balance the budget for the first time \nin 30 years. This budget reconciliation legislation, does not advance \nthe cause of fiscal responsibility. Every penny saved in funding cuts \nand then some will be spent on new tax breaks, most of which will \nbenefit a small number of affluent individuals who neither need nor \nseek such reckless largesse from their leaders in Washington. The \nSenate has already approved $60 billion worth of tax cuts over the next \n5 years, and the House has approved more than $90 billion.\n  Under the Bush administration, our National debt has grown from $5.7 \ntrillion to more than $8 trillion. The portion of that debt held by \nforeign creditors has more than doubled. And our Federal budget has \nfallen from a $236 billion surplus in 2000 to a $319 billion deficit in \n2005. The Republican budget reconciliation package would only make this \nrecord of fiscal recklessness worse.\n  The cuts in this bill, if enacted, would make it harder for working \nAmericans to find a job and afford such basic needs as health care and \nchild care. At a time when international competition demands that we \ninvest in our people and our society, this bill radically scales back \nour Nation's crucial commitments. At a time when we should be expanding \naccess to higher education for all Americans, this bill puts college \nfurther out of reach for many students. And at a time when many \nbusinesses and millions of Americans cannot afford even the most basic \nhealth care coverage, this bill passes the buck, and the burden of \npaying, onto those who are already struggling to afford care. Instead \nof offering solutions, this bill offers more lip service to a failed, \npartisan ideological agenda that weakens our Nation's long-term \nstrength.\n  Perhaps most controversially, the bill before us would make the \nbiggest changes to Temporary Assistance to Needy Families, TANF, policy \nsince 1996, going even beyond the provisions in the House-passed \nreconciliation bill. The Republican majority hopes to ram through these \nchanges without any debate or consideration by this body. This is no \nway to run a country by not just ignoring those in the minority, but \nactively trampling over dissenting views.\n  Children in low-income families will suffer the most. This section of \nthe bill creates new, unrealistic work requirements for TANF recipients \nthat would effectively amount to a backdoor way of cutting funds. It \nauthorizes $2.5 billion less this year for child care than what is \nnecessary to keep pace with inflation, which, over the next 10 years, \nwill create a more than $11 billion shortfall and cause an estimated \n255,000 children to lose care. It cuts child support enforcement, which \nwill reduce child support collections by $8.4 billion over 10 years. \nAnd it completely eliminates Federal foster care support for \ngrandparents and other relatives who care for children who have been \nabused or neglected and removed from their parents.\n  These cuts reflect a fundamental lack of understanding by the \nRepublican majority of the struggles most Americans face every day. \nMoreover, they are based upon a faulty economic rationale. Though our \noverall economy grew somewhat between 2000 and 2004, those who \nbenefited from that growth are mostly at the top of the income pyramid. \nIndeed, the number of children living below one-half of the poverty \nline rose by nearly 1.5 million. Somewhere, the link has been broken, \nand not all families are sharing in our Nation's economic growth. \nInstead of looking for solutions, the cuts in this bill would \nexacerbate the problems faced with courage every day by American \nfamilies. If history is any guide, the families forced off of TANF \nwould be those who, without a lifeline, are the most likely to fall \ninto deep poverty. Child care assistance helps working parents keep \ntheir jobs and parents who have lost their jobs find new ones. If \nadequate child care and other supports are not available to low-income \nworkers, the TANF rolls will increase again. We would be taking a step \nbackward in helping people move from welfare to work. We should be \nconstantly innovating and strengthening our policies in this area, not \nblindly cutting them in favor of unaffordable tax policies, as this \nreconciliation package would do.\n  In addition, this reconciliation bill would also reduce health care \ncoverage and increase costs for some of the most vulnerable members of \nour society. Most troublingly, this conference agreement proposes to \nincrease co-payments and premiums for Americans who rely on Medicaid \nfor their health care. Under this agreement, low-income Medicaid \nbeneficiaries would be forced to pay more for their needed health care \nservices and medicines. This, despite the fact that a recognized and \ngrowing body of evidence demonstrates that ill Medicaid beneficiaries \nwill likely forego medical treatment in the face of increases in co-\npayments. Such decisions often lead to greater health problems, and \nlarger health care costs, later on. On top of these co-payment \nincreases, this package will additionally allow States to increase the \npremiums that Medicaid beneficiaries must pay to enroll in the program \nin the first place.\n  Also deeply troubling about this agreement is its granting to States \nthe ability to decrease the scope of their Medicaid programs. The \nFederal Government currently requires State Medicaid programs to adhere \nto a set of standards that ensure comprehensive health care coverage \nfor Medicaid beneficiaries. This agreement will significantly lower \nthese standards and will allow States to lessen needed coverage for \nthose most in need.\n  As alarming as these provisions are, just as galling is what this \nbill lacks. The Senate-passed reconciliation package rightly contained \ntwo significant and cost-saving provisions that are absent from the \npackage currently before us. First, the Senate bill sought to increase \nthe rebates that pharmaceutical manufacturers must pay the Federal \nGovernment for medicines provided to Medicaid beneficiaries. Second, \nthe same bill achieved $10 billion in savings by eliminating the so-\ncalled ``stabilization'' fund designed to encourage preferred provider \norganizations to participate in the Medicare program. Both of these \nvaluable provisions have gone missing in this conference agreement.\n  Finally, in addition to weakening the safety net that allows \nAmericans to weather tough times, this budget reconciliation \nlegislation also shortchanges the millions of families trying to send \ntheir children to college. It provides no general increase in need-\nbased aid. Instead, it limits the increase to a narrowly defined subset \nof students who may or may not demonstrate as much need as their peers. \nIn fact, there are so many restrictions on who qualifies for the \nincreased Pell funds that I question how many students will actually \nreceive it.\n  This version of reconciliation also ignores a number of other \nprovisions that were important to the Senate: loan forgiveness for \nchild care workers, protections as we open up distance learning, and \nmore consumer information for students that are consolidating loans. \nAll of these provisions have disappeared. Instead we are left with a \nnarrowly crafted bill that does not help all students achieve their \ncollege dreams. In my opinion, this bill represents a lost opportunity \nfor students and a lost opportunity for this body to assist them.\n  The conference agreement before us today ignores the values and \nconcerns of ordinary Americans. Instead of investing our resources \nintelligently in the priorities that will make America strong and \nsecure into the future like education, health care and the fight \nagainst terrorism it weakens important safety net provisions, decreases \nhealth care coverage and increases cost burdens, and reduces access to \nhigher education. America needs priorities that reflect our values as a \ncountry and that prepare our people, especially our children, for a \nfuture of freedom, prosperity and security. Regrettably, this \nreconciliation legislation falls far short.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, the spending cut bill before us is \nshameful. I have always said that it is my job to look out for the day-\nto-day needs of Marylanders and the long-term needs of the Nation. I am \nsorry to say this bill does neither. In the holiday season, this bill \nmakes draconian spending cuts in critically important programs. This is \nnot done for balancing the budget, which I support. It is done to pay \nfor more tax cuts to the superwealthy.\n  These spending cuts don't only hurt hard-working Americans. They chip\n\n[[Page S14219]]\n\naway at the very foundation of the American dream and do so at the \nworst possible time. For example, we face unprecedented challenges from \nincreased global competition. Our country has always had the ability to \nrise above these challenges because of America's incredible capacity to \ninnovate. It is our responsibility to empower Americans to innovate. \nUnfortunately, this bill represents the wrong priorities for this \ncountry, not those held by the vast majority of Americans.\n  Nowhere do individual and national priorities more closely converge \nthan funding for education. Education has always been our country's \ngreatest engine for climbing the ladder of opportunity. It is also the \ngreatest engine for our national aspiration: that each generation will \nhave a better life than the one that came before. International trade \nand outsourcing have already shuttered several of our industries and \nthreaten to do the same to others. Other countries are investing \nheavily to train and educate their people. They are manufacturing \nproducts less expensively than could be done here at home, often due to \ntheir weak labor and environmental protections. That is why we must \npreserve America's remarkable lead in the amazing race to innovate. To \ndo this, we must realize that innovation starts with a well-educated \npopulation.\n  Unfortunately, this bill makes the biggest cuts to student loan \nprograms in history. For the fourth year in a row, the maximum Pell \ngrant will remain the same. And while Pell grants stagnate, interest \nrates for student loans will increase. Republicans have also made it \nmore difficult for students to consolidate their loans so that they \nwill end up paying more for college. So not only is there less student \naid available but this bill actually makes it tougher to qualify for \nneed-based aid so that it will only go to a small group of students, \ndecreasing the number of low-income people who are eligible to receive \naid. It also gives private lenders and banks an unfair advantage over \nmore cost efficient Federal loan programs, which increases costs for \ntaxpayers.\n  These cuts couldn't come at a worse time. College tuition is on the \nrise and financial aid isn't keeping up. Pell grants cover only 40 \npercent of average costs at a 4-year public college. Twenty years ago, \nthey covered 80 percent. Our students are graduating with so much debt \nit is like their first mortgage. College is part of the American dream; \nit shouldn't be part of the American financial nightmare. Families are \nlooking for help. And I am sad to say the Republicans don't offer them \nmuch hope. This bill has all the wrong priorities. Instead of easing \nthe burden on middle-class families and increasing student aid for all \nstudents, they want to help out big business cronies with lavish tax \nbreaks.\n  We need to do more to help middle-class families afford college. We \nneed to increase the maximum Pell grant to $4,500 and double it over \nthe next 6 years. We need to make sure student loans are affordable. \nAnd we need a bigger tuition tax credit for the families in the middle \nwho aren't eligible for Pell grants but still can't afford college.\n  My family believed in the American dream. They believed there is no \nbarrier to having hopes. Through hard work and sacrifice, everyone \nshould be able to pursue a higher education. But belief in the American \ndream is shrinking. There is not a dream deficit, there is a wallet \ndeficit. There is not a talent deficit, there is an opportunity \ndeficit. And at a time when the opportunity ladder is already creaky \nand shaky, the Republicans are trying to tear down this ladder by \nmaking massive cuts to student aid. Sadly, this will cripple our \nNation's ability to innovate and compete in the global market.\n  Those aren't the only bad things in this bill. It also slashes health \ncare. I believe that every American should have the right to affordable \nhealth care, especially as they get old and need it the most. \nUnfortunately, this conference report cuts a net $6.9 billion in \nexisting Medicaid spending. This will force beneficiaries to pay higher \npremiums and receive less health care coverage.\n  I am particularly alarmed by the bill's changes to eligibility for \nlong-term care coverage for elderly Americans needing care. This bill \nwould require the government to look back at a senior's assets for the \npast 5 years and consider the value of their home to be eligible for \nlong-term care. This is unfair. We should be supporting our elders, not \npunishing them.\n  And that is not all. As temperatures drop and heating prices rise, \nthis bill will literally leave Marylanders and Americans in the cold. \nOil companies are now making record profits. Republicans beat back each \nof our attempts to eliminate tax giveaways to these same companies. Now \nenergy prices are soaring and the bill falls $1.3 billion short in \nfunding the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program. LIHEAP helps \nhard-working Americans afford to stay warm. But it won't have enough \nfunds to do this next year.\n  The reconciliation bill also suspends important Federal housing \nprograms that preserve affordable housing. Republicans are prioritizing \nadditional tax cuts for the superwealthy by killing a program to \npreserve affordable housing for working families. They too will be left \nout in the cold. The Millennium Housing Commission cited a lack of \naffordable housing as the primary cause of homelessness. So here again, \nthe spending cut bill serves to squash our aspirations.\n  When many of our families first moved to the United States, they were \ndrawn to the promise of a better life--the ``American dream.'' They \ncould aspire to a better life for themselves, their families, and their \nkids. They knew that hard work could make that dream a reality. For \nmany generations, this country allowed each generation to be better off \nthan the one before it. If we follow the course laid out before us \ntoday, our children are not going to be able to say the same thing.\n  Mr. President, America can do better. We must look out for both the \nday-to-day needs of those who have elected us and also the Nation's \nlong-term interests. This bill does neither. I strongly oppose this \nbill and urge my colleagues to do the same.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, as we all know, the Budget Reconciliation \nAct contains an appalling number of devastating cuts that will hurt \nmillions of Americans. But I do commend the conferees for including the \nFamily Opportunity Act, which will remove the barriers in current law \nthat penalize families struggling to stay together and make ends meet \nwhen their children have high health costs because of disabilities.\n  For the past 6 years, Senator Grassley and I have worked with many \nparents and leaders in communities across the country to reach this \nmilestone. Countless parents, family members, citizens, friends, \nneighbors, and colleagues face this problem today. As they make very \nclear, the Nation is failing families with severely disabled children \nby not giving them access to the health care they need to stay home and \nlive in their communities. Many of them have been on the front lines in \nraising the Nation's awareness of their plight, and they have been \nfearless and tireless warriors for justice, and this legislation could \nnot have happened without them. Today, their long wait is nearly over.\n  The Family Opportunity Act is for them. It allows families of \nchildren with severe disabilities to purchase health care coverage \nunder Medicaid, without first having to impoverish themselves or give \nup custody of their disabled children.\n  Almost 1 in 10 children in America has significant disabilities. But \nmany do not have access to even the most basic health care they need, \nbecause their private health insurance won't cover them. Often, their \nneeds are treated as ``exclusions'' in their policies--no coverage for \nhearing aids, for services related to mental retardation, for physical \ntherapy, for services at school, and on and on.\n  That is why this legislation is so important--these children will now \nhave access to these needed services and have a genuine opportunity at \nleast to achieve full potential.\n  When we think of disabled children, we tend to think of them as \ndisabled from birth. But fewer than 10 percent of such children are \nborn with their disabilities. A bicycle accident or a serious fall or \nillness can suddenly disable even the healthiest of children. Many of \nthem with significant disabilities do not have access to even the most \nbasic health services, because their families can't afford them.\n\n[[Page S14220]]\n\n  No longer will these families be forced to become poor, stay poor, or \neven do the unthinkable by putting their children in institutions or \ngiving up custody of them, so that their children can qualify for \nMedicaid.\n  Families of special needs children often have to turn down jobs, turn \ndown raises, or turn down overtime pay to keep a child eligible for \nbenefits under Medicaid.\n  No longer will parents be forced to give up their children or give up \nbeing part of our Nation's economy.\n  This bill will change the life of 13-year-old Alice in Oklahoma, who \nwas disabled because of multiple dystrophy. Under this bill, she will \nbe able to have a personal assistant living at home with her family. \nShe will be able to go to her neighborhood school.\n  This bill will change the life of Johnny in Indiana, who has a severe \nmental illness and needs numerous mental health therapies and drugs. \nHis mother will no longer be forced to give up custody of him in order \nto obtain the treatment he needs. Her goal of being a productive \ncitizen and keeping her son at home will no longer be denied because \nher son will now have the health care and support he needs.\n  This bill will transform the life of Abby in Massachusetts, who is 6 \nyears old and has multiple disabilities. Her parents are deeply \nconcerned about her future if the existing buy-in State program for \nMedicaid is weakened. Without the buy-in, her parents would be \nbankrupted by her current medical bills. Now Abby and her family will \nhave real opportunity to grow and work and prosper.\n  The legislation also gives States greater flexibility to enable \nchildren with mental health disabilities to obtain the health care they \nneed in order to live at home and in their communities, instead of \nbeing placed in institutions.\n  It establishes Family to Family Information Centers in each State to \nhelp parents find the resources they need to meet the unique health \ncare requests of their disabled children.\n  Six years ago this week, President Clinton signed the Ticket to Work \nAct into law. That legislation demonstrates our commitment to give \nadults with disabilities the right to lead independent and productive \nlives, without giving up their health care.\n  Today we make the same commitment to children with disabilities and \ntheir families.\n  These provisions will undoubtedly be among the most important bills \npassed by this Senate. It closes the health care gap for the Nation's \nmost vulnerable population, and enables families of disabled children \nto be equal participants in the American dream. It will truly change \nlives, and I commend my colleagues in both the House and the Senate on \nboth sides of the aisle for their dedicated and their leadership that \nhave made this day possible at long last.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, last week I came before this body to \nhighlight the potentially harmful effects of budget reconciliation on \nour Nation's working families. I asked my colleagues to hold firm \nagainst the special interests in order to protect the Federal guarantee \nof Medicaid benefits for the 50 million Americans who depend on this \nvital program for health care. When the Medicaid motion to instruct \nconferees passed by a vote of 75 to 16, I thought the Senate was \nserious about preserving access to health coverage for children, \npregnant women, the elderly, and disabled across our country.\n  However, my hope quickly faded when the budget reconciliation \nconference report was released earlier this week. Instead of providing \nmore assistance to families in need, the reconciliation conference \nreport includes even greater cuts than those passed in the House of \nRepresentatives to vital safety net programs like Medicaid.\n  Under this conference bill, the early and periodic screening, \ndiagnostic, and treatment, EPSDT, benefit, which provides children with \naccess to necessary immunizations, checkups, and preventive services, \nis eliminated. This means that low-income children--no matter how \npoor--will no longer be guaranteed vision, hearing and dental \nscreenings; coverage for eyeglasses; therapy services, medical \nequipment that will allow them to attend school; or any other Medicaid \nservices. Without access to this comprehensive benefit, many children \nwill not get the vital medical care they need and will develop medical \nconditions that could have been prevented.\n  The reconciliation language also begins to erode Federal laws \nprotecting Medicaid recipients from burdensome cost-sharing. Under this \nbill, States would be allowed to index nominal cost sharing amounts by \nmedical inflation, which grows at least twice as fast as wages. States \nwould also be allowed to charge co-insurance up to four times higher \nthan the 5 percent co-insurance allowed today. This means that Medicaid \nbeneficiaries could pay as much as 20 percent of the cost of any \nMedicaid service--which for some would consume their entire monthly \nincome. Such cost-sharing requirements are unacceptable for a safety-\nnet program designed to help working families when times get tough.\n  This bill gives States the green light to vary benefit packages based \non factors such as geography and disease. If enacted, Medicaid \nrecipients will no longer have equal protection under the law. Instead, \nresidents in rural areas of a State could receive fewer Medicaid \nbenefits than those living in more populated, urban areas. Individuals \nwith diseases that are expensive to treat may receive a narrower set of \nbenefits than those with diseases that are less expensive to treat. \nAnd, if residents and diseases are treated differently in a State, then \nproviders can also be reimbursed differently depending on their \ngeographic location and the types of patients they treat. Such a \nhaphazard benefit system will lead to more emergency room visits by \nbeneficiaries and decreased provider participation in the Medicaid \nprogram. It would appear that, for some of my colleagues on the other \nside of the aisle, the vote in favor of the motion to instruct \nconferees was nothing more than a procedural motion--more rhetoric than \nsubstance, more posturing than true concern--because many of the \nMedicaid provisions included in the budget reconciliation package got \neven worse after the Senate voted overwhelmingly in opposition to \nincreased beneficiary cost-sharing, barriers to eligibility and \nenrollment, and any other provisions that would undermine the Federal \nguarantee of Medicaid coverage.\n  In all my time in the Senate, I cannot remember a time when we have \nconsidered such drastic cuts to safety-net programs that threaten to \ndevastate working families. These are families who struggle to eat and \npay their bills, let alone pay for much needed health care services; \nfamilies of limited means who have done their best to contribute to a \nsystem that is now essentially turning its back on them. The cuts \ncontained in this budget reconciliation conference report are \nreprehensible.\n  This country has a moral obligation to help our fellow Americans in \ntheir time of need. We should not offer billions of dollars in \nadditional giveaways to the wealthiest Americans and special interests \nat the expense of working families already struggling to make ends \nmeet.\n  I believe we can do better. Hard-working Americans deserve better; \nlow-income children deserve better; the elderly, the disabled and \nparents who want to see their children go to college and succeed \ndeserve better. We have a responsibility, Mr. President, and I would \nhope we would live up to that responsibility.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I am pleased that we have passed the \nDeficit Reduction Act today. It is a good first step to curbing run \naway spending in our entitlement programs, and it provides essential \nMedicaid relief to hurricane victims in my state.\n  However, I am deeply concerned with the provision in the bill that \nrepeals the Continued Dumping and Subsidy Offset Act, also known as the \nByrd amendment. Many of my colleague and I signed a letter to the \nconferees urging that this repeal be excluded from the final bill. This \nimportant law helps counter unfair trade practices of other countries \nby using revenues from duties collected to compensate injured \nindustries. In Louisiana, most of our seafood industries have been \nseverely affected by illegal dumping from China and other nations, and \nthe Byrd amendment is one of the few things that could effective help \nthe families in these industries, who are now also reeling from \nHurricanes Katrina and Rita,\n\n[[Page S14221]]\n\nto survive in their business and maintain our unique culture and way of \nlife.\n  I have been very frustrated with the Commerce Department and the \nCustoms Department efforts to comply with the Byrd amendment as it \nstands now. Commerce does not properly set the duty collection rates, \nand Customs is severely lax in collecting tariffs that are due. Seafood \ntariffs uncollected stand at over $200 million from China alone right \nnow. As these tariffs are not collected as they should be, illegal \ndumping continues, and our seafood and other industries are not being \npaid what they are due under the law.\n  This bill supposedly has a phase out of CDSOA for 2 years, in which \npending cases are supposed to be paid. I fear with the current record \nof collections and distribution, this 2 year phaseout won't give much \nrelief. I do not feel that this phaseout is adequate, and the repeal \nthis important law should not have been included in this bill. It is \nnot right to use industries that are victims of illegal trade practices \nto carry a large burden of balancing the budget.\n  I urge my colleagues to help me force the bureaucrats to do their \nwork, collect these tariffs, and make the already due payments under \nthe Byrd amendment. While the law may be unwisely repealed in this \nbill, the previously due payment should be paid and paid quickly.\n  Mr. GREGG. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I believe the Democrat leader spelled out how that \ntime will be used.\n  At this point, I ask unanimous consent that the time on our side be \ndivided as follows: Senator Murkowski, 5 minutes; Senator Cochran, 2 \nminutes; Senator Lott, 3 minutes; Senator Domenici, 5 minutes; Senator \nGregg, 5 minutes; Senator Stevens be given the last 5 minutes of the \ndebate; and 5 minutes to be designated by Senator Stevens.\n  The VICE PRESIDENT. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I thank colleagues for their cooperation \nduring the consideration of budget reconciliation. I especially thank \nthe staffs on both sides, who spent several sleepless nights working on \nthis matter. I very much thank my staff director, Mary Naylor, and all \nof my staff for their extraordinary effort.\n  I also salute my colleague, the chairman of the Committee on the \nBudget, for his professionalism as we considered the matter. Special \nthanks to his staff, as well. I know this has been an extraordinarily \ntrying period. We appreciate so much the effort and work they put into \nit.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I join the Senator from North Dakota in \nespecially thanking our staffs, most of whom have not slept for a \nseries of nights. They have done an exceptional job, led by Scott Gudes \non our side and, obviously, Mary on the Democrat side. We have staff \nwho put in huge hours to make us look effective and efficient around \nhere, and they do an extraordinary job on our behalf.\n  I also thank the Senator from North Dakota. This bill has reappeared \nin the Senate sort of like Haley's Comet: it comes through about every \n3 months as we try to deal with it and move forward in the \nreconciliation budget process. In each instance, the Senator from North \nDakota has been extraordinarily professional, has moved forward in what \nI consider to be the tradition of this Senate, which is comity and \ncooperation, in order to make the Senate accomplish its business. I \nonly wish he had more charts.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/12/21/senate-section/article/S14221-2", "month": "12", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14221-S14233]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2006--CONFERENCE REPORT--\n                                Resumed\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, there will now \nbe 1 hour of debate equally divided between the two leaders or their \ndesignees on H.R. 2863. The time has been allocated by the two leaders. \nThe first will be designated to Senator Feingold who is recognized for \n2 minutes.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I hope today the Senate will side with \nrules, history, and future when it is time for this Senate to go on \nrecord as to whether it is okay to break the rules to do something you \ncannot otherwise get done.\n  My colleagues know I do not support drilling in the Arctic Refuge. \nBut this is not simply a debate about oil, wildlife, and energy policy. \nThe debate we are having and the vote we are about to have is about how \nthis institution and this democracy operate. Some have said there is \nprecedent for violating rule XXVIII. My response is simple: Abusing the \nprocess and breaking the rules in the past does not justify doing so \nnow, especially knowing it was a mistake.\n  We worked in a bipartisan fashion to reinstate these very rules in \n2000. We did this because these rules are designed to protect all of us \nagainst abuses of power. If Senators do not stand up to the current and \nvery troubling tactics we are seeing, what hope is there of stopping \nfuture attempts to hijack other legislation to pass proposals that \ncannot stand on their own merits?\n  There are clearly Members who are determined to open the Arctic \nRefuge to drilling. I suspect every Member also has a couple of things \nwe desperately want signed into law. However, we have a responsibility \nto respect the rules and traditions of the Senate. I urge my colleagues \nto vote against cloture and to vote to uphold the rules of this \ninstitution in which we are honored to serve.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Senator Boxer is recognized for 2 minutes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, if this Senate is going to operate and \nfunction, it has to follow its own rules. It is very obvious that \nincluding drilling in a wildlife refuge in a military bill is not \nfollowing our own rules. It is no wonder the people in the country are \ncynical. It is wrong to do this.\n  Members should stand on line, do it the right way. If Members want a \nbill passed, do it the right way. This is not a Senate where one person \ncan dictate how things get done.\n  I hope the Senate would understand when you are discussing a wildlife \nrefuge, which was first set aside by President Eisenhower, that we \nwould do better than putting it into a military bill\n\n[[Page S14222]]\n\nthat is a must-pass piece of legislation. I am very pleased that \nSenator Stevens said if he does not get his way on this, and the Senate \ndecides not to include it here, that we will be able to strip that \nprovision and get those funds where they need to go, to our troops.\n  I am very pleased about that. I hope the Senate will speak strongly \nin a bipartisan way and vote ``no'' on cloture.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New Mexico, Mr. Bingaman, \nis recognized for 3 minutes.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I speak briefly in opposition to the \nmotion to invoke cloture.\n  The point I want to make, which has not been made to an adequate \nextent here, is that the provisions to open the Arctic Wildlife Refuge \nthat are contained in this conference report are very different from \nwhat the Senate adopted in the budget reconciliation. In fact, the \nversion of the legislation that is before us has never passed the \nHouse. It has never passed the Senate. It has been substantially \nchanged from what we previously sought.\n  First, the Department of Defense conference report language limits \nthe ability of the Secretary to protect environmentally sensitive areas \nin the Coastal Plain to only 45,000 acres out of the 1.5 million-acre \nCoastal Plain. It cuts off the ability of the Secretary to withhold \nlands from leasing under other authority.\n  In addition, the language that is before us requires the Secretary to \noffer for lease no less than 200,000 acres of the Coastal Plain within \n22 months of the date of enactment. That is new.\n  In addition, there are provisions with regard to judicial review that \nare new and unprecedented. Unlike the budget reconciliation language, \nthe conference report prohibits review of a secretarial action in a \ncivil or criminal enforcement proceeding of any action that the \nSecretary takes subject to judicial review under these provisions.\n  In addition, there is a new presumption put forth in this language \nthat the Secretary's preferred action related to any lease sale is \ncorrect unless otherwise provided by clear and convincing evidence.\n  We should not be taking this action. We should clearly not be taking \nthis action as part of a Defense appropriations bill, which is very \nmuch needed in order to provide the resources for our troops in harm's \nway today. I urge my colleagues to oppose cloture on this provision, on \nthis conference report as it is currently constituted. We can come back \nat a time when we can actually look at the provisions we are being \nforced to vote on and consider them on their merits.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Senator Lieberman is recognized for 3 \nminutes.\n  Since he is not here, who seeks recognition?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, is there a quorum call in effect?\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. No, there is not.\n  Mr. REID. Whose time is running now?\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The minority has one-half hour, as we \nunderstand it, and the time is running against that one-half hour.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Will the Senator repeat herself, please.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Parliamentary inquiry.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Washington.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Is the agreement to have the time evenly divided \nbetween both sides and no specific request for how the sequencing of \ntime is allocated under the order?\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, there is an hour \ndivided between the two leaders. The leader had designated that time. \nThe first designation was made, but it is not--it is equally divided. \nThere is no sequence.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, if the Senator from Washington will yield, I \nthink what we would like is maybe to have some back-and-forth debate \nhere. I am wondering if there is someone on the majority side who \nwishes to speak at this time and can use their time. There is somebody \nhere who could yield that time, I am sure.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Alaska is recognized for \n5 minutes.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, thank you.\n  It is December 21. This is the shortest day of the year. On Alaska's \nNorth Slope today, it is pretty dark. The Sun went down, I was told, \nNovember 18 at 1:40 p.m. It is not going to rise again until January 23 \nat 1:01 p.m. Today's weather forecast on the North Slope is for it to \nbe about 30 degrees below zero. Most of us would be hunkering down and \nhiding out from the cold and the dark. But right now Alaska's North \nSlope and the oil activities are humming because this is the time of \nyear we do our work up there. And why do we do it? Do we do it because \nwe like the cold, we like to be in the cold and in the dark? No. We do \nit because this is how we provide for the protections for the area. We \nexplore and we work when the tundra is frozen. This is when we build \nthe ice bridges. This is when we do the exploration. We do it because \nwe care for the environment up there.\n  It hurts to hear some of the discussion and some of the argument and \nsome of the misinformation about how we in Alaska derive our resources, \nhow we pull the oil from the ground up North. We have been providing \nabout 20 percent of this Nation's domestic oil from Prudhoe Bay for the \npast 30 years, and we have been doing a good job of it. We have been \nproviding not only for the environment, we have been providing the \njobs, and we have been providing the revenues. We have been helping \nthis country in an effort to keep our balance of payments from booming \neven more than they already are. We are doing what this country needs \nwhen it comes to domestic production. We need the authorization of the \nCongress to do more, to open this small area up on the Coastal Plain to \noil exploration and development.\n  There has been some discussion that in this bill, in the Defense \nbill, we are opening up in excess of the 2,000 acres we have agreed \nupon. The language is very clear. It says: 2,000 acres. It does not \nallow for the Natives to add additional acreage on top of the 2,000. It \nis a 2,000-acre limitation.\n  There has also been some challenge or some suggestion by the minority \nleader that somehow with this legislation the judicial review has been \nchanged or altered in some way that would lesson the judicial review. \nThat is absolutely not correct. There have been technical corrections \nin this legislation that differ from the earlier legislation that was \nintroduced, but the judicial review remains in place.\n  There has been some suggestion that the State of Alaska will sue for \na 90-percent share of the revenues rather than the 50-50 share.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \na letter signed by the Attorney General of the State of Alaska that \nclearly provides that the issue has been settled in terms of the 50-50 \nsplit because the issue has been appealed all the way to the U.S. \nSupreme Court. The State considers the decision by the U.S. Court of \nFederal Claims to be settled law. So those arguments people will make \nthat we should not move forward with opening ANWR at this point in time \nare simply not true.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         State of Alaska, Department of Law, Office of the \n           Attorney General\n                                 Anchorage, AK, December 20, 2005.\n     Senator Ted Stevens,\n     Hart Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Stevens: You have requested our response to a \n     question that has arisen regarding the State of Alaska's \n     previous claims against the federal government over oil \n     revenues due to the State under the Alaska Statehood Act.\n       In 1993, the State sued the federal government over the \n     right arising out of the Alaska Statehood Act to mineral \n     revenues from federal leases. The State argued that the \n     Statehood Act constituted a contract that entitled Alaska to \n     90% of gross mineral leasing revenues from federal mineral \n     leases in Alaska. This issue was litigated in the United \n     States Court of Federal Claims. State of Alaska v. United \n     States, 35 Fed. Cl. 685 (1996). In 1996, the court found \n     against Alaska. It stated that ``there was no promise on the \n     part of the Federal Government to pay Alaska, in perpetuity, \n     90 percent of gross mineral leasing revenue from federal \n     mineral leases in Alaska.'' ld. at 704.\n       The State then appealed this decision to the United States \n     Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, which affirmed the \n     Court of\n\n[[Page S14223]]\n\n     Claims decision discussed above. State of Alaska v. United \n     States, 1997 WL 382032 at *1 (Fed. Cir. July 8, 1997). \n     Finally, the State petitioned the United States Supreme \n     Court, which denied certiorari. State of Alaska v. United \n     States, 522 U.S. 1108, 118 S. Ct. 1035 (1998).\n       Because the issue has been appealed all the way to the \n     United States Supreme Court, the State considers the decision \n     by the United States Court of Claims to be settled law.\n       Additionally, I would like to clarify an issue raised in \n     the press and the Congress regarding the State's role, if \n     any, in the lawsuit filed on December 19, 2005 by the Alaska \n     Gasline Port Authority against ExxonMobil Corp. and BP P.L.C. \n     et al, alleging violations of numerous laws, including the \n     Sherman Act. The State of Alaska is not a 'Party to this \n     lawsuit.\n       If I can be of any further assistance, please do not \n     hesitate to contact me.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 David W. Marquez,\n                                                 Attorney General.\n\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, what ANWR represents to this country is \nenergy security, national security, from the perspective of reducing \nour vulnerability on foreign sources of oil. When we talk about \nvulnerability in this country, and recognizing the vulnerability and \nthe exposure of our men and women who are serving us over in Iraq, over \nin Afghanistan, we have to do everything we possibly can in this \ncountry to provide for their protection. Eighty percent of the \nGovernment's oil consumption is by our military. We need to keep this \nin mind. If we can do anything more to help with our domestic \nproduction so that we can decrease this reliance, we need to do so.\n  What ANWR offers to us is energy security, domestic security in the \nsense of jobs, and truly environmental security. I need to stress that. \nWe have been doing a responsible job up North for the past 30 years. We \nwant to continue that, to fill the pipeline that is now about half \ncapacity.\n  Let me amplify a bit on why ANWR is so important for this Nation.\n  Since we debated ANWR during the budget resolution process this \nspring, we have finished a 14-year-effort to craft a new comprehensive \nenergy bill. In that bill we have provided incentives and tax breaks to \nincrease renewable energy: wind, solar, biomass, geothermal, ocean \nenergy supplies. We promoted, by tax breaks, the purchase of hybrid and \nalternate clean cars to cut fuel consumption. We also mandated a \ndoubling of the production of ethanol to help displace foreign oil.\n  We hiked the efficiency standards for a host of appliances to reduce \nelectricity demand--hopefully by 40 percent, saving enough electricity \nto equal the output of 170 new 300-megawatt power plants. We promoted \nnew technology, proposing to spend $3 billion to develop new hydrogen-\nfueled cars and to perfect the next generation of nuclear power.\n  We also made it easier to import more natural gas to ease our pending \nsupply shortage. We approved $5.6 billion in tax breaks to promote \nenergy efficiency and the growth of alternative fuels--more than twice \nwhat we spent to promote oil and gas production.\n  But outside of some minor changes that may speed oil leasing in the \nNational Petroleum Reserve in Alaska--the Nation's last designated \nplace for petroleum production--and a few very minor regulatory \nchanges, we did little to directly increase domestic oil and gas \nproduction.\n  We delayed that action until now, when we hopefully will permit oil \ndevelopment from a tiny portion of the Arctic coastal plain in my home \nState of Alaska.\n  ANWR oil will certainly help stabilize our energy prices while \ngenerating more than $36 billion in Federal revenues within 20 years--\n$2.5 billion according to this reconciliation bill--money that is vital \ngiven our $319 billion deficit for fiscal year 2005 and the recent CBO \nforecast that we will still face a $314 billion deficit this year, not \ncounting spending to counter the effects of Hurricanes Katrina, Rita \nand Wilma. While both numbers are down, we clearly need more revenues.\n\n  ANWR will reduce our balance of payments deficit because we won't be \nbuying as much oil overseas. Last year we paid $166 billion to buy oil \noverseas--a quarter of our ballooning trade deficit. We are paying even \nmore this year. Keeping those billions a year in America that ANWR oil \nproduction will equal at current prices is important.\n  It will produce hundreds of thousands of American jobs in most every \nState, with estimates ranging from a high of over 1 million total jobs \nto a low of 735,000.\n  These are jobs mostly in the lower 48 States; 12,000 jobs in \nWashington State; 80,000 jobs in California; 48,000 jobs in New York; \n34,200 in Pennsylvania; 34,000 jobs in Florida, 5,500 jobs in Arkansas, \neven 2,700 jobs in Hawaii, our fellow non-contiguous sister State to \nthe south, according to forecasts by Wharton Econometrics Forecasting \nAssociates.\n  It is because of these jobs and the other economic benefits, that so \nmany groups support ANWR development, from many in organized labor to \nfarmers, and from truckers to manufacturers, all of whom know that ANWR \noil will help stabilize everything from the cost of spring planting and \nfall harvesting to the thousands of products made from oil: from \nantihistamines to compact discs and from heart replacement valves to \nshampoo.\n  That is why groups from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce to the Americans \nfor Tax Reform, from the Alaska Gas Association to the Alliance for \nEnergy and Economic Growth, and unions such as the International Union \nof Operating Engineers, the Seafarers International Union, the \nTeamsters, the United Association of Plumbers and Pipefitters, the \nLaborers' International Union, the United Brotherhood of Carpenters and \nJoiners, and the Building and Construction Trades Department all are \nsupporting ANWR's opening.\n  According to USGS estimates, ANWR's Coastal Plain has an even chance \ncontaining the second largest oil field in North America. During this \ndebate opponents may well again repeat that there isn't enough oil \nthere to be worth developing, that it only represents a tiny supply or \nonly will decrease our dependence on foreign oil by a few percent.\n\n  Those arguments are utter nonsense. It is like saying we should never \nhave produced the East Texas oil fields since the area only contained \n5.3 billion barrels--a half to a third of ANWR's likely production. \nEast Texas has produced oil, created jobs and protected our national \nsecurity the past 75 years of through WWII, and Korea, Vietnam, and the \nPersian Gulf.\n  ANWR production is likely to provide all the oil that South Dakota \nwill need for 499 years. It is likely to provide all the oil that \nMinnesota will need for 84 years, for New York for 34 years, for \nCalifornia for 16 years. That is a lot of oil.\n  When you consider that the American Farm Bureau Federation reports \nthat American farmers in the 2003-2004 planting season lost $6.2 \nbillion in income because of higher fuel and fertilizer costs--farmers \nfacing an even bleaker price picture this fall given high prices and \ndrought--then it's clear that all the oil and gas ANWR may produce will \nbe precious to help hold down or reduce those costs in the future.\n  Remember that ANWR's oil would have offset the oil that we lost in \nthe Gulf of Mexico because of hurricane damage--oil that could well \nhave prevented prices from skyrocketing at the pump this summer and \nfall.\n  Discounting ANWR's likely oil is also like saying we as a nation \nshould never have opened the neighboring Prudhoe Bay oil field in \nAlaska because Prudhoe Bay would only supply us with a 3-year supply of \noil. Prudhoe Bay has provided America with up to a quarter of our \ndomestic oil supply for the past 28 years. It has already saved us from \nspending more than $200 billion to buy imported oil and new technology \nhas consistently raised the amount of oil the field will produce.\n  Initially Prudhoe was expected to produce only 35 percent of its oil. \nNow it's likely to produce more than 16.5 billion barrels--65 percent \nof its oil in place. The same increase in production might occur at \nANWR and could raise production totals to between 10 and 27 billion \nbarrels--the mean being nearly 18 billion barrels, if it happens.\n  We know industry has spent about $40 billion on the trans-Alaska oil \npipeline and the wells and production facilities at Prudhoe Bay in the \npast three decades--78 percent of that spending going to states in the \nlower 48.\n\n[[Page S14224]]\n\n  From just 1980 to 1994 California businesses received $3.2 billion in \nwork because of Alaska oil development, Washington State firms $1.7 \nbillion, New York $680 million, Minnesota businesses $100 million.\n  There is no question that ANWR oil development will be good for the \ncountry's economy and its national security. But it also will be good \nfor the global environment and it won't harm Alaska's environment, \nwildlife or beautiful landscape.\n  Let me shock those on the other side of this issue. As a life-long \nAlaskan, a mother with two sons with a family that loves the outdoors, \nlet me say again I would be the first to oppose ANWR's opening if I had \nany concerns about what oil development will do to our landscape, our \nair, our water and our wildlife. But I don't.\n  I have been to Prudhoe Bay, have seen the impacts of oil there and \nknow that Prudhoe's development has not damaged Alaska's environment.\n  And I know that by using 21st century technology and advanced \nengineering that has been perfected since the field's construction 30 \nyears ago, that ANWR can be developed safely and the environment even \nbetter protected.\n  First let's look again at Prudhoe's experience. There was much \nconcern that development there would harm the environment and damage \nthe Central Arctic Caribou herd that lives in the field. Neither \nhappened.\n  The Central Arctic herd continues to calve and nurse their young in \nthe area's oil fields. The herd has grown from 3,000 animals in 1974 to \nnearly 32,000 today. This 10-fold increase shows that caribou and oil \nproduction can co-exist quite nicely, thank you.\n  Wildlife studies have shown that several bird species have grown \nsince the field was built--specifically brant, snow geese and \nspectacled eiders, although as the National Academy of Sciences \nreported last year some nesting distributions may have changed and \nbrant and eiders in general are having problems, perhaps because of \nreach warmer climate conditions.\n\n  I'm sure someone will mention polar bears. I am quite prepared to \ntalk about the very healthy condition of Alaska polar bear stocks. For \nthe moment let me say that only two bears over the past 38 years have \nbeen harmed in Alaska because of oil development and with new infrared \ndetection equipment, we can make sure that no bears will be disturbed \nduring denning by ANWR's development.\n  Americans can be assured that opening the coastal plain will have \neven less impact on Alaska's environment. That is because new \ntechnology has reduced the impact on the environment and the footprint \nof development.\n  3-D and 4-D seismic that I mentioned earlier now allow us to locate \noil without surface disruption.\n  Underground directional drilling allow us to recover oil 4 miles away \nand hopefully up to 8 miles away within a few years, meaning that only \na tiny portion of surface habitat will be disturbed between drill \nsites.\n  The size of so-called well pads has decreased 70 percent to 88 \npercent since Prudhoe Bay. The proof can be seen in that the Tarn field \nwas opened in 1998 disturbing just 6.7 acres. Not the 65 acres for a \nwell-pad at Prudhoe Bay. The Alpine field that we in the Senate visited \nin March, today produces 120,000 barrels a day from a central well pad \nthat is just 43 acres in size--67 if you count the attached air strip.\n  Ice roads today are used for winter drilling--roads that melt without \nany disturbance to the tundra in summer when the animals arrive on the \ncoastal plain. New composite mats also can be used to reduce gravel \nfill and dust. And pipelines technically can be placed underground to \nprevent any surface disturbance to animals or birdlife, although there \nare no problems with above ground pipelines. There won't be a ``spider \nweb'' of development as some have claimed.\n  Drilling restrictions will prevent noise in summer that might scare a \nmother caribou, and as insurance, development can be barred by the \nSecretary of the Interior to guarantee habitat for a core caribou \ncaving area or for bird nesting areas.\n  Opponents often say that development will destroy ``America's \nSerengeti.'' We are proposing to limit the ``footprint'' of development \nto just 2,000 acres of Federal land. That is no more land than a \nmoderately-sized American farm--the average farm in North Dakota is \n1,400 acres--while an area larger than all of South Carolina will \nremain wild and protected. With the new technology it will be possible \nto leave nearly 100 square miles of undisturbed habitat between well \nsites. The animals of the African veld in Tanzania should be so lucky.\n  Opponents of opening ANWR always address two more issues: that oil \nspills on the North Slope of Alaska has shown that development should \nnot be allowed, and that air quality from energy production should also \nprevent development. Let me briefly respond to both concerns.\n  Concerning oil spills opponents list numbers claiming a high number \nof spills, but fail to mention that companies have to report spills of \nmost any substance more than a gallon in size, whether of water, or oil \nor chemicals.\n  According to the Alaska Department Environmental Conservation, there \nhave been an average of 263 spills on the North Slope yearly during the \npast decade, but the average oil spill was just 89 gallons--2 barrels \nof oil--and that 94 percent of that oil was totally cleaned up. By \ncomparison the rest of the state had seven times more spills per year \nthan the Prudhoe Bay oil field.\n  According to the National Academy of Science's 2003 study, if you \nlook at all oil spills from 1977 through 1999, 84 percent of all spills \nwere less than 2 barrels in size and only 454 barrels of oil per year \nmay have been released to the environment, compared to 378,000 barrels \nof oil that enter North American waters as a result of just urban \nrunoff--those drips at filling stations and other spills. That may be \nless oil than enters the Alaska environment naturally because of oil \nseeps on the North Slope.\n  Concerning air quality, we have heard mention that Prudhoe Bay has \ndestroyed the air quality. There is no truth to those claims.\n  It is true that the nation's largest oil field does add emissions \ninto the air, mostly nitrogen dioxide and larger particulate matter. \nBut field meets the stringent air quality standards in place for Class \nII attainment areas--areas where Congress has set higher standards to \nprevent any Significant Deterioration (PSD) of air quality.\n\n  Looking at nitrogen dioxide, in its worse year, 2000, such emissions \nwere only a quarter of the public health standard for the area. For \nsulfur dioxide, in its worse year 1997, the Prudhoe Bay field emitted \n16 times less sulfur dioxide than the public health standard and only a \nquarter of the tough standards for a Class II area.\n  For carbon monoxide, during its worse period, one eight-hour period \nin 1991 near Kuparuk, the field was 35 times lower than the public \nhealth standard. I could continue with particulate matter but the story \nis the same.\n  The truth is that the Prudhoe Bay area--the nation's largest oil \nfield--releases eight times less nitrogen dioxide into the air than the \nmetropolitan Washington area does per year, according to the \nMetropolitan Washington Council of Governments.\n  More important the releases have no impacts on the environment. There \nis no evidence that the releases are affecting the Arctic environment \nor the environment downwind. The air quality complaints are groundless.\n  To environmentalists who say we are harming Alaska, please remember \nthat an area of more than 192 million acres, the size of all the states \nthat stretch from Maine to Orlando, Fla.--almost the entire East \nCoast--are already protected in parks, refuges and forests in Alaska. \nWe aren't proposing to touch any of those areas.\n  Now let me explain why I suggested that ANWR development is actually \ngood for the global environment.\n  Right now America is using about 20 million barrels of oil a day and \nimporting more than 11 million barrels of that oil. That oil is \nincreasingly coming from countries with less stringent environmental \nstandards than America. America has the toughest environmental \nstandards in the world. We should be doing all we can to satisfy our \noil needs at home, not exporting environmental issues overseas to \nRussia or Colombia or Venezuela.\n\n  Secondly, even with greater efforts at conservation--efforts that I \nstrongly\n\n[[Page S14225]]\n\nsupported in the just-passed comprehensive energy bill--we are still \ngoing to need oil.\n  We could park every car and truck in America tomorrow and we still \nwill need ANWR's oil to meet our needs for plastics, road construction \nmaterials, roofing materials, and those petrochemical feed stocks that \nare the stuff of everything from soft contact lenses to aspirin and \nfrom house paint to toothpaste.\n  And in case anyone tries to argue that opening ANWR will somehow \nincrease carbon dioxide and maybe, perhaps, increase global warming, \nlet me say that if we don't open ANWR we will need to import ever more \noil to America in foreign tankers. Those tankers will need to travel \ntens of thousands of miles farther to reach American shores. They run \non diesel fuel and will produce far more carbon dioxide than \ntransporting Alaskan oil to lower 48 ports will.\n  Thirdly, if we don't open ANWR we will need to import ever more oil. \nWhen we reach 68 percent dependency we will need the equivalent of 30 \ngiant super tankers, each loaded with 500,000 barrels of crude oil a \nday, to dock at U.S. ports. That will be more than 10,000 shiploads of \noil a year, most likely foreign-flagged and foreign-crewed tankers \npassing our rocky coastlines and entering our crowded harbors. Those \nships create many more times the environmental risk to America's coasts \nthan developing our own energy, using American technology, American \ndoubled-hulled ships, whose performance is governed by American law.\n  For years the mantra of environmentalists has been ``Think globally, \nact locally.'' The best action we can take locally is to produce more \nof the oil we consume every day.\n  Let me briefly touch on whether Alaska Natives continue to support \noil development on the coastal plain. Earlier this spring some \nquestioned that support because of a petition that was signed by some \nin Kaktovik--the only village directly in the ANWR area, an area where \n78 percent of residents, 2 years ago supported oil development, \naccording to a community poll. While I have letters signed by a number \nof those who signed the anti-development petition--letters saying they \nwere misled by the petition sponsor and that they do still support \nANWR's on-shore oil development--let me just reassure my colleagues \nthat Alaska Natives clearly support oil development in my State.\n\n  I have a letter from all members of the Kaktovik City Council and \nfrom its Mayor sporting oil development.\n  The latest statewide public opinion poll in Alaska by Dittman \nResearch finds that only 23 percent of Alaskans oppose ANWR \ndevelopment. In this day and age, getting more than 70 percent of any \nbody anywhere in support of anything is a major achievement.\n  The Alaska Federation of Natives--that is the umbrella for all Native \ngroups in the State--is clearly on record supporting ANWR development.\n  I visited Kaktovik during August to see for myself the current level \nof support or concern with development in the coastal plain. I can say \nclearly that while villagers would like us to solve their Native land \nallotment concerns by next year--the 100th anniversary of when the land \nallotments were authorized and want us in Congress to protect \nsubsistence whaling--and while they clearly want to be consulted on \ndevelopment and aided to avoid any impacts--that they generally support \nenvironmentally sensitive development onshore on the coastal plain.\n  Natives on the North Slope of Alaska have seen for themselves the \nimpacts of oil development and have seen the benefits that oil can \nbring: good jobs, better schools, improved health care, modern water \nand sewer systems, adequate housing and better opportunities for their \nchildren and their grandchildren.\n  Natives who have lived in the area for thousands of years simply want \nto be consulted and to have their wisdom reflected in the regulatory \ndecisions made to control energy development. That is a perfectly \nreasonable position for local residents to take and I certainly will \nsupport them to make sure their knowledge and wisdom are listened to.\n\n  They simply want respect and we in government clearly should respect \ntheir knowledge as oil development proceeds.\n  I As long as we include reasonable environmental and regulatory \nprotections, Alaska Natives support responsible oil development on the \nArctic coastal plain.\n  And this bill provides $35 million in impact aid, money that \nhopefully will alleviate any impacts from ANWR development and assist \nAlaska Native Corporations and their members who live along the Trans-\nAlaska oil pipeline corridor.\n  This amendment is largely based on an ANWR stand-alone-bill, S. 1891, \nthat I introduced this fall. So that there is no mistaking the clear \nintent of this legislation as it is considered for final passage, let \nme state the following:\n  After 18 years of debate since release of the final environmental \nimpact statement covering Arctic oil development in 1987, more than 50 \nhearings, dozens of field trips, passage of ANWR legislation in the \n106th Congress, and passage of ANWR-opening legislation by the House in \nthe 108th Congress and by both the House and Senate in the \nreconciliation act process in the 109th Congress, it is absolutely \nclear that it is the intent of Congress--should this bill pass--that \noil and gas development be permitted in the entire ANWR coastal plain \non an expedited basis. That means that development should be permitted \non the Federal lands as permitted by this legislation without delay in \norder to be producing revenues within 5 years.\n  It is clearly the intent of Congress as spelled out in the provision, \nthat the existing LEIS is sufficient to cover new preleasing activities \nand that it is the intent of Congress that the LEIS is still sufficient \nto govern oil development with modest updating.\n  Concerning the 92,000 acres of native-owned lands, lands owned by the \nArctic Slope Regional Corporation and the Kaktovik Inupiat Corporation, \nCongress by this division in the Defense appropriations bill is \nauthorizing immediate development as allowed by the 1983 land trade \nthat allowed Natives to select lands in the coastal plain and as \nallowed by the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act and the Alaska \nNational Interest Lands Conservation Act.\n\n  Specifically, there should be no question that it is the intent of \nCongress that the phrase ``prelease activity'' is intended to include \nall activities that normally take place prior to a lease sale, \nincluding surface geological exploration or seismic exploration. The \nSecretary has promulgated regulations governing surface geological and \ngeophysical exploration programs for the refuge's coastal plain \npursuant to Section 1002 of ANILCA. These regulations, set out at Part \n37 of Title 50 of the Code of Federal Regulations, are consistent with \nthe LEIS and include adequate environmental safeguards. Although the \nprimary purpose of those regulations was to governor the exploration \nnecessary to produce the ``1002'' report to Congress, they include \nprovision for additional surface geological and geophysical exploration \n``if necessary to correct data deficiencies or to refine or improve \ndata or information already gathered.'' 50 CFR Section 37.11.\n  This authority is adequate for the Secretary to process any requests \nfor permits for prelease surface exploration, but is not the exclusive \nauthority for processing such requests. This amendment provides \nindependent and sufficient authority for the Secretary, acting through \nthe Bureau of Land Management, to issue prelease permits for surface \ngeological exploration or seismic exploration. Permits for prelease \nsurface exploration, whether or not pursuant to Part 37 of Title 50, \nthat incorporate environmental safeguards similar to those in Part 37 \nof Title 50 are consistent with the LEIS and the requirements of this \nsection.\n  Another area I would like to clarify is relating to the provision \nthat allows the Arctic Slope Regional Corporation to begin oil \nproduction from their lands. It should be clear that the section in \nthis bill removes the prohibition in Section 1003 of ANILCA against the \nproduction of oil and gas and leasing or other development leading to \nproduction of oil and gas for lands within the ``1002'' Coastal Plain \nArea, as depicted on the map prepared by the U.S. Geological Survey \nentitled ``Arctic National Wildlife Refuge 1002 Coastal Plain Area,'' \ndated September 2005,\n\n[[Page S14226]]\n\nincluding both Federal lands private lands, primarily owned by Alaska \nNative corporations, and now or hereafter acquired within the 1002 \nCoastal Plain Area and preserves all rights of access to those lands, \nincluding for oil and gas pipelines, provided for in Sections 1110 and \n1111 of ANILCA.\n  There is much more that I can say. For now let me just say that both \nRepublicans and Democrats agree that American independence on foreign \noil threatens our national security, and yet, we continue to import \nover half of our oil needs. And we haven't yet done enough to reverse \nthat trend.\n  Only by passing ANWR, in conjunction with the other environmental \nsteps we have already taken in the energy bill, can we produce more oil \nfrom American soil, with American workers; oil that will be used to \nheat American homes and power America's farms and industries.\n  In a sentence, ANWR is a part of the solution to America's dependence \non foreign energy sources. Not the entire solution, but one real part \nof it. The one part not yet addressed by Congress this year.\n  ANWR is the place and the time is now.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who yields time?\n  Senator Cochran is recognized for 4 minutes.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I understood I had 2 minutes under the \norder.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The occupant of the Chair has additional \ntime and is yielding the additional 2 minutes.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I appreciate the generosity of the Presiding Officer.\n  I am pleased to advise the Senate that after a great deal of hard \nwork, including Senators on both sides of the aisle, Members of the \nother body, we have been successful in adding to this conference report \nas an amendment a disaster assistance provision that makes money \navailable now to those in the Gulf States region who have been \nseriously harmed, hurt, devastated by Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane \nRita.\n  The Senators from Louisiana and Mississippi, of course, have been \nprobably the most directly affected in terms of the demands being made \non the Federal Government now for a sensitive and generous response to \nthe needs of our region. We are very grateful to those who have joined \nwith us and supported the addition of these funds, $29 billion in total \namount in this bill, to provide disaster assistance to that region.\n  We appreciate the administration's sensitivity to this and the \nrequest that the President made for a reallocation of previously \nappropriated funds in the amount of $17 billion. We urged that be \nincreased. The House agreed. The Senate agreed to support this. Our \ncommittee did. Now it is before this body. I hope all Senators will \nsupport this conference report. It is very important that this money be \ngiven to the region now. Any further delays are going to be not just \nfrustrating but devastating to the economic well-being, the emotional \nstability of that region of our country that has been so harmed, in an \nunprecedented way, by this disaster. We appreciate the support of all \nSenators.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Louisiana is recognized \nfor 4 of the minutes designated to me.\n  Mr. VITTER. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I stand in strong support of the motion to invoke \ncloture, and I ask all of my colleagues to come together, put the \ninterests of the country, including the interests of the citizens of \nthe gulf coast, first, ahead of politics, ahead of partisanship, and \nmove this important legislation forward.\n  In the last 48 hours, we have heard a whole lot about this package \nand about this upcoming vote. So much of it has been about partisan \nideology and politics and procedure. Let me tell you what this vote is \nabout in my home in Louisiana. It is about another ``P'' word. It is \nabout people, real people trying to live and survive and rebuild in the \nreal world. Nearly 4 months ago, 1,000 people, my fellow Louisiana \ncitizens, were killed during the devastation of Katrina. Today, 4 \nmonths later, nearly a million people are still reeling. They remain \nlost because of our continuing delay and inaction, people who have no \nhomes, no cars, no jobs, in many cases all of their personal \npossessions gone.\n  My hometown was flooded. The city of New Orleans, once a thriving \ncity of 450,000 people, is today, almost 4 months later, under 100,000 \npeople. My neighbors want to come home. We want to rebuild in earnest. \nTens of thousands of businesses want to reestablish themselves and \noffer jobs again to their hundreds of thousands of employees. This vote \nis crucial for that to happen. That is why it is not about partisan \nideology and politics and procedure that we have heard about for so \nmany days; it is about people, real people with enormous and real \nchallenges in the real world.\n  The question is simple. It is, in Louisiana, whether those people \nwill be flooded a third time. Why do I say a third time? The first time \nwas because of mother nature, because of the ferocity of Hurricane \nKatrina causing untold flooding and damage in southeast Louisiana. But \nthe second time was the day after Hurricane Katrina when the levees \nbroke. That wasn't the biggest natural disaster in American history. \nThat was the biggest manmade disaster in American history because of \nfundamental design flaws in that system.\n  Now we are on the Senate floor debating whether those same people \nwill be flooded a third time, flooded by inaction, flooded by the \nresults of partisan ideology and politics and getting all tangled up in \narcane procedure. Let's not flood these good people a third time. Let's \nact--yes, late, but not too late--to give them a clear vision forward \nso they can rebuild their lives.\n  I urge all of my Senate colleagues to put real people, facing real \nchallenges, the biggest of their lives in the real world, ahead of \npartisan ideology and politics and procedure. I urge my colleagues to \nvote yes on cloture.\n  I yield back my time.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Washington is recognized \nfor 12\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I yield 2 minutes of my time to the \nSenator from California.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from California is recognized \nfor 2 minutes.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Washington, \nand I thank the Chair.\n  ANWR is an issue that arouses great passion on both sides of this \nissue, but there are strong arguments that underlie the belief that the \nopening of these critical 1\\1/2\\ million acres of pristine wilderness \nis small, from an oil production perspective, and very damaging \nenvironmentally.\n  First, the Arctic Refuge Coastal Plain, where the drilling would \noccur, is the ecological heart of the Refuge. It is the center of \nwildlife activity. If ANWR were opened for drilling, the wilderness \nwould be crisscrossed by roads, pipelines, powerplants, and other \ninfrastructure. The Department of Interior estimates that 12,500 acres \nwould be directly impacted by drilling. I strongly believe that \ndestroying this wilderness does very little to reduce energy costs, nor \ndoes it do very much for oil independence. It will produce too little \noil to have a real impact on prices or overall supply, and it would \noffer a number of false hopes.\n  On average, ANWR is expected to produce about 800,000 barrels of oil \na day and, in 2025, these 800,000 barrels per day would represent but 3 \npercent of the projected 25 million barrels of oil a day of U.S. \nconsumption. By changing SUV mileage requirements to equal sedans, we \nproduce a million barrels of oil a day savings.\n  I don't believe we can drill our way to energy independence. I urge a \n``no'' vote.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who yields time? The Senator from \nWashington was yielded 12\\1/2\\ minutes and has yielded 2\\1/2\\ minutes \nof that.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I reserve the balance of my time. I see \nthe Senator from New Mexico seeks recognition.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New Mexico is recognized \nfor 5 minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about the bill \nbefore us in one respect. I want to talk about ANWR. Actually, ANWR has \nbeen waiting too long to become part of the United States of America's \ninventory of reserves of crude oil for our people and for our future.\n\n[[Page S14227]]\n\n  I had the luxury of going up there in the extreme cold to see what \nthis is all about. I want to share with my fellow Senators a couple of \nfacts that seem to be unnoticed. First of all, all of the activity that \ntakes place with reference to drilling, takes place with reference to \npreparing, takes place with getting the oil ready to put into a \npipeline--all of that activity takes place in the dead of winter. That \nmeans the roads are built on ice. That means the holes are drilled in \nthe ice. That means the oil comes to the surface to be put into \npipelines while it is below zero and everything is frozen.\n  So when Senators or visitors are taken there in the warm climate and \nthey see the soft ground that you cannot hardly put a truck on, the \nmarshes that everybody wants to preserve, everybody should understand \nthat there is no activity taking place under those conditions. \nEverything is done--the drilling, the preparation, the production--\nwhile it is all frozen. When the warmth comes, the activity disappears. \nWhat is left are a very few small signs of the activity of man that has \nproduced oil.\n  I saw 60 acres of the Alaskan frozen tundra--60 acres--upon which an \nentire drilling operation took place, all in winter. That 60 acres was \nproducing 150,000 barrels of oil a day. All that will be there are \nwellheads. Actually, as you drill, they look like little outhouses very \nclose together, in which a well is drilled, and scores of underground \nwells are drilled from it, vertical and horizontal, taking the oil out \nof the ground, with no new holes. When you are finished, there will be \nthe plugs on top of that and a station that pulls it together, and \neverything else will disappear, and out comes 150,000 barrels of oil.\n  Can you envision in this 1.5 million acres 2,000 acres of it being \nused in multiples of 60 acres to produce what is expected from ANWR? \nHow will that harm anything--that 1.5 million acres? They always quote \nPresident Eisenhower. It was set aside and designated, written there \nthat this might be important for our future because it has in it and \nunder it petroleum and petroleum products. That was known when it was \nset aside. We have been sitting around waiting, this great country, to \nproduce it.\n  The last point, they say it is not very important in terms of size. \nMr. President, the reserves on that property, at $30 a barrel, were \ncalculated to be the equivalent of the reserves in the State of Texas. \nNow we understand that at $60 a barrel it has probably doubled. That \nmeans it is more than the State of Texas. So for everyone who talks \nabout a 1-cent impact on gasoline, maybe we could also say it is not \nvery important, so why don't we close down all the wells in Texas; they \nare not very important. And they have a lot of environmental problems. \nThey were drilled in a different era. If you are worried about the \nenvironment, take a flight over Texas--no aspersions on Texas because \nit is my State also. But that is a lot of oil, the equivalent of Texas, \nand to run around America and say it is not important is economic \narrogance.\n  The United States needs oil that belongs to itself. We own it. I \nhonestly believe, having seen it and studied it, that those who say we \nwill destroy that part of the beauty of Alaska are missing the point. \nIt will not even be seen. You will not be able to locate----\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. You won't be able to see or locate what transpired. Yet \nAmerica will be safer. I hope we do this. This is the appropriate \nvehicle. I hope cloture is imposed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Murkowski). The majority has 16 minutes \nand the minority has 22 minutes left. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from West Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, the issue of drilling in the Arctic \nNational Wildlife Reserve is close to the heart, dear to the heart of \nthe senior Senator from Alaska. I love him. I admire his unyielding \ncommitment to the people of his State. I honor him for that. I consider \nhim a dear friend, a friend over a long period of time, a friend who is \nclose to my heart.\n  My remarks today do not reflect upon him or upon his efforts in \nregard to the people he represents. My concern is with the rules of the \nSenate. My concern is with the Senate rules in this book and how the \nrules are threatened--threatened--by what has been unfolding in recent \ndays.\n  If cloture is invoked on the conference report, Senators have \ndiscussed raising a rule XXVIII point of order--that is what we hear--\nagainst the conference report. That point of order is expected to be \nsustained by the Chair. The question may then be put to the Senate to \noverturn the ruling of the Chair and, in effect, to negate--get this--\nin effect to negate rule XXVIII in order to retain ANWR provisions in \nthe conference report.\n  It has been noted that if the Senate negates the rule, language \nincluded in the conference report would restore rule XXVIII by \ndirecting the Presiding Officer to apply the precedents of the Senate \nin effect at the beginning of the 109th Congress.\n  It is true that noncontroversial, extraneous matter is often included \nin conference reports. There is no doubt about that. It is true that \nSenators acquiesce on many occasions, choosing not to invoke rule \nXXVIII. That is true. That is a fact. It is also true that the Senate \ncan reinterpret and set new precedents for the application of its rules \nwhenever it pleases. The Senate can do that. That is as it ought to be. \nBut what has been discussed in recent days is very different--hear me--\nvery different.\n  It will allow a simple majority of Senators, as opposed to the two-\nthirds majority required by Senate rule V, to effectively suspend rule \nXXVIII by negating it and then restoring it so that the rule cannot be \nused to prevent the passage of the ANWR provisions that have been \ninserted into the conference report.\n  I say to my colleagues--hear me, hear me, my colleagues on both sides \nof the aisle--that I abhor, I abhor, I abhor this idea. Shame.\n  If such a scheme were carried into effect, it could seriously impair \nthe Senate rules. Hear me. I know about the rules. I spent years in \nusing the rules. Nothing would stand in the way of a majority--\nnothing--nothing would stand in the way of a majority, be it Republican \nor be it Democrat, from routinely negating and replacing Senate rule \nXXVIII in order to insert controversial legislation into a conference \nreport. This is a very clever, a very clever, a very clever thing that \nis being put forth here.\n  Today, this process could be employed to suspend rule XXVIII, but \ntomorrow, it could be employed to suspend the rule XVI prohibition \nagainst legislation on appropriations bills, and the day after that, it \ncould be used to suspend who knows whatever rules.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BYRD. Not yet. I will be happy to yield to my friend. He is my \nfriend. I love him, I told him that, but I love the Senate better. I \nlove the Senate more. I love this man from Alaska. I do, I love him. I \nfeel my blood in my veins is with his blood. I love him, but I love the \nSenate more. I came here and swore an oath to uphold the Constitution \nof the United States, and I would die upholding that oath, just as the \nRomans honored an oath. And I feel the same about that. I love my \nfriend from Alaska, I say, I love him, but I cannot go down that road. \nI have told him so. I love him, but I love the Senate more.\n  I know he is going to speak, and I would love to follow him, but I \nwon't be able to, so let my words stand. The record stands.\n  If permitted today, the process could be utilized again and again and \nagain, with terrible consequences for the Senate rules. I understand \nthat Senators are working to avoid this scenario. I hope that effort is \nsuccessful. Allowing this process to continue unfolding as it has in \nrecent days would cause significant harm to the Senate as an \ninstitution.\n  Senators should realize that if negated in the next hour, rule XXVIII \nwould not be restored in its current form until the President signs \ninto law the Defense appropriations conference report, which could take \nas long as 10 days. In that time, any remaining conference reports, \nwhether a rewritten PATRIOT Act or a continuing resolution, could \ninclude almost any--almost any--nongermane provisions without being \nsubject to a rule XXVIII point of order.\n\n[[Page S14228]]\n\n  It is ironic--oh, it is ironic.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. BYRD. May I have 5 more minutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. STEVENS. I would not object as long as the majority's time is \nextended the same period of time.\n  Mr. REID. I don't think we will ask the time be extended. Madam \nPresident, does Senator Cantwell have 5 minutes for him?\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Did I understand--\n  Mr. REID. Senator Byrd has asked for 5 more minutes out of the time \nof the Senator from Washington. Madam President, does she have it?\n  Ms. CANTWELL. I think I understand that the Senator from Alaska asked \nfor additional time.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I did not hear the Senator.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the time for \nthe majority and minority be extended 5 minutes each.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, it is ironic that the Senator from Alaska \nand I find ourselves on opposite sides of this issue. In the year 2000, \nwe worked together to restore rule XXVIII after it had been negated 4 \nyears earlier. We agreed that it ought to be restored to try to \nfacilitate a return to the regular order in the Senate. My friend \nremembers as I do the yearend Omnibus appropriations bills that would \ncome back from conference where conferees had to accept all sorts of \nnew matter never before considered by the House or Senate. We included \nan amendment in the fiscal year 2001 Consolidated Appropriations Act to \nrestore rule XXVIII, with the support of the majority and the minority \nleaders. Now the question may be put to the Senate to negate rule \nXXVIII again.\n  I understand the passions surrounding the issue of ANWR, and I honor \nmy friend from Alaska. He is standing up for his State, but I am \nstanding for the Senate. I am standing for the Senate, the Senate's \nrules under the Constitution of the United States. I understand the \npassions surrounding the issue of ANWR, but we abandon and undermine \nthese rules at a terrible, terrible price. What a price. This \ninstitution and the liberties that its rules protect must come first--\nmust come first--before political party, whatever it be, Republican or \nDemocrat, and before legislative maneuvering. Those battles are \nfleeting, but the Senate must stand forever.\n  I do not want to see the Senate, the forum of the States and the last \nexalted refuge that guarantees a voice to the minority among the din of \nan overwhelming majority, I do not want to see the Senate take the \nposition that a majority of Senators are entitled to suspend the Senate \nrules whenever they prove inconvenient. So I urge my colleagues--\nplease, listen, my friends on both sides of the aisle, Democrats and \nRepublicans--I urge my colleagues to think carefully about this issue. \nThe powerful abolitionist Senator Charles Sumner called the Senate \nrules the very temple, the very temple of constitutional liberty, and \nhe was right. I plead with my colleagues to not dismantle that temple \nof constitutional liberty. I urge my colleagues to preserve rule XXVIII \nin its current form and, if raised, to oppose any motion to overturn \nthe ruling of the Chair.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire has 5 minutes.\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, I rise to praise the Senator from Alaska \nfor bringing this bill forward. This bill has a lot of very important \nlanguage in it obviously dealing with our national defense, dealing \nwith our ability to be energy independent. But there are two items I \nwish to focus on because if this bill fails, if the cloture motion does \nnot occur, they are going to be dramatically impacted.\n  The first is the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program. There has \nbeen a lot of grandstanding in the Chamber over the last few months, \nwith Members coming down here and offering proposals for how they were \ngoing to fund Low-Income Home Energy Assistance, otherwise known as \nLIHEAP.\n  Most of those proposals have come forward without any offsets, have \nadded to the deficit and, therefore, have been subject to a 60-vote \npoint of order, and the people offering them knew they were not going \nto pass, but they wanted to take a position.\n  This is the first bill that will increase LIHEAP, low-income energy \nassistance, and allow those people who are going to have a very tough \nwinter to be able to pay for their energy costs. This bill has 2 \nbillion additional dollars for low-income energy assistance in it, and \nit is paid for. It is done in a fiscally responsible way.\n  Without that money, we will go back to the LIHEAP funding levels \nwhich are traditional here, and we will not be able to pick up the \nextra costs of LIHEAP, which is low-income energy assistance, which is \na function of increased oil costs--a very serious problem for a lot of \nlow income people who are trying to figure out how they are going to be \nable to heat their homes this winter.\n  So if this bill goes down under the cloture motion, we lose the \nLIHEAP dollars, and all those folks who have come to the Chamber and \nclaimed they were for LIHEAP will have to explain that.\n  Secondly, this bill has in it a major initiative in the area of \ndefending our borders; $1.1 billion is put into this bill to upgrade \nthe capabilities of the Border Patrol. The Border Patrol needs to be \ndramatically expanded as to personnel and detention facilities, but \nneither of those events can happen until the capital needs of the \nBorder Patrol are improved so that the additional agents can be taken \ncare of.\n  We as a Congress have increased the number of agents by 1,500 in the \nlast year, the number of detention beds by 1,000, but we have not \naddressed the capital needs. They need new helicopters, new cars, new \nbuildings and facilities to house people. They need some issues \nrelative to their training facilities so that we can train more border \npatrol. All that money is right here.\n  Everybody who has come to this Chamber talking about the need for a \nbetter Border Patrol and better capacity to monitor who is coming into \nour country, well, it cannot be done without a strong Border Patrol, \nand this bill commits to that.\n  I congratulate the Senator from Alaska for putting in that money. We \nneed to get it in the pipeline. We need to get it in the pipeline now \nso that the Border Patrol will have the capital resources it needs to \nmake sure they can move forward with our goal, which is to secure the \nborder so we know who is coming across the border and the people who \nare coming across the border illegally are apprehended.\n  It is a good bill. There are a lot of good proposals in this bill. \nBut those two items--getting energy assistance money out to low-income \nindividuals who need it, and as we head further into this winter, it is \ngoing to be critical that we have that money; and supporting the Border \nPatrol effort and making sure that our borders are secure through \nexpanding the capital commitment to the Border Patrol with additional \nhelicopters, additional housing, additional motor vehicles, and other \nphysical activity they need down there, training facilities--are very \ncritical elements of policy in this bill which will be lost potentially \nand most likely actually if this cloture motion is not agreed to.\n  Therefore, I strongly encourage our colleagues to vote for cloture.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time and yield it to the senior Senator \nfrom Alaska.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. LOTT. Could I inquire about the time remaining so we can keep \nsome balance about how the time is divided?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority has 16 minutes remaining, and the \nminority has 15 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. LOTT. Madam President, then I will take advantage of this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for 4 minutes.\n  Mr. LOTT. Madam President, I say to my colleagues, so many of them \nhave worked hard on this. They have produced a product that has some \nvery important things in it. I know some people will be concerned about \nthe process, as I am. I have been concerned, and I have been on both \nsides of the process question. But this is probably the biggest, most \nimportant bill of this year. We need to realize that.\n\n[[Page S14229]]\n\n  Some people say: Oh, this is so unprecedented, and why are we here? I \nhave been here a while--not as long as the distinguished Senator from \nWest Virginia--but this is not unprecedented. This is where we are just \nabout every year. Almost every year, we get down to the end and we have \nsome sort of omnibus or combination of bills, and so there is nothing \nso unusual or outlandish about all of this.\n  I wish to take just a minute to thank all who have been involved in \nputting this legislation together, particularly my senior colleague \nfrom Mississippi, Senator Cochran. He held the line. He insisted on \nsome reprogramming of the money that had been approved by the Senate \nearlier for installations that were damaged by the hurricane and to \nalso include additional money when some people did not want to include \nthe money that was needed for our people who are so desperate in the \nKatrina and Rita devastated areas. But he held the line, and he came up \nwith a bill that has $29 billion in reprogrammed money out of money \nthat was already there--this is reprogramming, not adding to the \ndeficit--plus some funds for restoration of our eroding lands in \nLouisiana and Mississippi. This is so vitally important to our region.\n\n  I have hesitated speaking because I am concerned I am going to get \nemotional and not be able to get through this without showing the same \nfeeling I hear from my constituents in Mississippi, people in Louisiana \nand Texas. We need this so desperately, and we need it now.\n  I know we have been arguing for years about ANWR. I am not going to \nrehash the merits of it. I think it is time we do this. We need the \nenergy. I think a lot of the alarms that are expressed about it are not \naccurate. I admire Senator Stevens for his tenacity and the leadership \nof Senator Murkowski for trying to get this done. It is an awfully \nsmall piece of land. It is something we really need. I hope we would \nnot allow this big, important bill to be defeated on this point.\n  The most important thing I wish to say today is how badly we need \nthis help. There are people right now literally living in tents, small \ntrailers, and double-wides who do not know what they are going to do \nwith their lives. There are people living with their relatives miles \nand States away because they lost their home. They have a slab, a \nmortgage, no insurance. Many of them lost their job. Some of them lost \nloved ones. Some of them lost their truck and their dog.\n  I talked to a man yesterday who cried twice on the phone, pleading \nwith me to tell him what he could do. They have hit the wall. Right \nnow, they are at that moment of exhaustion, frustration, and decision. \nIf we do not provide this help now, if it is put off another month or 2 \nmonths or 3 months, Heaven help us.\n  So I plead with my colleagues. I know we might not have designed this \nbill this way in a different time or a different set of circumstances. \nI do not begrudge anybody for what they have done, but I cannot let \nthis day go without pleading that we get this done and get it done now.\n  I am scheduled to go home tonight to make a speech in the morning to \nthe Biloxi, MS, Chamber of Commerce, an area that was devastated by \nthis hurricane. I have done this for 32 years in a row. If we do not \nget this bill done, I cannot go home and face those people. Please help \nus, and I will help my colleagues as long as I can avoid this sort of \nsituation in the future.\n  I thank my colleagues for their time and for the support they have \nalready given us.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I ask unanimous consent to speak for 1 minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Madam President, I rise following my colleague from \nMississippi, to associate myself with his remarks. I see my colleague, \nSenator Vitter, on the Senate floor, and Senator Cochran is not too far \naway. This is a crucial vote for those of us along the gulf coast who \nhave faced not just two killer storms but multiple levee breaks that \nhave put this great economy of the Nation's only energy coast at risk. \nWhile we would not design the bill this way if left up to the four of \nus who have been negotiating this package with the help of many of our \ncolleagues through the process, I add my voice to say it is imperative \nthat we get this $29 billion of direct aid, not to FEMA but directly to \nour Governors and to our people to give them hope that this region can \nbe rebuilt. Without this, it will be impossible, and they cannot wait \nanother day.\n  I thank my Senate colleagues.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Madam President, is there time left? What is the \nsituation with the time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority has 15 minutes. The majority has \n12 minutes remaining.\n  The Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent the Senator from Alaska be given \nthe last speech on this matter.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. I yield to the Senator from Massachusetts 3 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Madam President, I have as passionate a feeling against \nthe Arctic Refuge drilling as I know the Presiding Officer and the \nSenator from Alaska, the senior Senator, have for it. I do not believe, \nwhen you look at the facts dispassionately, on their face, that it is \ngoing to do any of the things that are promised. On its face, drilling \nin the Alaska National Wildlife Refuge does not help solve America's \ndrilling problem. We are overly dependent. We have only 3 percent of \nthe oil reserves in the world. There is no way for this to make a dent \nin the world oil supplies, in the supply or price of gasoline or \nAmerica's energy independence. But that is not the debate today. The \ndebate today is what the Senator from West Virginia was talking about.\n  Every so often in the Senate we have a gut check about what it means \nto be a Senator and why we are here and what our duty is--our duty. The \narguments we have just heard from the Senator from New Hampshire and \nthe Senator from Mississippi--we all agree we want border money. We all \nagree we want the money for our troops. We agree we want the money for \nthose hurricane victims. Every single one of us in the Senate knows how \nthis place works. If we say no to this breaking of the rules, which is \nwhat is creating this impasse, within hours we can pass this bill with \nthe border money, with our troop money, and with the hurricane money. \nWe can do that.\n  There is only one thing stopping us. What is stopping us is the fact \nthat in an effort to do what they could not do by following the rules, \nthey are now going to break the Senate rules for a matter of \nexpediency.\n  Mr. BYRD. Shame.\n  Mr. KERRY. That is what is at stake. That is the vote.\n  Mr. BYRD. Shame.\n  Mr. KERRY. The whole reason this is being put on DOD is to make it \ntough on Senators. And it is tough--\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes.\n  Mr. KERRY. Because they fear going home and somebody says: You voted \nagainst the troops.\n  This is not about the troops. We are all supportive of the troops, \nand we can have the money for the Defense bill, but we should do it \naccording to the rules of the Senate.\n  Mr. BYRD. Right.\n  Mr. KERRY. That is what we are here for. That is what this is about. \nThere is not one Senator here who does not understand that if we say no \nto cloture now, this can be stripped out. The Senator from Alaska \nhimself has said he would strip it out, that if it does not happen they \ncan take it out, reconvene the conference, we come back, and if it \nmeans an extra day to preserve the rules of the Senate, we ought to \ntake that extra day.\n  The fact is, this bill could have been passed 3 months ago, and it \nwas held up because of a stubborn insistence on the issue of torture. \nNow it is being held up in order to break the rules in order to be able \nto do ANWR. I hope our colleagues will stand up for the Senate. It is \nnot pro-ANWR or against ANWR. It is not protroops or against troops. It \nis for the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n\n[[Page S14230]]\n\n  Ms. CANTWELL. I yield 1 minute to the Senator from Michigan.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n  Ms. STABENOW. I thank my friend and colleague who has done such a \nwonderful job on this issue, the Senator from Washington.\n  I rise to oppose this motion and to clearly state, along with my \ncolleagues, that we all support funding our troops. We support helping \nthose in the gulf who have been hurt and are in such difficult times. \nWe all support the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program. We have \nhad the opportunity to vote on these. This is a question of whether \nsomething that cannot pass following the rules gets put into a bill \nthat we all support on behalf of our troops, and somehow we are \nblackmailed into passing that in order to get the funding for the \ntroops that we all want and that we all support.\n  I oppose this tactic. I appreciate that there are people on both \nsides of the aisle, well-meaning people who disagree on whether we \nshould drill in the Alaska National Wildlife Reserve. I say no. But \nthis is about whether we will support our troops and not allow the \nprocess to be hijacked. Let's vote no and get on about the business of \nfunding our troops.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired. The \nSenator from Washington.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Madam President, if I could be notified when I have \nused 5 minutes.\n  I rise today to ask my colleagues to reject this cynical ploy that \nhas brought us to this point today. Just a few days before the \nholidays, we are presented with this Defense bill that has become a \nChristmas tree. It is a Christmas tree decorated with giveaways and \nback-door exemptions, and special rules for the oil industry.\n  We have been debating the topic of ANWR for 25 years. No one should \ncondone such a blatant maneuver as taking the bill that provides \nfunding for our men and women in uniform, and stuffing into it a \nprovision that was in neither the House nor Senate bills; a provision \nthat gives away to the oil industry the ability to drill in the Arctic \nNational Wildlife Refuge; a provision that hasn't gone through the \nnormal rules and processes that any other business in the Senate would \nhave to go through.\n  This Senator strongly objects to these provisions for Arctic drilling \non the merits of the issue. I welcome a debate on the merits of the \nissue. But regardless of those issues, my colleagues should understand \nthat every Member of this institution should object to the way this \nprovision has been added to this legislation. These measures were \nslipped into the Defense spending bill, and they are a violation of the \nSenate rules. What is more, these provisions were changed after the \nbill was voted out of conference. After my colleagues had signed the \nconference report, the language related to ANWR was changed. So not \nonly was it not in the House or Senate conference bills, it was changed \nafter members had signed their names to the conference report.\n  Madam President, this is a frontal assault, as my colleague, the \nSenator from West Virginia said, on the institution, on the Senate, and \nI ask my colleagues to consider, what is next? If we are to allow \nlegislation like this to move forward, what do we have to look forward \nto in the future? Will we be drilling off the coast of Florida? Will we \nbe drilling in the Great Lakes? Will we be drilling anywhere, just \nbecause it can be put in a defense measure?\n  I ask my colleagues to make sure that we send a message that is loud \nand clear, that we are not for breaking Senate rules.\n  Over the last week or so there have been more than 20 different \neditorials from papers across the country, from New Hampshire to \nOregon, from Minnesota to Florida and elsewhere around the country, \ntalking about these issues and why we should not be in this situation.\n  From the Oregon newspaper--basically it said this is a shortsighted \nplan, and it is ``disgusting that lawmakers would try to equate oil \nprofits with our Nation's true defense needs.''\n  Another newspaper in New York said it was an eleventh hour ploy in \nCongress by Republican leadership, lowering the bar and slapping \nAlaskan oil drilling onto a must-pass bill to pay for the Iraq war.\n  Another criticism from the Oregonian:\n\n       A vote for the Arctic is not a vote against our Nation's \n     military.\n\n  We are not going to be blackmailed into passing this legislation, \njust because someone at the eleventh hour sticks this language in.\n  I saw in a news commentary, the Scarborough Report--this from \nsomebody who supports drilling in Alaska--who basically said that this \nprovision is a ``politically toxic rider to funding our troops in \nBadhdad, in Iraq, in Afghanistan, and across the world. It is \nunforgivable,'' this tactic.\n  And the military, retired leaders sent a letter saying:\n\n     . . . any effort to attach this controversial legislative \n     language authorizing drilling to the Defense appropriations \n     conference report will jeopardize Congress' ability to \n     provide our troops and their families with the resources they \n     need in a timely fashion.\n\n  We did not have to get to this point. We did not have to get to this \npoint today, where Members are being forced to vote on drilling in the \nArctic just because we have to pass a Defense appropriations bill.\n  I ask my colleagues to consider this. I do believe in a different \nview than this legislation when it comes to energy independence. I do \nbelieve that being dependent on foreign oil at more than 50 percent \ntoday is too much. There is no way we are going to drill our way to \nenergy independence in the United States. God only gave the United \nStates 3 percent of the world's oil reserves, so we should move off of \nthat and on to other supply.\n  Today we are here as Senators to say whether we are going to allow \nthe Senate rules to be broken; whether we are going to try to pass some \nlanguage that never appeared in any Senate bill, but mysteriously \nappeared in this conference report at the eleventh hour.\n  I do not think we should give a green light to oil companies in this \nfashion, giving them the ability to circumvent seven Federal laws and \ncountless regulations, regulations with which every other business in \nAmerica has to comply.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has consumed 5 minutes.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. I thank the Chair. I will consume another minute.\n  I hope the Senate will turn down this language, that we will make \nsure we do not give an exemption to oil companies from all these laws, \nand that we certainly do not do so on the backs of our military men and \nwomen.\n  I yield the floor and yield 3 minutes to the Senator from \nConnecticut.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, when I first ran for the Senate in \n1988, the question of whether to allow drilling for oil in the Arctic \nRefuge was an important choice before the voters of Connecticut. My \nopponent supported it. I opposed it. I opposed it because I wanted to \nprotect this magnificent piece of America's land and life forever, \npretty much as nature's God, as our Founders would have said, created \nit.\n  Second, I thought drilling for oil in the Arctic Refuge perpetuated a \ndangerous myth that we could drill our way out of energy dependence on \nforeign oil.\n  When I came to the Senate, I found, of course, many people who \nsupported drilling for oil in ANWR as strongly as I opposed it. Over \nthe last 17 years, we have had, almost every year, good, fair fights on \nthis issue according to the rules. In most of them, those of us who \noppose oil drilling in the Arctic Refuge have prevailed because the \nproponents have not been able to achieve the 60 votes necessary under \nthe Senate rules. What they have done in the last year or so is \nattempted to suspend and circumvent those rules, first on the budget \nmatters, circumventing the Byrd rule. In the Senate, they prevailed. In \nthe House, a very courageous band of Republicans and Democrats stood up \nand said no.\n  At the eleventh hour, the proponents of oil drilling in ANWR have \nattached this provision where it does not belong--on the Department of \nDefense appropriations bill--in the hope that we will be intimidated \ninto voting for something we don't believe is right because we don't \nwant to be accused of threatening support for our troops. I have too \nmuch of a sense of responsibility, too much respect for the Senate,\n\n[[Page S14231]]\n\nand too much respect for my constituents to be intimidated to support \nsomething I believe is wrong and clearly in contravention of our rules.\n  Somebody said to me the other day: Senator Lieberman, you are such a \nstrong supporter of the military. How can you intend to cast this vote \nwhich will threaten funding for our troops in the middle of a war?\n  My answer is: I am not the one threatening support for our military \nin the middle of the war. It is those who have had the audacity and \ndisrespect for our rules to attach this provision to funding for our \ntroops who are endangering it.\n  Second, if we yield to this tactic this time on ANWR, next year it \nwill be someone else's pet policy attached to the Department of Defense \nappropriations bill, and the year after, yet another.\n  In my opinion, if you support our military and you want security of \nfunding, particularly in time of war, you will vote against cloture to \nprotect the sanctity, if you will, the primacy of this funding for the \nmilitary.\n  Finally, if, as I hope and believe, the Senate rises up and denies \ncloture, our troops will not lose their funding. Members of Congress of \nboth parties and the President will not allow that to happen. My dear \nfriend, the senior Senator from Alaska, is too much of a patriot, no \nmatter how disappointed he is if cloture is denied, to take that anger \nout on our troops.\n  I appeal to my colleagues to vote against cloture. I am going to do \nit, not just because I am opposed to drilling for oil in the Arctic \nRefuge but because I support the U.S. military, and I refuse to have \nthe military and its funding held hostage to this move in violation of \nthe Senate rules.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Madam President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Two minutes.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. I yield the remaining 2 minutes to the Senator from \nIllinois, who has been hard working on this subject.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois is recognized for 2 \nminutes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Washington for \nher leadership, along with Senator Lieberman, Senator Kerry, and \nothers.\n  This vote on cloture comes down to two basic issues. The first is the \nissue of energy.\n  Fifty years ago, President Eisenhower set this land aside. He said \nthis Wildlife Refuge will be here for future generations. We ought to \nprotect it and preserve it. Now we are be being told that in the name \nof energy, we have no choice but to drill in this Wildlife Refuge.\n  What are we saying to Americans? What are we saying to our children? \nThat we are so bereft of ideas, that we are so devoid of leadership, \nthat we are so self-consumed, the only thing we can do to provide \nenergy for America is to break our promise to future generations to \nprotect this important piece of our heritage? I think not. The \nalternative is innovation. The alternative is conservation. The \nalternative is a real energy policy--not drilling in a wildlife refuge.\n  To think that we are bringing up this issue on the Defense \nappropriations bill--there was a time when this bill was considered in \na sacred manner. It was usually the first appropriations bill. It was \nvery rarely ever embroiled in a political controversy not directly \nrelated to the military. But this time, it is the second-to-last \nappropriations bill. It has become the vehicle for a variety of \ncontroversial political issues.\n  We show no respect for our men and women in uniform by taking this \nbill to this point in history where it becomes the showplace and the \nforum for all of these political squabbles. We should show respect for \nour men and women in uniform by defeating this cloture motion, by \ntaking out this objectionable provision, and by quickly moving to pass \nthis bill so we fully fund all that is necessary to help or men and \nwomen in uniform. The senior Senator from Alaska promised it, said that \nis what will occur.\n  I hope we prevail on the motion against cloture, that we can move \nvery quickly to pass a clean Defense appropriations.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, Senator Frist and I have spoken. After the \ndistinguished Senator from Alaska gives the closing statement, Senator \nFrist will speak, and then I will speak. We will use leader time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Madam President, I hope the good Lord will help me hold \nmy temper, and I think that will be the case.\n  The Senator from Illinois said some things that were not true. I have \nnot promised him one single thing. As a matter of fact, I asked for his \napology once; I wouldn't accept it now.\n  I wish to tell the Senator that I first went to the North Slope--and \nthere are people from the North Slope right up in the gallery--I went \nto the North Slope first in 1953 as a young U.S. attorney. I have been \ngoing there ever since. My best friends in Alaska are up there. My \nfirst wife used to go up there and go on whaling trips and spend days \nwith them. We know this Arctic. You don't know the Arctic at all. They \nwill tell you, as I will tell you, that it is 2,000 acres of Arctic. Is \nthat worth this fight? Did I bring this fight on? It was the minority \nin the House that refused to vote for the rule that we passed on the \nreconciliation bill. This provision was in the reconciliation bill. The \nmajority voted for it. Every other time it has been brought up, except \nonce, the minority has filibustered keeping the commitment made to me \nby two Democratic Senators in 1980, Senator Jackson and Senator \nTsongas. They wrote the amendment; I didn't. They wrote the amendment \nthat kept this area open for oil and gas leases.\n  I tell the Senator from Illinois that I was the one who drew the \norder that was issued creating an Arctic wildlife range in 1958 in \nwhich oil and gas leasing was specifically permitted. It has never been \nclosed. The Jackson-Tsongas amendment kept it open for oil and gas \nexploration and development subject to an environmental impact \nstatement being approved by both Congress and the President. But we are \nhere today now.\n  As my good friend from West Virginia says, we are in the temple. I \nhave lived in the temple now for 37 years. I have studied beside my \nfriend from West Virginia. But I will tell him he is wrong. Nothing in \nthis bill will allow the majority to go amok. No majority could do \nanything.\n\n  In the spirit of trying to prevent what happened before when the \nChair was overruled in 1996--and it took 4 years before we restored \nrule XXVIII--in the spirit of that, we put a provision in this bill, at \nthe suggestion of the former Parliamentarian, that we assured there \nwould not be that hiatus. Should someone raise a point of order against \nthis and the Chair would be overruled, we put a provision in it that \nwould prevent rule XXVIII from being suspended again.\n  I have been called a lot of things in the last few weeks. I didn't \nthink of putting this in the Defense bill. It was a group from the \nHouse, Members of the minority, who came to me and asked me to do this, \nput it in the Defense appropriations bill. I have managed the Defense \nappropriations bill, or my good friend from Hawaii now has managed it, \nsince 1981. I challenge anyone in the Senate to say they have greater \ncommitment to the military than the two of us.\n  As a matter of fact, as I look at the minority, I ask any one of you, \nhas anyone ever come to me as chairman of the appropriations or any \nother function and told me that you needed help for your State, that I \nhave turned you down? I have fought with you. I don't care whether it \nwas Senator Harkin, Senator Byrd, every Member. I have probably been \nthe most bipartisan Senator on this side of the aisle in history other \nthan Arthur Vandenberg.\n  Now, once again, let me say this. Every time this subject has come \nup--living up to the commitment of Senator Tsongas and Senator \nJackson--but once, the minority has filibustered. That once we did get \nit passed and President Clinton vetoed it. So here I am now, after 25 \nyears, and my two friends--they were friends, Senator Tsongas and \nSenator Jackson--they were friends so close that it caused people at \nhome to place full-page ads in the paper saying: Ted Stevens, come\n\n[[Page S14232]]\n\nhome. You don't represent us. We believe the Congress will keep this \ncommitment.\n  That was made in 1980. I have labored here and I have never violated \nthe rules. There is nothing I have done here that has violated the \nrules. Nothing in the bill before us violates the rules. I have lived \nby the rules.\n  Now I find myself second in age and second in seniority to my friend \nfrom West Virginia--at least I am the senior one on this side.\n  I will talk about this amendment. First, we cannot change the \njudicial review provision.\n  Mr. KERRY. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. STEVENS. I will not yield. No one yielded to me.\n  The impact of what I am saying is, we needed a new income stream.\n  I went to New Orleans with my friend Senator Vitter, and I sought \nSenator Landrieu's people down there. I saw the Gulf Coast States. They \nhave lost everything. I have never seen a disaster such as that. I was \nfaced with a question of how to find a revenue stream to help my \nfriends. I know they are my friends. I know disasters when I see them.\n  I also was faced with a question from the border security people \nsaying, they have to have money this year. We could not get it. We \ncould not get approval of emergencies.\n  So I met with the Congressional Budget Office. I said, I think you \nhave underestimated the income from ANWR, you have underestimated \nincome from spectrum sales. I have a letter from CBO somewhere. I will \nbe glad to put it in the Record. They said, yes, we did underestimate \nrevenues from ANWR. It will be at least twice as much as estimated, but \nwe cannot change it now. But it is true. They also agreed with me, \nmaking the assumptions I made, that there will be more money from \nspectrum. We allocated the spectrum money in the bill in excess to the \namount committed in the bill just passed. We take care of those needs.\n  The first responders is the first group. When you look at the first \nresponders group, they need equipment. There are people involved in \nhomeland security. This bill has $3.1 billion for them in terms of the \nborder security. There is $1.1 billion in emergency funds offset by \nfuture revenues from ANWR.\n  The second group deals with the first responders, particularly in New \nYork and throughout the country. That tragedy made us aware that first \nresponders could not communicate with one another. In this bill, we \nhave allocated $1 billion for first responders. That is interoperable \ncommunications, equipment, grants. We know if that is there, they will \nbe able to communicate with one another if, in fact, there is such a \ndisaster.\n  We have also public safety people. They have come to me in the last \nweek--this is a list of all the groups that have come to me now--in \nsupport of this bill. They need money to train and respond in the event \nwe have another terrorist attack.\n  Also in this bill is money for home heating. Part of the income from \nANWR is dedicated to home heating. The bill provides $2 billion in \nemergency money--yes, I said emergency--for 2006 in this bill.\n\n  If you take out ANWR, you take out that money. If you take out that \nmoney, you do not have money for LIHEAP this year other than what is in \nthe bill just passed and that is what was available last year. As we \nall know, the price of energy has gone up.\n  Yes, a vote for this bill--and to bring cloture to this bill--helps \nour Nation's farmers--our State does not have many farmers. We have \nsome great people out there trying to farm. They do a good job, but \nthey do not have the problems of what I call the south 48. Their \nproblems are high fuel prices, which we are paying, but also \nfertilizer. Fertilizer prices are off the wall. We do not have that.\n  We are able to get the money for disaster funding in this bill for \nfarmers in dealing with the conservation programs that are so necessary \nto ensure productivity for the lands of our country for generations to \ncome.\n  Some Members of the minority have challenged my sincerity with regard \nto this. I lived through an earthquake. I lived through the flood in \nFairbanks in 1966. This vote is a vote for the people of Louisiana, \nAlabama, Texas, Florida, and Mississippi. As I said, I went down there. \nI viewed the damage of that city. I saw devastation in China in World \nWar II where the Japanese wiped out cities, but I never saw devastation \nlike I saw in New Orleans. It was mile after mile after mile of homes \nof ordinary people, not just damaged, but just not there. Not there.\n  When I came back, I made a commitment to the two Senators that I \nwould help them. I have tried to keep that promise.\n  This bill provides on the Katrina side $29 billion for education, \nhousing, reconstruction of disaster areas. It is very needed. The \npeople of New Orleans cannot go home for Christmas. I cannot go home \nfor Christmas. I have already canceled my trip. I spent one time before \nin the chair on New Year's Eve. I don't look forward to it. I want \nMembers to know we will be here until we settle this problem. The \nseverability clause in this bill is not new. It has been there before.\n  I am not a fair-weather friend. I have not turned down one person on \nthat side of the aisle in my life without trying to help. I did not \neven go to you and say, Please help me. I did talk to one or more of \nyou about the fact that I thought this was the thing to do. I don't \ndeserve some of the comments that have been made by some Senators in \nthis Senate right now.\n  We are going to stay here until this is finished. As I said, a vote \nfor cloture is a vote for the troops. The Senator from Massachusetts \nsays it is not. But the easiest way to get the money to troops is to \nvote for cloture. We will be home for Christmas if we do.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 30 seconds remaining.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I say this to my friend from West Virginia: In all the \ntime we have worked together I have great admiration for you and \nstudied at your feet, but I do not believe I deserved that speech on \nthe rules. I have not violated the rules. I do not ask the Senate to \nviolate the rules. I ask them to vote for cloture, which is part of the \nrules, and see where we go from there.\n  Mr. REID. All time is expired; is that right?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. REID. I claim my leader time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Alexander). The minority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the Senate is a body of process and a body \nof order. We have rules. These rules separate us from the House of \nRepresentatives. The Founding Fathers, visionary as they were, \nrecognized that. That is why this Senate has worked so well, the \nConstitution. These rules separate us from the House of \nRepresentatives. The House is subject to partisan desires of the \nmajority. We are not.\n  For more than 200 years, through Democratic majorities and Republican \nmajorities, the Senate has lived by these rules. But twice this year--\nonce this spring and now today--the Republican majority has shown us \nhow far they are willing to go outside the rules to get what they want.\n\n  The first attempt to flex their muscle, to show their power and \nchange the Senate rules, was the so-called nuclear option. This was \nstopped when courageous Senators, Democrats and Republicans, from both \nsides of the aisle stood against it.\n  We need to see this same bipartisan courage today. The majority is \nthreatening to break the rules again--that is what this is all about--\nbut this time they are holding the U.S. military--yes, those men and \nwomen, as we stand here, are standing up in Iraq and Afghanistan--our \nmilitary is being held hostage by this issue, Arctic drilling.\n  Senator Stevens is violating rule XXVIII in order to pass ANWR. The \nSenator knows he lacks the votes to get this boon for special interests \npassed the right way, so he is willing to break the rules to jam it \nthrough.\n  Yes, I have worked with Senator Stevens all the time I have been in \nthe Senate. I have great admiration and respect for the Senator from \nAlaska. But the bill does not leave just the ANWR provision standing \nout there like a sore thumb. Another gift to special interests is the \ndrug immunity provision. The legislation was not included in either the \nHouse or the Senate versions of the Senate appropriations bill, and \nconferees were given written assurances it would not appear in the \nconference report. Yet here it is because\n\n[[Page S14233]]\n\nHouse and Senate leaders, in the middle of the night, insisted that the \nrules be broken to include it.\n  This process is not fair to the Senate, and certainly not fair to the \nU.S. military, and certainly--certainly--not fair to the American \npeople. It is time we said no to an abuse of power, no to those who \nseek to abuse the rules in the name of special interests, and no to \nturning the Senate into the House of Representatives.\n  We have rules for a reason. We have rules in the Senate for a reason. \nWhy? To create stability. It creates certainty. These rules serve the \nmajority, and they serve the minority, and they should not be broken \nbecause of special interests. They should not be broken because of the \npowerful.\n  I am going to vote against cloture today. Now, I know there are some \nin the majority who have threatened various things if cloture is not \ninvoked. But I say, Mr. President, thankfully, we have Senator Stevens' \nown words to tell us what will happen. Here is what the distinguished \nSenator from Alaska said, the bill manager. He told the Fairbanks Daily \nNews-Miner, this past Sunday:\n\n       If a Senate filibuster over ANWR stops the defense bill, \n     the legislation can be quickly modified and passed so there \n     is no impact on the military's finances.\n\n  He went on to say:\n\n       If we lose, then . . . ANWR will be out.\n\n  It is that simple. Senator Stevens is a man of his word, as he stated \non the floor today. And he said if we don't get cloture, the bill goes \nback to the conferees. Mr. President, I do not know how this vote is \ngoing to turn out. We all know it is very close. But I hope ANWR gets \ntaken out. All of us stand with our troops. And all of us want to do \nwhat is right for the Senate and for our country. That is why our best \ncourse of action is to vote ``no'' on cloture and follow the roadmap \nSenator Stevens himself has provided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. FRIST. America is watching what this body does. And America tells \nus to win the war on terror. Do not accept retreat and defeat. America \nis watching this body, and they are telling us to do something about \nenergy prices, that of home heating oil and gasoline prices, and to \nincrease the energy supply in this country.\n  America tells us to strengthen our porous borders, to enforce the \nlaws of the land. We are a nation of laws. Yes, we are a nation of \nimmigrants, a wonderful nation of immigrants, but a nation of laws.\n  America tells us to support the victims of Hurricanes Rita and \nKatrina, and what we are about to vote on in this bill is all of the \nabove. The Democrats should not filibuster our Defense appropriations \nbill. And that is what we will be voting on in a few minutes.\n  We are a nation at war. Right now, our troops are engaged on the \nbattlefield with a determined enemy. The consequences of failure to \ninvoke cloture on this Defense appropriations bill, when we have troops \nin the field, are grave. We have a responsibility not only to fully \nsupport our troops when they are at war but a responsibility also to \nsecure our economic viability. We need to reduce that dependence--that \ndangerous dependence--on foreign sources of oil.\n  The ANWR provision promises to unlock up to 14 billion barrels of \noil, nearly 1 million barrels a day at full production. ANWR has been \ndetermined by experts to be the single largest and most promising \nonshore oil reserve in North America. We need to put these energy \nresources to work for America to reduce those prices, which \nevery American feels, for our economic security and, indeed, for our \nnational security.\n\n  The ANWR provision is responsible. It is reasonable. It is critical \nto meeting our economic and security priorities.\n  And then we have the victims of Hurricanes Rita and Katrina. They \nhave suffered terrible loss--we have suffered with them--and \ndevastation. This bill, the bill we are about to vote upon, includes a \nlong-term funding stream for gulf coast recovery, as well as the most \nsignificant Katrina aid recovery package that Congress has yet \nallocated, including funds to immediately strengthen and repair the New \nOrleans levees.\n  The Defense bill provides $3 billion for border security to tighten \nthose borders. We are a nation of laws. It is time to enforce them. \nThere is $1 billion for interoperable communications equipment, the \nfirst priority of the 9/11 Commission.\n  We have long-term funding, as Senator Gregg has spoken to, to help \nlow-income Americans pay their heating bills this winter. I am \ndisturbed--disturbed--that there are Senators who believe it is a \nvictory to kill, to filibuster, to stop, to block this bill.\n  I urge my colleagues to carefully consider the consequences of the \nvote they are about to cast and the profound reverberations it will \nhave on America's economic and national security.\n  A vote for cloture is, indeed, a vote for our troops.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Chair lays \nbefore the Senate the pending cloture motion, which the clerk will \nstate.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     do hereby move to bring to a close debate on the conference \n     report to accompany H.R. 2863, the Department of Defense \n     Appropriations Act of 2006.\n\n         Bill Frist, John Cornyn, John Thune, Jeff Sessions, \n           Lindsey Graham, Saxby Chambliss, Richard Shelby, Jon \n           Kyl, Mike Crapo, Mitch McConnell, Ted Stevens, Thad \n           Cochran, C.S.

By unanimous consent, the mandatory quorum \ncall has been waived.\n  The question is, Is it the sense of the Senate that debate on the \nconference report to accompany H.R. 2863, the Department of Defense \nAppropriations Act of 2006, shall be brought to a close?\n  The yeas and nays are mandatory under the rule.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  The yeas and nays resulted--yeas 56, nays 44, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 364 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--56\n\n     Akaka\n     Alexander\n     Allard\n     Allen\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Burr\n     Chambliss\n     Coburn\n     Cochran\n     Coleman\n     Collins\n     Cornyn\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     DeMint\n     Dole\n     Domenici\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Graham\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Hatch\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Inouye\n     Isakson\n     Kyl\n     Landrieu\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     Martinez\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Murkowski\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Roberts\n     Santorum\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Sununu\n     Talent\n     Thomas\n     Thune\n     Vitter\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n\n                                NAYS--44\n\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Byrd\n     Cantwell\n     Carper\n     Chafee\n     Clinton\n     Conrad\n     Corzine\n     Dayton\n     DeWine\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Frist\n     Harkin\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     Mikulski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Obama\n     Pryor\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Rockefeller\n     Salazar\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Stabenow\n     Wyden\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thomas).

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the concurrent resolution correcting the enrollment of H.R. \n2863\n\n[[Page S14234]]\n\nwhich is at the desk and was introduced by Senator Cantwell and relates \nto the conference report to accompany the Defense appropriations bill; \nI further ask consent that there be 30 minutes for debate equally \ndivided between the two leaders or their designees; that no amendments \nor motions be in order, and that following that time the Senate proceed \nto a vote on the adoption of the resolution; I further ask that \nimmediately following that vote the Senate proceed to a vote on the \nadoption of the conference report to accompany H.R. 2863; provided \nfurther that the cloture vote with respect to the Defense authorization \nbe vitiated and the Senate proceed to an immediate vote on adoption of \nthat conference report following the vote on the Defense appropriations \nmeasure; I further ask consent that once the House has agreed to the \nconcurrent resolution without amendment, then the Labor-HHS conference \nreport be considered adopted; further that if the concurrent resolution \nthat corrects the enrollment of the Defense bill is not agreed to \ntomorrow, then passage of the Defense appropriations bill is vitiated.\n  Finally, I ask consent that if the House has not adopted the \nresolution, then, notwithstanding the adoption of the adjournment \nresolution, the Senate would reconvene Thursday, December 22, at 8 p.m.\n  I further ask consent that following the above action, the Senate \nproceed to a bill at the desk relating to the extension of the PATRIOT \nAct, the bill be considered read three times and passed, and the motion \nto reconsider be laid on the table.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will state his inquiry.\n  Mr. STEVENS. If the Leader's unanimous consent request is granted, \nthe bill is thus sent to the House. Will that bill violate rule XXVIII? \nI am talking about the conference report. Will that conference report \nviolate rule XXVIII?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator would have to specify a specific \nprovision.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I am speaking of the ANWR provisions and Katrina \nprovisions and avian flu provisions. Will they violate rule XXVIII?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. In the opinion of the Chair, those provisions \nviolate rule XXVIII.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I can't hear the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Those provisions do violate rule XXVIII.\n  Mr. STEVENS. So if this consent is granted, rule XXVIII is violated \nby this conference report; is that correct? Is that my understanding?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That issue has not been clearly joined by this \nagreement.\n  Mr. STEVENS. How do I join it? I want an agreement that this bill \nviolates rule XXVIII.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator would need to raise a point of \norder when the measure is pending.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I suggest the absence of a quorum. I do suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chambliss). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. There has been some confusion. Let me restate my \nparliamentary inquiry. If sections C and E are removed, would the \nconference report as thus constituted contain violations of rule \nXXVIII?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair is of the opinion that there would \nbe at least one violation of rule XXVIII.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I can assure you there are many more.\n  Thank you very much.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry: Has the point of \norder been be raised against any provision that would be left in this \nbill?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. No, it hasn't.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Wait. I will be glad to make a point of order, if you \nwish me to do it. Just so I understand the ruling, parliamentary \ninquiry: Did the Chair just say there is no point of order against this \nbill?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I want to make sure I understand this. I would be \npleased to make a point of order so the Chair will rule, if you want me \nto do it. We have an understanding that there are violations of rule \nXXVIII in this bill.\n  Mr. REID. Yes, there are.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Thank you.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I renew my unanimous consent request.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I had \nrequested in the time that was requested 15 minutes. That is clear. \nFurthermore, reserving the right to object, I ask unanimous consent to \namend the resolution to strike division E, the Public Readiness and \nEmergency Preparedness Act. This is the provision that provides drug \ncompanies with unprecedented immunity from liability which was added to \nthe Defense appropriations bill in the conference during the middle of \nthe night. It does not belong in this bill. I ask unanimous consent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is objection.\n  Is there objection to the unanimous consent request?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, it is \nmy understanding--I ask that it be confirmed--that titles III and VII \nof the conference report to accompany H.R. 3122 concerning port \nsecurity and the Combat Meth Act are not in this unanimous consent \nagreement. Is that correct?\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, that is correct.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, let me ask this question. The question \nis whether I can have such a commitment from the majority leader, since \nthese are both bills that have passed this body unanimously and have \nalso been conferenced by the House, if we could consider them when we \ncome back in January to be the first order of business?\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, responding to the Senator from California, \nboth of these issues--port security, as well as the methamphetamine--\nare very important issues that I believe this body unanimously will \nsupport. And after consultation with the Democratic leader, we will \naddress those very early when we come back in January or February. They \nare both very important bills.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Does the minority leader concur in that?\n  Mr. REID. Without reservation.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Thank you. January or February. Thank you very much.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the unanimous consent?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, real quickly, this means that we will have \n30 minutes of total debate followed by the concurrent resolution, \nfollowed immediately by Defense appropriations, followed by the \nauthorization by voice. That is my understanding.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I don't plan \nto, and I want to make sure no one needs a rollcall vote--I do not--on \nthe authorization bill. I want to doublecheck with a few people on this \nside.\n  Mr. FRIST. We already have unanimous consent, and I believe we will \ndo that.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, might I direct a question to the \ndistinguished majority leader through the Chair?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, if I could have the attention of the \nmajority leader, am I correct in my understanding that the Sununu-Leahy \net al 6-month extension of the PATRIOT Act has been included? And that \nis where we are with the conference report still on the calendar, but \nthe 6 months will be passed?\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, as part of the unanimous consent is the 6-\nmonth extension on the PATRIOT Act.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Sununu-Leahy et al. Thank you. I thank the Chair. I thank \nthe two distinguished leaders.\n  If I might note for a moment, both the distinguished Republican \nleader and the Democratic leader have worked\n\n[[Page S14235]]\n\nextremely hard on this, as has the Senator from New Hampshire, Mr. \nSununu, and Mr. Gregg and others, and, of course, the distinguished \nchairman of the committee, Senator Specter.\n  I think this is a reasonable conclusion that will allow the Judiciary \nCommittee to look at some of the questions which have legitimately been \nraised and would not have been heard had this gone through otherwise.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I yield 15 minutes to Senator Kennedy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the concurrent \nresolution.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       A concurrent resolution (S. Con. Res. 74) correcting the \n     enrollment of H.R. 2863.\n\n  The Senate proceeded to consider the concurrent resolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I yield 15 minutes to the Senator from \nMassachusetts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, will the Chair remind me when I have 3 \nminutes remaining?\n  Mr. President, over these last several months in the Senate we have \naddressed the issue of a potential epidemic, the pandemic flu. There \nhave been two areas of leadership. One has been in our HELP Committee \nunder the chairmanship of Senator Enzi and Senator Burr, where we have \ntried to work out a whole approach to deal with the area of epidemics \nand bioterrorist attacks, and another with the leadership of Senator \nHarkin, who had asked that we commit some $8 billion to be able to \npurchase vaccines and also antiviral drugs for influenza.\n  I attended the NIH announcement by the President of the United States \nwhen he actually requested $7.1 billion to prepare for a flu pandemic. \nThose funds were going to be used for public health, first of all, to \nbe able to detect flu outbreaks overseas; secondly, to be able to \ndetect them here at home; then to be able to build containment \ncapacities, what we call ``surge'' capacity; and, also to have a \ngenerously funded vaccine program, and also an antiviral program.\n  That is really where we were before the Defense appropriations bill.\n  A number of us on the HELP Committee had a series of negotiations to \ntry to make a bipartisan recommendation to the Senate. We did so on \npensions, on higher education, on workforce, and on Head Start. We were \nable to do so in a number of different areas. And we were moving ahead \ntoward making a recommendation in issues related to the purchase of \nvaccines and antivirals. There are two important issues to consider \nwith the purchase of pandemic influenza vaccine and antivirals. One is \nthe danger to an individual that is going to take those vaccines or \nantivirals; and the other is the risk those dangers raise for the \ncompanies that produce them. One is the compensation issue, and the \nother is the liability issue.\n  We have dealt with these issues on several occasions. We dealt with \nthem with respect to the swine flu. We dealt with these issues with \nsmallpox. We dealt with these issues for childhood vaccines.\n\n  One thing we know from experience is, if you do not have an adequate \ncompensation program, no matter how much money you put in for the \npurchase of vaccines or of antivirals, the program is not going to \nwork. There has to be an assurance that, if first responders and others \nare going to go out there and take their chance with these new vaccines \nor other drugs, that if they become grievously ill or sick or even die \nthere will be some compensation for them and for their families for \nlost wages and medical costs and the like. And there has to be the \nassurance to the first responders and others that those vaccines are \nnot going to be produced negligently. Otherwise, they will not take the \nrisk of using the vaccines or drugs. That is the framework.\n  We have to ask ourselves, for the liability and compensation \nprovisions that have been put in the Defense appropriations bill, how \ndo they line up with what has been successful in the past, with \nbipartisan efforts? These provisions fail in every respect of the word.\n  First, there is a compensation program that is not funded. It is not \nfunded. It will depend upon future appropriations. If you want to buy a \npig in a poke, buy that particular provision. All you have to do is ask \nmy friend from Utah, Senator Hatch, how we have funded the compensation \nprogram for the downwinders. Over a long period of time, we did not \nhave the required payments for them, when we know, as a direct result \nof governmental action, we adversely affected tens, even hundreds, of \nthousands of downwinders in the State of Utah and in the West more \nbroadly. We have not measured up to our responsibilities to them, and \nthe compensation program before us now is no more adequate. And as a \nconsequence, this compensation program is not going to work.\n  Not only that, what have we done with regard to the manufacturers? \nWhat kind of immunity have we given to them? It's really \nextraordinarily broad, effectively complete. What they call the ``bad \nactor'' provision describes the circumstances in which the immunity \nfrom liability fails. And it's really very narrow, because a company's \nactions have to meet a very narrow definition of willful misconduct.\n  Page 12 of this 40-page liability section says in order to have any \nkind of liability, you have to have willful misconduct. This is an act \nor omission that is taken intentionally to achieve a wrongful purpose; \nknowingly without legal or factual justification; and in disregard of a \nknown or obvious risk that is so great as to make it highly probable \nthat the harm will outweigh the benefit.\n  As if that isn't clear, and narrow, enough, on the same page, \nunderneath this language, is a rule of construction. This rule says \nthat this language establishes a standard for liability more stringent \nthan a standard of negligence in any form or recklessness. So companies \nare not deterred from acting recklessly, or with gross negligence.\n  Now that is pretty narrow, but apparently it isn't narrow enough. \nRight here on page 12, it says that the Secretary of Health and Human \nServices, in consultation with the Attorney General, must issue \nregulations that further restrict the scope of actions or omissions \nthat may qualify as willful misconduct.\n  So ``willful misconduct,'' which should just mean intentional, isn't \ngood enough.\n  Well, at least we have solved that, right, to make it as narrow as \npossible? Wrong. Go down to the standard of evidence. The bill changes \nthe standard of evidence in the various trials, to ``clear and \nconvincing evidence.'' That is at the bottom of page 13.\n  The bill defines a very narrow standard of willful misconduct, and it \nsets a very high standard of evidence. Shouldn't that be enough? Wrong. \nYou don't have a case against a company under these provisions unless \nthe FDA begins an enforcement case against that company. So if FDA goes \nahead and begins the case, you have a chance, right? Wrong again. FDA \nhas to bring it and conclude it successfully before you have any right \nto proceed with your case.\n  A person might think, I am not very satisfied with how this liability \nprovision has worked, maybe I will appeal to the courts of this \ncountry, right? Wrong. There is absolutely no, no, no, no judicial \nreview when the Secretary of Health and Human Services grants a company \nimmunity by issuing a declaration. No judicial review of that. And \nthere is no judicial review of FDA's decision not to bring an \nenforcement action. So it is whatever the administration says, whatever \nthe Secretary says, whatever the head of the FDA says, with changed and \ngimmick rules. This is a sham. There is no possibility of liability \nhere.\n  Now, we would say, OK, this is bad, but this liability protection is \nlimited to just a few products, right, products that few of us will \never have to use? It actually applies to products--vaccines, drugs, \ndiagnostic tests--for epidemics. We rarely have to worry about \nepidemics, right? Well, who defines ``epidemics''? It is rather \ninteresting who defines epidemics. Senator Domenici says diabetes is an \nepidemic. Senator Frist himself says meth abuse is an epidemic. Bill \nFrist himself said obesity is an epidemic. Senator Bond says arthritis \nis an epidemic.\n  This week in Newsweek Magazine, the Secretary of Health and Human \nServices, who is going to enforce this provision, says this:\n\n\n[[Page S14236]]\n\n\n       We're seeing an epidemic of chronic diseases. Obesity is \n     just one example.\n\n  So how many diseases are going to be considered epidemics? A lot, \nperhaps, but at least we say that is all right, because it is just \ngoing to apply to drugs for that particular epidemic disease, right? \nWrong again. This provides the same kind of liability protections for \nany of the drugs or anything else that deals with the side effects of \nthe products for that epidemic disease.\n\n  My goodness. Generally around here we measure who the winners are and \nwho the losers are. And we have seen over the last year and a half how \nthe drug companies come out on top, time and time and time and time \nagain. But never, never, never, ever, ever like they have with this \nsweetheart deal that was stuck into this conference report after the \nassurances had been given to the conferees that there were no \nprovisions in it with regard to liability.\n  The Medicare drug law made it illegal for the Government to negotiate \nprescription drug discounts for seniors. They do it in the VA system, \nand drug prices for the VA are lower. But we weren't able to permit the \ngovernment to negotiate drug prices for seniors. The Republican \nCongress blocked legislation to allow importation of safe and less \nexpensive drugs.\n  And now we find in this biodefense and pandemic flu provision \nliability shields for companies that make dangerous drugs, with no \ncompensation for injured patients.\n  That is a scandal. It has no business being in this bill. The \nJudiciary Committee requested an opportunity to examine it. It was \nrejected. We have had no hearings on this particular provision. It is \nthe wrong thing to include in this legislation.\n  Let me share what one of our colleagues has said about childhood \nobesity:\n\n       The responsibility for this growing epidemic rests with \n     us--the American consumer. We need to get serious about \n     fighting fat.\n\n  Let me cite you the language of the provision, the broad definition \non page 31 of what gets liability protections under this bill. It says: \n``Qualified pandemic or epidemic product'' means any drug, biological \nproduct, any device to diagnose, mitigate, prevent, treat, or cure a \npandemic or epidemic or limit harm from the pandemic or epidemic. And \nthe term includes not only those products, but any other product, any \nother product that is produced to deal with the side effects of those \nproducts.\n  This is a scandal. It is a giveaway. It is outrageous. It is rare, if \never, that we give this kind of privileged status to any industry in \nthe country, and give this kind of authority and power solely to one \nbranch of the Government. There is no second guessing. There is no \njudicial review. There is no further involvement of the Congress. That \nis basically and fundamentally wrong and we are asking and committing \n$3.7 billion to go down this road. It is outrageous and it is wrong.\n  I am sure that as soon as the Secretary of Health and Human Services \nissues what is called a declaration for a pandemic or epidemic to give \nimmunity from liability to vaccines or other products, there is going \nto be a charge to the courts. The constitutionality of this provision \nis going to go into the Federal district courts and the circuit courts \nof appeal.\n  Included in the Record is legal authority that I believe shows that \nthis provision, the way it is drafted, is absolutely unconstitutional \nbecause of the indefiniteness of the criteria under which the executive \nbranch makes decisions and because there is the real possibility and \nlikelihood of serious injury to individuals without any right to go to \ncourt or for judicial review of declarations.\n  This provision is going to be challenged along the way. We want to \ntell those in the bio industry--and they are healthy in my State and I \nhave worked with them--if you want to work with us to get an effective \ncompensation program, as we did in the past with smallpox or childhood \nvaccines, if you want to get an effective provision to deal with \nliability, one that is responsible and that responsible drug \nmanufacturers will welcome, then we are more than willing to welcome \nyou and to work with you.\n  But I think we can be certain that this provision will not be \neffective, and it is misleading the American people to say we are \nmaking a downpayment in the development of vaccines for the reasons I \nhave mentioned this evening.\n  Slipping a provision into a major spending bill late at night at the \nend of Congressional session is a trick to shield from public debate a \nprovision that is so wrongheaded that it would never stand public \nscrutiny.\n  The Republican congressional leadership has snuck yet another special \nfavor to drug companies into the defense appropriations bill.\n  It is an outrageous provision that has nothing to do with protecting \nour troops, and it should be dropped from the bill.\n  This provision allows drug companies to flagrantly disregard basic \nsafety measures in making a broad range of drugs or vaccines, while \ngiving patients who are injured by shoddy products only an empty \npromise of compensation.\n  It is cynical to claim that this is what is needed to deal with avian \nflu.\n  Drug industry advocates will say that this debate is about trial \nlawyers, and we have heard phrases like ``jackpot justice'' and \n``runaway juries,'' and tales of endless lawsuits against the firms \nthat make the vaccines. But that couldn't be further from the truth: \nSenator Dodd and I offered a plan that included important legal \nprotections for drug companies that make experimental flu vaccines and \nother drugs needed to respond to a pandemic or a bioterrorism attack as \nwell as a compensation program modeled after the Vaccine Injury \nCompensation Program that already works well for childhood vaccines.\n  Our proposal follows the successful examples of the past. For swine \nflu, for the smallpox vaccine and for childhood vaccines, the \nGovernment has set up a way to compensate the injured. Whenever \nCongress has provided an alternative to liability in the past, there \nhas always been an assured means for patients to receive compensation.\n  The current proposal violates that past practice.\n  It twists and turns the law to stack the deck against patients, and \nabrogates basic principles of judicial review. It is no wonder the \nprovision's authors hid it from public debate and didn't let the Senate \nJudiciary Committee even look at the proposal before it was jammed into \nthe massive conference report.\n  If they had allowed our Judiciary Committee to examine this proposal, \nwe would have quickly seen its constitutional flaws. I received a \ndetailed analysis of this provision from Professor Erwin Chemerinsky, \nwho is the Alston and Bird Professor of Law and Political Science at \nthe Duke University School of Law.\n  According to his analysis, the provision gives the Secretary of HHS \n``unfettered discretion . . . to grant complete immunity from \nliability'' while also ``depriving all courts of jurisdiction to review \nthose decisions.''\n  Professor Chemerinsky has found three areas in which the provision \ninfringes the Constitution.\n  First, the provision delegates powers to the executive branch without \nthe limitation of a prescribed standard. It is an extraordinarily broad \ndelegation--the Secretary decides when to declare emergencies, what \ndiseases or threats to health are covered, which drugs or products will \nbe immunized, which individual citizens lose their right to go to court \nand recover for injuries caused by the drugs or products, the \ngeographic area in which these rules will apply and the length of time \nthey will apply. This violates the nondelegation doctrine, which says \nthat Congress my not delegate its legislative authority to the \nexecutive branch without clear guidelines.\n  Second, it violates federalism principles by improperly intertwining \nFederal and State law, making a new Federal cause of action that \ndepends on State law. It also makes the Federal cause of action depend \non the FDA or the Attorney General taking an enforcement action. It is \na violation of due process, however, to allow official inaction to \nprevent a person from pursuing his or her rights in court.\n  Third, the provision completely prohibits judicial review of \ndeclarations that provide drug companies with immunity.\n  The U.S. Supreme Court has repeatedly stressed that the preclusion of \nall judicial review raises ``serious questions'' concerning separation \nof powers\n\n[[Page S14237]]\n\nand due process of law. Judicial review of government actions has long \nregarded as ``an important part of our constitutional tradition'' and \nan indispensable feature of that system.\n  I reserve whatever time I have remaining.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise to make a few remarks concerning the \nPublic Health and Emergency Preparedness Act of 2006 which was inserted \nin a year-end appropriations vehicle, the Department of Defense \nAppropriations Act.\n  Protecting the American public against acts of bioterrorism like the \n2001 anthrax attacks and natural disease outbreaks such as the risk \nposed by the avian flu is an important national security priority.\n  For 4 years, I have worked in a bipartisan manner with my friend from \nConnecticut, Senator Lieberman, on comprehensive legislation to address \nthis concern.\n  We have vetted our proposal with literally hundreds of experts over \nthe last 4 years.\n  We understand full well that our proposal contains a number of bold \nproposals that challenge our colleagues to make fundamental changes in \nour biomedical research, public health management, regulatory, \nantitrust, intellectual property, tax and civil liability systems \ntoward the end of materially increasing our Nation's public/private \nsector capacity to design, develop and distribute hopefully hundreds of \nnew products to counter the effects for the dozens of known biological, \nchemical or nuclear threat agents for which we today literally have no \ndiagnostics, vaccines or therapeutic responses.\n  This is a tall order.\n  It will likely take 20 or more years to build this capacity to the \nlevel we will need to discourage our enemies from attacking us in this \nmanner or, if they do so, to be able to respond in the way that the \npublic will expect to ensure the strength of American society.\n  We have made some progress in recent years but we have to do much \nmore in this area.\n  This is the type of issue that takes time, money, creative energy and \npatience.\n  We need a Manhattan Project type of effort, and we needed it 4 years \nago.\n  Throughout my years in the Senate, I have worked on dozens of \nimportant public health bills.\n  In my experience, public health bills go better if they are done on a \nbipartisan basis.\n  I have also observed over time that, generally speaking, good public \nhealth policy turns out to be good politics. I know of no disease or \ncondition that chooses its victims along party lines.\n  I am pleased that a key concept of the legislation that we introduced \nin 2002, the ``guaranteed market'' for those firms that successfully \ndevelop certain bioterrorism countermeasures was finally adopted in the \nBioshield I legislation passed in the 108th Congress.\n  In the first session of the current 109th Congress, there has been a \ngreat deal of interest in bioterrorism and pandemic diseases. This is \ngood for the American public.\n  In the Senate, the HELP Committee was infused with new leadership on \nthis issue in the persons of our new chairman, Senator Enzi, and the \nchairman of the new Bioterrorism and Public Health Preparedness \nSubcommittee, Senator Burr. Majority Leader Frist and former Chairman \nGregg have continued their longstanding involvement on these issues.\n  Across the aisle, led by a veteran leader in public health issues who \nhas been on the HELP Committee or its predecessors for 43 years, \nSenator Kennedy and others including Senators Harkin, Dodd and Clinton \nhave been interested in these issues.\n  Throughout the Spring of this year the Bioterrorism Subcommittee held \na series of bipartisan hearings and discussion roundtables that were \nattended by leading experts. Throughout the August recess the staffs of \nthe committee members worked on various drafts of bioterrorism \nlegislation that culminated in a markup in September.\n  Unfortunately, from my perspective, the bill that resulted from the \nHELP markup did not contain the intellectual property and tax \nprovisions that Senator Lieberman and I have long advocated. Such is \nthe reality of the dance of legislation. But, as has developed in the \nprovisions related to the guaranteed market, liability, and \ncompensation, we believe that the day will come when these ideas from \nour original legislation are also seen as meritorious.\n  Subsequent to that markup, the Bush administration unveiled its \ncomprehensive plan to prevent and respond to the potential catastrophic \noutbreak of human-to-human avian flu transmission.\n  Throughout the Fall, many Members of Congress, the administration, \nindustry, the public health community and other interested parties \nworked on various pieces of legislation to respond to these threats. \nUnfortunately, as sometimes happens at the end of very busy \ncongressional sessions, not everyone was able to work together at the \nsame time.\n  For a variety of factors, we have now arrived at a point where a \npotentially integral piece of an effective legislative response to \nbioterrorism and pandemic threats has been inserted into the Department \nof Defense appropriations bill. Using year-end appropriations bills as \nvehicles can be an opportunity to solve important problems but, \nsometimes, can pose a risk that an inadequately vetted measure becomes \nlaw.\n  As many who are not members of the esteemed Appropriations Committee, \nI have a preference for the regular order of the authorization process. \nIn all candor, from time to time in my career, I have availed myself of \nappropriations vehicles to move authorization bills that I desired to \nsee passed. Sometimes, as shocking as it sounds, there is gambling in \nCasablanca.\n  Comes now the newly drafted, and redrafted and redrafted, Public \nReadiness and Emergency Preparedness Act.\n  Both Senators Frist and Gregg must be singled out in the Senate for \ntheir efforts to develop and move this new bill. In the House, I \nunderstand that Speaker Hastert and Chairman Barton, even as he was \nhospitalized, are largely responsible for this effort.\n  All of these good and earnest members should be recognized for \nattempting to tackle two of the most vexatious policy and legal issues \nconfronting us in this critical area: liability; and compensation \nreform.\n  We need to encourage the private sector to work vigorously on scores \nof new, potentially dangerous drugs and biological products designed to \ncounter both natural and bioterroist threat agents. That is what \nliability reform is all about.\n  At the same time, if some of these products--some of which will never \nbe tested in human clinical trials since it would be unethical to \ninfect a patient with a microbe like the Ebola virus just to see if a \npotential treatment were safe and effective--turn out to injure and \neven kill patients, there must be a fair and funded system of \ncompensation.\n  Some critics are already falsely charging that these new provisions \nare nothing but a Republican gift to the drug industry during the \nChristmas season.\n  Hogwash.\n  There should be no doubt that the sole intention of the principal \ndrafters of this legislation is to help devise a system that will \nincrease the readiness of our country to respond to bioterrorist or \nnatural public health threats.\n  I also think it is way past time that Members of this body and others \nstop unjustifiably vilifying the pharmaceutical industry. Due in large \npart to the unique partnership between the public and private sector \nbiomedical research enterprise--undergirded by the substantial annual \n$28 billion taxpayer investment in the National Institutes of Health--\nwe are on the verge of a revolution in our understanding of human \nhealth and disease. Let's just hope that neither the avian flu not the \nbioterrorists strike before we have developed the means to defeat these \nthreats.\n  We will not defeat biological enemies with bullets or battleships. It \nwill be accomplished with basic biological knowledge and the applied \nknow-how required to translate ideas from the lab to the patient's \nbedside.\n  Integral to this system and to our national security is the too \noften-maligned pharmaceutical industry.\n  They are tough, profit seeking companies. They are often their own \nworst enemies. They are not always right.\n  But nor are they always wrong. The products they produce are aimed at\n\n[[Page S14238]]\n\npreventing and treating diseases and reducing suffering. And that is \nnot the worst business to be in by any means.\n  The situation is that we are confronting an enormous chicken-and-egg \nproblem in developing new vaccines and countermeasures due to the fact \nthat in the last several decades product liability exposure has \ndrastically reduced our domestic vaccine production capability. I \nunderstand that in 1976, 26 companies produced vaccines for the U.S. \nmarket. This year, only five companies produce vaccines sold in the \nU.S. and only three have U.S. production facilities.\n  This constitutes both a public health and national security challenge \nthat must be addressed.\n  While I have concerns about many of the precise provisions in this \nnew language, I recognize and commend my colleagues for attempting to \nsolve a problem that needs solving.\n  I have great respect for the majority leader, especially as he \nattempts to navigate this year's exceedingly complex package of pending \nbills which include the budget reconciliation bill--the first such \nmeasure in nearly 10 years--the PATRIOT Act, the Labor-HHS \nappropriations bill, as well as the Department of Defense authorization \nand appropriations bills. This is a tall order by any standard.\n  Although I urged the Leader not to include this new bill in the year-\nend legislation, I told him that I would not vote against this measure \nif it were part of one of the year end, must pass vehicles.\n  I did this largely out of deference to our majority leader.\n  For reasons that I will explain, if it came to a simple up-or-down \nvote on this measure as currently drafted, I could not yet support it \nand would vote no.\n  If this measure does in fact become enacted into law, I will be open \nto considering further modifications in this language should our study \nof this new language indicate that changes are advisable.\n  Many will question whether this bill, in its current form, contains \ntoo much indemnification and not enough compensation. This is a fair \nquestion.\n  For example, the funding mechanism in the bill does not appear to be \nguaranteed.\n  I have been down the hard road of discretionary funding with respect \nto the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act, which I authored, and I \ncannot say that I would recommend such an important program to be \nsubject to the uncertainties of less than stable, certain funding.\n  Still others will question why the bill provides for no judicial \nreview, apparently even by the United States Supreme Court, for certain \nactions by the Secretary of Health and Human Services?\n  There will be concern that the bill does not allow adequate judicial \nreview to assure that the Secretary has not acted either arbitrarily or \ncapriciously in certain circumstances.\n  Because of the great significance of this measure, I suggest that \nChairmen Enzi and Specter hold hearings on this language once the \nCongress reconvenes after the holidays.\n  It is, for example, important to learn what the administration thinks \nabout this new bill and whether, upon reflection, it would urge some \nrefinements.\n  I have not seen a Statement of Administration Policy on this measure.\n  Nor have I seen a Congressional Budget Office score so it is a little \nunclear to me how much this new section would cost.\n  The administration will be called upon to administer a new \ncompensation program and we need to know how they plan to implement \nthis program and whether they have any suggestions to improve the \noperation of this program.\n  As well, I would not be surprised if more Members and other \ninterested parties will want to weigh in on the structure of the new \ncompensation program, which is based in large part, on the current \nsmallpox vaccine injury compensation program.\n  As our experience with the asbestos legislation teaches us, there is \nalways great interest in the level of compensation injured citizens may \nreceive, especially if they give up their possible tort remedies.\n  I note that there is a higher standard imposed upon the Secretary in \nconstructing an injury table under this new bill than must be met under \nthe current smallpox vaccine injury compensation law. Many will want to \nknow exactly what is intended and what the practical effect of this new \nstandard will be on the health experts who will advise the Secretary in \nthis critical area.\n  There are also many questions that must be explored with respect to \nhow the liability shield will operate in practice.\n  Let me state clearly that I favor a strong liability shield so that \nmany pharmaceutical and biotechnology firms will enter this critically \nimportant field of research and development. The fact is today that \nthere exists a pervasive climate of apprehension about product \nliability and litigation exposure and this is chilling the necessary \nprivate sector activity.\n  Clearly something must be done. It is not so clear that the new \nliability language is yet as good as it needs to be. For example, the \nway in which the willful misconduct and FDA defense provisions operate \ntogether in the context to potential court challenges merit particular \nattention. As well, the policy and business-behavioral ramifications of \ndrawing a hard line between all forms of negligence and wilful \nmisconduct deserve careful thought and analysis.\n  In the case of dual use products, such as antibiotics, it appears \nthat, should a bad batch of drugs be made due to ordinary negligence, a \npatient injured when taking the product for a normal, garden-variety \ninfection will have a much greater range of legal remedies than a \nperson who took a pill from the same adulterated production batch but \nunder a Secretarial declaration of a public health remedy. It is not \nreadily apparent why this should be the case.\n  There may be ways to further improve and refine these provisions and \nother parts of the bill as well. For example, consideration is \nwarranted with respect to whether there ought to be a subrogration \nprovision in certain cases when the Federal Government must compensate \npatients for injuries caused by negligent or grossly-negligent actions \nof manufacturers, distributors, or others connected with developing the \ndrug or delivering it to patients.\n  In any event, I think we should keep an open mind to viewing this new \nlanguage as something as a work in progress.\n  Rather than embarking down a path of political who-struck-John on how \nthis new section got into the bill and who drafted this provision or \nthat provision, I think the public will be better served if we focus \nour future efforts on evaluating what the bill does and deciding \nwhether there are ways we can make it better.\n  One thing is certain. If we do not find a better way to unleash the \ncreative efforts of the private sector in researching and developing a \npanoply of new products designed to diagnose, prevent and treat \nbioterrorist and natural threats, the health and welfare of our Nation \ncannot be secure.\n  We have a big job ahead of us.\n  I urge that we move forward in a constructive, bipartisan effort to \nfurther improve the Public Readiness and Emergency Preparedness Act \nthat has been placed in the DOD appropriations bill conference report. \nIf others are willing to proceed in this fashion, I am certain that \nSenator Lieberman and I, and many others, stand ready to discuss and \nrefine this and any other piece of related legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Voinovich). Who yields time?\n  The Senator From Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I want to make sure everyone understands \nwhat we have done. I worked 3 months of my life on this bill, primarily \nto find a way to help the people whom I saw in New Orleans. But this \nunanimous consent agreement strips sections C and D out of the bill. \nThat section D allocated the funds that were to be received from the \ndevelopment of ANWR and the spectrum money that we expect to come into \nthe Treasury in excess of what was estimated in the budget and \nearmarked it to a gulf recovery fund and earmarked it to the LIHEAP \nprogram under a different formula than the existing formula.\n  The net result is that those who are going to vote for the separate \nresolution--and I shall vote against it--will\n\n[[Page S14239]]\n\nbe taking money from the first responders. Let me go through that. \nThere was $3.1 billion for our first responders, for homeland security \nneeds. We had $1 billion for our farmers and ranchers for farm \nconservation programs. The gulf coast recovery fund was estimated to \nhave $5 billion in bonus bids and $40 billion in royalties over the \ntotal production years of ANWR. It would have committed 50 percent to \nLouisiana, 25 percent to Mississippi, 10 percent to Alabama, 10 percent \nto Texas, and 5 percent to Florida.\n  When we remove that, we do remove the $2 billion emergency spending \nfor LIHEAP, and we remove the $3.1 billion for border security. That is \nmoney that was there. It was not funny money. It was money for this \nyear.\n  So when you go back to New York, will you tell them why? That first \nresponder money was $1,750,000,000 for the cities of New York, Los \nAngeles, San Francisco, Miami, Boston, Washington, DC, Chicago, \nPhiladelphia, and Houston. I showed before the list of all the people \nwho supported that.\n  In terms of the preparedness grants for avian flu response, and for \nevacuation routes, refugee feeding and housing in the event of another \ndisaster: $1 billion. But above all, the $1.1 billion in 2006 money for \nborder security for the Northern border and the Southern border, we \nwere overwhelmed with support for that. By voting for this, you will \ntake it out. You are taking out C and D. You are taking out all the \nfunding.\n  Now, what does that mean? It means that next year when we get the \nbudget they will pick up the estimates we were able to make. The money \nfor ANWR will next year be, I believe, estimated--I am sure it will; I \nhave a letter--at $10 billion. This year it was $5 billion. That $5 \nbillion that was in the budget will not be available to Louisiana. It \nwill not be available to the disaster area. The $10 billion we \nestimated in addition to the $10 billion that is already in the budget \nfor spectrum auctions will take place in 2008 and 2009. Actually, the \nFCC believes it is going to be $28 billion. We had used $8 billion in \naddition to the $10 billion that is in the budget. That, next year, \nwill also be estimated, and it will be used by the budget. So that \nmoney is not going to be available for these things that Senator \nCantwell's resolution will deny.\n  Senator Cantwell has authored this resolution to take out of the bill \nall of this money that we worked so hard to find a way to justify. We \ntook future revenues coming into the Treasury, held them in the \nTreasury and earmarked them for specific purposes when they would \narrive. We were told to have every reason to expect that money would \ncome in. And the House agreed with us and allowed two separate \nemergency things to take place. One was $1.1 billion for border \nsecurity. The other was $2 billion for LIHEAP for those who are in \nStates that are affected by the current formula. That is primarily the \nMidwestern States and Maine.\n  But I want the Senate to know the work we did in finding this money \nand finding a way to hold it in the Treasury, it will not be held any \nmore. This amendment takes out of the bill sections C and D. That means \nnext year you will not find money on this approach for the help for the \ndisaster areas or to deal with LIHEAP or to deal with homeland \nsecurity. And $3 billion was earmarked in that fund when the money came \nin. It was to go to homeland security. We earmarked it. No future \nbudget could use it.\n  By taking C and D out, by voting for it--all of you--I am going to go \nto every one of your States, and I am going to tell them what you have \ndone. You have taken away from homeland security the one source of \nrevenue that was new revenue. It was money that should have been used \nfor disaster. It should have been used for homeland security. And I am \nsure that the Senator from Washington will enjoy my visits to \nWashington because I am going to visit there often.\n  This was wrong. We should have kept sections C and D in this bill. \nThis was something that we studied. We went with CBO. We talked to \neveryone possible. Everyone understood it in the House, what we did. \nThe Senate refused to even look at it. I think most of you voted for it \nwithout even looking at it. California has lost its money for disasters \nin the future from that revenue source. It will have to find some way \nthrough the budget to compete with everybody else next year in a \ndeclining budget year. Because as the interest on the national debt \ngoes up, there is less money to allocate for existing programs. I \npredict next year will be the toughest budget year in history.\n  But we took money from 2008, 2009, 2010, and we earmarked it. One \nthing you did not notice, we put in borrowing authority. In the event \nthere is a disaster, the Secretary could go to Treasury and say: Mr. \nSecretary of Treasury, I exercise the borrowing authority and get that \nmoney right now. Did you know that? I bet half of you--none of you--\nread the bill, none of you read the bill. But I am going to explain the \nbill to everyone in the country--the homeland security bill, the first \nresponders, the interoperability part of it, the part of equipment for \nfirst responders.\n  The total amount of this bill has been destroyed by the Cantwell \namendment. And I want to make sure everyone understands it. Emergency \nassistance for seniors and low-income Americans: That $2 billion was at \na different theory, different formula than the existing law. We made it \navailable to those in great need this winter. By this amendment, by \nvoting for it, you take it away. Go ahead and vote for it. I am going \nto vote against it because I know what I did. I found and spent a lot \nof time with those who handle budget matters and particularly the CBO. \nAsk them. I will show you the letters. They said I was right, that was \nnew revenue coming into the Federal Government. Everyone expects it, \nand we earmarked it for those things that we all believe in now.\n  Next year, are you going to give it to homeland security? Are you \ngoing to give it to border security? Are you going to give them $2 \nbillion for LIHEAP? By the way, it did not have to be spent this year. \nIt could carry over. It is to be used when needed, by higher prices. \nOK? It was not something that was total spending this year.\n  I do think the hurricane areas are the ones that lost most. There is \na $14 billion estimate in C and D for the hurricane area: $7 billion \nfor Louisiana, $3.5 billion for Mississippi, $1.4 billion for Texas, \n$1.4 billion for Alabama, and $1.2 billion for Florida.\n  Mr. President, this Senator has tried to do what is right. In the \nlast month or 2 months, I have been pilloried by almost every newspaper \nin this country because of what has been said on this floor and what \nhas been said by Members on the other side of this body. I have been \ncalled a liar. I have been told that I violated the rules. I have been \ntold I did things in the middle of the night when no one knew it. I \nhave been told almost everything. Even my grandchildren asked my son: \nIs that right?\n  I ask the Senate: Is that right? Should I lose the reputation I have \ngotten for 37 years in the Senate? No one has ever questioned my \nintegrity before this year. Well, we had one little thing--I see an \naction from the Chair--about an ethics matter in my State, but that, \ntoo, was misunderstood. And I am glad to see that--I hope that has been \nput to rest. But in any event, no one has really questioned my actions \nhere on the floor.\n  But they have been. People I have known on the other side, on a \nfirst-name basis, have come to me and talked to me about their \nproblems--each one of you. Many of you have spoken here and said things \nthat are not true, and you know they are not true. As I said, one \nSenator said something so bad, I asked for an apology. I would not \naccept his apology now.\n  Mr. President, I am going to go home, and I am going to think about \nthis, and I am going to try to figure out what to do next year. But I \nknow one thing, the 3 months I spent on this to try and help the people \nin the disaster area, with the sincere belief in the--how many of you \nhave been to the disaster area? Did you spend a couple of days down \nthere, as I did? Did you go and look at it? Did you see the miles and \nmiles of homes that are gone? Did you see a great big barge, bigger \nthan this room, on top of a schoolhouse? Did you see miles and miles of \nlevees just laid down? Did you see the devastation as that tsunami came \nup that channel that man dug from New Orleans to the gulf?\n\n[[Page S14240]]\n\n  Did you see that? Did you see how it devastated the land, and all the \nplant life is now dying because it was inundated in saltwater?\n  The earthquake in my State did that. I saw one town disappear. I saw \na third of my city, Anchorage, disappear. You have to have had that \nexperience to understand how I felt when I went to New Orleans.\n  You people didn't believe it. Many of you said I did this for \npolitical reasons, just a crass thing, pick up some money and give it \naway for votes. I never asked one of you for a vote. I talked to some \nof you about how you should vote, but I never went to you and said: You \nhave to vote for me. You wouldn't be voting for me; it was voting for \nthe people who would have been helped.\n  This has been the saddest day of my life. It is a day I don't want to \nremember, and I am sorry to see it come to an end. Because I am drawing \nthe line now with a lot of people I have worked with before. I really \nam. I can't put in my mind the amount of time, the days I have spent \nwith you working on your problems, and to know you said about me the \nthings you said in the last 2 months. I say goodbye to the Senate \ntonight. Thank you very much.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. REID. I yield back the time on this side.\n  Mr. FRIST.

The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I would like to speak for 30 seconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I know everyone is anxious to vote. In \nthis underlying bill on defense, I just wish to say that there is $29 \nbillion for coastal restoration, hurricane protection, housing, and \nbusiness help for the gulf coast. I know it has been a tough, long day, \nbut in this bill there is $29 billion because of the hard work by both \nsides of the aisle. We are very grateful for the help on this bill.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I rise to express my surprise and deep-\nseated opposition to the so-called Public Readiness and Emergency \nPreparedness Act, which is included in the Defense Department \nAppropriations bill.\n  This provision would give the Secretary of Health and Human Services \nauthority to provide almost total immunity from liability to the makers \nof almost any drug, and to those who administer it.\n  While the measure's proponents portray it as a simple tool to make \nsure we have sufficient vaccine available in the case of an avian flu \npandemic, the actual language of the provision is far broader than \nthat, and it therefore poses a danger to all Americans.\n  The actual provision permits immunity for the makers of virtually any \ndrug or medical treatment. All the secretary need do is declare that it \nis a ``countermeasure'' used to fight an epidemic. One solitary person \ngets to decide what is a countermeasure and what is an epidemic. There \nis nothing to prevent the declaration of immunity for, say, Tylenol. \nThere is nothing to prevent a declaration that, say, arthritis is an \nepidemic.\n  What's more, this is no typical grant of immunity. No, the breadth of \nthis provision is staggering. A drug maker can be grossly negligent in \nmaking or distributing a drug, and still escape liability. It can even \nmake that drug with wanton recklessness and escape scott-free after \nharming thousands of people.\n  In fact, under this provision, the only way a victim could still \nrecover compensation from a drug maker for a dangerous drug or vaccine \nwould be to prove ``willful misconduct,'' and then only by ``clear and \nconvincing evidence.'' What this means is that, for a victim to be able \nto be compensated by the company that harmed him, he must prove that \nthey committed a crime. And even if he can do that, the company can \nstill avoid liability simply by notifying the authorities within 7 days \nthat someone was harmed by their product. In other words, so as long as \nyou ``confess'' to your bad behavior, you can get away with it!\n  Is this the sort of justice system that Americans desire?\n  The answer to this question seems clear from the way this provision \nwas inserted in the larger bill. No hearings were held on this \nlanguage; no Committee vote was taken; no bill passed the House or the \nSenate. Not even the House and Senate conferees had a chance to give \ninput on this provision. Indeed, I'm told it was inserted in the dead \nof night, after conferees had already signed the conference report!\n  Perhaps the folks who secretly inserted this provision in the dead of \nnight knew that it was overly broad, as I've discussed; perhaps they \nknew that it was constitutionally suspect, as has been noted by at \nleast one prominent law professor; or perhaps they just knew that, if \nthis provision ever saw the light of day, the American people would not \nstand for such secrecy and injustice.\n  This should not be how we conduct the business of the American \npeople, and we will all suffer if this provision is permitted to go \nforward.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the Senate is now on its way to passing the \nDefense appropriations bill, which will provide essential funds to our \ntroops. The U.S. Armed Forces are comprised of some of the finest men \nand women our country has to offer. Each of these brave individuals has \nmade the commitment to serve our country, during times of war or peace, \nand each is deserving of the support of a grateful nation.\n  I particularly wish to salute the fine members of the West Virginia \nNational Guard who have time and again demonstrated their commitment to \nserving our State and our Nation. These citizen-soldiers have served in \nall corners of the world while balancing their obligations to their \nfamilies, to their employers, and to their communities. The Defense \nappropriations bill is important to our National Guard and all the \nmembers of our military. I am proud to have worked with my colleagues \nto expedite passage of this essential legislation.\n  The Senate is proceeding in a wise course after the cloture vote this \nmorning. The most controversial part of the conference report will be \nremoved, clearing the way for the Defense appropriations bill to pass \nthe Senate and be sent on its way to the White House. It is unfortunate \nthat the deletion of the most controversial provision that was attached \nto the bill in conference will also result in eliminating needed funds \nfor hurricane relief, LIHEAP, homeland security, and border security. \nCongress should not delay in providing additional funds for these \npurposes. There are emergency needs in each of these areas that must be \nmet with quick action.\n  While the ANWR provision will be removed from the bill, I continue to \nhave serious concerns about the avian flu-related liability provisions \nthat were slipped into the conference report without debate. These \nliability provisions did not appear in either the House- or the Senate-\npassed bill. These provisions were not in the materials presented to \nthe conference committee during its deliberations. It was not until the \ndead of night on this past Sunday, after signatures had already been \ncollected on the conference report, that the Republican majority \nslipped these provisions into the bill before the Senate today. What an \ninsult to the legislative process.\n  It makes sense for Congress to take steps to encourage companies to \ndevelop and manufacture lifesaving flu vaccines. Manufacturers and \nhealth professionals acting in good faith to protect the public health, \nby developing and distributing critical vaccines, should not be \nunfairly penalized for their efforts to protect the American people \nfrom the horrors of a pandemic disease.\n  However, our country has a moral obligation to look out for those who \nmay become seriously ill as a result of these vaccines. We are talking \nabout the lives of real American people. There ought to be compensation \navailable to those persons who may suffer adverse effects from these \nkinds of vaccines.\n  But the liability amendment slipped into the bill does not contain \nany meaningful provisions establishing a fair compensation system to \nprotect vaccine recipients. Americans who pull up their sleeves to \nreceive an emergency flu vaccine must be provided with some assurance \nthat they would not face economic catastrophe should they be harmed.\n  All of this comes as our country is coming to grips with the threat \nthat the avian flu might spread to our shores. A flu pandemic is one of \nthe most dangerous threats the United States faces today. Medical \nexperts warn that a global, cataclysmic pandemic is not a question of \nif but when. Like any natural disaster, it could hit at anytime. And \nwhen it does, it could take the lives of tens of millions of people.\n  According to the Congressional Budget Office, an avian flu pandemic \nwould deliver a devastating $675 billion blow to the U.S. economy. This \nadministration has failed to adequately respond to safeguard the \nAmerican people and limit the human and economic cost of such a \npandemic.\n  In the event of a flu pandemic, hundreds of millions of Americans \nwill need to be vaccinated as quickly as possible. Yet our current \npublic health infrastructure is alarmingly ill-equipped for this \nthreat. This administration and the Republican-led Congress have \nweakened the health care infrastructure of this country by starving it \nof needed funding. The administration has been engaged in a relentless \ncampaign to arbitrarily cut Medicaid and other vital safety-net \nprograms that protect the health of the poor and disabled.\n  I am also disappointed that the majority chose to limit funds for \nvaccines, medicines, and other tools to combat\n\n[[Page S14243]]\n\nthe avian flu to just $3.8 billion. That level of funding is $4.3 \nbillion below the level that the Senate approved just 2 months ago.\n  The American people deserve better from their elected \nrepresentatives. They deserve a coherent plan to combat the looming \nthreat of a flu pandemic with significant resources devoted to \nprotecting the public's health.\n\n  Finally, Mr. President, I regret that so little attention has been \npaid during the recent debate on this bill to the most important issue \nfacing our country. The ongoing war in Iraq has so far cost the lives \nof 2,155 members of the U.S. Armed Forces. Including the so-called \n``bridge fund'' of $50 billion that is appropriated in this bill, our \nNation will have dedicated $259 billion to carry out the war in Iraq. \nWhat an enormous sum. More than a quarter of a trillion dollars has \nbeen spent on this war that should never have begun.\n  What is more, the newspapers are full of stories that the President \nis going to ask Congress for another $100 billion in the coming months \nto pay for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n  These huge sums of money are being requested and spent for the war in \nIraq with no idea of how the White House intends to get our troops out \nof that country. The President has taken to the speaking circuit to try \nto rally support for the war, but his statements are simply variations \non a theme: stay the course, stay the course, stay the course.\n  Americans are asking questions that the White House has so far \nrefused to address. How much longer will our troops be in Iraq? How \nmany more Americas will perish in this costly war? How many more \nbillions will be spent to support the administration's misguided \npolicies in Iraq?\n  Instead of getting answers to these questions, and instead of \nchanging course in the war in Iraq, this appropriations bill includes \n$50 billion to continue the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, despite the \nfact that the President did not request a single dime in his budget for \nthese costs. Let me say again: the Congress is appropriating billions \nmore for the war in Iraq without a request from the President. Is this \nany way to pay for a war?\n  Although Senators must do our part in providing for our troops \nserving in harm's way, I do not think that our troops are served by \nhaving Congress appropriate funds for the war in Iraq without any \nexplanation by the President or the Secretary of Defense about how \nthese funds are to be used. If the administration wants additional \nfunds to prosecute the war in Iraq, the administration should answer \nthe tough questions about its policy for getting our country out of \nIraq.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to \nobject to insertion of a provision in the Department of Defense \nappropriations bill that would provide sweeping immunity protections to \npharmaceutical manufacturers. I know that this provision is being \nbilled as a simple liability protection to help those who would \nmanufacture avian flu vaccine, but it is nothing of the sort. I support \nlimited liability protections for manufacturers to help cover their \nrisks in developing products that our Nation will need in case of \nemergency. However, this provision would grant immunity to all claims \nof loss, including death and disability, for a broad range of products, \nincluding any drug that the Secretary designated as one that would \nlimit the harm caused by a pandemic--a definition so broad as to \nencompass nearly any drug.\n  This immunity is not subject to judicial review. It preempts any \nState laws that provide different liability protections or that may \nprovide stronger consumer safety protections for pharmaceutical \nproducts. In fact, the only exception to this immunity is for actions \nof ``willful misconduct,'' which is so narrowly defined that it would \nonly apply to cases where a company intentionally set out ``to achieve \na wrongful purpose . . . in disregard of a known or obvious risk that \nis so great as to make it highly probable that the harm will outweigh \nthe benefit.'' The provision requires the Secretary and the Attorney \nGeneral to narrow the scope of willful misconduct even further and \nstates that for any FDA-approved product, willful misconduct will not \napply unless the Government is already taking action against the \nmanufacturer for such misconduct.\n  If the Government is providing complete immunity to manufacturers, \nhow are those who may be injured to seek compensation in case of \ninjury? This provision sets up a ``Covered Countermeasure Process \nFund,'' but fails to provide any money for this fund. We all recognize \nthat in a public health emergency, we may need to seek whatever \nprotections we can find to prevent widespread death and disease--but \nthose who are asked to take these products are told that if they are \ninjured, their only recourse is to seek compensation from a fund which \ncurrently has no money to award.\n  I am also gravely concerned by the fact that this provision was \nincluded in the appropriations bill without following the process for \npassing legislation used by this Chamber. This authorizing--\nauthorizing, not appropriating--language was never considered, let \nalone agreed to by the Senate. It was never agreed to by the HELP or \nJudiciary Committees, which have jurisdiction over this matter. It is a \nmockery of the legislative process. I believe that the American people \nare ill-served by Congress when controversial and potentially harmful \nprovisions can simply be inserted without undergoing the open \ndeliberations and debate that are fundamental to the democratic process \nand are designed to protect our citizens from special interests and \nback-room dealings. This provision should be stripped from the bill.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, this week, the Senate considers conference \nreports on two pieces of legislation--the Defense Authorization and \nAppropriations Acts that are critical to the security of our Nation. \nThese conference reports contain important measures for keeping our \ntroops safe and secure, particularly provisions to upgrade body armor \nand protective equipment, resources to ramp-up vital construction of \nU.S. military ships, aircraft, and ground vehicles, and funding for \nresearch on vital defense technologies of the future.\n  The conference agreements also promote important quality-of-life \nimprovements for our troops and their families, including a 3.1 percent \npay raise for all military personnel and increases in compensation for \nsurvivors of military personnel killed since the onset of the wars in \nAfghanistan and Iraq.\n  These two bills could not come before the Senate at a more urgent \ntime. Our Nation is at war, and our troops desperately need these \nresources to complete their missions in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n  This Congress owes America's fighting men and women its unconditional \nsupport for these critical defense priorities. But this year, the \nadministration and Members of the majority in Congress have fallen far \nshort of meeting this responsibility. They have allowed a handful of \npowerful special interests to impede the critically important process \nof funding our national defense, including America's highest security \npriorities. The Republican leadership's decisions to open up the Arctic \nNational Wildlife Refuge for oil companies' exploitation and to shield \ndrug and vaccine makers from any accountability have absolutely nothing \nto do with national security and have no place in bills like the \ndefense appropriations conference report. Their willingness to risk \nfunding for our troops in favor of these parochial priorities is \nindefensible.\n  Let me say a few words about these two specific measures.\n  I have consistently opposed opening the Arctic National Wildlife \nRefuge, ANWR, to oil drilling because I am unconvinced that the small \namount of recoverable oil there outweighs the permanent damage that we \nwould do to the area and the nearly 200 species of wildlife that live \nthere. The process entails a web of oil platforms, pipelines, \nproduction facilities, power facilities, support structures, and roads \nacross the entire area. I strongly believe we need to ensure our \nNation's economic and energy security, but any recoverable oil in the \nRefuge would not begin flowing for at least 10 years. What is the \nurgency to include this legislation now in a bill it has no business \nbeing part--of especially when the impact of such a measure could be so \nremote and so damaging? There is significantly less job creation than \nproponents would have us believe, there is minimal\n\n[[Page S14244]]\n\nrecoverable oil available, drilling in ANWR would have no impact on \ncurrent energy prices or supply or even on our foreign oil dependence, \nand it would leave a web of infrastructure that would permanently ruin \nthe pristine nature of the land and habitat. Moreover, if we took just \na few modest steps to use energy more efficiently--such as properly \ninflating vehicle tires or raising engines' fuel efficiency--we would \nsave more oil than currently exists in the ANWR. It is simply \nirresponsible to move forward with this legislation.\n  Just as irresponsible is an equally non-germane provision shielding \nvaccine producers from liability. This language provides sweeping legal \nimmunity to a few companies, and relieves them of responsibility for \ntheir reckless and negligent actions. Rather than encouraging companies \nto make safe and effective medicines, it will provide a perverse \nincentive by protecting those companies that make ineffective or \nharmful products. That is unwise--not to mention unfair--to companies \nthat strive for excellence, a number of which are located in \nConnecticut. And rather than encouraging Americans to be vaccinated or \nto take needed medication, it will discourage them from doing so by \nfailing to provide even rudimentary compensation for the few who will \ninevitably be injured by these products. Make no mistake about it: this \nplan fails to protect the American people from the risk of a flu \npandemic or from other biohazards.\n  Senator Kennedy and I spent the past several months negotiating with \nSenators Enzi, Burr, Gregg, Frist, and others on the Health, Education, \nLabor, and Pensions Committee to try to reach a bipartisan compromise \non this issue. Senator Kennedy and I made several proposals, modeled on \npast Congressional action, to protect manufacturers from frivolous \nlawsuits while providing fair and adequate compensation to those who \nare injured. Both sides worked in good faith, and we made significant \nprogress.\n  Unfortunately, my understanding is that a decision was made by \nleaders of the Republican caucus to forego this bipartisan process. \nInstead, this nongermane provision was slipped in the final hours of \nthis session of Congress into the Defense Appropriations Conference \nReport. Furthermore, it is my understanding that this language was \ninserted after members had agreed to the Conference Report with the \nunderstanding that this language was not included. I am disturbed and \ndisappointed by this blatant abuse of power and disregard for \nSenate procedures. I can only assume that the supporters of this \nprovision are using this tactic because they know that their plan would \nnot stand up to public scrutiny and Senate debate.\n\n  In terms of some of the germane provisions of this bill, I must also \nexpress my disappointment with the conferees' decisions to weaken \nimportant measures that were actually inserted in the Senate's defense \nbills to support and protect our troops. For example, I originally \nauthored amendments to both of these bills that would ensure that our \ntroops would be reimbursed for purchasing their own critical safety and \nprotective gear that the Defense Department failed to provide for use \nin Iraq and Afghanistan. The Senate approved this measure without any \ndissent, having recognized the administration's inadequate compliance \nwith current law. After failing to implement a program under a law \nenacted last year, the Pentagon only established the reimbursement \ninitiative as this body considered the new provisions to extend this \nbenefit to all military personnel deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan. \nMost appalling to me is that there remains little evidence that the \nPentagon has acted to ensure that our soldiers, sailors, airmen, and \nmarines receive the information that they need to take advantage of \nthis important program. Given that the Defense Department is failing to \nmeet its commitment to adequately equip our military personnel, the \nleast that it can do is inform our brave men and women of the \ncompensation due to them. In the end, I was deeply troubled that the \nfinal version of this legislation did not include adequate language to \naddress many of the concerns originally raised on this floor just two \nmonths ago. In particular, as part of an agreement worked out with both \nChairmen of the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee and Senate Armed \nServices Committee, we had agreed to extend the reimbursement program \nto troops who made purchases up until the end of the 2006 fiscal year. \nIn both final conference reports, this deadline was cut short to April \n1, 2006.\n  In the final analysis of the underlying bills, I can only take solace \nin the fact that other critically important measures in these \nconference reports could have been weakened even further. We in this \nbody managed to avert grave problems posed by misplaced priorities by \nthe administration and the Republican leadership. For example, it is my \nunderstanding that the administration's allies in the House actually \nattempted to slip another measure--this time, related to campaign \nfinance--into the Defense Authorization Act after the conferees had \nalready signed the conference report--without any hearing or public \nreview by the appropriate committees of jurisdiction. It was only after \nthe chairman and ranking member of the Senate Armed Services Committee \nintervened that this utter abuse of power was averted.\n  In another case, the administration and its allies in Congress sought \nto thwart the final approval of Senator McCain's amendment that would \nset standards for the interrogation of detainees in the custody of the \nUnited States, and prohibit the cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment \nof these detainees. I strongly support Senator McCain's amendment \nbecause it upholds the values on which our country is based, it helps \nstrengthen the rule of law, and most importantly, it serves to protect \nAmerican troops and civilians who are currently serving and living \nabroad.\n  I regret, however, that the Bush administration attempted for so long \nto block adoption of this amendment. Indeed, the administration only \naccepted it in the face of overwhelming congressional support and in \nthe wake of international condemnation resulting from allegations of \nsecret CIA prisons in Europe. While I am certainly pleased that the \nMcCain amendment was included in this conference report, I hope that \nthe administration's stonewalling has not undermined the very things \nthat this amendment aims to protect--American values and American \nlives.\n  In the end, it is our solemn duty as members of this institution to \npromote policies that will safeguard America's critical security \ninterests. That is why I am so deeply offended by the tactics which the \nmajority used to weaken many of these efforts. After all, most of the \ngermane provisions of these two Defense-related conference reports will \nsupport our defense needs and protect U.S. military personnel deployed \nin harm's way. For example, within these germane provisions, I am \nparticularly proud that the bills build on Connecticut's unique \nstrengths in contributing to America's defense needs. From increases in \nBlack Hawk helicopters to production of a new Virginia Class submarine, \nour troops will be better prepared to meet the security challenges of \nthe 21st century.\n  Under these bills, the Army and Navy will receive 83 much needed \nBlack Hawk helicopters to perform a variety of critical missions \nincluding medical evacuations, air assaults, and special operations. In \nthe shipbuilding accounts, in addition to funding the procurement of \nanother Virginia submarine, these bills will ensure that the Navy \nremains committed to developing new undersea technologies--including \ndevelopment of new submarine designs--an important element of our \nnation's pertinent efforts to maintain undersea dominance as countries \nsuch as China and Russia expand their own submarine fleets.\n  To address immediate concerns for our soldiers and marines, these \nbills finally contribute meaningful resources for countering the most \nserious threats facing our troops in Iraq--the so-called improvised \nexplosive devices or IEDs. Devoting $1 billion to the Joint Improvised \nDevice Defeat Task Force will help accelerate American development of \nnew technologies and tactics for detecting, jamming, or de-activating \nthese roadside bombs which continue to plague U.S. combat operations in \nIraq. In addition, I am truly pleased with the conferees' decision to \nadd an additional $610 million to the Administration's otherwise slow \nattempts at reinforcing American ground vehicles\n\n[[Page S14245]]\n\nin Iraq with state-of-the-art body armor and other protective gear. \nThis Congress has few higher priorities than the safety and wellbeing \nof our troops deployed in harm's way. And I believe these measures \ntruly are steps in the right direction.\n  But we must remain dedicated to such critical force protection \nmeasures, particularly as our forces battle insurgents in Iraq and \nAfghanistan. The Republican majority's attempts to ensnare these \ndefense bills with unrelated political schemes gravely threatened our \nability to meet this commitment and amounted to an utter abuse of \npower.\n  The United States is at war. Our troops and the American people \nexpect that our nation's defense policy will be unfettered by special \ninterests and untainted by political gamesmanship. I can only hope \nthat, as we return to Capitol Hill to begin the New Year a few weeks \nfrom today, the leaders of the majority party will resolve to put \nnational interests over narrow interests.\n  Mr. LEAHY. When the Department of Defense authorization bill passed \nthe Senate on November 15, I spoke of my concerns about an amendment \nthat limits the rights of detainees in U.S. custody at Guantanamo Bay, \nCuba, to file habeas corpus petitions in federal court. That amendment \nwas modified in conference to further erode these rights, and then \nidentical text was added to the conference report on Defense \nappropriations to ensure that the language was enacted into law in one \nbill or the other.\n  Debates over the treatment of detainees have dominated our \ndiscussions of both the Defense authorization and appropriations bills. \nSenator McCain waged a battle with the White House and his own party to \nensure that his amendment requiring the humane treatment of detainees \nwas retained in the conference reports. I commend Senator McCain and \nthe members of the Congress who have fought to address these issues. \nDespite calls from many of us over recent years, the legislative branch \nhas not met its obligation of oversight and policymaking in this area. \nI am encouraged that more than 18 months after the revelation of \natrocities at Abu Ghraib, we are finally willing to confront this \nissue.\n  The administration fought this provision for months, with the \nPresident vowing to veto any bill that contained it. But after months \nof threats and backdoor lobbying, the White House finally recognized \nthat it could not win with a policy that granted itself the authority \nto use torture or cruel and inhumane treatment in interrogations.\n  Unfortunately, the positive steps we take today in adopting the \nMcCain amendment are undercut by the modified Graham-Levin amendment in \nthe conference report. As I just noted, I expressed concerns about the \nGraham-Levin text, and voted against it, when it passed the Senate. At \nthat time, it reflected a modest improvement over an earlier version \noffered by Senator Graham. Now, it has come almost full circle, and is \ndeeply troubling.\n  The Graham-Levin amendment as it passed the Senate would deny \nprisoners that the administration claims are unlawful combatants the \nright to challenge their detention in a petition for a writ of habeas \ncorpus. At no time in the history of this Nation have habeas rights \nbeen permanently cut off from a group of prisoners. Even President \nLincoln's suspension of habeas was temporary. The Supreme Court has \nheld numerous times that enemy combatants can challenge their \ndetention. The new version of this text, the text that was added to the \nconference report, goes even further. It prohibits any lawsuit against \nthe United States brought by a Guantanamo detainee for any reason. This \nmeans that while the McCain Amendment requires humane treatment of \ndetainees, the substituted text of the Graham-Levin Amendment provides \nno remedy whatsoever when detainees are mistreated. The result is that \nGuantanamo could become the legal black hole that the administration \nhas long argued it should be. The Supreme Court rejected that argument \nin Rasul v. Bush in 2004.\n  I am also deeply troubled by other provisions added in conference. \nThe conference report allows a combatant status review tribunal, an \nadministrative review board, or a similar tribunal to consider \nstatements obtained as a result of coercive interrogation, so long as \nthe tribunal assesses the ``probative value'' of the statement. With \nthe passage of the McCain amendment, I had hoped that the Congress was \nfinally prepared to acknowledge that statements obtained by coercion \nhave no value.\n  A prime example of how abusive interrogation techniques elicit bad \nintelligence was reported on December 9, 2005, in The New York Times. \nThe article states that the ``administration based a crucial prewar \nassertion about ties between Iraq and al Qaida on detailed statements \nmade by a prisoner while in Egyptian custody who later said he had \nfabricated them to escape harsh treatment.'' Just last week, at a \nspeech in Philadelphia, a member of the audience asked the President \nwhy the administration continually seeks to link the 9/11 attacks with \nthe invasion of Iraq in spite of the fact that Iraq was not involved in \nthe events of 9/11.\n  It is beneath the values of this Nation to allow the use of coerced \nstatements in the trials or review panels conducted on the status of \ndetainees. It is also beneath us to strip detainees of habeas rights. \nFiling a petition for a writ of habeas corpus is often the detainee's \nonly opportunity to openly challenge the basis for his detention. \nProviding detainees this right is not about coddling terrorists. It is \nabout showing the world that we are a nation of laws and that that we \nuphold the principles that we urge other nations to follow. It is about \nhonoring and respecting the values that are part of our heritage as \nAmericans and that have shone as a beacon to the rest of the world. \nAllowing a detainee to file a habeas petition provides legitimacy to \nour detention system and quells speculation that we are holding \ninnocent people in secret prisons without any right to due process.\n  Some members of the Senate have argued that these prisoners should be \ntried in the military justice system. I think that we could all agree \non such a course if the administration had worked with Congress from \nthe start and established with our approval procedures that are fair \nand consistent with our tradition of military justice. The Graham-Levin \namendment does allow the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia \nto review some of the military commission's final decisions. I am in \nfavor of Federal court review, but Congress seems to have missed the \ncritical step of authorizing the administration to use military \ncommissions. I introduced a bill in the 107th Congress to do just that. \nSo did Chairman Specter. If the administration wanted to use military \ncommissions to try detainees, it should have sought and obtained the \nexplicit authorization of Congress. It did not do so. The system that \nhas been established by the administration to try individuals held at \nGuantanamo does not provide due process or independent review. It is \nnot a system that reflects our tradition of justice.\n  Since the Graham-Levin amendment would not retroactively apply to \npending cases, the Supreme Court will still have the opportunity to \ndetermine the legitimacy of the military commissions, as being \nlitigated in case of Hamdan v. Rumsfeld. If the military commission \nprocess is rejected by the Court, I hope that the administration will \nwork with Congress to establish a fair system for trying suspects who \nare captured in the war on terror. Working in this way, we can restore \nthe reputation of our Nation for upholding the rule of law.\n  Everyone in Congress agrees that we must capture and detain terrorist \nsuspects, but it can and should be done in accord with the laws of war \nand in a manner that upholds our commitment to the rule of law. The \nJudiciary Committee held a hearing on detainee issues in June. At that \nhearing, Senator Graham said that once enemy combatant status has been \nconferred upon someone, ``it is almost impossible not to envision that \nsome form of prosecution would follow.'' He continued, ``We can do this \nand be a rule of law nation. We can prove to the world that even among \nthe worst people in the world, the rule of law is not an inconsistent \nconcept.'' I agree with Senator Graham, but I strongly believe that in \norder to uphold our commitment to the rule of law, we must allow \ndetainees the right to challenge their detention in Federal court.\n\n[[Page S14246]]\n\n  As Chairman Specter noted on the floor last month, there are existing \nprocedures under habeas corpus that have been upheld by the Supreme \nCourt that do not invite frivolous claims and that are appropriate. The \nGraham-Levin amendment would not only restrict habeas in a manner never \ndone before in our Nation, but, as the chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee said last week, it would open a Pandora's box.\n  The chairman is right. We must not rush to change a legal right that \npredates our Constitution. Creating one exemption to the Great Writ \nonly invites more. The Judiciary Committee has jurisdiction over habeas \ncorpus, and it should have the first opportunity to review any proposed \nchanges carefully and thoroughly. Although congressional action on the \nissue of foreign detainees is long overdue, we must not act hastily \nwhen the Great Writ--something that protects us all--is at stake.\n  I ask unanimous consent to place in the Record an article entitled, \n``Qaeda-Iraq Link U.S. Cited Is Tied to Coercion Claim,'' from the \nDecember 9, 2005, New York Times.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, Dec. 9, 2005]\n\n          Qaeda-Iraq Link U.S. Cited Is Tied to Coercion Claim\n\n                           (By Douglas Jehl)\n\n       Washington.--The Bush administration based a crucial prewar \n     assertion about ties between Iraq and Al Qaeda on detailed \n     statements made by a prisoner while in Egyptian custody who \n     later said he had fabricated them to escape harsh treatment, \n     according to current and former government officials.\n       The officials said the captive, Ibn al-Shaykh al-Libi, \n     provided his most specific and elaborate accounts about ties \n     between Iraq and Al Qaeda only after he was secretly handed \n     over to Egypt by the United States in January 2002, in a \n     process known as rendition.\n       The new disclosure provides the first public evidence that \n     bad intelligence on Iraq may have resulted partly from the \n     administration's heavy reliance on third countries to carry \n     out interrogations of Qaeda members and others detained as \n     part of American counterterrorism efforts. The Bush \n     administration used Mr. Libi's accounts as the basis for its \n     prewar claims, now discredited, that ties between Iraq and Al \n     Qaeda included training in explosives and chemical weapons.\n       The fact that Mr. Libi recanted after the American invasion \n     of Iraq and that intelligence based on his remarks was \n     withdrawn by the C.I.A. in March 2004 has been public for \n     more than a year. But American officials had not previously \n     acknowledged either that Mr. Libi made the false statements \n     in foreign custody or that Mr. Libi contended that his \n     statements had been coerced.\n       A government official said that some intelligence provided \n     by Mr. Libi about Al Qaeda had been accurate, and that Mr. \n     Libi's claims that he had been treated harshly in Egyptian \n     custody had not been corroborated.\n       A classified Defense Intelligence Agency report issued in \n     February 2002 that expressed skepticism about Mr. Libi's \n     credibility on questions related to Iraq and Al Qaeda was \n     based in part on the knowledge that he was no longer in \n     American custody when he made the detailed statements, and \n     that he might have been subjected to harsh treatment, the \n     officials said. They said the C.I.A.'s decision to withdraw \n     the intelligence based on Mr. Libi's claims had been made \n     because of his later assertions, beginning in January 2004, \n     that he had fabricated them to obtain better treatment from \n     his captors.\n       At the time of his capture in Pakistan in late 2001, Mr. \n     Libi, a Libyan, was the highest-ranking Qaeda leader in \n     American custody. A Nov. 6 report in The New York Times, \n     citing the Defense Intelligence Agency document, said he had \n     made the assertions about ties between Iraq and Al Qaeda \n     involving illicit weapons while in American custody.\n       Mr. Libi was indeed initially held by the United States \n     military in Afghanistan, and was debriefed there by C.I.A. \n     officers, according to the new account provided by the \n     current and former government officials. But despite his high \n     rank, he was transferred to Egypt for further interrogation \n     in January 2002 because the White House had not yet provided \n     detailed authorization for the C.I.A. to hold him.\n       While he made some statements about Iraq and Al Qaeda when \n     in American custody, the officials said, it was not until \n     after he was handed over to Egypt that he made the most \n     specific assertions, which were later used by the Bush \n     administration as the foundation for its claims that Iraq \n     trained Qaeda members to use biological and chemical weapons.\n       Beginning in March 2002, with the capture of al Qaeda \n     operative named Abu Zubaydah, the C.I.A. adopted a practice \n     of maintaining custody itself of the highest-ranking \n     captives, a practice that became the main focus of recent \n     controversy related to detention of suspected terrorists.\n       The agency currently holds between two and three dozen \n     high-ranking terrorist suspects in secret prisons around the \n     world. Reports that the prisons have included locations in \n     Eastern Europe have stirred intense discomfort on the \n     continent and have dogged Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice \n     during her visit there this week.\n       Mr. Libi was returned to American custody in February 2003, \n     when he was transferred to the American detention center in \n     Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, according to the current and former \n     government officials. He withdrew his claims about ties \n     between Iraq and Al Qaeda in January 2004, and his current \n     location is not known. A C.I.A. spokesman refused Thursday to \n     comment on Mr. Libi's case. The current and former government \n     officials who agreed to discuss the case were granted \n     anonymity because most details surrounding Mr. Libi's case \n     remain classified.\n       During his time in Egyptian custody, Mr. Libi was among a \n     group of what American officials have described as about 150 \n     prisoners sent by the United States from one foreign country \n     to another since the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks for the purposes \n     of interrogation. American officials including Ms. Rice have \n     defended the practice, saying it draws on language and \n     cultural expertise of American allies, particularly in the \n     Middle East, and provides an important tool for \n     interrogation. They have said that the United States carries \n     out the renditions only after obtaining explicit assurances \n     from the receiving countries that the prisoners will not be \n     tortured.\n       Nabil Fahmy, the Egyptian ambassador to the United States, \n     said in a telephone interview on Thursday that he had no \n     specific knowledge of Mr. Libi's case. Mr. Fahmy acknowledged \n     that some prisoners had been sent to Egypt by mutual \n     agreement between the United States and Egypt. ``We do \n     interrogations based on our understanding of the culture,'' \n     Mr. Fahmy said. ``We're not in the business of torturing \n     anyone.''\n       In statements before the war, and without mentioning him by \n     name, President Bush, Vice President Dick Cheney, Colin L. \n     Powell, then the secretary of state, and other officials \n     repeatedly cited the information provided by Mr. Libi as \n     ``credible'' evidence that Iraq was training Qaeda members in \n     the use of explosives and illicit weapons. Among the first \n     and most prominent assertions was one by Mr. Bush, who said \n     in a major speech in Cincinnati in October 2002 that ``we've \n     learned that Iraq has trained Al Qaeda members in bomb making \n     and poisons and gases.''\n       The question of why the administration relied so heavily on \n     the statements by Mr. Libi has long been a subject of \n     contention. Senator Carl Levin of Michigan, the top Democrat \n     on the Senate Armed Services Committee, made public last \n     month unclassified passages from the February 2002 document, \n     which said it was probable that Mr. Libi ``was intentionally \n     misleading the debriefers.''\n       The document showed that the Defense Intelligence Agency \n     had identified Mr. Libi as a probable fabricator months \n     before the Bush administration began to use his statements as \n     the foundation for its claims about ties between Iraq and Al \n     Qaeda involving illicit weapons.\n       Mr. Levin has since asked the agency to declassify four \n     other intelligence reports, three of them from February 2002, \n     to see if they also expressed skepticism about Mr. Libi's \n     credibility. On Thursday, a spokesman for Mr. Levin said he \n     could not comment on the circumstances surrounding Mr. Libi's \n     detention because the matter was classified.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Late Sunday night, Republican leadership slipped language \ninto a lengthy appropriations conference report that will immunize drug \ncompanies against reckless misconduct and will impede our ability to \nprotect our citizens from the threatened avian flu pandemic. This \nprovision is a gift to the drug manufacturers and will likely have a \ndevastating effect on our ability to protect our constituents.\n  Under the guise of a threatened pandemic, this legislation goes far \nbeyond the scope of vaccine preparedness and includes language that is \nfar more sweeping than any language previously passed by the House or \nthe Senate. Instead of focusing on protecting American families from \navian flu or ensuring that victims of any untested vaccine will be \ncompensated for their injuries, the provision simply shields drug \ncompanies from any culpability for injuries caused by its actions. The \nscope of this immunity is so expansive that once the Secretary of \nHealth and Human Services has declared a public health emergency even \nfor a future threat, drug companies would not be held accountable for \nany injuries or deaths caused by the drugs they manufacture, including \ndrugs that are not specifically used in a pandemic context. This is \ndisgraceful and will deter Americans from taking vaccines and drugs if \nwe ever experience a health crisis.\n  The only exception to the broad immunity given to drug companies in \nthis proposal is the possibility that a victim could prove that the \ncompany\n\n[[Page S14247]]\n\nacted with ``willful misconduct.'' Knowingly committing health \nviolations would not even suffice to state a claim. Knowing violations \nas well as gross negligence would be immunized from accountability. \nEven if the drug company acted with the intent to harm people, it would \nnevertheless be immune from criminal conduct unless the Attorney \nGeneral or Secretary of Health and Human Services initiates an \nenforcement action against a drug company that is still pending at the \ntime a personal claim is filed. That is unbelievable. I question \nwhether such a role for the Secretary of HHS is even constitutional. \nSince when do we in Congress allow a political appointee of the \nadministration to determine when, and if, someone injured by willful \nmisconduct can be compensated for their injuries? Professor Erwin \nChemerinsky sent a letter yesterday that outlines his concerns \nregarding the constitutionality of the provision and I ask that his \nletter be made part of the Record.\n  Passage of the Defense appropriations bill is of vital importance to \nall of us, but the inclusion of provisions that excuse even gross and \ndeadly negligence on the part of drug companies makes it impossible for \nmany of us to vote for this bill in good conscience. I urge my \ncolleagues to strike the unjustified and extraneous provisions from the \nDefense appropriations bill in order to act quickly on this important \nbill.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                December 20, 2005.\n       Dear Senator: I understand that the Congress is considering \n     legislation that has been denominated as the ``Public \n     Readiness and Emergency Preparedness Act.'' This legislation \n     would give the Secretary of Health and Human Services \n     extraordinary authority to designate a threat or potential \n     threat to health as constituting a public health emergency \n     and authorizing the design, development, and implementation \n     of countermeasures, while providing total immunity for \n     liability to all those involved in its development and \n     administration. In addition to according unfettered \n     discretion to the Secretary to grant complete immunity from \n     liability, the bill also deprives all courts of jurisdiction \n     to review those decisions. Sec. (a)(7). I write to alert the \n     Congress to the serious constitutional issues that the \n     legislation raises.\n       First, the bill is of questionable constitutionality \n     because of its broad, unfettered delegation of legislative \n     power by Congress to the executive branch of government. \n     Under the nondelegation doctrine, Congress may provide \n     another branch of government with authority over a subject \n     matter, but ``cannot delegate any part of its legislative \n     power except under the limitation of a prescribed standard.'' \n     United States v. Chicago, M., St. P. & P.R. Co., 282 U.S. \n     311, 324 (1931). Recently, the Supreme Court endorsed Chief \n     Justice Taft's description of the doctrine: ``the \n     Constitution permits only those delegations where Congress \n     `shall lay down by legislative act an intelligible principle \n     to which the person or body authorized to [act] is directed \n     to conform.' '' Clinton v. City of New York, 524 U.S. 417, \n     484 (1998)(emphasis in original), quoting J.W. Hampton, Jr., \n     & Co. v. United States, 276 U.S. 394, 409 (1928). The breadth \n     of authority granted the Secretary without workable \n     guidelines from Congress appears to be the type of \n     ``delegation running riot'' that grants the Secretary a \n     ``roving commission to inquire into evils and upon discovery \n     correct them'' of the type condemned by Justice Cardozo in \n     A.L.A. Schechter Poultry Corp. v. United States, 295 U.S. \n     495, 553 (1935)(Cardozo, J., concurring).\n       Second, the bill raises important federalism issues because \n     it sets up an odd form of federal preemption of state law. \n     All relevant state laws are preempted. Sec. (a)(8). However, \n     for the extremely narrow instance of willful (knowing) \n     misconduct by someone in the stream of commerce for a \n     countermeasure, the bill establishes that the substantive law \n     is the law of the state where the injury occurred, unless \n     preempted. Sec. (e)(2). The sponsors appear to be trying to \n     have it both ways, which may not be constitutionally \n     possible. The bill anticipates what is called express \n     preemption, because the scope of any permissible lawsuits is \n     changed from a state-based to a federally based cause of \n     action. See Beneficial Nat'l Bank v. Anderson, 539 U.S. 1, 8 \n     (2003).\n       Usually, that type of ``unusually `powerful' '' preemptive \n     statute provides a remedy for any plaintiff's claim to the \n     exclusion of state remedies. Id. at 7 (citation omitted). \n     Here, rather than displace state law in such instances, the \n     bill adopts the different individual laws of the various \n     states, but amends them to include a willful misconduct \n     standard that can only be invoked if the Secretary or \n     Attorney General initiates an enforcement action against \n     those involved in the countermeasure and that action is \n     either pending at the time a claim is filed or concluded \n     with some form of punishment ordered.\n       Such a provision raises two important constitutional \n     concerns. One problem is that this hybrid form of preemption \n     looks less like an attempt to create a federal cause of \n     action than an direct attempt by Congress to amend state law \n     in violation of Erie Railroad Co. v. Tompkins, 304 U.S. 64 \n     (1938) and basic principles of federalism. Although Congress \n     may preempt state law under the Supremacy Clause by creating \n     a different and separate federal rule, see Crosby v. Nat'l \n     Foreign Trade Counc., 530 U.S. 363, 372 (2000), it may not \n     directly alter, amend, or negate the content of state law as \n     state law. That power, the Erie Court declared, ``reserved by \n     the Constitution to the several States.'' 304 U.S. at 80. It \n     becomes clear that the bill attempts to amend state law, \n     rather than preempt it with a federal alternative, when one \n     realizes that States will retain the power to enact new \n     applicable laws or amend existing ones with a federal overlay \n     that such an action may only be commenced in light of a \n     federal enforcement action and can only succeed when willful \n     misconduct exists. The type of back and forth authority \n     between the federal and state governments authorized by the \n     bill fails to constitute a form of constitutionally \n     authorized preemption.\n       The other problem with this provision is that the \n     unfettered and unreviewable discretion accorded the Secretary \n     or Attorney General to prosecute an enforcement action as a \n     prerequisite for any action for willful misconduct violates \n     the constitutional guarantee of access to justice, secured \n     under both the First Amendment's Petition Clause and the \n     Fifth Amendment's Due Process Clause. See Christopher v. \n     Harbury, 536 U.S. 403, 415 n.12 (2002). In fact, the Court \n     has repeatedly recognized that ``the right of access to the \n     courts is an aspect of the First Amendment right to petition \n     the Government for redress of grievances.'' Bill Johnson's \n     Restaurants v. NLRB, 461 U.S. 731, 741 (1983), citing \n     California Motor Transport Co. v. Trucking Unlimited, 404 \n     U.S. 508, 510 (1972). First Amendment rights, the Supreme \n     Court has said in a long line of precedent, cannot be \n     dependent on the ``unbridled discretion'' of government \n     officials or agencies. See, e.g., City of Lakewood v. Plain \n     Dealer Pub. Co., 486 U.S. 750, 757 (1988). At the same time, \n     the Due Process Clause guarantees a claimant an opportunity \n     to be heard ``at a meaningful time and in a meaningful \n     manner.'' Armstrong v. Manzo, 380 U.S. 545, 552 (1965). The \n     obstacles placed before a claimant, including the insuperable \n     one of inaction by the Secretary or Attorney General, raise \n     significant due process issues. The Supreme Court has \n     recognized that official inaction cannot prevent a claimant \n     from being able to go forth with a legitimate lawsuit. See \n     Logan v. Zimmerman Brush Co., 455 U.S. 422 (1982). The \n     proposed bill seems to reverse that constitutional \n     imperative.\n       Third, the complete preclusion of judicial review raises \n     serious constitutional issues. The Act, through Sec. 319F-\n     3(b)(7), expressly abolishes judicial review of the \n     Secretary's actions, ordaining that ``[n]o court of the \n     United States, or of any State, shall have subject matter \n     jurisdiction,'' i.e., the power, ``to review . . . any action \n     of the Secretary regarding'' the declaration of emergencies, \n     as well as the determination of which diseases or threats to \n     health are covered, which individual citizens are protected, \n     which geographic areas are covered, when an emergency begins, \n     how long it lasts, which state laws shall be preempted, and \n     when or if he shall report to Congress .\n       The United States Supreme Court has repeatedly stressed \n     that the preclusion of all judicial review raises ``serious \n     questions'' concerning separation of powers and due process \n     of law. See, e.g., Johnson v. Robison, 415 U.S. 361 (1974); \n     see also, Oestereich v. Selective Service System Local Board \n     No. 14, 393 U.S. 233 (1968); McNary v. Haitian Refugee \n     Center, Inc., 498 U.S. 479 (1991); Reno v. Catholic Social \n     Services, 509 U.S. 43 (1993). Judicial review of government \n     actions has long regarded as ``an important part of our \n     constitutional tradition'' and an indispensable feature of \n     that system, Lehnhausen v. Lake Shore Auto Parts Co., 410 \n     U.S. 356, 365 (1973).\n       The serious constitutional issues raised by this \n     legislation deserve a full airing and counsels against any \n     rush to judgment by the Congress. Whatever the merits of the \n     bill's purposes, they may only be accomplished by \n     consideration that assures its constitutionality.\n                                                Erwin Chemerinsky.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, the conference report on the Defense \nappropriations bill contains $29 billion in disaster relief funding \nrelated to hurricanes Katrina and Rita. As part of that emergency \npackage, $49 million is being made available to the National Park \nService and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to reimburse cleanup \ncosts and facility repair and restoration costs arising from the \nhurricanes. As the ranking member of the Interior and Related Agencies \nSubcommittee, which has jurisdiction over these agencies, I fully \nsupport this appropriation. There are, however, two aspects of the \nfunding provision which concern me.\n  First, the $49 million being provided is less than a quarter of the \n$220 million in damages suffered by our gulf coast parks and refuges. \nBut not funding these expenses does not make them go away. What I fear \nwill end up happening is that every other park and\n\n[[Page S14248]]\n\nevery other refuge in the Nation is going to have its 2006 budget \nreduced as a way of making up the $170 million Congress is not \nproviding. Every park superintendent and every refuge manager in this \nNation is struggling to keep up with fixed costs and working to address \nthe maintenance backlog. Taking more money away from them is simply not \nhelpful.\n  Secondly, I strongly disagree with the instructions that are being \ngiven to the National Park Service and the Fish and Wildlife Service \nwith respect to how these funds are to be spent. The funding in this \nbill is provided through each Agency's construction account. Under \nFederal law, that is the only purpose for which those funds can be \nused. They cannot legally be spent on operational expenses, which are \nfunded through different accounts. However, the Statement of Managers, \nwhich is the report that accompanies the bill and explains in detail \nhow all of the appropriated dollars are to be spent, explicitly says \nthat the money is available for ``un--reimbursed overtime [pay] and \noperational costs.''\n  I think it was a mistake for the administration to forgo asking for \nreimbursement of operational expenses. Both agencies have incurred \nsubstantial costs in that area that must be paid for. But the \nadministration's error should not be compounded by having Congress \nencourage a Federal agency to violate the law. We could have very \neasily divided the funding between the operational accounts and the \nconstruction accounts, which would have allowed the agencies to \nproperly and legally repay some of their operational costs. But that \nidea was soundly rejected by the majority in the House of \nRepresentatives. And so we are left with a situation where we are \nexplicitly encouraging Federal agencies to use appropriated dollars for \npurposes other than what they were intended. That, Mr. President, is \nsimply the wrong thing to do.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, today I joined many of my colleagues in \nopposing cloture on the Defense appropriations bill. Regrettably, I was \nforced to try and slow this bill down because language unrelated to our \nNation's defense was inserted into the bill. In a cynical attempt to \nauthorize drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, language \nthat in the past has been filibustered, was included in the Defense \nbill. Using our men and women in the military as a shield, the ANWR \nbill was put in the Defense bill in a parliamentary game of chicken. \nSupporters of drilling in ANWR believed that if they included this \nlanguage in the Defense bill, opponents of drilling in ANWR would never \nvote to hold up the Defense bill. They were wrong.\n  I do not enjoy opposing a Defense bill while we have troops in harm's \nway, but the principle at stake here was too important. We will be \nsorry if we set the precedent that unpopular provisions can just be \nrolled into the bill that funds our defense. In the long run, letting \nthat cynical strategy proliferate will hurt our country and the \ninstitution of the Senate.\n  So today, when I opposed cloture, it was not a reflection of my \nsupport of our military. I believe in our men and women in uniform and \nbelieve that this bill should have been passed months ago. Instead, I \nopposed cloture because I believe that we should not use the Defense \nbill as a Trojan Horse to slip through legislation that would not be \nable to survive under the normal rules of the Senate.\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, I rise to speak about the bill before us \ntoday.\n  If any of you are wondering why the American people are so frustrated \nwith the legislative process, why they believe that politics always \ntrumps substance and nothing ever gets done in Washington, this is what \nthey are talking about.\n  Every single member of this body wants our military to have the \nfunding and the resources it needs to fight the war in Iraq and the war \non terror. We all agree on that.\n  Yet somehow an otherwise noncontroversial bill gets bogged down \nbecause some have chosen to use it as a political opportunity to slip \nin proposals they couldn't get passed through the normal channels of \ndebate and deliberation. The idea here is to add anything you want to a \nDefense bill, no matter how surprising or controversial, figuring that \nit will pass since no one would dare cast a vote against our troops.\n  They may think this is shrewd politics, but it is terrible policy, \nand it is disrespectful to both our brave men and women in the field \nand the American people back home.\n  Now, I have great respect for the Senator from Alaska, and I also \nrespect his passion towards the ANWR debate, even if I disagree with \nhis position. But I strongly believe that if he and other ANWR \nsupporters wish to convince us of that position, they should do so by \narguing the merits of the proposal itself, not by sneaking it into a \nbill none of us want to vote against. Not only does that go against the \nbest traditions of the United States Senate, it goes against the best \nexpectations of the American people when they sent us here.\n  Aside from critical defense funding for our troops, there are other \nelements of this bill that this country desperately needs to have \npassed. There is funding for gulf coast recovery efforts and resources \nthat will help our Nation prepare for a possible avian flu pandemic. I \nam also pleased that Senator McCain's amendment opposing torture, which \nwas overwhelmingly passed by the Senate, appears in this bill.\n  Unfortunately, all of this critical funding is being jeopardized by \none Senator's desire to ram through a provision that is personally \nimportant to him. That is not the way Congress should be conducting its \nbusiness.\n  There will be a time and a place for debate on this topic as there \nhas been before. But now is not that time. Not with 180,000 troops in \nharm's way who need important resources and supplies; not with families \nfrom the gulf coast who want a place to go home to; not with the danger \nof pandemic influenza threatening our shores. Now is the time to \nrespect the legislative process and pass a bill that does not play \npolitics with our troops, so that we can finally return home to our \nconstituents and let them know that we truly did the people's work.\n  Mr. President, I want to express my strong support for the \nreauthorization of the Department of Defense, DOD, 1207 program. The \n1207 program is designed to ensure that the DOD Federal contracting \nprocess does not support or subsidize discrimination. This program must \nbe extended through September 2009 so that the tremendous progress we \nhave made in leveling some of the playing ground for Federal \ncontracting is not lost.\n  We here in Congress know that there is a long history of keeping out \nthe little guys in government contracting. In the aftermath of \nHurricane Katrina, minority-owned and economically disadvantaged \ncompanies have had a near impossible time trying to secure some of the \nbillions of dollars of gulf coast reconstruction contracts. Meanwhile, \nbig multinational contractors were given no-bid contracts in the weeks \nimmediately following the hurricane. This double standard is \nunfortunately all too common, and it is the duty of Congress to ensure \nthat this discrimination does not continue.\n  Ever since the DOD's 1207 program was first adopted in 1986, racial \nand ethnic discrimination--both overt and subtle--have continued to \nerect significant barriers to minority participation in Federal \ncontracting, but the 1207 program helps to correct the problems of \ndiscrimination without imposing an undue burden on larger businesses. \nWithout programs like the 1207 program, many contractors would simply \nrevert to their old practices, denying contracts to small companies \nowned by minorities or the economically disadvantaged. It is clear that \nthe 1207 program is still needed to monitor and secure the gains made \nand perhaps encourage even greater opportunity for these small \nbusinesses.\n  I am pleased that this bill includes an extension of this important \nprogram. I have a letter from a minority-woman owned business detailing \nsome of her experiences with the Department of Defense, and I ask that \nthis letter also be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                          Elyon International,\n\n                                 Vancouver, WA, December 20, 2005.\n       Dear Senator, My name is Carmen Nazario. I am a Hispanic \n     woman business owner and Veteran, working in the Information \n     Technology industry. I have been in\n\n[[Page S14249]]\n\n     business for more than eight years and our company has \n     successfully completed contracts in the private and public \n     sector. I personally have worked in this industry as a \n     practicing professional for over 30 years. My initial entry \n     into the computer technology profession commenced while \n     serving in the army during the Vietnam-era war. I graduated \n     as an honor student from the Adjutant General School on two \n     different occasions while attending various types of computer \n     training and continued in that career path after leaving the \n     military.\n       I am writing to you because I believe that it is terribly \n     important that you understand that discrimination is still \n     pervasive in the contracting markets across this country. \n     Where I live in Washington State I confront discrimination on \n     a regular basis as I attempt to run my business and earn a \n     living.\n       I understand that Congress is currently reauthorizing the \n     Department of Defense's 1207 program. This program is of \n     special interest to me because I have attempted to get work \n     with the Defense Department over the past several years to no \n     avail. I feel strongly that discrimination and stereotyping \n     are part of the reason that it is difficult for me, and for \n     other minority business owners. to fully participate in our \n     nation's economy.\n       I would like to give you some examples of the types of \n     discrimination I have confronted just in the last few years. \n     For the past eight years I have engaged tirelessly in \n     marketing the services of ELYON International. I have \n     experienced an unfavorable business climate towards a \n     Hispanic woman professional, both in the public and private \n     sector in spite of the fact that I have wonderful references \n     and the clients I have previously supported have been very \n     happy with our services.\n       I have been trying to work with Washington State agencies \n     for over seven years and find it very difficult because \n     Washington State has no minority procurement goals. Although \n     we have been on board with various agencies as pre-qualified \n     vendors by way of the RFP process, I find that the state \n     tends to award contracts to large firms and companies they \n     have been working with for years. As an example, I submitted \n     a well qualified candidate, a minority, who was interviewed \n     as a finalist but not selected and I found out that the work \n     was awarded to another company who had an established track \n     record with the state. (I requested the winning bid.) \n     Washington State's procurement awards to minority companies \n     has drastically decreased to less that 1 percent since \n     implementation of the 1-200 initiative which removed minority \n     procurement goals from State government purchasing. I find \n     this discriminatory in the sense that 99 percent of \n     contracting opportunities are going to non-minority \n     companies. The state is not distributing its wealth to its \n     constituents.\n       This year we submitted a response to a small business set-\n     aside for Tactical Network Services at Fort Lewis, WA. We had \n     Microsoft as a sub-contractor and used some of their past \n     performance as well as ours. Much of the technology for this \n     response involved Microsoft products. When I requested the \n     winning vendor information I found out it was awarded to a \n     newly formed company, service disabled, who had only been in \n     existence for a few months and whose owners had been \n     previously employed by the incumbent and were partnering \n     with BAE who had acquired the incumbent, DigitalNet (a \n     large company).\n       Deployable Data Systems, who won the bid, priced it at \n     $2,468,075 and ours was $2,298.107. Ours was $169,968 lower. \n     I requested a debriefing but was given bogus reasons and I \n     also requested a copy of the winning solicitation response \n     but was denied any further information other than price and \n     name of company that received the award. I find these actions \n     totally discriminatory . . . Ft Lewis decision makers knew \n     all along who they where going to award that contract to.\n       MBEs are being squeezed out of the supply chain for larger \n     deals. Many government contracting opportunities have now \n     been bundled making it only possible for primary suppliers to \n     respond to these larger long-term contract opportunities. In \n     the past I have also proposed to establish a working \n     relationship as a subcontractor to IBM, Anteon, Unisys, Best \n     Consulting, Anderson Consulting (for GSA contract), DMO, \n     Emerald Solutions and many other large established computer \n     technology firms.\n       A scenario where I proposed to establish a working \n     relationship as a subcontractor, involved IBM. In September \n     of 2002 I requested a list of companies planning to bid on \n     ACES RFP 2002-035-9275, a multi-million dollar RFP, that was \n     up for re-compete for a maximum period of 10 years (IBM \n     previously held contract). I contacted Mary Brennan, \n     Washington's State Department of Social & Health Services RFP \n     coordinator. She first did not want to release the names of \n     the companies bidding and I called the DSHS's Office of Equal \n     Opportunity to express my concern that a 10 year RFP was \n     being released and I wanted to have an opportunity to contact \n     vendors bidding and propose subcontracting services as a MWBE \n     IT vendor. Mary Brennan finally released the information and \n     I contacted all of the companies planning to bid on this RFP \n     (there were only three, primarily out of state companies). \n     IBM was the only one potentially interested in working with \n     my company. They released an email request for me to provide \n     information and resumes of candidates with the requirements \n     that they needed to satisfy. After much effort on my part to \n     coordindate available candidates and submit their \n     information, I received an email from Jack Tompkins dated \n     October 21, with the following message:\n       ``Carmen, I wanted to thank for you responsiveness to our \n     requests for a WebSphere Administrator and Data Manager. For \n     now, we have filled the requirements we had for our proposal. \n     I do not have an immediate need for any of your candidates, \n     but was pleased to see some promising resumes. As we fill \n     positions in the future I'll make certain that you are made \n     aware of our openings.\n       ``Thank again,\n       ``Jack A. Tompkins\n       ``IBM Global Services--State of Washington''\n       IBM submitted the proposal to the state, but my company was \n     not included as one of its subcontractors even though I \n     received very positive feedback. Of course the State of \n     Washington had no MBE/WBE requirements in the RFP, nor \n     language encouraging prospective bidders to utilize minority \n     firms. Because of the scope of work involved with this RFP \n     and the number of years (ten)--this procurement probably will \n     hit triple digit multi-million dollar expenditure by the \n     State of Washington, yet there was no opportunity for \n     companies such as mine to participate in the state \n     expenditure. The State of WA ended up awarding this multi-\n     million dollar contract to IBM in 2003 and the winning bid \n     had no minority participation. As of today, we have never \n     been contacted by IBM for any sub-contracting work.\n       This experience as well as several others I had with large \n     Defense/Federal vendors has led me to believe that perhaps it \n     looks good for them on paper to submit information on their \n     MWBE subcontractor utilization (to comply with minority \n     goals) but their intent may not be to really give us \n     subcontract work.\n       I appreciate the opportunity to share my stories with you. \n     I know that many, many business owners in similar situations \n     confront very similar problems. Still, many business owners \n     are afraid to speak out for fear of losing business or other \n     types of retaliation. Sadly, discrimination is not yet a part \n     of the past in the United States. Until it is, it is very \n     important that you continue to support and enforce programs \n     intended to level the playing field for women and minority \n     contractors.\n       Thank you for your time and attention.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Carmen Nazario,\n                                                        President.\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I rise to speak to speak on a free-\nstanding provision in title IV of the pending DOD appropriations bill, \nsubtitle A, the Hurricane Education Recovery Act, which prohibits \ndiscrimination ``on the basis of . . . sex.'' (Section 107(m)(1)(A)). I \nwant to ensure that this provision will be applied in an abortion-\nneutral manner--such as parallel provisions that have long governed all \neducational institutions receiving Federal funds--even though it \ncontains no explicit clarifying language.\n  Over two decades ago, Federal regulators and others misused statutory \nlanguage against ``discrimination on the basis of sex'' to argue that \nprocedures, such as abortion, which apply only to women must be treated \nlike any routine health procedure. To end this misinterpretation, \nabortion-neutral language amending title IX of the Education Amendments \nof 1972 was enacted as part of the Civil Rights Restoration Act in \n1988, 20 U.S.C Sec. 1688. When Congress passed the D.C. School Choice \nIncentive Act of 2003 in January, it incorporated this clarification by \nreference, Sec. 308(b)(3) of Pub. L. 108-199.\n  It is therefore important to be clear that nothing in this bill is \ndesigned to change this legal status quo in any way. At a time when \nschoolchildren in so many States are in desperate need of temporary \nassistance to continue their educations, no one should be seizing upon \nthis emergency legislation as a vehicle for changing current law on \nabortion. Nor should the devastation wrought by Hurricane Katrina and \nother disasters be used to justify filing sex discrimination suits \nagainst private and public schools that do not facilitate abortions for \nminor children in their charge. I am confident that Congress had no \nsuch intent in crafting this bill and that the U.S. Department of \nEducation will not construe the bill's provision on discrimination ``on \nthe basis of sex'' to require any new policy or practice on abortion in \nschools.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, while I wholeheartedly support \nrobust funding for our troops, several measures slipped into the \nDefense appropriations bill were totally extraneous to our military \nmissions. Two such provisions--oil drilling in the Arctic National \nWildlife Refuge and complete liability protection for drug companies \nthat manufacture vaccines--\n\n[[Page S14250]]\n\nwere added to this bill behind closed doors and in the dead of the \nnight.\n  If unrelated and unpopular measures can be slipped into our Nation's \nmilitary spending bill at the last moment, without being included in \neither the House or Senate, open debate on issues and all control over \nspending has been lost. Lawmakers behind this move held funding for our \ntroops hostage to achieve the interests of the oil and drug industries.\n  Largely for this reason, dozens of Senators voted for more debate on \nthe Defense appropriations conference report. We hope these unwanted \nand extraneous provisions will be removed.\n  As I have stated, I voted to oppose closing off debate on the Defense \nappropriations bill for several reasons--including the bill's insertion \nof oil drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and liability \nprotection for drug companies that manufacture vaccines. In addition, \nto my opposition to these specific provisions, I believe the disaster \nrelief provided for in the bill is woefully inadequate for Florida.\n  Florida was hit by four hurricanes again in 2005. Hurricanes Dennis, \nKatrina, Rita and Wilma wreaked havoc in South Florida, the Panhandle \nand even parts of central Florida. These storms caused over $2 billion \nin agricultural losses. That surpasses the losses from the 2004 \nhurricane season.\n  Florida's Agriculture Commissioner, Charles Bronson, said that he has \n``never witnessed such extensive devastation to our state's agriculture \nsectors as that caused by Hurricane Wilma.''\n  Despite this devastation, the disaster relief in the Defense \nappropriations bill fails to provide any financial relief to the \ncitrus, sugar, vegetable, tropical fruit or livestock industry.\n  It is estimated that Florida lost 47 percent of the grapefruit crop \nand 15 percent of the orange crop--for a total loss of $180 million.\n  The vegetable industry took a $311 million hit because the fall and \nwinter vegetable crops were growing when Wilma hit.\n  The sugar industry suffered more than $370 million in losses. One-\nhundred mile per hour winds not only flattened the cane, but also \ncaused significant structural damage to critical infrastructure such as \nstorage bins and the mill.\n  Literally, millions of Floridians are still struggling due to these \nhurricanes; and this bill does little to help them recover.\n  When this bill goes back to the conference committee, I hope this \ndisaster relief package can be reworked to provide relief for all those \nwho suffered damage in this year's hurricanes.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, the fiscal year 2006 Defense Appropriations \nAct is a vitally important piece of legislation. It funds the \noperations of the Department of Defense and, in this particular case, \nthe wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n  It is disgraceful that this bill was delayed until the end of the \nyear by an administration that was more interested in lobbying for the \nright to torture than in meeting the needs of our troops. Now at this \nlate hour, it was further delayed by those who sought to take a bill \nthey knew people would support--funding our troops--and load it up with \nfavors for special interests. With these issues resolved, I am pleased \nthis important legislation has finally passed.\n  The fiscal year 2006 Defense Appropriations Act includes funding for \neverything from boots to beans to bullets--everything our Armed Forces \nneed to keep America safe. This bill funds the national defense program \nat $453.28 billion, including $50 billion in emergency appropriations \nfor on going operations in Iraq and the war on terror.\n  The legislation funds recent and pending increases in Army end \nstrength, provides a 3.1 percent pay raise to all members of the U.S. \nmilitary, and increases housing allowances.\n  It funds the readiness programs that maintain our military's ability \nto conduct operations around the world, whether that means flying hours \nfor pilots, steaming days for Navy crews, spare parts, training, or \nmaintenance.\n  The legislation funds major acquisition programs in every service--\nwhether the C-17, PAC-3 missiles, the Army's Stryker, or the Navy's DD-\nX program. It also funds $72.1 billion in research development test and \nevaluation. That includes future systems--whether air, land, space or \nsea systems--as well as important medical research that will bring our \nsoldiers the most advanced medical treatment on future battlefields. \nThe future American military, its capabilities, and its personnel are \nall funded in this legislation.\n  The $50 billion emergency appropriation included in this legislation \nfunds on going operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, and wherever the war on \nterror takes American forces. That total includes money for combat pay, \ndeath gratuities, and other allowances. It includes $142.8 million for \nbody armor and other personal protection equipment and $1.4 billion for \nthe Joint Improvised Explosive Device Task Force. It funds important \nprograms to replace lost or damaged helicopters and ground vehicles and \nrestocks ordinances used in operations. It also includes $1 billion to \nmeet immediate equipment deficiencies in the National Guard and \nReserves.\n  The Defense appropriations bill is one of the most important pieces \nof legislation the Congress enacts each year. It is always tempting to \nsome to try to attach riders to it that have nothing to do with the \ndefense of our country or the courageous Americans who make up the U.S. \nmilitary. I am pleased that, at long last, the Senate finally moved \nthis vital legislation that is so important to our troops.\n  Mr. President, I know there will be some who criticize this \nlegislation because of the way it was ultimately enacted. I share those \nfrustrations. I wish that we could have passed a clean defense \nappropriations act 3 or 4 months ago to avoid the challenges we have \nseen in the last days. It is regrettable that we did not, but I am \nhappy that this legislation has finally passed so that our troops \nreceive the resources they need to protect this country.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, we are in a period of extended debate \nto resolve the remaining issues related to the Defense appropriations \nbill, so I wanted to take a minute to address the serious avian flu \nissue that is before us. While I am concerned that we will need the \nfull funding request the administration sought, if we approve the avian \nflu proposal, we will at least be advancing some $3 billion. I want to \nstress the importance of global wild bird surveillance systems as part \nof my comprehensive flu plan.\n  I am pleased that the avian flu provisions include authorizing \nlanguage and funds to set up a wild bird surveillance network as well \nas other essential elements of avian flu public health preparedness. If \npassed by Congress and signed by the President, this will assure that \nwe have a comprehensive approach to what may become a real world \nthreat. We do not want to have piecemeal solutions or be simplistically \nreactive when it comes to the public's health.\n  The avian flu provision we have been considering today states that \npart of $150 million is designated to carry out global and domestic \ndisease surveillance, which includes international surveillance to \ntrack influenza strains as a way of focusing limited resources on at-\nrisk populations. The conferees have pointed out specifically the \nimportance of migratory bird tracking in predicting the spread of avian \ninfluenza and encourage the CDC to ensure that this important activity \nis part of its surveillance activities. I am pleased with this language \nthat acknowledges a key part of the preparedness puzzle to which, \nfrankly, few people have given attention--wild bird sentinels and the \nintimate connection between animal and human health. We cannot separate \nthe two.\n  As we all know, the potential for an influenza pandemic is increasing \nas the H5N1 virus has now moved swiftly across Asia, Russia, Turkey, \nand now the EU, killing millions of domestic poultry and over 60 humans \nto date. History and science tell us that wild birds and movements of \npoultry have the potential to spread deadly avian influenza viruses. \nThe 1918 influenza epidemic that killed an estimated 40 million people \nworldwide was an avian-origin viral strain. We must act now to ensure \nthat this does not happen again. We have the tools to track the \nmovement of this virus. We just need to increase and strengthen them.\n  In October, I introduced a bill, S. 1912, to do exactly this. This \nmonth, Representatives DeLauro and Lowey, with the cosponsorship of \nRepresentative Case, introduced an identical bill\n\n[[Page S14251]]\n\nin the House of Representatives, H.R. 4476, to provide funds supporting \nan early warning system and real-time data network for global avian \ninfluenza surveillance. Senator Brownback has also been supportive of \nthese efforts to urge Congress to examine ways to boost our prevention \nand preparedness efforts via an international surveillance network.\n  In fact, the Senate passed appropriations for such an effort in the \nSenate Labor-HHS appropriations bill for fiscal year 2006. This was \nwork from our colleagues Senators Specter and Harkin, who again \nrealized the importance of fighting the threat of avian flu from \nmultiple fronts including funds for vaccines and antivirals but also \nwith the establishment of an international wild bird surveillance \nnetwork.\n  The surveillance network contemplated by the avian flu proposals we \nhave been considering should be designed to be an early warning and \ntracking system to monitor avian viruses and their mutations and \nreassortments, as carried by wild birds. The provision would require \nexpansion the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Influenza \nBranch's wild bird surveillance program, which currently is small. \nSpecifically, it is our intent that the Centers for Disease Control and \nPrevention's Influenza Branch, CDC, with expertise in analyzing \nornithological and animal samples for infectious diseases, and other \nnational partners, such as the US Agency for International Development, \nUSAID, with expertise in working with international partners and \ncoalitions, would partner with one or more nongovernmental \norganizations that meet the following criteria: have extensive global \nwildlife health experience in tracking disease in wild birds, including \nfree-ranging, captive, and wild-bird species using an international and \nextensive field program and network with projects in 50 or more \ncountries to allow for the collection and dissemination of data around \nthe world; have proven ability in identifying avian influenza, \nspecifically H5N1 and other infectious diseases, in wild birds; and \nhave accredited zoological facilities in the United States, with the \ncapacity to analyze, store, and interpret samples and compile data.\n  Such tracking allows us to predict the spread of the virus and then \nto focus limited resources and prepare communities in the flight path \nof wild birds, as the conference report notes. Potential interventions \ninclude providing available antivirals or vaccines to those at-risk, \nenhancing biosecurity at poultry farms, and even keeping people indoors \nshould surveillance information warrant it. By tracking wild birds, as \nthese provisions require, we may even be able to produce an avian flu \nvaccine faster by understanding which variant of avian influenza virus \nis the killer. The current H5N1 virus is potentially not the one that \ncould cause widespread devastation to humans. Again, the conference \nreport recognizes the importance of tracking viral strains and has \nprovided the CDC with funding to do so.\n  Just as we track hurricanes as they begin as a tropical storm, we \nmust track wild birds and the viral storms they carry over oceans and \ncontinents and share that data with the world.\n  At least $10 million of the funds available in this proposal in 2006 \nshould be available to the CDC to work with a national partner such as \nUSAID and one or more eligible NGOs with the expertise and the criteria \npreviously outlined and other supporting international partners to \nestablish a strong global wild bird surveillance system.\n  This proposal would help ensure we have an organized, near real-time, \nvirtual library that would allow U.S. Government agencies, wildlife \nconservation organizations, and public health organizations to track \nboth the spread of avian viruses and their reassortments and mutations, \nwhich are integral to understanding how a virus might change to permit \nhuman to human transfer.\n  Ten million dollars is a small sum in comparison to the tens of \nbillions of dollars required for vaccine research and antiviral \nstockpiling. Vaccines and stockpiling are our current focus and we \nshould be thinking about them--but it is equally important to think \nabout being prepared for outbreaks and preventing a pandemic from ever \nbecoming a reality.\n  As we speak, information is being collected and analyzed all over the \nUnited States and the world. But while we are collecting piles of data, \nit is not being stored in the kind of organized manner needed to make \nit available for easy study and response. The information we have, I \nfear, is scattered like books with no library to contain them and no \nlibrarian to locate them.\n  Again, I would like to thank leaders in the Senate and the House, \nincluding Senators Specter, Harkin, and Brownback, and Representatives \nDeLauro, Lowey, and Case, for their work in preparing our Nation for a \npossible pandemic. We must address the treatment, surveillance, and \nprevention but, also, critically the global wildfowl surveillance; this \naddresses a big gap that is easy to forget about. It is the big bird in \nthe room.\n  Wild birds can spread this virus and could potentially carry it to \nthe United States. I thank and urge my colleagues to continue \nsupporting flu legislation with essential provisions such as this one, \nwhich surveys wild birds with NGOs who have the international networks \nand the capacity to connect all the dots, so when a flu pandemic does \nor does not happen, we are better prepared.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise to speak about the Detainee \nTreatment Act of 2005, which is included in the Defense Appropriations \nconference report.\n  I will submit a similar statement into the Record for the Defense \nauthorization conference report because the Detainee Treatment Act of \n2005 is also included in the Defense authorization bill.\n  The Detainee Treatment Act includes two provisions that were adopted \nin the Senate version of the Defense Authorization bill: the McCain \nAntitorture amendment and the Graham-Levin Detainee amendment.\n  I was an original cosponsor of the McCain Antitorture amendment. I \nhave spoken at length about the vital importance of this amendment on \nseveral other occasions. At this time, I simply want to reiterate a \ncouple of points.\n  Twice in the last year and a half, I have authored amendments to \naffirm our Nation's longstanding position that torture and cruel, \ninhuman, or degrading treatment are illegal. Twice, the Senate \nunanimously approved my amendments. Both times, the amendments were \nkilled behind the closed doors of a conference committee--at the \ninsistence of the Bush administration.\n  I am pleased that the administration has changed its position. As a \nresult, it will now be absolutely clear that under U.S. law all U.S. \npersonnel are prohibited from subjecting any detainee anywhere in the \nworld to torture or cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment.\n  The amendment defines cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment as any \nconduct that would constitute the cruel, unusual, and inhumane \ntreatment or punishment prohibited by the U.S. Constitution if the \nconduct took place in the United States. Under this standard, abusive \ntreatment that would be unconstitutional in American prisons will not \npermissible anywhere in the world.\n  Let me give you some examples of conduct that is clearly prohibited \nby the McCain amendment.\n  ``Waterboarding'' or simulated drowning is a technique that was used \nduring the Spanish Inquisition. It is clearly a form of torture. It \ncreates an overwhelming sense of imminent death. It amounts to a clear-\ncut threat of death akin to a mock execution, which is expressly called \n``mental torture'' in the U.S. Army Field Manual.\n  Sleep deprivation is another classic form of torture which is \nexplicitly called ``mental torture'' in the U.S. Army Field Manual. It \nhas been banned in the United Kingdom and by a unanimous Israeli \nSupreme Court, and the U.S. Supreme Court has repeatedly declared it \nunconstitutional, once citing a report that called it ``the most \neffective form of torture''.\n  The amendment also clearly bans so-called stress positions or \npainful, prolonged forced standing or shackling. Again, the U.S. Army \nField Manual expressly calls these techniques ``physical torture.'' \nMoreover, one of the most recent Supreme Court cases on the extent of \nthe prohibitions on ``cruel and unusual'' punishments expressly\n\n[[Page S14252]]\n\noutlawed the use of painful stress positions, denouncing their \n``obvious cruelty'' as ``antithetical to human dignity.''\n  The amendment bans the use of extreme cold, or hypothermia, as an \ninterrogation tactic. Hypothermia can be deadly. Clearly it is capable \nof causing severe and lasting harm, if not death, and consequently is \nbanned by both the Field Manual and the Constitution.\n  The amendment bans punching, striking, violently shaking or beating \ndetainees. Striking prisoners is a criminal offense and clearly \nunconstitutional. Moreover, while assaults like slapping and violent \nshaking, may not seem as dangerous as beatings, shaking did, in fact, \nkill a prisoner in Israel, and the tactic has been banned by the \nIsraeli Supreme Court. Numerous U.S. Supreme Court cases likewise \nprohibited striking prisoners.\n  The amendment bans the use of dogs in interrogation and the use of \nnakedness and sexual humiliation for the purpose of degrading \nprisoners.\n  No reasonable person, given the text of the amendment, the judicial \nprecedents, and common sense, would consider these techniques to be \npermitted. Any U.S. official or employee who receives legal advice to \nthe contrary should think twice before defying the will of the Congress \non this issue.\n  The McCain antitorture amendment will make the rules for the \ntreatment of detainees clear to our troops and will send a signal to \nthe world about our Nation's commitment to the humane treatment of \ndetainees.\n  I want to express again my opposition to the Graham-Levin amendment.\n  The amendment would essentially eliminate habeas corpus for detainees \nat Guantanamo Bay. In so doing, it would apparently overturn the \nSupreme Court's landmark decision in Rasul v. Bush.\n  No one questions the fact that the United States has the power to \nhold battlefield combatants for the duration of an armed conflict. That \nis a fundamental premise of the law of war.\n  However, over the objections of then-Secretary of State Colin Powell \nand military lawyers, the Bush administration has created a new \ndetention policy that goes far beyond the traditional law of war. The \nadministration claims the right to seize anyone, including an American \ncitizen, anywhere in the world, including in the United States, and to \nhold him until the end of the war on terrorism, whenever that may be. \nThey claim that a person detained in the war on terrorism has no legal \nrights. That means no right to a lawyer, no right to see the evidence \nagainst him, and no right to challenge his detention. In fact, the \nGovernment has argued in court that detainees would have no right to \nchallenge their detentions even if they claimed they were being \ntortured or summarily executed.\n\n  U.S. military lawyers have called this detention system ``a legal \nblack hole.''\n  Defense Secretary Rumsfeld has described the detainees as ``the \nhardest of the hard core'' and ``among the most dangerous, best \ntrained, vicious killers on the face of the Earth.'' However, the \nadministration now acknowledges that innocent people are held at \nGuantanamo Bay. In late 2003, the Pentagon reportedly determined that \n15 Chinese Muslims held at Guantanamo are not enemy combatants and were \nmistakenly detained. Almost 2 years later, those individuals remain in \nGuantanamo Bay.\n  Last year, in the Rasul decision, the Supreme Court rejected the \nadministration's detention policy. The Court held that detainees at \nGuantanamo have the right to habeas corpus to challenge their \ndetentions in Federal court. The Court held that the detainees' claims \nthat they were detained for years without charge and without access to \ncounsel ``unquestionably describe custody in violation of the \nConstitution, or laws or treaties of the United States.''\n  The Graham amendment would protect the Bush administration's \ndetention system from legal challenge. It would effectively overturn \nthe Supreme Court's decision. It would prevent innocent detainees, like \nthe Chinese Muslims, from challenging their detention.\n  However, I do want to note some limitations on the scope of the \nGraham-Levin amendment.\n  A critical feature of this legislation is that it is forward looking. \nA law purporting to require a Federal court to give up its jurisdiction \nover a case that is submitted and awaiting decision would raise grave \nconstitutional questions. The amendment's jurisdiction-stripping \nprovisions clearly do not apply to pending cases, including the Hamdan \nv. Rumsfeld case, which is currently pending before the Supreme Court. \nIn accordance with our traditions, this amendment does not apply \nretroactively to revoke the jurisdiction of the courts to consider \npending claims invoking the Great Writ of Habeas Corpus challenging \npast enemy combatant determinations reached without the safeguards this \namendment requires for future determinations. The amendment alters the \noriginal language introduced by Senator Graham so that those pending \ncases are not affected by this provision.\n  The amendment also does not legislate an exhaustion requirement for \nthose who have already filed military commission challenges. As such, \nnothing in the legislation alters or impacts the jurisdiction or merits \nof the Hamdan case.\n  Nothing in the legislation affirmatively authorizes, or even \nrecognizes, the legal status of the military commissions at issue in \nHamdan. That is the precise question that the Supreme Court will decide \nin the next months. Right now, the military commissions are legal under \na decision of the DC Circuit, and this amendment reflects, but in no \nway endorses that present status. It would be a grave mistake for our \nallies around the world to think that we are endorsing this system at \nGuantanamo Bay--a system that has produced not a single conviction in \nthe 4 years since the horrible attacks of September 11, 2001.\n  This provision attempts to address problems that have occurred in the \ndeterminations of the status of people detained by the military at \nGuantanamo Bay and elsewhere. It recognizes that the Combatant Status \nReview Tribunal, CSRT, procedures applied in the past were inadequate \nand must be changed going forward. As the former chief judge of the \nU.S. Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court found, in In Re Guantanamo \nDetainee Cases, the past CSRT procedures ``deprive[d] the detainees of \nsufficient notice of the factual bases for their detention and den[ied] \nthem a fair opportunity to challenge their incarceration,'' and allowed \n``reliance on statements possibly obtained through torture or other \ncoercion.'' Her review ``call[ed] into serious question the nature and \nthoroughness'' of the past CSRT process. The former CSRT procedures \nwere not issued by the Secretary of Defense, were not reported to or \napproved by Congress, did not provide for final determinations by a \ncivilian official answerable to Congress, did not provide for the \nconsideration of new evidence, and did not address the use of \nstatements possibly obtained through coercion.\n  To address these problems, this provision requires the Secretary of \nDefense to issue new CSRT procedures and report those procedures to the \nappropriate committees of Congress; it requires that going forward the \ndeterminations be made by a Designated Civilian Official who is \nanswerable to Congress; it provides for the periodic review of new \nevidence; it provides for future CSRTs to assess whether statements \nwere derived from coercion and their probative value; and it provides \nfor review in the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals for these future CSRT \ndeterminations.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, the annual Defense Appropriations bill \nis rightly considered a priority most years, and Congress typically \ncompletes its work on this important bill early in the year. This year, \nhowever, progress on this bill was suspended largely because of \nRepublican political maneuvering. I supported the Senate version of \nthis bill, but a very different bill emerged from conference. That \nconference report was hijacked by the Republican leadership in a \ncynical effort to try to pass controversial provisions that have \nnothing to do with our defense. By jeopardizing funding for our brave \nmen and women in uniform, and attempting to circumvent the rules that \ngovern the Senate, those leaders placed their own narrow interests \nabove those of the country and this institution.\n  The most blatant abuse was the insertion into the conference report \nof a\n\n[[Page S14253]]\n\nprovision that appeared in neither bill to open the Arctic National \nWildlife Refuge to drilling. I have already addressed the Senate twice \nthis week on why that provision had no place in this conference report \nand I am pleased that my colleagues have joined me in sending a clear \nmessage that we will not tolerate attempts to hold vital funding \nhostage to unrelated special interest provisions.\n  While we were successful in removing the Arctic provisions, I remain \nvery troubled about provisions included in the emergency funds slated \nfor pandemic influenza preparedness. While I have long advocated for \npandemic influenza preparedness funding, and while I am pleased that \n$3.8 billion is provided for this purpose, I am deeply concerned about \nthe inclusion of far-reaching liability protections for health care \nproviders and vaccine manufacturers in this conference report. It is an \nabuse of the appropriations process to incorporate such sweeping legal \nprotections into a measure providing funds for the military.\n  The provisions inserted in the conference report would exempt vaccine \nproducers from civil liability for injuries caused by vaccines, unless \nthe health care provider or vaccine manufacturer acted with willful \nmisconduct. This language is extremely far-reaching. Plaintiffs would \nneed to prove that the health care providers or vaccine manufacturers \nacted intentionally, acted without justification, and disregarded known \nor obvious risks that the harm would outweigh the benefit. This will be \nextremely difficult for plaintiffs to establish. Furthermore, \ndisregarding the advice of public health experts, the language fails to \nprovide meaningful injury compensation provisions to help those injured \nby vaccines. These protections for health care providers and vaccine \nmanufacturers are unparalleled, and it is painfully clear that our \nleadership in Congress and in the White House is not listening to the \nconcerns of first responders, families, or public and global health \nexperts. They are listening only to the businesses and industries that \nwould use the threat of pandemic influenza as an opportunity to help \ntheir own profit margins.\n  Mr. President, I also object to the inclusion of certain provisions \nof the Hurricane Education Recovery Act in the Department of Defense \nAppropriations bill. More than 370,000 elementary and secondary \nstudents have been displaced as a result of Hurricane Katrina. Schools \nacross the country, including some in Wisconsin, have opened their \ndoors to these students. I strongly support efforts to assist the \nschools that are welcoming these students as they continue to work to \nmake this transition and school year go as smoothly as possible.\n  But I am troubled by key provisions of the legislation. For example, \nSection 107 of the Act would allocate Federal funding to go directly \nthrough State agencies to local school districts where displaced \nstudents have enrolled in public or private schools. The local school \ndistricts, which are government agencies, would then be responsible for \nissuing direct payments to public and private schools educating \ndisplaced students. Earlier this year, the Senate soundly defeated a \nproposal to provide vouchers directly to parents with little in the way \nof civil rights protections. The Senate subsequently passed a measure \nthat, like the measure now before this body, would have passed taxpayer \nmoney to private schools through local public school districts. I had \ngrave concerns about that provision, and I am even more troubled that \nthe provisions before us do not include even the modest attempts at \ncivil rights and other protections that were included in the Senate \npassed language. While I believe the supporters of this act are well-\nintentioned, I am concerned that Senate passage of this measure would \ncreate a troubling precedent with regard to taxpayer-funded school \nvouchers.\n  I oppose school vouchers because such programs funnel taxpayer money \naway from the public schools that this funding is intended to support \nand instead direct this funding to private schools that do not have to \nadhere to the same Federal, State, and local accountability and civil \nrights laws and regulations that apply to public schools. I strongly \nsupport providing assistance to the students and schools that have been \naffected by Hurricane Katrina, but we should do so within existing \nFederal laws that allow local public school districts to provide \nspecific educational services--rather than direct funding--to private \nschools.\n  Mr. President, I also object to the across-the-board cut to \ndiscretionary programs, including education programs, that was inserted \nin this conference report. The Labor-HHS-Education appropriations bill \nalready cuts or allows for only nominal increases in funding for \neducation. This across-the-board cut would magnify the damage done by \nthat appropriations bill, which awaits final action. If both \nthe across-the-board cut and the Labor-HHS-Ed appropriations bill are \nadopted, total Federal education funding would be cut for the first \ntime in a decade, Funding would be cut for No Child Left Behind, at a \ntime that we are still requiring States to comply with testing all \nstudents in reading and math in grades 3-8 for the first time this \nschool year. Title I funding would be cut for the first time in 13 \nyears, hurting children that are currently eligible to receive Title I \nservices. The Federal share of special education costs would be cut for \nthe first time in a decade forcing States and local school districts to \npick up the slack. And I regret that the maximum Pell Grant award would \nbe frozen for the fourth year in a row at $4,050.\n\n  Mr. President, reducing funding for our nation's schools is not the \nmessage we should be sending to our youth. We need to find ways to \nprovide an excellent K-12 education for all of America's children and \nfind ways to make college more affordable for young people now and in \nthe future. Cutting funding for these various programs is not the \nanswer and this across-the-board cut is particularly regrettable. I \nstrongly support reducing our budget deficit and have long promoted \nmeasures, such as PAYGO, that would help us toward that goal. But \ncutting funding for those most in need is not the solution.\n  I am pleased that the conference report sends such a strong message \nto the administration about the treatment of detainees by adopting the \namendment of the senior Senator from Arizona. The lack of a clear \npolicy regarding the treatment of detainees has been confusing and \ncounter-productive. It has left our men and women in uniform in the \nlurch with no clear direction about what is and is not permissible. \nThis failure on the part of the administration has sullied our \nreputation as a Nation, and hurt our efforts to promote democracy and \nhuman rights in the Arab and Muslim worlds. I have been proud to \nsupport Senator McCain's amendment on interrogation policy because it \nshould help to bring back some accountability to the process and \nrestore our great Nation's reputation as the world's leading advocate \nfor human rights.\n  I am disappointed with the mixed messages that the Senate continues \nto send to the administration and the country on issues related to the \ndetainees held at Guantanamo Bay. In addition to the important McCain \namendment on torture, the conference report also includes the Graham \namendment, which remains deeply troubling because of the restrictions \nit places on judicial review of detainees held at Guantanamo. However, \nit is important to note that the provision is limited in critical ways. \nThe provision on judicial review of military commissions covers only \n``final decisions'' of military commissions, and only governs \nchallenges brought under that provision. In addition, the language in \nSection 1405(e)(2) that prohibits ``any other action against the United \nStates'' applies only to suits brought relating to an ``aspect of \ndetention by the Department of Defense.'' Therefore, it is my \nunderstanding that this provision would not affect the ongoing \nlitigation in Hamdan v. Rumsfeld before the Supreme Court because that \ncase involves a challenge to trial by military commission, not to an \naspect of a detention, and of course was not brought under this \nprovision. Furthermore, it is important to make clear that this \nprovision should not be read to endorse the current system of trial by \nmilitary commission for those at Guantanamo Bay. This provision \nreflects, but certainly does not endorse, the existing status of those \nmilitary commissions, which is that they are currently legal under a \ndecision of the D.C. Circuit.\n\n[[Page S14254]]\n\nHowever, the Supreme Court has not yet addressed the legality of such \nmilitary commissions, and this amendment should not be read as any \nindication that Congress is weighing in on that issue. While I would \nhave strongly preferred that this amendment not be included in the \nconference report, I think it is important to note these limitations on \nits practical effect.\n  In closing, Mr. President, I am pleased that I was able to vote for a \nbill to provide our brave men and women in uniform with the funding \nthey need. But I am disappointed with the long and winding road that it \ntook to get to this point. I hope that Republican leaders are on notice \nthat the Senate will not turn a blind eye when they break the rules and \nput their own narrow interests above those of the country and the \ntroops.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the cloture vote on \nthe conference report on H.R. 1815 is vitiated.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I am proud to bring the Conference Report \non the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2006 before \nthe Senate for final passage. This has been a long and difficult \nconference, but we have achieved our goal of providing the necessary \nauthorities and resources for our men and women in uniform to defend \nthe freedom of America.\n  I thank my colleague and partner for these 27 years we have served \ntogether in the Senate, the senior Senator from Michigan, Carl Levin, \nfor his consistently constructive help and leadership in bringing this \nimportant legislation to the floor.\n  An undertaking of this magnitude is ultimately a bipartisan, \nbicameral effort. Consequently, there are many people deserving of \nrecognition. I want to thank all of our subcommittee chairs and ranking \nmembers for their tireless efforts. I also want to thank Chairman \nDuncan Hunter and Congressman Ike Skelton for their leadership and \nteamwork in producing this conference agreement.\n  This conference agreement could not have been reached without our \ndedicated, professional staff. I especially want to recognize the \nunwavering leadership of the Committee Staff Director, Charlie Abell \nand the Democratic Staff Director, Rick DeBobes, together with their \nstaff, in bringing this process to a successful conclusion.\n  As we consider this legislation, we remain a nation at war. This year \nmarks the fourth year in the global war on terrorism. On September 11, \n2001, our Nation awakened to a terrorist attack. From this dark hour, \nour Nation quickly emerged stronger and more united because our Armed \nForces, like the generations that preceded them, responded to the call \nof duty in Operation Enduring Freedom, Operation Iraqi Freedom, and \nelsewhere around the world in the cause of freedom.\n  Hundreds of thousands of soldiers, sailors, airmen, marines, active \nand Reserve components, and countless civilians continue to serve \nvaliantly around the world--from Iraq and Afghanistan to the Persian \nGulf, Europe, Africa, and Korea--to secure peace and freedom. All \nAmericans are proud of what our military has accomplished. Their \nsacrifices and service have removed obstacles to freedom and democracy \nin the regions of the Middle East and Asia.\n  We remain mindful that the defense of our homeland begins on distant \nbattlefields. To the extent that we can prevent or contain the threats \non these battlefields or potential battlefields, the less likely that \nwe will experience a threat here at home. The threats to our Nation and \nthe ongoing war on terrorism demand increased investment in our \nnational security.\n  As we begin this debate, I remain mindful that no military victory is \ngained without significant sacrifice. I ask that we pause to remember \nthose who died in the defense of our freedom, and the many others who \nwere wounded. We honor their sacrifices and service. On behalf of a \ngrateful Nation, we salute you. They and their families deserve our \ngratitude and unwavering support.\n  This year, the House and Senate conferees confronted especially \ndifficult challenges affecting our Nation's security. These issues \nincluded U.S. policy on Iraq, detainee policy, and the Navy \nshipbuilding budget. With respect to these issues, I believe that the \nconferees reached a balanced agreement.\n  Overall, the conferees authorized funding of $441.5 billion in budget \nauthority for defense programs in fiscal year 2006, an increase of \n$20.9 billion--or 3.1 percent in real terms--above the amount \nauthorized by the Congress for fiscal year 2005.\n  The conference report underscores some key defense priorities \ncritical to our national security, including authorities and resources \nto win the global war on terrorism and support for the men and women of \nthe Armed Forces who are fighting so bravely in the global war on \nterrorism. Specifically, the conferees added $586.4 million over the \nPresident's budget request for combating terrorism. The conferees also \nauthorized $50.0 billion in emergency supplemental funding for fiscal \nyear 2006 for activities in support of operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, \nand the global war on terrorism.\n  The conferees further agreed to enhance congressional oversight of \nongoing military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, and the global war on \nterrorism, including uniform standards for interrogation operations, \nwhile removing the burden of litigation from vital intelligence \nactivities. The conference report also includes a 3.1 percent pay raise \nfor all military personnel.\n  In addition, the conference report contains some provisions of which \nI am very proud that emphasizes our commitment to homeland defense, \nforce protection, recruiting and retention of military personnel, \nquality of life programs, and modernization and transformation efforts.\n  To enhance the ability of the Department of Defense to fulfill its \nhomeland defense responsibilities, the conferees agreed to: authorize \n$115.2 million for homeland defense and counterterrorism, including \n$19.8 million for specially trained and equipped teams to support civil \nor military authorities in the event of a chemical, biological, \nradiological, nuclear or high-explosive\n\n[[Page S14255]]\n\nattack or event; and enhance the Department's working relationship with \nthe Department of Homeland Security for purposes of leveraging dual-use \nassets in conducting homeland defense and homeland security missions.\n  To rapidly deploy and acquire the full range of force protection \ncapabilities for deployed forces, the conferees agreed to authorize an \nadditional $610.0 million for up-armored high mobility multipurpose \nwheeled vehicles and wheeled vehicle add-on ballistic protection to \nprovide force protection for soldiers in Iraq and Afghanistan; \ndesignate an executive agent for a joint research and treatment effort \nto treat combat blast injuries resulting from IEDs, rocket propelled \ngrenades, and other attacks; and facilitate the rapid deployment of new \ntechnology and tactics and the rapid deployment of equipment to counter \nthe threat of improvised explosive devices.\n  To improve recruiting goals and retention of military personnel, the \nconferees agreed to create new and better incentives to meet the \nchallenge of recruiting for the All Volunteer Force; and ensure the \nretention of experienced personnel in the active-duty ranks, in the \nReserve, and in the National Guard.\n  To continue its commitment to quality health care for all \nbeneficiaries, the conferees agreed to enhance access to health care \ncoverage under TRICARE for every member of the Selected Reserve and \ntheir families, with Government subsidies based on new categories of \neligibility.\n  To continue necessary modernization and transformation efforts, the \nconferees agreed to authorize an increase of $159.5 million for Navy \nShipbuilding to accelerate the CVN-78 aircraft carrier, the LHA (R) \namphibious ship, and the second DD(X) destroyer of the class. Much more \nmust be done, however, to achieve stability in the Navy's shipbuilding \nbudget and to protect this fragile sector of our industrial base.\n  I have a list of some of the highlights of this conference report \nthat I ask unanimous consent to be printed in the Record following my \nremarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. WARNER. Each year since 1961, the House and Senate have reached a \nconference agreement on, and the President has signed into law, a \nNational Defense Authorization Act. I now call upon my colleagues in \nthis chamber to fulfill our responsibility and pass the annual Defense \nauthorization bill, as has been the tradition of the Senate for each of \nthe past 45 years. This is the 27th year that I have had the privilege \nof working on this important legislation.\n  I believe this conference report is a strong bipartisan bill that \nserves the interests of the men and women of our Armed Forces and of \nour Nation today. We must send a strong message of support to the men \nand women in uniform serving on the distant outposts throughout the \nworld. I can think of no better way to honor their sacrifices and \nservice, and that of their families than with the passage of the \nNational Defense Authorization bill. This conference report provides \nthe authorities and resources to win the global war on terrorism, while \nsafeguarding Americans at home. It sustains the current readiness of \nthe Armed Forces and provides the resources to prepare them for the \nfuture.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n  Appendix A: Key Military Personnel Provisions--Conference Agreement \n                         NDAA 2006 (H.R. 1815)\n\n       Active End Strength:\n       Increases Army end strength by 10,000 to 512,400.\n       Increases USMC end strength by 1,000 to 179,000.\n       Pay Raise: Provides 3.1 percent pay raise.

Reserve members would be eligible for \n     the income replacement payment for any full month following \n     the date that the member completes 18 continuous months of \n     service on active duty or 24 months on active duty during \n     the previous 60 months, or for any month during a \n     mobilization that occurs within 6 months of the member's \n     last active duty tour.

Makes additional retroactive death gratuity payments of \n     $150,000 to survivors of all military deaths, not just \n     combat-related deaths, to compensate for the increase in \n     Servicemembers' Group Life Insurance coverage from $250,000 \n     to $400,000 that became effective for all military members on \n     May 11, 2005.\n       Survivors in Family Housing--Extends the period that \n     survivors of members who die on active duty may remain in \n     family housing or received basic allowance for housing from \n     180 days to 365 days.\n       Survivors home of selection move--Extends the period of \n     time allowed for surviving family members of members who die \n     on active duty to select a permanent residence from one year \n     to three years.\n       Wounded Member Benefits:\n       Special pay during medical rehabilitation--Authorizes the \n     secretary concerned to pay $430 per month to a service member \n     with an injury or illness sustained in a combat operation or \n     zone designated by the Secretary of Defense.

I thank our respective leaders, the majority leader and \nthe distinguished Senator from Nevada, and my good friend and partner, \nour dear Senator Levin, and all members of the Armed Services \nCommittee, and particularly our staff that made this bill possible.

The Senate will proceed to the consideration \nof the conference report.\n  (The conference report is printed in the House proceedings of the \nRecord of December 18, 2005.)\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, will the Chair advise the Senate with \nregard to any time allocation for remarks in connection with the \npending matter?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There was not a time allocation.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I congratulate Senator Warner. Without his \nleadership we would not be here. We had a record number of amendments \nwhich we had to deal with in a record short period of time. He showed \nincredible tenacity and patience and wisdom, as he always does in \nbipartisanship. I commend him and particularly our staffs.\n  Mr. President, I thank our leadership as well for their staying with \nus on this one. There was a time earlier this year when we didn't think \nwe were going to get an authorization bill, and except for the efforts \nof our leaders we would not be here either. I want to particularly \nthank them.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my good friend and \ncolleague, Senator Warner, the Chairman of the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee, in urging the adoption of the conference report on H.R. \n1815, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2006. \nGetting this conference report to the Senate required the labors of \nHercules, the patience of Job and the magic of Merlin. We would not \nhave been able to complete conference on this important bill--made so \nvery urgent by the fact that we are nation at war--without the tireless \nefforts of Senator Warner.\n  First, a word on the extraordinary events of the last few days.\n  On the Senate side, every one of our conferees--including all 11 \nDemocrats on the Armed Services Committee--signed the conference \nreport. Each of these Senators signed on the basis of the text of the \nconference report that was agreed to between the Senate and House \nconferees.\n  As is our usual practice, we delivered our Senate signature sheets to \nthe House on Friday afternoon, with the understanding that the \nconference report would be filed first in the House and acted upon \nfirst by that body. The Senate stood ready to take up the conference \nreport as soon as it came over from the House and to pass it after 1 \nhour of debate.\n  Unfortunately, the conference report was not filed on either Friday \nor Saturday, because the House Republican leadership was considering \nadding an extraneous bill to the conference report. This bill was not a \npart of our conference, is not in the jurisdiction of our committee, \nand was never considered by any of the conferees. The bill was not a \npart of the conference report that was agreed to by our conferees on \neither side of the aisle.\n  Senator Warner and I strongly objected to a procedure so totally \ndestructive of bedrock legislative process. When we learned that such \nan attempt might be made, we joined together and retrieved the Senate \nsignature sheets from the House. Only after we were assured on Sunday \nafternoon that the conference report would be voted on in the House of \nRepresentatives as agreed, with no effort to insert additional \nmaterial, did we return the Senate signature sheets to the House.\n  I will ask unanimous consent that a copy of the cover letter that we \nsent to the House be inserted in the Record. I would also make \nreference to Senator Warner's remarks in the Record on this subject \nlast Friday, and my remarks last Saturday.\n  Even before the events of the last weekend, the Armed Services \nCommittee faced obstacles and hurdles in completing this bill that we \nhave never faced before. For example:\n  It took us over 2 months from the time we reported the bill to the \nSenate on May 15 to the time debate initially began on July 20.\n  Then, after only 5 days of debate, our bill was pulled down by the \nmajority leader on July 26 when the Senate failed to invoke cloture on \nthe bill. We had to wait over 3 months and negotiate a very complicated \nunanimous consent agreement which limited the number of amendments \nbefore we were able to resume debate on the bill on November 4.\n  We debated the bill for an additional 7 days and finally passed it by \na unanimous 98 to 0 vote on November 15, but not before disposing of a \ntotal of 261 amendments--more amendments ever considered to any Defense \nauthorization bill since Congress passed the first annual Defense \nauthorization bill back in 1961.\n  As far as completing conference this session, there were a lot of \npeople who doubted it could be done because of the sheer size and \ncomplexity of this legislation, leaving aside some of its very \ncontentious issues. Over the past 10 years, we have averaged a total of \n70 days in conference with the House on this massive bill. Last year \nalone, we were in conference with the House for a total of 85 days. We \ncompleted this conference in under 1 month--29 days, to be exact. We \ncompromised on a lot of issues, but we didn't compromise the quality of \nthis legislation just for the sake of getting it done quickly. In \nshort, we did it right and we are very proud of that. This year, we \nhave produced a true holiday gift for our troops and our Nation.\n\n  This conference report contains provisions that provide well-deserved \nsupport for our military personnel and their families. In particular, \nthe conference report will:\n  Increase basic pay by 3.1 percent, a half percent higher than \ninflation;\n  Increase the death gratuity for all active duty deaths from $12,400 \nto $100,000, retroactive to the beginning of Operation Enduring \nFreedom;\n  Authorize a new special pay of $430 a month during hospitalization \nfor service members while rehabilitating from an injury or disease \nincurred in a combat zone;\n  Authorize a new leave of up to 21 days when adopting a child;\n  Provide $30 million in impact aid to local school districts, \nincluding a new $10 million authorization for schools that have a large \nincrease or decrease in students due to rebasing, activation of new \nmilitary units, or base realignment and closure;\n  Increase funding for military child-care services by $50 million, and \nfor family assistance services by $10 million; and\n  Create a mental health task force to help military members and \nfamilies deal with an increasing number of mental health issues.\n  The bill also contains several provisions especially designed to \nbenefit our\n\n[[Page S14257]]\n\nNational Guard and Reserve personnel and their families:\n  Every member of the Selected Reserve will have access to government-\nsubsidized health care under the military TRICARE Standard medical \nprogram for themselves and their families.\n  Tier 1 is the TRICARE Reserve Select program that we authorized last \nyear. National Guard and Reserve personnel who are mobilized can use \nthis benefit for a year for each period of mobilized service, as long \nas they remain in the Selected Reserve. The Government pays 72 percent \nof their health care premium--they pay only 28 percent.\n  Tier II includes members of the Selected Reserve who do not have \naccess to health insurance through their civilian employment. The \nGovernment pays 50 percent of their premium; and\n  Tier III includes members of the Selected Reserve who have access to \nhealth insurance through their employer but choose TRICARE. The \nGovernment pays 15 percent of their premium, they pay the remaining 85 \npercent.\n  National Guard and Reserve members who suffer an income loss when \nmobilized will be paid an income replacement payment after 18 months of \nactive duty, upon completion of 24 months of active duty in a 5-year \nperiod, or when mobilized within 180 days of an earlier mobilization.\n  Reservists who are ordered to active duty for more than 30 days will \nreceive a full housing allowance rather than the current 140 days.\n  In the bill we authorize the following end strengths for our active-\nduty forces: Army--512,400, an increase of 10,000 soldiers from last \nyear's authorized end strength; Navy--352,700, 13,200 less than last \nyear, in accordance with the Department's request; Marine Corps--\n179,000, an increase of 1,000 Marines; and Air Force--357,400, 2,300 \nless than last year's authorization, again in accordance with the \nDepartment's request.\n  We are very concerned about the Army's ability to recruit enough \nenlistees to make the end strength that we authorized. This bill gives \nthe Army new tools to help it meet its recruiting goals:\n  A new bonus of up to $1000 for soldiers who refer a successful \nrecruit to the Army;\n  New authority to experiment with innovative recruiting incentives;\n  Authorization for matching contributions to the Thrift Savings Plan \nduring a service member's initial enlistment; and\n  An increased maximum enlistment bonus of up to $40,000.\n  This bill does not include everything that I fought for. For example, \nI am very disappointed that we were not able to eliminate the \nrequirement that survivor benefit plan annuity payments be reduced by \nthe amount of dependency and idemnity compensation received from the \nVeterans' Administration. I am also disappointed that we were not able \nto immediately repeal the 10-year phase-in of the concurrent receipt of \nmilitary retired pay and VA disability compensation for military \nretirees with less than a 100 percent disability who are considered \n``totally disabled'' because their disability renders them \nunemployable.\n  Before I comment further on a number of other issues in the \nconference report relating to support for our men and women in uniform, \nweapons systems and nonproliferation programs, I want to comment on \nprovisions relating to the treatment of detainees and the sense of the \nCongress on United States policy on Iraq.\n  I am pleased that the conference report contains the full text of the \nMcCain amendment on torture, without change. This language firmly \nestablishes in law that the United States will not subject any \nindividual in our custody, regardless of nationality or physical \nlocation, to cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment. The \namendment provides a single standard--``cruel, inhuman, or degrading \ntreatment or punishment''--without regard to what agency holds a \ndetainee, what the nationality of the detainee is, or where the \ndetainee is held. With the enactment of this amendment, the United \nStates will put itself on record as rejecting any effort to claim that \nthese words have one meaning as they apply to the Department of Defense \nand another meaning as they apply to the CIA; one meaning as they apply \nto Americans and another meaning as they apply to our enemies; or one \nmeaning as they apply in the United States and another meaning as they \napply elsewhere in the world.\n  The McCain amendment is not only an important statement of law, it is \na reaffirmation of one of the core values of our system of government \nand a restatement of who we are as Americans. I would not have signed \nor supported any conference report that did not include these \nprovisions.\n  Despite repeated efforts by administration officials and their allies \nin the House of Representatives to amend this language, the conference \nreport does not allow the President to authorize actions that violate \nthe standards in the McCain amendment, or to immunize individuals who \nengage in such actions from either criminal prosecution or civil suit. \nDespite repeated efforts by administration officials and their allies \nin the House, the conference report does not authorize the U.S. \ngovernment to indemnify individuals who are found to be liable for \nviolating the standards in the McCain amendment, and it does not make \nreckless or wanton behavior a prerequisite to such liability.\n  The conference report would add a new section establishing a defense \nin any legal action against a person who engages in specific \noperational detention and interrogation practices that were officially \nauthorized at the time that they were conducted, if the defendant did \nnot know that the practices were unlawful and a person of ordinary \nsense and understanding would not have known that they were unlawful. \nThis is not a new defense: it is virtually identical to the defense \nalready available under the Manual for Courts-Martial for military \nmembers who act in reliance upon lawful orders.\n  It has never been my understanding that the McCain amendment would, \nby itself, create a private right of action. I do not believe that the \namendment was intended either to create such a private right of action, \nor to eliminate or undercut any private right of action--such as a \nclaim under the alien tort satute--that is otherwise available to an \nalien detainee. Rather, the McCain amendment would establish a legal \nstandard applicable to any criminal prosecution or a private right of \naction that is otherwise available under law. That would not be changed \nin any way by the affirmative defense added in the new section. Nor \nwould the McCain amendment be undermined in any way by any of the other \ndetainee provisions in the conference report.\n  I opposed the initial amendment addressing the legal rights of \nDepartment of Defense detainees at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba when Senator \nGraham offered it on the Senate floor, because it would have stripped \nfederal courts of jurisdiction to hear habeas corpus challenges--\nincluding pending cases--brought by Guantanamo detainees. \nUnfortunately, the Senate approved that amendment by a 49-to-42 vote.\n\n  Following the Senate vote, I worked with Senator Graham to build back \nprotection into his amendment. We did so in three ways:\n  First, the jurisdiction-stripping provision in the initial Graham \namendment would have applied retroactively to all pending cases in \nFederal court--stripping the Federal courts of jurisdiction to consider \npending cases, including the Hamdan case now pending in the Supreme \nCourt. The revised amendment adopted by the Senate--the so-called \nGraham-Levin-Kyl amendment--does not apply to or alter any habeas case \npending in the courts at the time of enactment.\n  Under the Supreme Court's ruling in Lindh v. Murphy, 521 U.S. 320, \nthe fact that Congress has chosen not to apply the habeas-stripping \nprovision to pending cases means that the courts retain jurisdiction to \nconsider these appeals. Again, the Senate voted affirmatively to remove \nlanguage from the original Graham amendment that would have applied \nthis provision to pending cases. The conference report retains the same \neffective date as the Senate bill, thereby adopting the Senate position \nthat this provision will not strip the courts of jurisdiction in \npending cases.\n  Let me be specific.\n  The original Graham amendment approved by the Senate contained \nlanguage stating that the habeas-stripping provision ``shall apply to \nany application or other action that is pending on\n\n[[Page S14258]]\n\nor after the date of the enactment of this Act.'' We objected to this \nlanguage and it was not included in the Senate passed bill.\n  An early draft of the Graham-Levin-Kyl amendment contained language \nstating that the habeas-stripping provision ``shall apply to any \napplication or other action that is pending on or after the date of the \nenactment of this Act, except that the Supreme Court of the United \nStates shall have jurisdiction to determine the lawfulness of the \nremoval, pursuant to such amendment, of its jurisdiction to hear any \ncase in which certiorari has been granted as of such date.'' We \nobjected to this language and it was not included in the Senate-passed \nbill.\n  A House proposal during the conference contained language stating \nthat the habeas-stripping provision ``shall apply to any application or \nother action that is pending on or after the date of enactment of this \nAct.'' We objected to this language and it was not included in the \nconference report.\n  Rather, the conference report states that the provision ``shall take \neffect on the date of the enactment of this Act.'' These words have \ntheir ordinary meaning--that the provision is prospective in its \napplication, and does not apply to pending cases. By taking this \nposition, we preserve comity between the judicial and legislative \nbranches and avoid repeating the unfortunate precedent in Ex parte \nMcCardle, in which Congress intervened to strip the Supreme Court of \njurisdiction over a case which was pending before that Court.\n  Second, the initial Graham amendment would have provided for direct \njudicial review only of status determinations by Combat Status Review \nTribunals, CSRTs. By contrast, the revised Graham-Levin-Kyl amendment \nadopted by the Senate provided for direct judicial review of both \nstatus determinations by CSRTs and convictions by military commissions. \nThe amendment does not affirmatively authorize either CSRTs or military \ncommissions--instead, it establishes a judicial procedure for \ndetermining the constitutionality of such processes.\n  Again, this improvement is preserved in the conference report, which \nretains the Senate language authorizing direct review of both status \ndeterminations by CSRTs and convictions by military commissions.\n  Third, the initial Graham amendment would have provided only for \nreview of whether a tribunal complied with the Department's own \nstandards and procedures. By contrast, the revised amendment adopted by \nthe Senate would authorize courts to determine whether the standards \nand procedures used by CSRTs and military commissions are consistent \nwith the Constitution and laws of the United States.\n  This language has been revised in conference only to state what the \nintent of the amendment already was--that it was not intended to grant \nto an alien detainee any rights under the Constitution and laws of the \nUnited States that the detainee does not already have. Otherwise, the \nimproved language remains intact in the conference report: The courts \nwould be expressly authorized to determine whether the standards and \nprocedures used in a status determination or the trial of an alien \ndetainee at the Guantanamo are consistent with the Constitution and \nlaws of the United States, as they apply to that detainee.\n\n  We expect that final decisions in both the CSRT process and under the \nmilitary order for trials will be reached in an expeditious manner to \nensure judicial review within a reasonable period of time. The \nstatement of managers makes this point expressly with regard to CSRT \ndeterminations, because the amendment requires that CSRT procedures be \nsubmitted to Congress. The statement of managers does not make this \npoint with regard to military commissions only because the procedures \nfor military commissions are not in any way addressed in the conference \nreport.\n  The Senate bill also contained a provision that would require the \nSecretary of Defense to submit to Congress a report on the procedures \nused by combat status review tribunals and administrative review boards \nfor determining the status of the detainees held at Guantanamo Bay and \nthe need to continue to hold such detainees. This provision has been \nexpanded in the conference report to require that the report also \naddress procedures in operation in Afghanistan and Iraq for a \ndetermination of the status of aliens detained in the custody or under \nthe physical control of the Department of Defense.\n  Nothing in the conference report is intended to in any way authorize, \nendorse or approve either these procedures or Military Commission Order \nNo. 1, which establishes Department of Defense procedures for the trial \nof detainees. Nor does anything in the conference report authorize, \nendorse or approve the administration's position on the President's \nauthority to treat any alien or category of aliens as ``enemy \ncombatants'' or ``unlawful combatants''. All that it does is to require \nthat certain DOD procedures be submitted to the Congress and \nestablishes an orderly process for the review of those procedures in \nthe courts to determine whether they are consistent with the \nConstitution and laws of the United States. The conference report does \nnot attempt to prejudge the outcome of that review.\n  Throughout the conference, we were pressed by administration \nofficials and their allies in the House to make changes to the Senate \nlanguage. We were asked to strip the courts of jurisdiction over \npending cases; to eliminate any review of the constitutionality of \nprocedures established by the Department of Defense; to expand the \nhabeas limitations to detainees held anywhere in the world; to expand \nthese provisions to strip legal rights from detainees held by the CIA \nand other agencies; to bar detainees from ever bringing any legal \naction challenging any aspect of their detention; to prohibit the \ncourts from providing legal relief for detainees who are found to be \nimproperly held; and to grant immunity to individuals engaged in \ndetention and interrogation operations. We successfully opposed all of \nthese changes.\n  The conference report does make two changes to the Senate language \nwhich are more complex.\n  First, the Senate-passed provision would have established an \nexclusionary rule prohibiting CSRTs from considering evidence obtained \nthrough ``undue coercion''. I was troubled by the phrase ``undue \ncoercion'', because of the implication that there might be such a thing \nas ``due''--or appropriate--coercion. I do not believe that coerced \ntestimony is ever appropriate.\n  We were able to modify the provision in the conference report to \neliminate the word ``undue'', an improvement over the Senate language. \nAt the same time, however, the provision was modified so that it only \nprovides for an ``assessment'' of whether the testimony was obtained \nthrough cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment and, if so, requires the \ntribunal to decide if there is any probative value to the testimony. We \ndo not authorize such testimony to be used: a reviewing court will make \nthat determination.\n  It is a centuries-old principle of Anglo-American law, enshrined in \nthe fifth amendment to the Constitution, that no person shall be \ncompelled to be a witness against himself. Regardless whether this rule \nof law is expressly incorporated into CSRT procedures, I hope and \nbelieve that the courts will enforce the generally accepted rule of law \nand ensure that evidence obtained through coercion is excluded from any \nadministrative or judicial proceedings.\n  Second, while the Senate-passed provision would have eliminated \nfederal court jurisdiction only for habeas corpus actions, the \nconference report would eliminate such jurisdiction for ``any other \naction against the United States or its agents'' relating to detention \nat Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. This new language is limited to detainees who \neither: (1) remain in military custody at Guantanamo; or (2) although \nthey have been released from Guantanamo, have been determined by the \nUnited States Court of Appeals (subject to Supreme Court review) to \nhave been properly detained as enemy combatants. This language places a \nlimitation on legal recourse available to detainees. While we do not \nknow whether any legal remedies other than habeas corpus actions would \nhave been available to detainees, I would have preferred not to have \nthis limitation in the bill.\n\n  In sum, administration officials and their allies in the House have \nsought at every turn to deny legal rights or recourse to detainees at \nGuantanamo and\n\n[[Page S14259]]\n\nelsewhere. I do not believe that we should have gone down the road of \nlimiting legal remedies for detainees in the manner that we did. \nHowever, once the Senate voted over my objection to eliminate habeas \ncorpus relief, my effort turned toward: (1) building back access to the \ncourts on direct appeal of administrative determinations of status or \ncriminal conduct; (2) avoiding stripping the courts of jurisdiction \nover pending cases; and (3) ensuring that the provisions on detainee \nrights would not be used to undermine the McCain amendment.\n  I believe that we succeeded on all three issues. The conference \nreport preserves a meaningful opportunity for detainees to challenge \nthe legality of their detention or any criminal conviction in federal \ncourt. It ensures that the provisions eliminating habeas corpus \njurisdiction will be prospective in their application and will not \napply to pending cases. And of course we worked with Senator McCain to \npreserve his amendment intact and to shape the Graham-Levin language so \nas to avoid undermining the McCain amendment.\n  The conferees endorsed with minimal change the provision on United \nStates policy on Iraq which garnered overwhelming bipartisan support \nfrom over three-quarters of the Senate. This provision shows that both \nhouses of Congress, and both political parties, have come together with \na common message to our troops, to the administration, to the American \npeople, and, most importantly, to the Iraqi people.\n  Expressing the heartfelt gratitude of the American people to our \ntroops and their families for their unwavering devotion to duty, \nservice to the Nation, and selfless sacrifice, Congress in this \nconference report reiterates its support for them and for a successful \nconclusion to their mission.\n  Congress, in the provision in the conference report, notes that \ncalendar year 2006 should be a period of significant transition to full \nIraqi sovereignty, with Iraqi security forces taking the lead for the \nsecurity of a free and sovereign Iraq, thereby creating the conditions \nfor the phased redeployment of United States forces from Iraq.\n  Congress expresses its view that the administration should tell the \nleaders of all groups and political parties in Iraq that they need to \nmake the compromises necessary to achieve the broad-based and \nsustainable political settlement that is essential for defeating the \ninsurgency in Iraq, within the schedules they set for themselves.\n  Congress directs the administration to provide Congress and the \nAmerican people specific information on its strategy in Iraq, \nprincipally the diplomatic, political, economic, and military measures \nthat are being undertaken; whether the Iraqis have made the compromises \nnecessary to achieve the broad-based and sustainable political \nsettlement that is essential for defeating the insurgency; and the \nconditions that must be met in order to provide for the transition of \nadditional security responsibility to Iraqi security forces, along with \na plan for meeting such conditions, and an assessment of the extent to \nwhich such conditions have been met.\n  This provision, which has garnered broad bipartisan support, is a \nsignificant win for the American people, and a large step forward for \npolicy for Iraq. The messages that it sends are important, and the \ninformation it demands is crucial, for establishing and advancing a \nstrategy for completing the mission in Iraq successfully, for beginning \nthe process of redeployment of our military forces, and for doing so in \na manner that will hopefully enhance U.S. national security.\n  The conference report also authorizes $50 billion in supplemental \nfunding for fiscal year 2006 to support our troops on the ground in \nIraq and Afghanistan. This is consistent with the budget resolution. \nIncluded in this $50 billion is funding to support increased Army and \nMarine Corps personnel, funding to buy additional armor for their \nvehicles and to repair or replace the equipment that our troops rely \non. It also includes $1 billion for our No. 1 force protection \npriority, the Joint Improvised Explosive Device or IED Task Force.\n  This bill authorizes military construction and family housing \nprojects that will improve the quality of life of our men and women in \nuniform and their families. It also authorizes $1.5 billion to begin \nimplementing the decisions of the 2005 base realignment and closure \nround. These funding authorizations are consistent with the military \nconstruction appropriations enacted in November and will allow those \nprojects to proceed.\n  The conferees agreed to the Army's request to relax the punitive \nrestrictions on military construction at Fort Buchanan, Puerto Rico \nthat were enacted 5 years ago in light of the protests over Vieques. \nThe Army activities at Fort Buchanan are not now and never were related \nto the Navy's activities at Vieques, and I am pleased that the \nconferees agreed to address these unjust restrictions.\n  With respect to nonproliferation programs, although I would have \npreferred the amendment that Senator Lugar added to the Senate-passed \nbill, which would have repealed all of the various conditions that the \nCooperative Threat Reduction, CTR, program must meet before spending \nmoney in any given year, I am pleased that we have included permanent \nauthority to waive on an annual basis the requirement to certify that \nthe various conditions have been met by each country recipient of CTR \nfunds.\n  The CTR program and the nonproliferation programs at the Department \nof Energy are all funded at the budget request. Within the Department \nprograms we were able to address some urgent requirements by providing \nadditional funds to accelerate the shutdown of the last plutonium-\nproducing reactor in Russia and to accelerate the security of nuclear \nweapons storage at key Russian sites.\n  The agreement includes $4.0 million in Air Force accounts that the \nAir Force and the Department of Defense have the option to use to study \nand improve the performance of conventional, nonnuclear, penetrator \nweapons. I hope and urge the Department to use at least the $4.0 \nmillion to support conventional, nonnuclear weapons development.\n  The conference report includes a series of provisions designed to \nimprove the management of the Department of Defense. These include \nprovisions that would:\n  Help protect the Federal employee workforce from unfair competition \nby codifying an important set of historic precedents and commonsense \nprinciples for public-private competition;\n  Improve the management of DOD's major defense acquisition programs by \nrequiring the Department to establish more realistic and achievable \ncost and performance estimates and tighten oversight requirements for \nprograms that are experiencing problematic cost growth;\n  Improve the management of $70 billion a year of DOD contracts for \nservices by requiring the Department to establish a new management \nstructure for such contracts and requiring strict review of interagency \ncontracting mechanisms that have been abused in the past;\n  Reduce the risk of abusive acquisition practices like those seen in \nthe proposed tanker lease contract by requiring the Secretary of \nDefense or the Deputy Secretary of Defense to personally approve any \nproposal to purchase a major weapon system as a commercial item; and\n  Prohibit the Department from wasting hundreds of millions of dollars \non unneeded audits of financial management systems that must be \nreplaced because they are incapable of producing timely, accurate and \ncomplete financial data for management purposes.\n  I am particularly pleased that the conference report also includes a \nprovision for disaster relief for small business concerns damaged by \ndrought. In the same way that floods, hailstorms, tornadoes, and other \nnatural phenomena can devastate small businesses, the harm caused by \nunusually low water levels on the Great Lakes can be irreparable to \nbusinesses that depend on the waterways. The Small Business Act already \nprovides disaster assistance to businesses have been victim to a number \nof natural disasters, so I am grateful that we have been able to \nbroaden eligibility for that assistance to include businesses that have \nbeen hurt by below-average water levels on the Great Lakes.\n  With respect to the Navy's shipbuilding accounts, the conference \nagreement incorporates reasonable\n\n[[Page S14260]]\n\ncost caps on Virginia-class attack submarines in the Future Years \nDefense Program, the fifth DD(X) land attack destroyer, to be bought in \n2010, and the fifth and sixth littoral combat ships, to be bought in \n2008 or 2009. The conferees did not include a cost cap on the LHA \nbecause too little is known yet about the final design. The conference \nagreement also reflects the fact that the House has agreed to the \nSenate provision preventing the Navy from conducting a winner-take-all \ncompetition for the next generation destroyer program called the DD(X). \nFinally, the conferees agreed to a provision requiring the Navy to \nmaintain 12 aircraft carriers and provided funding to overhaul the USS \nJohn F. Kennedy that the Navy had planned to retire.\n\n  The conferees dealt with the Navy's program to buy a new presidential \nhelicopter, called the VXX, by adopting compromise language that would: \n(1) allow production of the pilot production helicopters to go forward; \nand (2) require that the Secretary of the Navy submit an acquisition \nstrategy for the full rate production aircraft, Increment Two, by March \n15, 2006. This strategy would be required to include one phase of \noperational testing before initiation of full rate production for VXX. \nThe agreement would fence 25 percent of the Fiscal Year 2006 R \nfunding until the Secretary submits that strategy.\n  The conferees also dealt with the Army's future combat systems by \nagreeing that the entire Army future combat systems program, including \nthe manned ground vehicles project, should remain in system development \nand demonstration, rather than having large portions revert to the \ntechnical base. This is a recognition of the importance of the Army's \nonly modernization program to both the future Army, and to the spinout \nof FCS technologies to the current force, as well as a recognition of \nthe need for the future combat systems to be developed as an integrated \nsystem of systems as quickly as possible.\n  The bill also demonstrates the conferees continued strong support for \nthe Department's special operations, counterdrug and humanitarian \noperations. In particular the conferees enhanced DOD's ability to \ncombat terrorism and the production and trafficking of illegal drugs, \nincluding: authorizing and funding five additional National Guard \nChemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear and High Yield Explosive \n(CBRNE) Enhanced Response Force Package teams, in addition to \nsustaining the existing 12 teams--which provide support to civilian \nauthorities in the aftermath of a WMD incident; directing the \nDepartment to report on the use of DOD aerial reconnaissance assets to \nsupport the Department of Homeland Security; authorizing use of \ncounterdrug funding for 2 years for joint task forces combating \nterrorism and narcotics production and trafficking, and; designating \nthe Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff as the principal military \nadvisor to the Homeland Security Council. The conferees also agreed to \nauthorize increased funding for humanitarian operations, including $40 \nmillion in a future supplemental for Pakistan, and expanding the \nmedical assistance to include related education, training, and \ntechnical assistance.\n  In science and technology, this year's conference report includes a \nnumber of provisions and funding measures that support the \ntransformation of our military while improving our ability to rapidly \nmove new technologies out of the laboratory and onto the battlefield. \nThe conference report authorizes over $11.3 billion for science and \ntechnology research programs, an increase of $840 million over the \nPresident's budget request. It also makes permanent the SMART, Science, \nMath, and Research for Transformation, Scholarship for Service Program \nto help the DoD educate, train, and employ the highest quality \ntechnical workforce. In order to better utilize the innovative talents \nof our nation's small businesses, the bill establishes a pilot program \nto promote the transition of technologies from the Small Business \nInnovative Research program into DoD acquisition programs. Finally, the \nconference report increases funding for and establishes mechanisms to \naccelerate and better coordinate research in a number of priority areas \nincluding robotics, unmanned ground vehicles, IED detection and defeat, \nthe diagnosis and treatment of blast injuries, semiconductor \nmicroelectronics, and the development and deployment of advanced fuel \ncell vehicles.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the letter I referred to be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                                  Committee on Armed Services,\n\n                                Washington, DC, December 18, 2005.\n     Hon. Duncan Hunter,\n     Chairman, Armed Services Committee, and National Defense \n         Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2006 Conference, House \n         of Representatives, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Duncan: On Friday, December 16, we joined you and Ike \n     Skelton in conducting the final meeting of the conferees \n     along with other Members of the Senate and House.\n       At the conclusion of the meeting, the ``base bill'' was \n     agreed upon and signatures of Republican and Democratic \n     Committee Members were requested and affixed to the \n     Conference Report with the expectation that the House, \n     following the customary procedure, would be the first chamber \n     to file. It was our further understanding that this would be \n     done Friday evening.\n       We are returning to you the signatures of the Senate \n     conferees on the condition that there are no changes made in \n     the ``base bill'' and Conference Report and that the House \n     obtain a Rule which precludes any further amendment.\n       You have shown strong leadership during this very brief and \n     unusual conference period and we have confidence that you can \n     achieve passage in the House of the ``base bill''. We believe \n     it is in the interest of the Nation and the men and women of \n     the Armed Forces that our Conference Report as agreed to on \n     December 16 becomes law.\n           Sincerely,\n     Carl Levin,\n     Ranking Member.\n     John Warner,\n     Chairman.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. My particular thanks to my staff for their extraordinary \nwork:\n  Rick DeBobes, Peter Levine, Jon Clark, Chris Cowart, Dan Cox, Madelyn \nCreedon, Brie Eisen, Evelyn Farkas, Richard Fieldhouse, Creighton \nGreene, Bridget Higgins, Mike Kuiken, Gary Leeling, Mark McCord, Bill \nMonahan, Arun Seraphin.\n  Also to Charlie Abell and others of Senator Warner's staff.\n\n\n                       comments on final passage\n\n  Mr. KYL. I would like to say a few words about the now-completed \nNational Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 2006, and in \nparticular about section 1405 of that act, which expels lawsuits \nbrought by enemy combatants from United States courts. I see that my \ncolleague, the senior Senator from South Carolina, is also on the \nfloor.\n  I would like to begin by commenting on the need for this legislation. \nThis provision originally was added to the bill in an amendment that \nwas offered by Senator Graham and of which I was a cosponsor, as well \nas Senator Chambliss.\n  Keeping war-on-terror detainees out of the court system is a \nprerequisite for conducting effective and productive interrogation, and \ninterrogation has proved to be an important source of critical \nintelligence that has saved American lives.\n  In Rasul v. Bush, the U.S. Supreme Court interpreted section 2241 of \ntitle 28 to authorize enemy combatants held outside of the United \nStates to file habeas-corpus petitions challenging their status in \nfederal courts. Such a process is both without precedent and is utterly \nimpractical.\n  Giving detainees access to federal judicial proceedings threatens to \nseriously undermine vital U.S. intelligence-gathering activities. Under \nthe new Rasul-imposed system, shortly after al-Qaida and Taliban \ndetainees arrive at Guantanamo Bay, they are informed that they have \nthe right to challenge their detention in Federal court and the right \nto see a lawyer. Detainees overwhelmingly have exercised both rights. \nThe lawyers inevitably tell detainees not to talk to interrogators. \nAlso, mere notice of the availability of these proceedings gives \ndetainees hope that they can win release through adversary litigation--\nrather than by cooperating with their captors. Effective interrogation \nrequires the detainee to develop a relationship of trust and dependency \nwith his interrogator. The system imposed last year as a result of \nRasul--access to adversary litigation and a lawyer--completely \nundermines these preconditions for successful interrogation.\n\n[[Page S14261]]\n\n  Navy VADM Lowell Jacoby expounded on the preconditions for effective \ninterrogation in a declaration attached to the United States' brief in \nthe Padilla litigation in the Southern District of New York. Vice \nAdmiral Jacoby at the time was the Director of the Defense Intelligence \nAgency. He noted in the Declaration that:\n\n       DIA's approach to interrogation is largely dependent upon \n     creating an atmosphere of dependency and trust between the \n     subject and the interrogator. Developing the kind of \n     relationship of trust and dependency necessary for effective \n     interrogations is a process that can take a significant \n     amount of time. There are numerous examples of situations \n     where interrogators have been unable to obtain valuable \n     intelligence from a subject until months, or, even years, \n     after the interrogation process began.\n       Anything that threatens the perceived dependency and trust \n     between the subject and interrogator directly threatens the \n     value of interrogation as an intelligence gathering tool. \n     Even seemingly minor interruptions can have profound \n     psychological impacts on the delicate subject-interrogator \n     relationship. Any insertion of counsel into the subject-\n     interrogator relationship, for example--even if only for a \n     limited duration or for a specific purpose--can undo months \n     of work and may permanently shut down the interrogation \n     process.\n\n  Specifically with regard to Jose Padilla, Vice Admiral Jacoby also \nnoted in his Declaration that:\n\n       Providing [Padilla] access to counsel now would create \n     expectations by Padilla that his ultimate release may be \n     obtained through an adversarial civil litigation process. \n     This would break--probably irreparably--the sense of \n     dependency and trust that the interrogators are attempting to \n     create.\n\n  The system of litigation that Rasul has wrought is unacceptable.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I agree entirely. If I could add one thing on this point: \nperhaps the best evidence that the current Rasul system undermines \neffective interrogation is that even the detainees' lawyers are \nbragging about their lawsuits' having that effect. Michael Ratner, a \nlawyer who has filed lawsuits on behalf of numerous enemy combatants \nheld at Guantanamo Bay, boasted in a recent magazine interview about \nhow he has made it harder for the military to do its job. He \nparticularly emphasized that the litigation interferes with \ninterrogation of enemy combatants. Ratner stated:\n\n       The litigation is brutal for [the United States]. It's \n     huge. We have over one hundred lawyers now from big and small \n     firms working to represent these detainees. Every time an \n     attorney goes down there, it makes it that much harder [for \n     the U.S. military] to do what they're doing. You can't run an \n     interrogation . . . with attorneys. What are they going to do \n     now that we're getting court orders to get more lawyers down \n     there?\n\n  When I read that quote, that for me was the last straw. I knew that \nsomething had to be done. On this issue, both the detainees' lawyers \nand the Defense Department seem to agree: involving enemy combatants in \nadversarial litigation in U.S. courts undermines effective \ninterrogation of those detainees.\n  Mr. KYL. I am glad that we have been able to work together on this \nissue. I would add that interrogation of these detainees is important. \nIn his Declaration to the Southern District of New York, DIA Director \nJacoby described how interrogation has proven to be a critical \nintelligence tool--indeed, our most important intelligence tool--in \npast conflicts and in the current war on terror. Interrogation was our \nmost valuable source of information in World War II and the gulf war, \nand has played a key role in stopping numerous terrorist attacks in the \npresent conflict. Vice Admiral Jacoby stated in that declaration:\n\n       Interrogations are vital in all combat operations, \n     regardless of the intensity of the conflict. Interrogation \n     permits the collection of information from sources with \n     direct knowledge of, among other things, plans, locations, \n     and persons seeking to do harm to the United States and its \n     citizens. When done effectively, interrogation provides \n     information that likely could not be gained from any other \n     source.\n       The Department of the Army's Field Manual governing \n     Intelligence Interrogation, FM 34-52, dated 28 September \n     1992, provides several examples of the importance of \n     interrogations in gathering intelligence. The Manual cites, \n     for example, the United States General Board on Intelligence \n     survey of nearly 80 intelligence units after World War II. \n     Based upon those surveys, the Board estimated that 43 percent \n     of all intelligence produced in the European theater of \n     operations was from HUMINT, and 84 percent of the HUMINT was \n     from interrogation. The majority of those surveyed agreed \n     that interrogation was the most valuable of all collection \n     operations.\n       The Army Field Manual also notes that during OPERATION \n     DESERT STORM, DoD interrogators collected information that, \n     among other things, helped to: develop a plan to breach Iraqi \n     defensive belts; confirm Iraqi supply-line interdiction by \n     coalition air strikes; identify diminishing Iraqi troop \n     morale; and identify a United States Prisoner of War captured \n     during the battle of Kafji.\n\n  Vice Admiral Jacoby also noted that interrogations of enemy \ncombatants captured in the War on Terror have played a vital role in \npreventing numerous terrorist attacks. Again, quoting from his \ndeclaration in the Padilla litigation, Jacoby noted that interrogations \nof combatants such as those held at Guantanamo Bay have:\n\n     . . . provided vital information to the President, military \n     commanders, and others involved in the war on Terrorism. It \n     is estimated that more than 100 additional attacks on the \n     United States and its interests have been thwarted since 11 \n     September 2001 by the effective intelligence gathering \n     efforts of the Intelligence Community and others.\n       In fact, Padilla's capture and detention were the direct \n     result of such effective intelligence gathering efforts. The \n     information leading to Padilla's capture came from a variety \n     of sources over time, including the interrogation of other \n     detainees. Knowledge and disruption of Al Qaida's plot to \n     detonate a `dirty bomb' or arrange for other attacks within \n     the United States may not have occurred absent the \n     interrogation techniques described above.\n\n  There are other examples of the importance of intelligence obtained \nfrom interrogation. In a recent new release, the Defense Department \ndescribed valuable information that was obtained from interrogation of \nMohamed al Kahtani, an enemy combatant being held at Guantanamo Bay. \nThe Pentagon release noted that interrogation of Kahtani has yielded \ninformation that:\n\n       Clarified Jose Padilla's and Richard Reid's relationship \n     with al-Qaida and their activities in Afghanistan; provided \n     infiltration routes and methods used by al-Qaida to cross \n     borders undetected; explained how Osama Bin Laden evaded \n     capture by U.S. forces, as well as provided important \n     information on his health; and provided detailed information \n     about 30 of Osama Bin Laden's bodyguards who are also held at \n     Guantanamo.\n\n  The Pentagon's news release concluded: ``the result of those \ninterrogations [at Guantanamo Bay] has undoubtedly produced information \nthat has saved the lives of U.S. and coalition forces in the field.''\n  Let me cite another example: a June 27, 2004 Washington Post story \nnotes that on November 11, 2001, Pakistani forces captured Ibn al-\nShaykh al-Libi, a Libyan national who ran the Khaldan paramilitary camp \nin Afghanistan. In January 2002, al-Libi was handed over to U.S. forces \nand interrogated. According the Post, interrogation of al-Libi:\n\n     . . . provided the CIA with intelligence about an alleged \n     plot to blow up the U.S. Embassy in Yemen with a truck bomb \n     and pointed officials in the direction of Abu Zubaida, a top \n     al Qaeda leader know to have been involved in the September \n     11 plot. In March 2002, Abu Zubaida was captured. . . . \n     [Interrogation of Zubaida] led to the apprehension of other \n     al Qaeda members, including Ramzi Binalshibh, also in \n     Pakistan. The capture of Binalshibh and other al Qaeda \n     leaders--Omar al-Faruq in Indonesia, Rahim al-Nashiri in \n     Kuwait, and Muhammad al Darbi in Yemen--were all partly the \n     result of information gained during interrogations, according \n     to U.S. intelligence and national security officials.\n\n  The bottom line is that keeping detainees out of court makes \neffective interrogation possible, and interrogation has proved to be an \ninvaluable source of intelligence, allowing the United States to \ncapture important terrorists, prevent future terrorist attacks, and \nsave the lives of American soldiers in the field.\n  I should also say a few words about some of the attacks that have \nbeen made against our amendment. For example, some critics have \nsuggested that our amendment is inconsistent with the McCain \namendment--that it prevents detainees from suing to enforce the McCain \namendment. The response to this criticism is relatively \nstraightforward: our amendment does not take anything away because the \nMcCain amendment does not create a private cause of action in the first \nplace. That amendment directly regulates military officers and is \nenforced through the usual mechanisms of military discipline.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. You are absolutely correct Senator Kyl. I must admit, I'm\n\n[[Page S14262]]\n\na bit baffled by the assertion that our amendment is somehow internally \ninconsistent, that our provisions interfere with the McCain provisions \nin some way.\n  While we must ensure that detainees are treated humanely, and that is \nwhat we addressed so well with the McCain portion of our total package, \ndirecting our departments and agencies to refrain from cruel, inhumane, \nor degrading treatment; we also don't want to give these detainees the \nright to abuse our courts by going after our soldiers, sailors, airmen \nand marines based on how we have decided to treat them. In fact, while \nit is true that some physical abuses have occurred, we know that \nmembers of al-Qaida are trained to claim mistreatment to manipulate \npublic opinion of the war.\n  I would like to remind all of my colleagues of some of the most \negregious cases that prompted our amendments. For instance, a detainee \nwho threw a grenade that killed an Army medic, a medic--someone trying \nto render medical assistance, and who often treats our enemies on the \nbattlefield as well as our own troops.\n  In any event, the detainee who threw the grenade that killed an Army \nmedic in a firefight, and who comes from a family with longstanding al-\nQaida ties, filed for an injunction forbidding anyone from \ninterrogating him or engaging in ``cruel, inhuman, or degrading'' \ntreatment of him.\n  Now clearly, our reaffirmation of America's policy against treating \nanyone in a cruel, inhuman, or degrading way tells the world that we \nare not like our enemy. We do not allow our departments or agencies to \ntreat people like that. And if our people do abuse people, we prosecute \nthem to the fullest extent of the law.\n  However, to allow a detainee access to our courts to contest every \naspect of his detention, a person who has fought against the very \nsystem he now seeks to make use of, is ludicrous. And for anyone to say \nthat somehow our provisions undermine the McCain provisions or our \noverall amendment is just as wrong.\n  Senator McCain, due to his service in our Nation's military, is \nuniquely qualified to take the lead on these issues. The McCain \nprovisions are about us. How we behave. How we administer justice. It \nis another affirmative statement that the United States of America is \nthat ``Shining City on the Hill'' President Reagan referred to. I am \nvery proud to have been part of Senator McCain's effort to retake the \nmoral high ground in the war on terror.\n  The Graham-Kyl provisions are about them, the detainees, and what \nrights they do and, most importantly, do not have. And I am proud of \nthe provisions we have made for the detainee's status to be reviewed by \nthe Federal courts on the one time direct appeal. We allow for a just \nprocess, in the form of military tribunals and boards and commissions, \na process based on Supreme Court precedent, modeled on the tribunals we \nhave used in the past and created in accordance with Geneva Convention \nrequirements. That is the process we have established for determining \nthe status of detainees.\n  But I have gotten a little far a field here, let's get back to the \nlawsuits. Here is another of the crazy lawsuits out there: there's a \nsuit out there by a detainee accusing military health professionals of \n``gross and intentional medical malpractice'' in alleged violation of \nthe 4th, 5th, 8th, and 14th Amendments, 42 U.S.C. 1981, and other, \nunspecified, international agreements. Now I don't know about the rest \nof you, but a detainee has no business in our courts suing the \nindividual doctors and nurses that are making sure that that detainee \nis in good health.\n  Here is another one. There is one guy down there that we are trying \nto send home, and he's suing to keep us from sending him home. Imagine \nthat, he is trying to stay.\n  One high level al-Qaida detainee lawsuit complains about the base \nsecurity procedures, the speed of the mail, and his medical treatment. \nHe is asking the courts to order the marines to transfer him into the \n``least onerous conditions'' at Guantanamo and allow him to keep any \nbooks and reading material sent to him.\n  I think this one is the one that makes me the maddest. A high level \nal-Qaida member, who probably has the blood of 9/11 on his hands, \ncomplaining about the speed of his mail delivery. Complaining about how \nonerous the conditions are at Guantanamo.\n  With the McCain provisions of our amendment, we have, in addition to \nthe President's order and other regulations already in place, directed \nthe Department of Defense to treat him humanely. But under our \nprovisions, he will receive the justice he deserves.\n  As you can see, these cases have nothing to do with cruel or inhumane \ntreatment. They are abuses of our courts by the very people who are \ntrying to kill Americans here and abroad. I don't know about you, \nSenator Kyl, but I believe that when you raise arms against the United \nStates, you should not be surprised when you lose the privilege of our \ncourt system. As the McCain amendment provisions state very clearly, we \nare not going to treat people inappropriately. And, Senator Kyl, as our \nprovisions state very clearly, we are not going to allow them to make a \nmockery of our courts, standing beside our own citizens at the \ncourthouse door.\n  We have provided a fair alternative judicial process for the \ndetainees with our provisions. In fact, we have been more than fair. We \nhave given them more process than our own soldiers and marines would \nenjoy under the Geneva Convention. This in no way undermines the McCain \nprovisions about how we will treat them and I would challenge anyone \nwho thinks so to come to the Senate floor and debate us on that point.\n  Mr. KYL. To be clear, neither the CSRT nor the ARB process is \ndesigned to entertain grievance about the conditions of confinement. Is \nthat your understanding as well?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. And those are the only channels that have been created \nwhere the detainee himself can pursue a remedy on his own in a semi-\nadversarial forum. These complaints about conditions of confinement, \nthese are for the military itself to enforce through its own procedures \nand systems of accountability for monitoring its soldiers. And we have \nno reason to believe that those systems are not adequate to investigate \nand remedy abuses. For all the attention to cases such as Abu Ghraib, \none thing that deserves emphasis is that it was our own military that \ndiscovered, investigated, and punished those abuses. That is as it \nshould be. These standards of treatment are important, but they need to \nbe enforced through the military's internal systems of accountability \nand Congressional oversight, not through lawsuits and adversarial \nproceedings brought by detainees. The military's own accountability \nsystems ultimately, I think, will be more effective in monitoring our \ndetention centers and in remedying abuses. All that litigation would \ndo--letting these detainees into court--is undermine intelligence \ngathering through interrogation.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. If I might interrupt, I would like to add that I share \nthe understanding of my colleagues from Arizona and South Carolina. I \nsupported the McCain amendments--I think that it is important to ensure \nthat detainees are treated humanely. But I would not support allowing \nthose detainees to file lawsuits against our armed forces, and I wasn't \naware that anyone had even suggested that the McCain amendments allow \ndetainees to file Bivens-type actions.\n  Mr. KYL. No one really argued that the McCain amendments do create a \nprivate cause of action, except that some groups have suggested that \nthe Graham/Kyl amendment is somehow inconsistent with the McCain \namendments, the implication being that the Graham amendment wiped out \nthe forum for bringing some cause of action that otherwise was created. \nObviously, if the McCain amendment did create a private right of \naction, our amendment would bar the courts from entertaining that \naction. But the fact alone that the same Congress that adopted the \nMcCain amendment also adopted the Graham/Kyl amendment tends to \nconfirm, I would think, that the McCain amendments never were intended \nto create a private right of action in the first place.\n\n  As a matter of fact, the Supreme Court recently has tightened the \nstandards for spontaneously recognizing such actions in cases where \nCongress is silent on the matter--I believe it was in the recent case \nof Alexander against Sandoval. The McCain amendments do\n\n[[Page S14263]]\n\nnot state that they create a private cause of action. They regulate the \nconduct our troops rather than creating rights. And we have alternative \nmeans of their enforcement--as my colleague mentioned, through the \nsystem of military discipline--and thus we do not need a private cause \nof action to be implemented. I would be pretty surprised if, under \nthose circumstances, anyone were to argue that the McCain amendment \ncreated a private right of action. So the senior Senator from South \nCarolina is correct, the Graham-Levin-Kyl amendment does not take away \nany cause of action created elsewhere in this bill, because the bill \ndoes not create any rights of action. Some members have been arguing \nthat the McCain amendment will establish a standard that perhaps could \nbe employed in another cause of action. That is, of course, true. But \nif such a cause of action is to exist, Congress will have to create it \nin the future. No cause of action currently available could serve as a \nvehicle for enforcing the McCain amendment in a private lawsuit, and I \nthink that all the backers of that amendment consistently agree that \nthe McCain amendments themselves did not create a private right of \naction. Again, it would be strange to construe this Act as intending \nsuch a private action when by the same hand this Congress would take \naway any forum for asserting such action.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I thank the Senator from Arizona for his comments. I'd \nalso like to say a word about the timing of this bill because we \ndrafted this section very carefully and I want our colleagues to know \nexactly what they will be agreeing to. While our language does respond \nto the Rasul decision by effectively reversing the Supreme Court's \ndecision in that case, we wanted to respect the courts' role in this by \naddressing two different considerations.\n  First, as we stated before, we wanted the CSRT process to yield \ndecisions which will be reviewed by the DC Circuit Court of Appeals. \nAnd we wanted to be sensitive to the Rasul court's concerns about a \nprocess for the detainees. So, what we did was make the substantive \nprovisions governing the CSRTs and ARBs apply to all cases, those \npending on or after the enactment date. This was to ensure that every \ndetainee was provided with the same protections and review.\n  Second, regarding the modification of the jurisdiction of those \ncourts currently hearing individual habeas or other actions that have \nbeen filed by the detainees, we wanted those cases to be recast as \nappeals of their CSRT determinations. We believe that is the best way \nto balance between allowing the detainees to challenge their status, \nand still allowing effective detention and interrogation techniques. As \nwe all know, a court either has jurisdiction to hear a case or it \ndoesn't. Jurisdiction doesn't attach for all time when the case is \nfiled.\n  This is really no different than transferring a case from one court \nto another. But in this case, given the change in the substantive law \nas well, we were required to extinguish these habeas and other actions \nin order to effect a transfer of jurisdiction over these cases to the \nDC Circuit Court and substantive legal change as well.\n  Mr. KYL. Right. It may not be quite right to characterize this bill's \nprovisions as transferring jurisdiction. Rather, they extinguish one \ntype of action--all of the actions now in the courts--and create in \ntheir place a very limited judicial review of certain military \nadministrative decisions.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Yes, that is correct. But we do still allow some types of \njudicial review to go forward--those cases asking for review, in \naccordance with section 1405, of military commissions or CSRTs. And the \nvery last paragraph of section 1405--I believe that it is paragraph \n(h)(2)--adopts a compromise of sorts. It states that the bill's \nauthorization for limited DC Circuit review of CSRTs and military \ncommissions shall apply to pending cases. Obviously, no pending case \nseeks judicial review in the DC Circuit pursuant to section 1405. What \nthis paragraph means is that, at the same time that the courts like the \nDC district courts kick these cases out of their courtrooms, they can \nalso tell them where they should go next. And if, for example, a habeas \naction currently is in the DC Circuit, that court can simply construe \nthat action as a request for review of the detainee's CSRT pursuant to \nsubsection (e) of 1405, and allow that claim to go forward in that \nform.\n  Mr. KYL. The DC Circuit will have to give the petitioner leave to \namend his claim, I assume?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Yes, I assume that they will do so. No sense in kicking \nout a detainee's current habeas action in the DC Circuit just so that \nhe has to refile a section 1405 review request--it would be better to \nlet the current case go forward as a 1405 review request, as \nappropriately amended.\n  Mr. KYL. We agree on that point. The one thing that critics have said \nabout this bill that is correct is that it is a jurisdiction stripping \nbill. It strips every court of jurisdiction to hear claims from \ndetainees held in Guantanamo Bay. The courts' rule of construction for \nthese types of statutes is that legislation ousting the courts of \njurisdiction is applied to pending cases. It has to. We're not just \nchanging the law governing the action. We are eliminating the forum in \nwhich that action can be heard. And there is no exception anywhere in \nthis bill for keeping intact part of that forum to hear the case. The \ncase simply has nowhere to be heard.\n  I have just been handed a memorandum on this subject. The governing \ncases on this question are the Landraf case, as well as Hallowell v. \nCommons, 239 U.S. at 506, and Sherman v. Grinnell, 123 U.S. at 679. As \nthe Landraf court noted, these statutes ``speak to the power of the \ncourt rather than the rights or obligations of the parties.'' These \ncases articulate the rule that will govern the detainee habeas actions \nand other lawsuits that currently are in the courts: legislation \nremoving jurisdiction applies to pending cases and removes those cases \nfrom the courts.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, if Senator Kyl would be so kind, could he \nexplain how our amendment will affect ongoing litigation? Specifically, \nmy understanding is that the Supreme Court granted certiorari recently \nin a case.\n  Mr. KYL. Yes. The Constitution gives Congress the power to make \n``exceptions'' and ``regulations'' to the Supreme Court's \njurisdiction--or at least, to its appellate jurisdiction. It was \nMarbury v. Madison that held that Congress could not regulate original \njurisdiction, but the court since then has made clear that even habeas \nactions filed directly in the Supreme Court are regarded as falling \nwithin a subspecies of the Supreme Court's appellate jurisdiction. This \nwould be an interesting exam question for a law school class.\n  The Congress's authority to use this power was affirmed by the \nSupreme Court in the case of Ex Parte McCardle. That case involved, I \nbelieve, an even sharper use of this authority than this bill does--I \nbelieve that there the Supreme Court had even heard argument in that \ncase before Congress stripped the court's jurisdiction over it. The \nSupreme Court upheld the statute and dismissed Colonel McCardle's case \nfor want of jurisdiction.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. And we are confident that McCardle still is good law?\n  Mr. KYL. So long as the Constitution still is good law. I am not \naware that the clause in Article III allowing Congress to make \nexceptions and regulations to Supreme Court appellate jurisdiction has \nbeen repealed.\n  I suppose that some might argue that stripping the Supreme Court of \njurisdiction over a pending case is unconstitutional if it is driven by \nsome impure motive. But I can't imagine that the court would take away \nan authority clearly granted to Congress by the Constitution, \nregardless of what motive one might attribute to us. I am a member of \nthis body, and would have great difficulty describing some definitive \nmotive or intent to every law that we enact. I don't know how the \nSupreme Court or any other court could accurately discern such a \nmotive. The laws that we enact have meanings that can be discerned \nthrough ordinary rules of construction. I think the rule of law is much \nmore secure when the meaning of legislation is governed by those \nuniversally accessible rules of construction rather than through some \nattempt to psychoanalyze Congress's motive. And in any event, as I \nrecall, this amendment was filed before the Supreme Court even granted \nreview in the Hamdan case. That makes it a little\n\n[[Page S14264]]\n\nhard to argue that the amendment was motivated by a desire to strip the \ncourt of its jurisdiction in that case. I don't think that the \nConstitution gives Hamdan a greater right to have his case go forward \nthan it did to Colonel McCardle.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. So once this bill is signed into law, you anticipate that \nthe Supreme Court will determine whether to maintain their grant of \ncertiorari?\n  Mr. KYL. Yes, in my opinion, the court should dismiss Hamdan for want \nof jurisdiction. That is what they did in Ex Parte McCardle. I assume \nthat we may see an unhappy dissent from the court's order from one or \ntwo of the Justices--there may be some members of the court who refuse \nto accept McCardle and article III. But I think that a majority of the \ncourt would do the right thing--to send Hamdan back to the military \ncommission, and then allow him to appeal pursuant to section 1405 of \nthis bill.\n  The court also may well request a round of briefing on the effect of \nthe effect on the Hamdan case. I suppose that a lawyer in the SG's \noffice can look forward to rereading Ex Parte McCardle and the debates \non the case in Hart & Wechsler's. But again, I don't think that this \nwill change the result.\n  As for legislative history, I think it usually is regarded as an \nelement of the canons of construction. It gives some indication of what \nCongress at least understood what it was doing--the context in which a \nlaw was enacted. Although, I understand that Justice Scalia does not \nread legislative history. I suppose that for his sake, we will have to \nstrive to be exceptionally clear in the laws that we write.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Let me address another issue. As we worked through this \nlanguage in conference, we received a lot of comments from our \ncolleagues who were concerned not only about the frivolous cases being \nfiled by al-Qaida terrorists at Guantanamo, but by people detained by \nour forces in Iraq.\n  I believe there are several cases that have been filed by those held \nin Iraq challenging their detention by American forces. Our language \ndoes not address these cases, and let me tell you why.\n  The Rasul v. Bush decision that we have talked so much about worked \ntwo significant changes in prior POW or detainee law. Prior to Rasul, \nthe Eisentrager line of cases had governed whether foreign combatants \nhad access to our courts. In 1950, the Eisentrager court held that a \nFederal district court lacked authority to hear habeas cases for some \nGerman POWs held by U.S. forces outside the U.S. These Germans had been \ntried and convicted of war crimes by an American military commission \nheadquartered in Nanking, and then put in jail in Germany.\n  The Court stated six reasons for its decision. The German prisoners \nwere: (1) Enemy aliens who (2) had never been or resided in the United \nStates, (3) were captured outside U.S. territory and there held in \nmilitary custody, (4) were there tried and convicted by the military \n(5) for offenses committed there, and (6) were imprisoned there at all \ntimes.\n  The Eisentrager line of cases is the reason the Bush administration \nchose to locate the al Qaida and Taliban holding facility at \nGuantanamo. The Bush administration relied upon the Eisentrager line of \ncases so as to prevent exactly what we have seen happen since Rasul: \nterrorists with lawyers. Now I'm a lawyer myself, and I think we can \nall agree that that is a bad combination.\n  In fact, if my colleagues will permit me a quick aside, I would \nremind them again of the statement by one of the lawyers for some of \nthese terrorists, Michael Ratner. Mr. Ratner boasts about the fact that \nthis litigation has undermined intelligence gathering in the war on \nterror. In an interview published in May of this year Mr. Ratner \nstated:\n\n       The litigation is brutal for the United States. It's huge. \n     We have over one hundred lawyer now from big and small firms \n     working to represent these detainees. Every time an attorney \n     goes down there, it makes it that much harder for the U.S. \n     military to do what they're doing. You can't run an \n     interrogation with attorneys. What are they going to do now \n     that we're getting court orders to get more lawyers down \n     there?\n\n  Now that is what we are facing. Terrorists with lawyers. I am pretty \nsure the American people expect more from their government than that.\n  But getting back to what I was saying about Eisentrager. The Bush \nadministration relied on the Supreme Court's decision in Eisentrager \nwhen they located the detainees at Guantanamo, reasoning sensibly, at \nleast I think it was sensibly, that since the al-Qaida and Taliban \nmembers were enemy aliens who were being held by U.S. forces outside \nthe United States after being captured on the battlefield, that they \nwould not have access to Federal courts.\n  But then the Supreme Court held in Rasul that the detainees could \nhave access to our courts to challenge their detention. Would my \ncolleague from Arizona care to comment on the Rasul decision?\n  Mr. KYL. Where to even begin? The U.S. has been accused before in its \nhistory of imperialistic behavior, but I think that this is the first \ntime ever that a portion of a sovereign nation has been annexed to the \nUnited States by the U.S. Supreme Court.\n  Rasul begins with a discussion of two cases that were irrelevant to \nthe question before the court, Ahrens v. Clark and the Braden case. \nAhrens had adopted a strict rule that district courts may only hear \ncases within their territorial jurisdiction. Braden then softened that \nrule for particular circumstances--for cases where a defendant is in \nprison in one state but under indictment in another, allowing the \ndefendant to bring a habeas action to challenge the indictment in the \nlatter state's courts. Neither of these cases has anything to do with \nenemy combatants.\n  From a discussion of these relatively mundane decisions, the Rasul \nmajority adopts a rather stunning non-sequitir: that ``because Braden \noverruled the statutory predicate to Eisentrager's holding, Eisentrager \nplainly does not preclude the exercise of section 2241 jurisdiction \nover petitioners' claims.''\n  It could almost be a rule of construction that when a lawyer says \n``plainly'' or ``clearly,'' he usually is identifying the weakest point \nin his argument. Braden is a case concerned more with the technical \naspects of judicial administration than with core questions of the \nscope of the writ. Eisentrager is different. The Nazi soldiers denied \naccess to the writ in that case did not simply file in the wrong \nforum--Alabama instead of Kentucky--or at the wrong phase of their \nsentences. Eisentrager denied review to the Nazi soldiers because they \nwere Nazi soldiers in the custody of the U.S. military in occupied \nGermany. It is not a case about how we administer the writ of habeas \ncorpus, but about the power and nature of the writ and who may employ \nit. I doubt that there was any member of the court who participated in \nBraden who believed that the court in that case was destroying the \nfoundation of Eisentrager.\n  So according to section III of Rasul, Braden killed the ``statutory \npredicate'' for Eisentrager and that's that. No more territorial \njurisdiction requirement for habeas courts. Apparently even the Rasul \ncourt itself was unwilling to buy this argument, however, because \nsection IV of the opinion goes on to explain that Guantanamo Bay, Cuba \nis really part of the territory of the United States--something which \nsection III just told us irrelevant and unnecessary to the court's \ndecision.\n  But territorial jurisdiction does matter--a point that the court \nseems to concede by attempting to annex Guantanamo Bay to the United \nStates. But Cuba is not the United States. Eisentrager should be \nrestored to its rightful place as the precedent that governs litigation \nattempted by enemy combatants outside of our territory--even for the \nspecial case of Guantanamo Bay. Eisentrager was the law of the land for \nover 50 years, until Rasul carved a hole into it. Through this act, \nCongress patches that hole and restores Eisentrager's role as the \ngoverning standard. We do this not because, or not just because, Rasul \ndoesn't make sense and is wrong. We do it because Eisentrager's \nreasoning is compelling, and the rule that is established wards off \nmuch mischief.\n  Let me quote two key passages from Eisentrager that explain why enemy \ncombatants outside the United States should not have access to U.S. \ncourts. As that court began by noting, there has been:\n\n\n[[Page S14265]]\n\n\n     . . . no instance where a court, in this or any other country \n     where the writ is known, has issued it on behalf of an alien \n     enemy who, at no relevant time and in no stage of his \n     captivity, has been within its territorial jurisdiction. \n     Nothing in the text of the Constitution extends such a right, \n     nor does anything in our statutes.\n\n  Not only has this always been the law, but it should remain so. \nEisentrager explains rather clearly and eloquently why we do not let \nenemy combatants sue our soldiers in our courts:\n\n       A basic consideration in habeas corpus practice is that the \n     prisoner will be produced before the court. This is the crux \n     of the statutory scheme established by the Congress; indeed, \n     it is inherent in the very term ``habeas corpus.'' And though \n     production of the prisoner may be dispensed with where it \n     appears on the face of the application that no cause for \n     granting the writ exists, Walker v. Johnston, we have \n     consistently adhered to and recognized the general rule. \n     Ahrens v. Clark. To grant the writ to these prisoners might \n     mean that our army must transport them across the seas for \n     hearing. This would require allocation of shipping space, \n     guarding personnel, billeting and rations. It might also \n     require transportation for whatever witnesses the prisoners \n     desired to call as well as transportation for those necessary \n     to defend legality of the sentence. The writ, since it is \n     held to be a matter of right, would be equally available to \n     enemies during active hostilities as in the present twilight \n     between war and peace. Such trials would hamper the war \n     effort and bring aid and comfort to the enemy. They would \n     diminish the prestige of our commanders, not only with \n     enemies but with wavering neutrals. It would be difficult to \n     devise more effective fettering of a field commander than to \n     allow the very enemies he is ordered to reduce to submission \n     to call him to account in his own civil courts and divert his \n     efforts and attention from the military offensive abroad to \n     the legal defensive at home. Nor is it unlikely that the \n     result of such enemy litigiousness would be a conflict \n     between judicial and military opinion highly comforting to \n     enemies of the United States.\n\n  Other authorities also have emphasized that the Anglo-American common \nlaw tradition includes no place for habeas petitions filed by enemy \naliens in military custody outside our territory. Law Professor Peter \nLushing, in an internet posting commenting on the Graham amendment \nshortly after it passed the Senate, put the matter quite colorfully: \n``the guys in the powdered wigs would have flipped over the idea that \nhabeas extends to foreigners we are in combat with who have been \ncaptured and are being held by us abroad.'' He concludes: ``the Rasul \ndecision has extended habeas far beyond what anybody alive during the \nratification of the Constitution would have envisioned.''\n  Former U.S. Attorney General William Barr testified on the subject of \ndetainees in the war on terror before the Senate Judiciary Committee on \nJune 15 of this year. His testimony made a considerable impact on \nmembers of the committee--it persuaded several of us that something \nneeded to be done legislatively to correct the current situation. Here \nis what Attorney General Barr had to say about the history of habeas \nand detainees:\n\n       The determination that a particular foreign person seized \n     on the battlefield is an enemy combatant has always been \n     recognized as a matter committed to the sound judgment of the \n     Commander in Chief and his military forces. There has never \n     been a requirement that our military engage in evidentiary \n     proceedings to establish that each individual captured is, in \n     fact, an enemy combatant.\n\n  Attorney General Barr went on to note:\n\n       World War II provides a dramatic example. During that war, \n     we held hundreds of thousands of German and Italian prisoners \n     in detention camps within the United States. These foreign \n     prisoners were not charged with anything; they were not \n     entitled to lawyers; they were not given access to U.S. \n     courts; and the American military was not required to engage \n     in evidentiary proceedings to establish that each was a \n     combatant.\n\n  The concerns that were expressed in the passage from Eisentrager that \nI quoted earlier also have been expressed by other, more recent \ncommentators, with the present conflict against Islamic extremism in \nmind. For example, in a 2003 article in George Washington Law Review, \nlaw professor John C. Yoo notes the special importance of \n``interrogating enemy combatants for information about coming attacks'' \nin this conflict, and concludes:\n\n     . . . de novo judicial review threatens to undermine the very \n     effectiveness of the military effort against al-Qaeda. A \n     habeas proceeding could become a forum for recalling \n     commanders and intelligence operatives from the field into \n     open court; disrupting overt and covert operations; revealing \n     successful military tactics and methods; and forcing the \n     military to shape its activities to the demands of the \n     judicial process.\n\n  Similarly, Andrew McCarthy, a former federal prosecutor who led the \ncase against Sheik Omar Abdel Rahman, offered a stinging criticism of \nRasual the day after the Supreme Court issued its opinion. He stated \nthat:\n\n       How can it conceivably be appropriate to impose on our \n     soldiers the burdens of stopping to collect evidence and \n     write incident reports in the middle of fighting a war? Of \n     course they do a measure of that now--after all, it is much \n     in their interest correctly to sort out whom to hold and whom \n     to release. But, until now, that has certainly not been done \n     with the rigor anticipation of litigation will doubtless \n     produce. It is not enough to say, hopefully, that U.S. courts \n     will be indulgent given what's involved. Empirically, \n     judicial demands on governmental procedural compliance become \n     steadily more demanding over time, and government naturally \n     responds by being even more internally exacting to avoid \n     problems. In no time flat, what was once thought a trifling \n     inconvenience becomes a major expenditure--in this case one \n     that will inevitably detract from the military mission which \n     is the bedrock of our safety.\n\n  McCarthy also summarized why the Rasul decision is at war with the \nrole and duties of the Federal judiciary in our constitutional \nframework:\n\n       In the Framers' ingenious construct, the courts of the \n     United States are supposed to be a bulwark protecting members \n     of the uniquely American community--i.e., citizens of the \n     United States and those aliens who, by their lawful \n     participation in our national life, have immersed themselves \n     into the fabric of American society--from the excesses of an \n     oppressive executive or a legislature insufficiently heedful \n     of their fundamental rights. It is the institution that \n     ensures the law and order a free people must have in order to \n     thrive.\n       Nevertheless, as manifested in Rasul, yesterday's case \n     involving claims of foreign enemy combatants captured on \n     faraway battlefields and held by the military in Guantanamo \n     Bay, Cuba--an installation outside the jurisdiction of any \n     U.S. court--the judiciary is no longer a neutral arbiter \n     there to ensure that Americans get a fair shake from their \n     government and its laws. Instead, it is evolving, or \n     morphing, into a sort of United Nations with teeth. It has \n     seized the mantle of international arbiter, ensuring that the \n     world--including that part of it energetically trying to kill \n     Americans--has a forum in which to press its case against the \n     United States.\n\n  McCarthy went on to conclude: ``Rasul is a dangerous decision. \nCongress should slam the door on al-Qaeda today.''\n  And again, former Attorney General Barr also commented on this same \nquestion--on the impracticality of applying judicial process and \nstandards to questions of the detention of enemy combatants. Because of \nhis authority and the force of his arguments, I quote from his June 15 \ntestimony at length:\n\n       There appear to be courts and critics who continue to claim \n     that the Due Process Clause applies and that the CSRT process \n     does not go far enough. I believe these assertions are \n     frivolous.\n       I am aware of no legal precedent that supports the \n     proposition that foreign persons confronted by U.S. troops in \n     the zone of battle have Fifth Amendment rights that they can \n     assert against the American troops. On the contrary, there \n     are at least three reasons why the Fifth Amendment has no \n     applicability to such a situation. First, as the Supreme \n     Court has consistently held, the Fifth Amendment does not \n     have extra-territorial application to foreign persons outside \n     the United States. As Justice Kennedy has observed, ``[T]he \n     Constitution does not create, nor do general principles of \n     law create, any juridical relation between our country and \n     some undefined, limitless class of non-citizens who are \n     beyond our territory.'' Moreover, as far as I am aware, prior \n     to their capture, none of the detainees had taken any \n     voluntary act to place themselves under the protection of our \n     laws; their only connection with the United States is that \n     they confronted U.S. troops on the battlefield. And finally, \n     the nature of the power being used against these individuals \n     is not the domestic law enforcement power--we are not seeking \n     to subject these individuals to the obligations and sanctions \n     of our domestic laws--rather, we are waging war against them \n     as foreign enemies, a context in which the concept of Due \n     Process is inapposite.\n       In society today, we see a tendency to impose the judicial \n     model on virtually every field of decision-making. The notion \n     is that the propriety of any decision can be judged by \n     determining whether it satisfies some objective standard of \n     proof and that such a judgment must be made by a ``neutral'' \n     arbiter based on an adversarial evidentiary hearing. What we \n     are seeing today is an extreme manifestation of this--an \n     effort to take the judicial rules and standard applicable in \n     the domestic law enforcement context and extend them to the \n     fighting of wars. In my view, nothing could be more farcical, \n     or more dangerous.\n\n[[Page S14266]]\n\n       These efforts flow from a fundamental error--confusion \n     between two very distinct constitutional realms. In the \n     domestic realm of law enforcement, the government's role is \n     disciplinary--sanctioning an errant member of society for \n     transgressing the internal rules of the body politic. The \n     Framers recognized that in the name of maintaining domestic \n     tranquility an overzealous government could oppress the very \n     body politic it is meant to protect. The government itself \n     could become an oppressor of ``the people.''\n       Thus our Constitution makes the fundamental decision to \n     sacrifice efficiency in the realm of law enforcement by \n     guaranteeing that no punishment can be meted out in the \n     absence of virtual certainty of individual guilt. Both the \n     original Constitution and the Bill of Rights contain a number \n     of specific constraints on the Executive's law enforcement \n     powers, many of which expressly provide for a judicial role \n     as a neutral arbiter or ``check'' on executive power. In this \n     realm, the Executive's subjective judgments are irrelevant; \n     it must gather and present objective evidence of guilt \n     satisfying specific constitutional standards at each stage of \n     a criminal proceeding. The underlying premise in this realm \n     is that it is better for society to suffer the cost of the \n     guilty going free than mistakenly to deprive an innocent \n     person of life or liberty.\n       The situation is entirely different in armed conflict where \n     the entire nation faces an external threat. In armed \n     conflict, the body politic is not using its domestic \n     disciplinary powers to sanction an errant member, rather it \n     is exercising its national defense powers to neutralize the \n     external threat and preserve the very foundation of all our \n     civil liberties. Here the Constitution is not concerned with \n     handicapping the government to preserve other values. Rather \n     it is designed to maximize the government's efficiency to \n     achieve victory--even at the cost of ``collateral damage'' \n     that would be unacceptable in the domestic realm.\n\n  Attorney General Barr brought these concerns into relief with the \nfollowing hypothetical example:\n\n       Let me posit a battlefield scenario. American troops are \n     pinned down by sniper fire from a village. As the troops \n     advance, they see two men running from a building from which \n     the troops believe they had received sniper fire. The troops \n     believe they are probably a sniper team. Is it really being \n     suggested that the Constitution vests these men with due \n     process rights as against the American soldiers? When do \n     these rights arise? If the troops shoot and kill them--i.e., \n     deprive them of life--could it be a violation of due process? \n     Suppose they are wounded and it turns out they were not enemy \n     forces. Does this give rise to Bivens' Constitutional tort \n     actions for violation of due process? Alternatively, suppose \n     the fleeing men are captured and held as enemy combatants. \n     Does the due process clause really mean that they have to be \n     released unless the military can prove they were enemy \n     combatants? Does the Due Process Clause mean that the \n     American military must divert its energies and resources from \n     fighting the war and dedicate them to investigating the \n     claims of innocence of these two men?\n       This illustrates why military decisions are not susceptible \n     to judicial administration and supervision. There are simply \n     no judicially-manageable standards to either govern or \n     evaluate military operational judgments. Such decisions \n     inevitably involve the weighing of risks. One can easily \n     imagine situations in which there is an appreciable risk that \n     someone is an enemy combatant, but significant uncertainty \n     and not a preponderance of evidence. Nevertheless, the \n     circumstances may be such that the President makes a judgment \n     that prudence dictates treating such a person as hostile in \n     order to avoid an unacceptable risk to our military \n     operations. By their nature, these military judgments must \n     rest upon a broad range of information, opinion, prediction, \n     and even surmise. The President's assessment may include \n     reports from his military and diplomatic advisors, field \n     commanders, intelligence sources, or sometimes just the \n     opinion of frontline troops. He must decide what weight to \n     give each of these sources. He must evaluate risks in light \n     of the present state of the conflict and the overall military \n     and political objectives of the campaign.\n\n  Attorney General Barr goes on to consider the practical consequences \nof applying civilian due process concepts in the context of military \ndetention of enemy combatants:\n\n       The imposition of such procedures would fundamentally alter \n     the character and mission of our combat troops. To the extent \n     that the decisions to detain persons as enemy combatants are \n     based in part on the circumstances of the initial encounter \n     on the battlefield, our frontline troops will have to concern \n     themselves with developing and preserving evidence as to each \n     individual they capture, at the same time as they confront \n     enemy forces in the field. They would be diverted from their \n     primary mission--the rapid destruction of the enemy by all \n     means at their disposal--to taking notes on the conduct of \n     particular individuals in the field of battle. Like \n     policeman, they would also face the prospect of removal from \n     the battlefield to give evidence at post-hoc proceedings.\n       Nor would the harm stop there. Under this due process \n     theory, the military would have to take on the further burden \n     of detailed investigation of detainees' factual claims once \n     they are taken to the rear. Again, this would radically \n     change the nature of the military enterprise. To establish \n     the capacity to conduct individualized investigations and \n     adversarial hearings as to every detained combatant would \n     make the conduct of war--especially irregular warfare--vastly \n     more cumbersome and expensive. For every platoon of combat \n     troops, the United States would have to field three platoons \n     of lawyers, investigators, and paralegals. Such a result \n     would inject legal uncertainty into our military operations, \n     divert resources from winning the war into demonstrating the \n     individual ``fault'' of persons confronted in the field of \n     battle, and thereby uniquely disadvantage our military vis-a-\n     vis every other fighting force in the world.\n       Second, the introduction of an ultimate decision maker \n     outside of the normal chain of command, or altogether outside \n     the Executive Branch, would disrupt the unitary chain of \n     command and undermine the confidence of frontline troops in \n     their superior officers. The impartial tribunals could \n     literally overrule command decisions regarding battlefield \n     tactics and set free prisoners of war whom American soldiers \n     have risked or given their lives to capture. The effect of \n     such a prospect on military discipline and morale is \n     impossible to predict.\n\n  Attorney General Barr also noted that ``Supreme Court's decision in \nRasul was a statutory ruling, not a constitutional one.'' He went on to \npoint out:\n\n       An important consequence follows: Congress remains free to \n     restrict or even to eliminate entirely the ability of enemy \n     aliens at Guantanamo Bay to file habeas petitions. Congress \n     could consider enacting legislation that does so--either by \n     creating special procedural rules for enemy alien detainees, \n     by requiring any such habeas petitions to be filed in a \n     particular court, or by prohibiting enemy aliens from hauling \n     military officials into court altogether.\n\n  Obviously, the Congress has taken the former Attorney General up on \nhis suggestion, particularly the third variation of it.\n  I should also say a few words about military commissions. The \nJudiciary Committee also heard enlightening testimony on the history of \nthese commissions. Former Attorney General Barr commented on them as \nfollows:\n\n       Throughout our history we have used military tribunals to \n     try enemy forces accused of engaging in war crimes. Shortly \n     after the attacks of 9/11, the President established military \n     commissions to address war crimes committed by members of al-\n     Qaeda and their Taliban supporters.\n       Again, our experience in World War II provides a useful \n     analog. While the vast majority of Axis prisoners were simply \n     held as enemy combatants, military commissions were convened \n     at various times during the war, and in its immediate \n     aftermath, to try particular Axis prisoners for war crimes. \n     One notorious example was the massacre of American troops at \n     Malmedy during the Battle of the Bulge. The German troops \n     responsible for these violations were tried before military \n     commissions.\n\n  As an aside, those disturbed by the tendency of some in the press and \npolitics to take the side of the Guantanamo detainees--of those \ncaptured while at war with America--might find it interesting that the \nsame phenomenon developed with regard to the Malmedy detainees. The \nMalmedy German soldiers were tried and convicted of massacring American \nPOWs near the Belgian village of Malmedy during the Battle of the \nBulge. This crime unquestionably occurred--the bodies of over 80 U.S. \nsoldiers were recovered in a field, most of them shot in the head. \nMembers of the German unit responsible for this crime later were \ncaptured and tried by a military commission. Over the years, these Nazi \nsoldiers, at least some of whom unquestionably massacred American \nG.I.s, somehow managed to turn the tables on the U.S. military in the \npress and in political circles. Senator Joseph McCarthy took up their \ncause, as did other Senators. The most fanciful allegations of abuse \nmade by these Nazi murderers were indulged by various prominent \nAmericans, and the whole incident became a public relations \nembarrassment for the U.S. military. Eventually, this pressure campaign \nsucceeded in winning the commutation of all death sentences given to \nthe Malmedy killers, and all of the German soldiers involved--even \ntheir commander--were released from prison by the mid-1950s. For those \nwho find it disturbing that the sympathies of the press (especially in \nEurope) and of various intellectuals have been misplaced on the side of \nthe Guantanamo detainees, at least we can take comfort in the fact the \nperversions of truth and rank miscarriages of justice that have\n\n[[Page S14267]]\n\nresulted from such misplaced sympathy so far in this war pale in \ncomparison to those that followed from Malmedy.\n  Perhaps first among those who would object to any sympathizing with \nthe Guantanamo detainees would be Andrew McCarthy, the former Federal \nantiterror prosecutor. He has written often on this and other war-on-\nterror topics. I was pleased to see that shortly after the Graham/Kyl \namendment first passed the Senate, he wrote a column for National \nReview Online lauding our efforts. It was titled ``Restoring Law and \nOrder,'' and McCarthy's only complaint was that ``it has taken our \nnational legislature nearly a year-and-a-half--during all of which we \nhave been at war--to stir itself to address this serious national-\nsecurity problem.'' So you can imagine my disappointment when, just two \ndays later, Mr. McCarthy posted another column commenting on the final \nSenate language, which include some compromises to ensure bipartisan \nsupport. This column was titled ``Snatching Defeat from the Jaws of \nVictory.'' Some of its language I won't recite here. But its specific \ncomplaints bear scrutiny. Mr. McCarthy alleged that ``the senators \nresolved Tuesday that the ultimate decision about who is properly \nconsidered an `enemy combatant,' should rest with federal judges, not \nour military commanders.'' As he characterized the final Senate \nlanguage, ``a panel of robed lawyers will second-guess the \ndetermination of [our soldiers'] commanders on scene that certain \ncaptives warranted detention--that holding them would be beneficial to \nthe war effort.'' Similarly, with regard to military commissions, Mr. \nMcCarthy complained that ``everything that happens in the commission \nwould be reviewed by judges if this measure passes.''\n\n  I do not think that these words are an accurate characterization of \nthe Senate-passed language. I think that Mr. McCarthy probably relied \non inaccurate characterizations of the language that were published in \nthe press at the time rather than on the language itself. Nevertheless, \nMr. McCarthy's complaints did cause me and others to take another look \nat the language, to make sure that it does what we intended.\n  Limited judicial review of the decisions of the CSRTs and military \ncommissions is authorized by paragraphs 2 and 3 of subsection 1405(e) \nof the conference report. These paragraphs authorize the same two \nnarrow judicial inquiries into the ``status determinations'' and \n``final decisions'' of the CSRTs and military commissions. The \ndifference in language here is not intended to connote any substantive \ndifference in the scope of review--it simply attempts to accurately \ncharacterize the work of each entity: ``making status determinations'' \nfor the CSRTs, and ``reaching final decisions'' for the military \ncommissions.\n  The review authorized by each of these paragraphs goes only to the \nfollowing questions: did the CSRTs and commissions use the standards \nand procedures identified by the Secretary of Defense, and is the use \nof these systems to either continue the detention of enemy combatants \nor try them for war crimes consistent with the Constitution and Federal \nlaw? The first inquiry I think is straightforward: did the military \nfollow its own rules? This inquiry does not ask whether the military \nreached the correct result by applying its rules, or even whether those \nrules were properly applied to the facts. The inquiry is simply whether \nthe right rule was employed.\n  As to the second inquiry, here the language has been further modified \nin order to make clear the narrow scope of the inquiry. The original \nSenate language spoke of whether ``subjecting'' an enemy combatant to \nthe CSRT or commission systems was constitutional and legal. This \nformulation was somewhat illogical in that the detainee would not \ncomplain of the fact that he was forced to go through a CSRT--rather, \nhe would want to challenge its adequacy as a means for justifying his \ncontinued detention. And in any event, our concern was to make clear \nthat this language in no way invites a re-evaluation of the correctness \nof the military's decision, even under a deferential standard of \nreview. Nor does it invite an as-applied challenge. All that this \nlanguage asks is whether using these systems is good enough for the \nends that they serve--to justify continued detention or to try an enemy \ncombatant for war crimes. The only thing that this provision authorizes \nis, in effect, a facial challenge. In fact, we anticipate that once the \nDistrict of Columbia Circuit decides these questions in one case, at \nleast so long as military orders do not substantially change, that \ndecision will operate as circuit precedent in all future cases, with no \nneed to relitigate this second inquiry in the future. In effect, the \nsecond inquiry--into the constitutionality and lawfulness of the use of \nCSRTs and commissions--need only be decided once by the court.\n  It bears quoting some of the thinking that undergirds the \nestablishment of these review standards. Attorney General Barr, in his \nJune 5 testimony before the Judiciary Committee, describes the \nphilosophy and approach that paragraph 2's scope of review for CSRTs is \ndesigned to reflect:\n\n       It seems to me that the kinds of military decisions at \n     issue here--namely, what and who poses a threat to our \n     military operations--are quintessentially Executive in \n     nature. They are not amenable to the type of process we \n     employ in the domestic law enforcement arena. They cannot be \n     reduced to neat legal formulas, purely objective tests and \n     evidentiary standards. They necessarily require the exercise \n     of prudential judgment and the weighing of risks. This is one \n     of the reasons why the Constitution vests ultimate military \n     decision-making in the President as Commander-in-Chief. If \n     the concept of Commander-in-Chief means anything, it must \n     mean that the office holds the final authority to direct how, \n     and against whom, military power is to be applied to achieve \n     the military and political objectives of the campaign.\n       I am not speaking here of ``deference'' to Presidential \n     decisions. In some contexts, courts are fond of saying that \n     they ``owe deference'' to some Executive decisions. But this \n     suggests that the court has the ultimate decision-making \n     authority and is only giving weight to the judgment of the \n     Executive. This is not a question of deference--the point \n     here is that the ultimate substantive decision rests with the \n     President and that courts have no authority to substitute \n     their judgments for that of the President.\n\n  And the thinking that underlies paragraph 3's scope of review for \nmilitary-commission decisions is well articulated in Johnson v. \nEisentrager:\n\n       It is not for us to say whether these prisoners were or \n     were not guilty of a war crime, or whether if we were to \n     retry the case we would agree to the findings of fact or the \n     application of the laws of war made by the Military \n     Commission. The petition shows that these prisoners were \n     formally accused of violating the laws of war and fully \n     informed of particulars of these charges. As we observed in \n     the Yamashita case, ``If the military tribunals have lawful \n     authority to hear, decide and condemn, their action is not \n     subject to judicial review merely because they have made a \n     wrong decision on disputed facts. Correction of their errors \n     of decision is not for the courts but for the military \n     authorities which are alone authorized to review their \n     decisions.'' ``We consider here only the lawful power of the \n     commission to try the petitioner for the offense charged.\n\n  There is another matter that I should mention before I yield the \nfloor to my colleague from South Carolina. Some have asked why the \njurisdiction-removing language in the bill is limited to Guantanamo. \nThe answer is that Rasul is only about Guantanamo. Although the opinion \ncontains the discussion of Ahrens and Braden that undercuts the \n``territorial-jurisdiction'' rule for habeas courts, in the end the \ndecision appears to be based on the unique status of the naval station \nat Guantanamo Bay--the permanent nature of the lease, for example, \nwhich can only be terminated by the United States. Justice Kennedy \nadopted a similar focus in his concurring opinion. I believe that \nJustice Kennedy's concurrence goes so far as to declare that Guantanamo \nis in practical respects a U.S. territory.\n  Some have raised the concern that the logic of Rasul will be extended \nto U.S. military and intelligence detention facilities in Iraq or \nAfghanistan. I think that such an extension would be very foolish and I \ndo not think that the court will go there. I do not think that the \nSupreme Court is going to declare parts of Afghanistan or Iraq to be \nthe territory of the United States. If the court does do so, we can of \ncourse legislatively overrule it, as we legislatively overrule Rasul \ntoday. But I do not think that it is either necessary, or respectful of \nthe court's capacity for common sense, to preemptively overrule such an \noutlandish hypothetical decision. Does the Senator from South Carolina \nagree?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Yes, my friend from Arizona is correct, our language \napplies only to Guantanamo just because\n\n[[Page S14268]]\n\nwe understand that the Supreme Court only extended the jurisdiction of \nthe courts over the detainees held at Guantanamo. And since the Rasul \ndecision was based on the habeas statute in the U.S. Code, I am very \ncomfortable amending that statute as a proper congressional response to \nthe Court's decision.\n  As I stated repeatedly to a number of my colleagues, we did not want \nto deprive the courts of jurisdiction to hear cases filed on behalf of \ndetainees in Iraq because we are confident that, as the law stands now, \nthose cases are already barred by previous Supreme Court decisions, \nwhich the Rasul decision left in place.\n  We should always be careful when dealing with our co-equal branches. \nJust as we do not appreciate it when they stray into our areas of \nconstitutional responsibility, we should always be willing to refrain \nfrom straying into theirs unnecessarily. As I read the Rasul decision, \nthese other cases from other parts of the world are still subject to \nthe Eisentrager opinion and will not be considered by U.S. courts.\n  And so, our language is limited to Guantanamo. To my friends who \ncounseled that we should extend our jurisdiction modification to those \ncases being filed on behalf of Iraqis held in accordance with the \nGeneva Convention, I would just counsel them to be patient. I cannot \nimagine the Court extending its jurisdiction halfway around the world \nto involve what is almost exclusively an executive branch function. \nHowever, should that become necessary, I am perfectly willing to modify \nour courts' jurisdiction again to ensure that does not happen. But \nagain, in truth, especially after our very robust action here today, I \ncannot even conceive of such a decision by the Supreme Court.\n  Mr. KYL. Well, that is what I thought before Rasul was decided. But \nwe can cross that bridge if we get to it.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I would also like my esteemed colleague \nfrom Arizona, Senator Kyl, to address the misunderstandings that seem \nto have made their way into the press. For instance, when I returned \nfrom Iraq this morning, I was surprised to see the New York Times \neditorial page making some fundamental mistakes about what our \nlegislation does.\n\n  Mr. President, I would also request unanimous consent to have the New \nYork Times editorial entitled Ban Torture. Period. from December 16, \n2005 entered in the Record.\n  The first sentence reads, ``It should have been unmitigated good news \nwhen President Bush finally announced yesterday that he would back \nSenator John McCain's proposal to ban torture and ``cruel, inhuman or \ndegrading'' treatment at United States prison camps. Nothing should be \nmore obvious for an American president than to support a ban on \ntorture.'' I agree, nothing should be more obvious. And I'd like to \napplaud the New York Times for finally endorsing the actions President \nReagan took when we signed the Convention Against Torture on April 18, \n1988, and the Senate ratified the Convention on October 21, 1994.\n  But since they appear to be laboring under some confusion, I would \nlike to clarify how and when our antitorture statutes apply. First, \ntorture has been illegal for quite some time. Indeed, Section 2340A of \nTitle 18 of the United States Code specifically provides for the \nprosecution of people who torture overseas. And most of the techniques \nof torture, beatings, improper imprisonment, and threats have long been \npart of the criminal code of the United States.\n  I strongly supported Senator McCain's amendment each and every time \nit came up. I am extremely pleased it passed. But, make no mistake, it \ndoes not make torture illegal. Torture has long been illegal. What the \nMcCain language does is make a very clear statement that we will treat \npeople humanely while we have them in our custody. The McCain amendment \nis a very clear policy statement that is in accord with the best of \nAmerican tradition. But it does not ban torture. Accordingly, the \nGraham-Levin-Kyl provisions do not equivocate in any way regarding \ntorture. The Times editors, regrettably, for I appreciate the place the \nTimes holds in our public discourse, do not appear to understand what \nthey are talking about.\n  I would like to address one other statement the Times makes. They \nstate, and I quote, that ``What is at stake here, and so harmful to \nAmerica's reputation, is the routine mistreatment of prisoners swept up \nin the so-called war on terror.'' Now I take great exception to this \nbaseless smear of our soldiers and marines. It is said off-handedly, \nalmost as if everyone takes it for granted that the fine men and women \nof our armed services routinely mistreat our prisoners.\n  Well I will tell you, I for one don't take it for granted that the \nfine people who are putting their lives on the line to protect our \nNation routinely mistreat the prisoners in their care. I believe they \nfollow the orders that their superiors give them, orders based on such \npolicy statements as Senator McCain's or the Army Field Manual, and \nthey follow them to the best of their ability.\n  Now, are there going to be bad apples? As a former JAG prosecutor and \ndefense counsel, I can tell you affirmatively, yes, there will be. And \nthey will be arrested, tried, convicted, and will serve long sentences. \nThose few individuals who do not live up to the high standards of the \nvast majority of our honorable service members, will be held \naccountable for their actions.\n  Our troops do not deserve such a slander, and I call on the New York \nTimes to take back the vile assertion they have made against the people \nwho exemplify the best our Nation has to offer.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I see that we are nearing the end of our \nallotted time. If I could quickly address a few other minor issues and \nsummarize briefly. It is important to note that the limited judicial \nreview authorized by paragraphs 2 and 3 of subsection (e) are not \nhabeas-corpus review. It is a limited judicial review of its own \nnature. All habeas actions are terminated by this bill. I hope that \nthis change will also put to rest any arguments that extending habeas \nto prisoners also extends to them some type of substantive rights. I do \nnot believe that supposition is correct because habeas is a vehicle for \nasserting rights, not a source of rights. The fact that an individual \nhas access to habeas does not mean that he has any of the rights that \nhe asserts. But in any event, because this bill leaves no habeas in \nplace, that debate need not be rejoined.\n  Also, some have suggested that by vesting exclusive jurisdiction in \nthe DC circuit for the paragraph 2 and 3 appeals, this bill bars even \nSupreme Court appellate review. That was not the drafters' intention, \nnor do I believe that it is a correct reading of the legislative \nlanguage. Supreme Court review is implicit, or rather, authorized \nelsewhere in statute, for all judicial decisions. It is rarely \nmentioned expressly. In fact, when it is mentioned, it is sometimes to \npreempt Supreme Court review. Far example, the limit on successive \nfederal habeas petitions for state prisoners in section 2244 bars \npetitions for certiorari following a three-judge panel's decision on a \nsuccessive-petition application. The clear implication of these \nprovisions is that Supreme Court review is implicitly allowed except \nwhere expressly barred, and thus since it is not barred here, it is \nallowed.\n\n\n            uniform standards of interrogation for detainees\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. I would like to thank the chairman and the ranking member \nfor their untiring work to bring the Defense authorization bill to \nclosure. In doing so, Congress takes a major step in ensuring that \nAmerica stays true to its fundamental values. By establishing uniform \nstandards for the interrogation of Department of Defense detainees, and \nby ensuring that the United States will not subject any individual to \ncruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, we are better able \nto wage and win the war on terror. This would not have been possible \nwithout the work of the chairman, the ranking member, and other members \nof this committee, including most notably the Senator from South \nCarolina.\n  I would also like to thank the President and the national security \nadvisor for their efforts in resolving the difficult issues underlying \nthe amendment. In reaching agreement, we make sure that the world knows \nthat the United States does not--and by law cannot engage in torture or \ncruel, inhuman or degrading treatment. During our talks, the \nadministration raised legitimate concerns about legal claims\n\n[[Page S14269]]\n\nfacing civilian interrogators. Based on these concerns, the bill \nincludes language that will allow accused civilian interrogators--like \nmilitary interrogators--a robust defense if a person of ordinary sense \nand understanding would have believed he was following a lawful \ndirective. It further includes language providing legal counsel to \ninterrogators. These provisions are modeled on provisions drawn from \nthe Uniform Code of Military Justice.\n  With the detainee treatment provisions, Congress has clearly spoken \nthat the prohibition against torture and other cruel, inhuman or \ndegrading treatment should be enforced and that anyone engaging in or \nauthorizing such conduct, whether at home or overseas, is violating the \nlaw. Sections 1402 and 1403 of Title XIV of this bill do not create a \nnew private right ot action. At the same time, these provisions do not \neliminate or diminish any private right of action otherwise available. \nIt is our intent not to disable that in any way.\n  Mr. WARNER. To have worked from the beginning with Senator McCain \nthen with Senators Graham, Levin and Kyl was a privilege, and, to \nachieve legislation which was needed for all our Nation's citizens was \na humble, but very fulfilling, experience. We realized both the \nnecessity for action in this area and the vital importance of dealing \nwith the increasing flow of litigation involving Guantanamo detainees.\n  This legislative history should document that the McCain provisions, \nsections 1402 and 1403 of the bill, do not create a private right of \naction. Title XIV of the bill does provide a new affirmative defense \nthat may be applied to civil actions brought under other statutes and \nto criminal prosecutions. This is essential to give potential \ndefendants fair rights to defend themselves. Further, language was \nincluded affording the same right to counsel and to payment of \nlitigation costs at Government expense for non-military personnel, in \nboth foreign and domestic courts, that is presently extended to members \nof the Armed Forces.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I am pleased that the conference report contains the full \ntext of the McCain amendment on torture, without change. This language \nfirmly establishes in law that the United States will not subject any \nindividual in our custody, regardless of nationality or physical \nlocation, to cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment. The \namendment provides a single standard--for ``cruel, inhuman, or \ndegrading treatment or punishment''--without regard to what agency \nholds a detainee, what the nationality of the detainee is, or where the \ndetainee is held.\n  It has never been my understanding that the McCain amendment would, \nby itself, create a private right of action. I do not believe that the \namendment was intended either to create such a private right of action, \nor to eliminate--or undercut any private right of action such as a \nclaim under the Alien Tort Statute--that is otherwise available to an \nalien detainee. Rather, the McCain amendment would establish a legal \nstandard applicable to any criminal prosecution or any private right of \naction that is otherwise available under law. That would not be changed \nin any way by the affirmative defense added in the new section.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I was pleased to support this legislation and work toward \nits enactment from the beginning. Under section 1402, our troops now \nhave one standard--the Army Field Manual--for their interrogations. In \nsection 1403, we close the loophole in the United Nations Convention \nAgainst Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or \nPunishment. As National Security Advisor Stephen Hadley said, ``those \nstandards, as a technical, legal matter, did not apply abroad. And that \nis what Senator McCain, in the second section of his legislation, \nwanted to address--wanted to make clear that those would apply abroad. \nWe applied them abroad as a matter of policy; he wanted to make sure \nthey applied as a matter of law. And when this legislation is adopted, \nit will.'' I agree that these sections do not create a new private \nright of action, but that they are binding on the executive and may be \napplicable to actions brought under other statutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have a letter \nfrom Mr. Ed Tong printed in the Record for the consideration of the \nfiscal year 2006 Defense Authorization Act. The letter reflects the \nview of a supporter of the minority small business contracting program, \nwhich is reauthorized in this bill.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                   ASIAN, Inc.\n\n                             San Francisco, CA, December 19, 2005.\n     Hon. Edward M. Kennedy,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kennedy: I write to urge you to support the \n     reauthorization of the Department of Defense 1207 program. \n     The program has been repeatedly reauthorized since its \n     original enactment, and it remains necessary today. \n     Minorities have historically been disadvantaged with regard \n     to the awarding of federal, state and municipal contracts. \n     The impact of such discrimination and exclusion has been \n     especially felt in Northern California--and specifically \n     within the San Francisco Bay area.\n       The 1992 Minority Business Census of the U.S. Census Bureau \n     reported that San Francisco has over 16,353 minority-owned \n     businesses operating in the area. That statistic makes San \n     Francisco the fourth largest business locale in the country \n     for minority-owned businesses. Despite the large number of \n     minority-owned business, discriminatory and harassing \n     treatment is commonly experienced.\n       Specifically, Asian American construction firms in San \n     Francisco, have encountered discriminatory and harassing \n     treatment at the hands of the craft unions and city \n     government through the San Francisco's Office of Labor \n     Standards Enforcement (OLSE). OLSE was created in 2000, to \n     enforce the prevailing wages of crafts set by the state's \n     Department of Industrial Relations. In fact, OLSE has \n     differentially chosen to conduct its audits and impose higher \n     penalties against many of San Francisco's minority craft \n     businesses. At its inception of enforcement, the OLSE \n     specifically targeted Chinese businesses. The statistics at \n     that time showed that Chinese businesses had around a 5% \n     chance of obtaining a prime contract they bid on, but a 50% \n     probability of their project being inspected and audited by \n     the OLSE. At present, OLSE still disproportionately targets \n     minority businesses, whether they are union or non-unionized \n     construction companies. Left with no avenue through which to \n     remedy its grievances, many Asian American businesses have \n     turned to ASIAN, Inc. for assistance\n       In my role as ASIAN, Inc.'s Program Manager in our Business \n     & Economic Development Division, I have had personal \n     experience in speaking with Asian American businesses dealing \n     with discriminatory treatment. ASIAN, Inc. is a nonprofit \n     technical assistance and research organization that works to \n     strengthen the infrastructure of Asian American communities \n     in Northern California and to assist in their physical, \n     economic, and social development. ASIAN, Inc. has been in \n     operation for 34 years. Over the years, the organization has \n     helped over 500 disadvantaged businesses obtain business \n     loans through partnerships with the City of San Francisco's \n     Office of Community Development, the State of California, the \n     U.S. Department of Commerce Minority Business Development \n     Agency, the U.S. Small Business Administration, and many \n     banks and other private lenders. Still, discrimination \n     continues to pose barriers for many of the businesses with \n     which we work\n       Because ASIAN, Inc.'s role has been to provide strategic \n     information and technical assistance in order to promote the \n     ability of Asian Americans to compete in mainstream society--\n     including achieving success for their businesses and \n     participating in public decision-making--the organization has \n     been in a position to witness the experiences of Asian \n     American businesses in the San Francisco Bay Area.\n       Notably, several Asian American businesses came to ASIAN, \n     Inc. for assistance after the OLSE imposed significant \n     penalties upon their businesses, allowed those businesses no \n     opportunity to rectify any alleged violations prior to making \n     a finding, or to present their sides of the story. Initially \n     there was no appeals process built into the Ordinance. To the \n     presidents and owners of these businesses, it felt as if the \n     OLSE was targeting them because they were minority owned and \n     because of the ongoing disputes between Asian businesses and \n     the trade unions in the area. The targeting of Asian American \n     firms by OLSE for inspection and audits made obtaining \n     contracts difficult when it became known that a business was \n     being inspected by the OLSE.\n       ASIAN, Inc.'s work with the OLSE is by no means unique but \n     rather signifies merely one of many types of discrimination \n     experienced by the Asian American businesses that contact our \n     organization. In fact, the OLSE situation is quite emblematic \n     of the larger underlying problems that minority businesses \n     face. Discrimination is not limited to the local or municipal \n     level. Asian American businesses have experienced \n     discrimination in the awarding of local agency contracts, the \n     issuance of bonds and insurance policies, and the provision \n     of necessary materials and material quotes by suppliers.\n       For example, I personally have heard of complaints/\n     testimonials from minority businesses about:\n       The use of racial slurs or epithets against minority owners \n     or employees, One Asian\n\n[[Page S14270]]\n\n     firm owner used workers of Mexican ancestry on a job, and \n     other white subcontractors challenged him and asked ``Why are \n     your illegal workers on my job site.'' Also, an institution's \n     administrator might use the phrase ``Your kind are the \n     majority now.'' For another Asian American owner, when his \n     workers took items from the trash bins he was told to stop \n     his workers from doing so. As ``You may be a nice guy, but \n     you are not one of us.''\n       The exclusion of minority businesses from informal business \n     networks such as the Associated General Contractors. Or not \n     invited to go golfing with them, even when the other group \n     was looking for a foursome.\n       The refusal to use minority businesses on private jobs even \n     when they are used on government jobs where minority business \n     programs are in place. For example, Nibbi Brothers \n     Construction will use numerous minority firms when doing \n     public works projects (and the locale's program encourages \n     minority participation) but not ask them to bid on their \n     private works projects. This was also true for a general \n     contractor (SJ Amoroso) that uses minority firms in their \n     public works jobs but one white subcontractor almost \n     exclusively for their roofing work, in their private works \n     projects.\n       The existence of the old boys network to justify doing \n     business with one's own cronies. For example, with Asian \n     firms that have become prime contractors, white \n     subcontractors often won't bid for the subcontracting work, \n     or will hedge their bids and draw out the bidding process in \n     deciding whether they want to work with a minority prime \n     contractor\n       The non-enforcement of nondiscrimination requirements and \n     disparate treatment by government inspectors. For example, \n     when as the prime contractor and your project is audited, all \n     certified payrolls are asked of your minority subs, but your \n     white sub will not be asked to provide a certified payroll. \n     In another case with an institution in the City, the \n     inspector would not approve the work, and make additional \n     demands that were not put it in writing. For example, he \n     demand that a electrical panel be explosion proof though it \n     was not required by the specs. He also demanded that \n     materials be UL (Underwriters Laboratories) listed although \n     the specs did not require it. Also, when the Asian prime \n     contractor reported the error of his white subcontractor to \n     the engineer, he was told that this was not acceptable. \n     However, when the white subcontractor reported his error to \n     the white engineer the error was allowed to stand without \n     correction.\n       The bundling of contracts which minority businesses could \n     bid for if not for bundling. For example, when work is \n     required for a number of school sites, a number of 3-4 \n     schools may be bundled even when the type of work in each \n     school is different. This will bring the total project and \n     bonding requirements to $10 million dollar when without \n     bundling the individual projects would cost about $2-3 \n     million dollars.\n       The tendency to pay minority contractors slower or not at \n     all compared to white contractors. For example, San Francisco \n     city departments and institutions have a poor reputation for \n     paying in a timely manner and so the cumulative debt on a \n     number of projects/contracts owed to Asian businesses has \n     been in excess of $1 million dollars.\n       The provision of different quotes from suppliers to \n     companies depending upon the race of the business owner, or \n     to provide those supplies at an exorbitant rate to a minority \n     contractor.\n       The refusal to provide higher capacity bonds.\n       Our nation's small businesses are the backbone of this \n     country's economy and the obstacles that impede the successes \n     of U.S. businesses have enormous impact on the local \n     economies these businesses support as well as the nation at \n     large. This is especially true for minority-owned businesses \n     that not only contribute to the country's economic base but \n     have also traditionally provided jobs for minority youth and \n     adults in ways that majority-owned business have not. As \n     such, removing obstacles facing minority businesses is \n     critical not only for our economy but for our nation's \n     minority youth.\n       Minority contractors have a right to expect unbiased \n     treatment in the awarding of contracts. The 1207 Program is a \n     valuable means by which the federal government demonstrates \n     fairness and equity in the area of government contracts. It \n     is vitally important that the federal government recognizes \n     and rectifies some of the problems faced by minority \n     businesses across the country. The government's commitment to \n     equality in the economic marketplace is an ongoing \n     responsibility of our government, and the reauthorization of \n     1207 not only is in keeping with the spirit of that \n     commitment but provides leadership by example to local \n     government, banks, customers and suppliers that interact with \n     minority-owned businesses.\n           Respectfully submitted,\n\n                                               Edmund Y. Tong,\n\n                                       Program Manager, Business &\n                                    Economic Development Division.\n\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, the Senate is considering today the \nDepartment of Defense authorization conference report for the 2006 \nfiscal year. As a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, I have \nattended numerous hearings and participated in the markup of this \nlegislation. And I want to commend the Chairman of the Senate Armed \nServices Committee, Senator Warner, and the ranking member, Senator \nLevin, for the serious, bipartisan approach they took in preparing the \nSenate version of the bill.\n  The DOD authorization bill is critically important, particularly with \nour servicemen and women are serving bravely in Iraq, Afghanistan and \naround the world. We owe it to our men and women in uniform to do \neverything we can to support them.\n  While what has emerged from conference is not perfect, the bill \ncontains a wealth of positive provisions in keeping with the \nresponsibility of Congress to our men and women in uniform.\n  When we first considered the DOD authorization bill in July, the \nSenate accepted an amendment Senator Graham and I offered to make \nTricare available to all National Guard members and reservists during \nthe House-Senate conference, we reached a compromise which will offer \ngreat opportunities for Guard members and reservists to join the \nTricare Program.\n  At at time when approximately 40 percent of the men and women serving \nin Iraq are members of the National Guard and Reserve, and as Guard \nmembers and reservists are a serving in a new and expanding role in the \nglobal war on terror, we ought to do all we can to ensure that these \nmen and women have the services and support they need and deserve. This \nbill marks further progress in this effort, increasing access to health \nbenefits for our National Guard and Reserve and their families in New \nYork and around the country. Providing the Guard and Reserves, as well \nas their families, with adequate support and benefits is the least that \na grateful nation can do. Under the provision, all members of the \nSelected Reserve are eligible to enroll in the military health care \nprogram.The premiums are based on categories of eligibility:\n  Category 1: Members of the Selected Reserve who are called to active \nduty qualify for TRICARE Reserve Select, TRS. Under this program, \nestablished last year, a reservist would accumulate 1 year of TRS \ncoverage for every 90 days of Active-Duty service. Monthly premiums \nduring the years of accumulated eligibility are only 28 percent of the \nprogram cost. The Government picks up the remaining 72 percent. As has \nalways been the case, coverage is free of charge while on active duty. \nThis bill now permits accumulation of earned periods of coverage for \nfrequently deployed personnel. In addition, it authorizes 6 months of \ntransitional coverage for family members following the death of the \nReserve member, if the member dies while in an inactive status.\n  Category 2: Members of the Selected Reserve who are not called to \nactive duty and who otherwise do not qualify for health insurance due \nto unemployment or lack of employer-provided coverage are eligible to \nenroll in TRICARE for a 50-percent cost-sharing premium. The Government \nwill pay the remaining 50-percent.\n  Category 3: Members of the Selected Reserve who do not fit into \neither of the above categories but would like to participate in TRICARE \nare eligible to do so for an 85-percent cost share. Employers are \nallowed and encouraged to contribute to the reservist's share. The \nGovernment contributes 15 percent of the costs.\n  This compromise is an important step forward in improving health care \naccess for our Nation's guardsmen and reservists.\n  It is important to note as well that this expansion was the fruit of \na bipartisan effort by Senator Graham and myself, along with my \ncolleagues Senator Leahy and Senator DeWine.\n  The conference report also includes another provision I offered, this \none with Senator Collins, to improve financial education for our \nsoldiers. It is a problem that has plagued military service men and \nwomen for years: a lack of general knowledge about the insurance and \nother financial services available to them.\n\n  This provision instructs the Secretary of Defense to carry out a \ncomprehensive education program for military members regarding public \nand private financial services, including life insurance and the \nmarketing practices of these services, available to them. This \neducation will be institutionalized in initial and recurring training \nfor\n\n[[Page S14271]]\n\nmembers of the military. This is important so that we don't just make \nan instantaneous improvement, but a truly lasting benefit to members of \nthe military.\n  The legislation also requires that counseling services on these \nissues be made available, upon request, to members and their spouses. \nIt is very important to include the spouses in this program because we \nall know that investment decisions should be made as a family. Too many \ntimes, a military spouse has to make these decisions alone, while a \nhusband or wife is deployed.\n  This amendment requires that during counseling of members or spouses \nregarding life insurance, counselors must include information on the \navailability of Servicemembers' Group Life Insurance, SGLI, as well as \nother available products.\n  I am happy that my fellow Senators support this legislation and proud \nthat the amendment was adopted in conference.\n  The legislation also includes a provision which will ensure the \navailability of special pay for members during rehabilitation from \nwounds, injuries, and illnesses incurred in a combat zone. Earlier this \nyear, I learned of the story of Army SPC Jeffrey Loria, who was \nencountering pay problems while recovering at Walter Reed Army Medical \nCenter. My inquiry to the Army in this matter corrected Specialist \nLoria's problems and also led to the discovery of pay problems for at \nleast 129 other soldiers. I continued to follow up on the plight of \nwounded soldiers when I questioned each of the service secretaries \nabout this topic in early March 2005, asking if they would support \nefforts to ensure that wounded Guard members and reservists did not \nlose their combat pay allowance while in a military hospital. Their \nunanimous answer was yes. I am proud to see the provision incorporated \ninto the bill.\n  In addition, I am pleased that the House and Senate have agreed to \nprovide hundreds of members of the National Guard who served at Ground \nZero after the terrorist attacks the full Federal retirement credit for \ntheir service that they deserve. Many of the soldiers who served at \nGround Zero, often for extended periods, were not officially put on \nFederal active duty and so did not receive Federal military retirement \ncredit. I was proud to fight for this legislation as a House-Senate \nconferee, and I want to thank Congresswoman Maloney and Congressman \nKing for their hard work to see the provision through the House of \nRepresentatives. I applaud Congress for accepting our arguments for \nthose brave men and women of the National Guard who gave their all \nafter the September 11 attacks and absolutely deserve this credit.\n  I am also glad to see that the final conference report includes no \nlanguage to restrict the role that women can play in our Armed Forces. \nWomen have a long history of proud service in our Armed Forces, and \nmore than 200,000 women currently serve, making up approximately 17 \npercent of the total force. Thousands of women are currently serving \nbravely in Iraq, Afghanistan, and elsewhere. During my own visits to \nIraq--as I am sure that many of my colleagues who have also visited \nIraq can also attest--I witnessed women performing a wide range of \ntasks in a dangerous environment.\n  Our soldiers, both men and women, volunteered to serve their Nation. \nThey are performing magnificently. There should be no change to \nexisting policies that would decrease the roles or positions available \nto women in the Armed Forces. Earlier this year, I introduced, along \nwith several of my colleagues, a sense-of-the Senate resolution stating \nthat there should be no change to existing laws, policies, or \nregulations that would decrease the roles or positions available to \nwomen in the Armed forces.\n  Finally, I want to highlight several other provisions in the \nlegislation that honor the commitment of this Congress to our men and \nwomen in uniform. The final bill includes a 3.1-percent pay raise for \nall military personnel as well as increases to the maximum amount of \nassignment incentive pay and hardship duty pay that our servicemen and \nservicewomen receive. The bill also calls for an increase of $60 \nmillion for childcare and family assistance services to support Active-\nDuty and Reserve military families.\n  Also included were measures to bolster the support and gratitude our \nNation shows for the families of our men and women in uniform who have \nlost their lives in service to our country. The bill increases the \nsurvivor benefits to $100,000 for all Active Duty military decedents; \npayments would be retroactive, to include all those lost since the \ncommencement of Operation Enduring Freedom. In addition, the conference \nreport increases TRICARE benefits for the surviving children of those \nwho have lost their lives while on active duty and calls for the \nestablishment of a uniform policy on casualty assistance to improve the \nservices provided to survivors and next of kin.\n  I am proud to support these provisions and proud to do all I can for \nthese families.\n  Despite the positive sections of the conference report, many of which \nI have outlined above, there are also portions of the authorization \nbill that are deeply troubling. I fear that included in a bill that \ndoes so much to support our men and women in uniform are provisions \nthat might also do a disservice to these brave Americans.\n  One in particular is the Graham-Levin-Kyl amendment, included in the \nconference report, governing the treatment of detainees at Guantanamo \nBay.\n  Like all of my colleagues, I am deeply troubled by the circumstances \nthat have opened our Federal courts to enemy combatants. Senator Graham \nis correct that the present level of accessibility to our courts by \nindividuals who would do us harm is unprecedented in our Nation's \nhistory.\n  However, the seeds of this situation were sown when the President \nchose our course for the war against terror. Rather than treating our \ndetainees in accordance with the governing principles of military \nengagement, he chose to institute policies that demonstrate disrespect \nfor the rule of law and have resulted in lowering our country's moral \nstanding in the world. Had the President chosen instead to respect \ninternational conventions that provide due process protections, we \nwould not be facing the unprecedented problem of having to make our \ncourts open to our enemies.\n  I agree that this is an area long overdue for reform. Although it \nleft much to be desired, I voted in favor of the Graham-Levin-Kyl \namendment in its original form because it was an improvement over a \nharsh measure that would have eliminated almost entirely a detainee's \nability to challenge his or her detention. In conference, however, \nHouse negotiators once again undermined much of the thoughtful \ndeliberation that went into crafting the Graham-Levin-Kyl compromise, \nstripping out important provisions that would have prohibited the \nadmission of evidence obtained through ``undue coercion'' and further \nlimiting legal recourse available to detainees.\n  We must work toward a system that corrects the missteps made by the \nPresident and adopt a well-thought-out set of procedures that respects \nthe rule of law and restores our Nation to its proper standing in the \nworld. The system outlined by the Graham-Levin-Kyl amendment as \nprovided in the DOD Authorization conference report falls short of this \nmeasure.\n  The Defense authorization conference report contains a great deal \nthat we in this body can look to with pride. That is why I support the \nbill as a whole and why I voted in favor of it. We face real challenges \nand threats as a nation, and our men and women in uniform are, every \nsingle day, serving with courage on the front lines in defense of our \nvalues and our way of life. I do not vote without concern, however, in \nlight of a few troubling provisions which I fear do not serve the \ninterests of our country or our troops.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, the fiscal year 2006 Defense Authorization \nAct contains a number of provisions that take an important step towards \nthe Military Family Bill of Rights I believe we need.\n  Among the final provisions, the legislation authorizes an increase of \nthe death gratuity to $100,000 for all active-duty service members. I \nwas pleased to originally offer this provision as an amendment to the \nfiscal year 2005 supplemental appropriations act earlier this year. I \nwas happy to work with Senator Levin on this bill to bring this \nprovision into reality.\n\n[[Page S14272]]\n\n  I offered another amendment on the supplemental last spring to \nincrease to 1 year the length of time surviving families of service \nmembers may reside in Government housing or receive the basic allowance \nfor housing. It was signed into law then, but because it was part of \nthe supplemental, it expired with the end of the fiscal year. The \nfiscal year 2006 National Defense Authorization Act makes this \nextension permanent.\n  I am also pleased that the final bill includes authorization for \nincreased funding for Project Sheriff--an initiative of the Office of \nForce Transformation to provide our soldiers and marines with a full \nspectrum of lethal and nonlethal weapons when engaging enemies in an \nurban environment.\n  The Defense authorization bill includes other important provisions \nfor our country: a 3.1-percent pay raise for military personnel; \nincreased Army and Marine Corps end strength, and an expansion of \nTRICARE benefits for members of the Selected Reserve and their \nfamilies.\n  Taken together, these provisions are important milestones. They are \nfurther testament of this Congress's and this country's determination \nto maintain the best trained, best equipped, best prepared, and most \ncapable military on earth. It is also a recognition of the important \ncontributions made by military families--families who give so much to \nthis country.\n  When I voted for this legislation on the Senate floor, one essential \naspect was that the limitations placed on the review of habeas corpus \nclaims of Guantanamo Bay detainees were prospective only. I am pleased \nto say that the bill's effective date was not altered in conference. As \na result, as the Supreme Court held in Lindh v. Murphy, it still \nemploys the normal rule that our laws operate prospectively.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate was finally \nable to debate and pass the Defense Authorization Act. It is \nindefensible that this important legislation was put on the backburner \nfor so long; held back until the eleventh hour by the majority for \nvarious special interests and political reasons. The American people \nand the troops deserve better than that.\n  I am pleased that this bill includes important provisions for our men \nand women in uniform and their families. I am very pleased that we were \nable to include a 3.1 percent pay raise for all of our men and women in \nuniform as well as a host of bonus and incentive pays to help the \nmilitary in its recruiting and retention efforts. The conference report \nalso contains an important provision that permanently increases the \ndeath gratuity for those killed on active duty. Although the Senate's \nstrong bipartisan efforts to make TRICARE available for the Guard and \nReserve were again watered down in the conference report, the final \nbill still includes significant improvements in TRICARE access for all \nof our citizen-soldiers. These are just a few examples of the important \nprovisions contained in this bill.\n  I am proud that the Congress has finally, definitively, sent such a \nstrong message to the administration about the treatment of detainees \nby enacting the amendment of the senior Senator from Arizona. The lack \nof a clear policy regarding the treatment of detainees has been \nconfusing and counter-productive. It has left our men and women in \nuniform in the lurch with no clear direction about what is and is not \npermissible. This failure on the part of the administration has sullied \nour reputation as a Nation, and hurt our efforts to promote democracy \nand human rights in the Arab and Muslim worlds. I have been proud to \nsupport Senator McCain's amendment on interrogation policy because it \nshould help to bring back some accountability to the process and \nrestore our great Nation's reputation as the world's leading advocate \nfor human rights.\n  Although I voted for the Department of Defense authorization bill, I \nam disappointed with the mixed messages that the Senate continues to \nsend to the administration and the country on issues related to the \ndetainees held at Guantanamo Bay. Even as we enact the important McCain \namendment on torture, the conference report also includes the Graham \namendment, which remains deeply troubling because of the restrictions \nit places on judicial review of detainees held at Guantanamo. However, \nit is important to note that the provision is limited in critical ways. \nThe provision on judicial review of military commissions covers only \n``final decisions'' of military commissions, and only governs \nchallenges brought under that provision. In addition, the language in \nsection 1405(e)(2) that prohibits ``any other action against the United \nStates'' applies only to suits brought relating to an ``aspect of \ndetention by the Department of Defense.'' Therefore, it is my \nunderstanding that this provision will not affect the ongoing \nlitigation in Hamdan v. Rumsfeld before the Supreme Court because that \ncase involves a challenge to trial by military commission, not to an \naspect of a detention, and of course was not brought under this \nprovision. Furthermore, it is important to make clear that this \nprovision should not be read to endorse the current system of trial by \nmilitary commission for those at Guantanamo Bay. This provision \nreflects, but certainly does not endorse, the existing status of those \nmilitary commissions, which is that they are currently legal under a \ndecision of the DC Circuit. However, the Supreme Court has not yet \naddressed the legality of such military commissions, and this amendment \nshould not be read as any indication that Congress is weighing in on \nthat issue. While I would have strongly preferred that this amendment \nnot be included in the conference report, I think it is important to \nnote these limitations on its practical effect.\n  I am pleased that the conference report contained a number of \nprovisions I authored, including my amendment to enhance and strengthen \nthe transition services that are provided to our military personnel by \nmaking a number of improvements to the existing transition and \npostdeployment/predischarge health assessment programs. The conference \nreport also includes my amendment that corrects a flaw in the law that \nunintentionally restricted the number of families of injured \nservicemembers who qualify for travel assistance. The change in the law \nnow ensures that families of injured servicemembers evacuated to a U.S. \nhospital get at least one trip paid for so that these families can \nquickly reunite and begin recovering from the trauma they have \nexperienced.\n  The military's high operational tempo over the last 4 years led it to \nkeep thousands of troops beyond their contractual separation dates \nthrough a policy often referred to as ``stop-loss.'' The Pentagon did a \npoor job of clearly disclosing to volunteers that they could be stop-\nlossed and so many who thought they had completed their military \nservice found themselves deployed to a combat zone. It is not difficult \nto understand how this policy turned upside down the lives of the \nimpacted troops and their families. The conference report includes an \namendment I authored requiring the Department of Defense to report on \nthe steps it is taking to clearly communicate the stop-loss policy to \npotential enlistees and re-enlistees. I hope that, by pushing the \nDepartment to report on the actions it is taken to ensure that \npotential recruits know the terms of their service, the Department will \ntake quick action to address this problem.\n  Despite the unprecedented levels of defense spending, the Government \nAccountability Office recently found that the Department of Defense is \nnot only doing a poor job in replacing equipment that is being rapidly \nworn out but is not even tracking its equipment needs. Military \nreadiness has suffered as a result. I authored an amendment retained in \nthe conference report requiring DOD to submit a comprehensive report in \nconjunction with the President's annual budget request that details \nDOD's program strategies and funding plans to ensure that DOD's budget \ndecisions address these equipment deficiencies. Such a report will make \nDOD's equipment needs more transparent and will allow Congress to \nprovide more effective oversight and hold the Department accountable.\n  I am disappointed that the conference report did not maintain the \nbipartisan amendment I authored establishing the Civilian Linguist \nReserve Corps, CLRC, pilot project. Our Government is in desperate need \nof people with critical language skills and the CLRC model, which is \nstrongly supported by the Defense Department, has\n\n[[Page S14273]]\n\nthe potential of addressing this need in a fiscally responsible manner. \nIt is unfortunate that the conferees chose to go another route.\n  In conclusion, I must note, as I have in all of the 13 years I have \nserved in the Senate, my disappointment that we continue the wasteful \ntrend of spending billions of dollars on Cold War-era weapons systems \nwhile not fully funding our current needs. This enormous bill could \nhave been better. However, on balance this legislation contains many \ngood provisions for our men and women in uniform and their families and \nthat is why I support it.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I express my concern regarding the \nadoption of the McCain amendment as part of the National Defense \nAuthorization Act. Although I am pleased the legislation now includes \nimportant protections for the brave men and women who are interrogating \nterrorists around the world, I am nevertheless concerned that this \nlegislation may hinder our intelligence collection activities.\n  Many supporters of the amendment, including the mainstream media, \nclaim that the legislation ``bans'' torture--leaving the impression \nthat torture was somehow legal under our current laws. This is \nincorrect. Torture is prohibited under current U.S. law and treaty \nobligations, and President Bush has unequivocally stated that the \nUnited States will not engage in torture, and we will treat all \ndetainees in a humane fashion. In fact, this legislation will likely \nprohibit current legal interrogation techniques that stop well short of \ntorture and are providing valuable intelligence information.\n  We all agree that in order to achieve victory in the war on terror, \nthe United States must have the very best intelligence we can acquire \nthrough technical means and the interrogation of captured terrorists. \nMany of these terrorists are highly trained to resist U.S. \ninterrogation techniques. Although I adamantly oppose torture, I \nbelieve we must use every legal means--including aggressive \ninterrogation methods that some may find objectionable--to get \nintelligence that will save American lives. I voted against the McCain \namendment out of a deep concern that it would potentially limit certain \ninterrogation methods that may be necessary to save American lives.\n  We know that aggressive--yet humane--interrogation techniques were \ninstrumental in gaining valuable information from Khalid Sheikh \nMohammed, a key architect of the 9/11 attacks, and other terrorists in \nU.S. custody. We must not abandon these important and legal questioning \nmethods for the sake of political correctness. We must send a strong \nsignal to terrorists everywhere that if they are captured by the United \nStates, while they will be treated humanely, we will use every legal \nmethod to force them to reveal their designs on the United States.\n  Torture does not produce good intelligence. People who are tortured \nwill tell their captors anything they want to hear and not the truth. \nMore importantly, torture does not represent the values of America and \nall that we stand for as a Nation. However, we should not unnecessarily \nlimit our military and intelligence agencies from aggressively \ninterrogating those individuals who wish to kill innocent Americans. We \nmust always remember that the terrorists who attacked America on 9/11 \nare relentless in their efforts to destroy us.\n  Finally, some have argued that the passage of the McCain amendment \nwould have somehow prevented the heinous abuses that we saw at Abu \nGhraib prison. This is patently false. The individuals who committed \nthe abuses at Abu Ghraib knew their actions were against the law, yet \nthey violated core American values. The perpetrators of these crimes \nare now being prosecuted, and the military has undertaken comprehensive \nreforms to prevent future abuses. As noted by the independent \nSchlesinger Panel in its report on detainee operations: ``There is no \nevidence of a policy of abuse promulgated by senior officials or \nmilitary authorities.'' Our military has detained over 80,000 \nindividuals and the instances of detainee abuse are extremely rare and \nthey are prosecuted when discovered. To imply that our military or \nintelligence services are torturing detainees as a matter of policy is \na distortion of reality.\n  In our efforts to demonstrate to the world that the United States \ndoes not torture terrorists, we must not weaken our ability to \nprosecute the war on terror. Our military and intelligence personnel \nmust have the tools--including aggressive interrogation techniques--to \nquestion captured terrorists. I remain concerned that the McCain \namendment, although admirable in its intent, may hinder our efforts to \ncollect vital intelligence, and I make no apologies for endorsing all \nlegal means of obtaining actionable intelligence that will save \nAmerican lives.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, today I rise to comment upon the recently \npassed Defense authorization bill. That bill contained a Graham-Levin-\nKyl amendment which dealt with the Combatant Status Review Tribunals \nand Military Commissions at Guantanamo Bay. I was very pleased to join \nwith Senators Levin and Kyl and others to offer this amendment, and I \nwant to thank them for working so hard on this issue.\n  In rising today, I address one particular section of our amendment, \nthe requirement that the tribunals consider whether evidence was \ncoerced. In drafting this section, we were compelled to recognize three \nbasic facts.\n  First, we were compelled to recognize the impracticality of importing \ndomestic criminal protections into a forum constructed to administer \nwhat are essentially enemy soldiers; combatants for a very unique \nenemy, an enemy without uniforms, capitals, or cohesive command \nstructures, but combatants nonetheless.\n  Second, we were forced to address the necessity of relying on \nevidence without a complete picture of how it was obtained; evidence \nthat might be obscured by the fog of war, derived from battlefield \nintelligence, from classified sources, or even through unknown \ncircumstances.\n  Lastly, we were required by our constitutional responsibilities to \nerr on the side of protecting the American people. In instances where \nthere is some doubt as to the evidence or the status of the detainee, \nthe benefit of the doubt must go to the government as it seeks to \ndischarge its first duty, providing for the common defense of our \npeople.\n  In our efforts to balance these interests, we initially included an \nexclusionary rule for evidence obtained through ``undue coercion.'' We \nfelt that the term ``undue coercion'' reflected the reality that, in \nthe national security context, there is some level of coercive \ninterrogation that is acceptable. We also understand that, at some \npoint, the reliability of the information can be questioned as a result \nof the methods used to obtain it. I believe Guantanamo Bay serves a \nunique and necessary purpose in the war on terror, but we need to \nensure that we are holding the right people.\n  However, upon reconsideration, we came to believe that the term \n``undue coercion,'' being a new term without legal precedent, might not \nbe as instructive as we required. Furthermore, a number of the military \njudge advocates we consulted were concerned that the exclusionary rule \ncould limit them from considering evidence tainted by only an \nallegation of mistreatment.\n  Therefore, after much consultation with legal professionals, we \ndecided to eliminate the ``undue'' qualifier. Unfortunately, striking \nthe qualifier also eliminated the consideration of whether the \ninformation was obtained by acceptable sources and methods. \nAccordingly, we decided to refrain from mandating the exclusionary \nrule. Instead, our language requires, for the first time, the panels to \nconsider the source of the information and the information's \nreliability. I am very confident our language provides for the proper \nconsideration.\n  Now, to be sure, our language also provides for the benefit of the \ndoubt to go to the government. In granting this benefit, however, we \nrecognize that we are fundamentally different from our adversaries. \nThough we may fail at times, we strive to be fair and just and \nhonorable. And because our military men and women exemplify those \nvalues, we can trust them to fairly administer this process. In the \nend, we must remember that this is a military administrative process, \nand, with the proper congressional and judicial oversight provided by \nour amendment, we must trust our professional military officers to do \ntheir jobs.\n\n[[Page S14274]]\n\n  In our amendment as a whole, we sought to protect our national \nsecurity while still striking the proper balance between aggressively \ninterrogating detainees and providing a competent military \nadministrative process for their status determination. I am confident \nthat this new evidentiary standard serves that goal.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise to speak about the Detainee \nTreatment Act of 2005, which is included in the Defense authorization \nconference report.\n  The Detainee Treatment Act includes two provisions that were adopted \nin the Senate version of the Defense authorization bill: the McCain \nantihuman torture amendment and the Graham-Levin Detainee Amendment.\n  I was an original cosponsor of the McCain Antitorture amendment. I \nhave spoken at length about the vital importance of this amendment on \nseveral other occasions. At this time, I simply want to reiterate a \ncouple of points.\n  Twice in the last year and a half, I have authored amendments to \naffirm our Nation's long standing position that torture and cruel, \ninhuman, or degrading treatment are illegal. Twice, the Senate \nunanimously approved my amendments. Both times, the amendments were \nkilled behind the closed doors of a conference committee--at the \ninsistence of the Bush administration.\n  I am pleased that the administration has changed its position. As a \nresult, it will now be absolutely clear that under U.S. law all U.S. \npersonnel are prohibited from subjecting any detainee anywhere in the \nworld to torture or cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment.\n  The amendment defines cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment as any \nconduct that would constitute the cruel, unusual, and inhumane \ntreatment or punishment prohibited by the U.S. Constitution if the \nconduct took place in the United States. Under this standard, abusive \ntreatment that would be unconstitutional in American prisons will not \nbe permissible anywhere in the world.\n  Let me give you some examples of conduct that is clearly prohibited \nby the McCain amendment.\n  ``Waterboarding'' or simulated drowning is a technique that was used \nduring the Spanish Inquisition. It is clearly a form of torture. It \ncreates an overwhelming sense of imminent death. It amounts to a clear-\ncut threat of death akin to a mock execution, which is expressly called \nmental torture in the U.S. Army Field Manual.\n  Sleep deprivation is another classic form of torture which is \nexplicitly called mental torture in the U.S. Army Field Manual. It has \nbeen banned in the United Kingdom and by a unanimous Israeli Supreme \nCourt, and the U.S. Supreme Court has repeatedly declared it \nunconstitutional, once citing a report that called it ``the most \neffective form of torture.''\n  The amendment also clearly bans so-called stress positions or \npainful, prolonged forced standing or shackling. Again, the U.S. Army \nField Manual expressly calls these techniques ``physical torture.'' \nMoreover, one of the most recent Supreme Court cases on the extent of \nthe prohibitions on ``cruel and unusual'' punishments expressly \noutlawed the use of painful stress positions, denouncing their \n``obvious cruelty'' as ``antithetical to human dignity.''\n  The amendment bans the use of extreme cold, or hypothermia, as an \ninterrogation tactic. Hypothermia can be deadly. Clearly it is capable \nof causing severe and lasting harm, if not death, and consequently is \nbanned by both the Field Manual and the Constitution.\n  The amendment bans punching, striking, violently shaking, or beating \ndetainees. Striking prisoners is a criminal offense and clearly \nunconstitutional. Moreover, while assaults like slapping and violent \nshaking may not seem as dangerous as beatings, shaking did, in fact, \nkill a prisoner in Israel, and the tactic has been banned by the \nIsraeli Supreme Court. Numerous U.S. Supreme Court cases likewise \nprohibited striking prisoners.\n  The amendment bans the use of dogs in interrogation and the use of \nnakedness and sexual humiliation for the purpose of degrading \nprisoners.\n  No reasonable person, given the text of the amendment, the judicial \nprecedents, and common sense, would consider these techniques to be \npermitted. Any U.S. official or employee who receives legal advice to \nthe contrary should think twice before defying the will of the Congress \non this issue.\n  The McCain antitorture amendment will make the rules for the \ntreatment of detainees clear to our troops and will send a signal to \nthe world about our Nation's commitment to the humane treatment of \ndetainees.\n  I want to express again my opposition to the Graham-Levin amendment.\n  The amendment would essentially eliminate habeas corpus for detainees \nat Guantanamo Bay. In so doing, it would apparently overturn the \nSupreme Court's landmark decision in Rasul v. Bush.\n  No one questions the fact that the United States has the power to \nhold battlefield combatants for the duration of an armed conflict. That \nis a fundamental premise of the law of war.\n  However, over the objections of then-Secretary of State Colin Powell \nand military lawyers, the Bush administration has created a new \ndetention policy that goes far beyond the traditional law of war. The \nadministration claims the right to seize anyone, including an American \ncitizen, anywhere in the world, including in the United States, and to \nhold him until the end of the war on terrorism, whenever that may be. \nThey claim that a person detained in the war on terrorism has no legal \nrights. That means no right to a lawyer, no right to see the evidence \nagainst him, and no right to challenge his detention.\n  In fact, the Government has argued in court that detainees would have \nno right to challenge their detentions even if they claimed they were \nbeing tortured or summarily executed.\n  U.S. military lawyers have called this detention system ``a legal \nblack hole.''\n  Defense Secretary Rumsfeld has described the detainees as ``the \nhardest of the hard core'' and ``among the most dangerous, best \ntrained, vicious killers on the face of the Earth.'' However, the \nadministration now acknowledges that innocent people are held at \nGuantanamo Bay. In late 2003, the Pentagon reportedly determined that \n15 Chinese Muslims held at Guantanamo are not enemy combatants and were \nmistakenly detained. Almost 2 years later, those individuals remain in \nGuantanamo Bay.\n  Last year, in the Rasul decision, the Supreme Court rejected the \nadministration's detention policy. The Court held that detainees at \nGuantanamo have the right to habeas corpus to challenge their \ndetentions in Federal court. The Court held that the detainees' claims \nthat they were detained for years without charge and without access to \ncounsel ``unquestionably describe custody in violation of the \nConstitution, or laws or treaties of the United States.''\n  The Graham amendment would protect the Bush administration's \ndetention system from legal challenge. It would effectively overturn \nthe Supreme Court's decision. It would prevent innocent detainees, like \nthe Chinese Muslims, from challenging their detention.\n  However, I do want to note some limitations on the scope of the \nGraham-Levin Amendment.\n  A critical feature of this legislation is that it is forward looking. \nA law purporting to require a Federal court to give up its jurisdiction \nover a case that is submitted and awaiting decision would raise grave \nconstitutional questions. The amendment's jurisdiction-stripping \nprovisions clearly do not apply to pending cases, including the Hamdan \nv. Rumsfeld case, which is currently pending before the Supreme Court. \nIn accordance with our traditions, this amendment does not apply \nretroactively to revoke the jurisdiction of the courts to consider \npending claims invoking the Great Writ of Habeas Corpus challenging \npast enemy combatant determinations reached without the safeguards this \namendment requires for future determinations. The amendment alters the \noriginal language introduced by Senator Graham so that those pending \ncases are not affected by this provision.\n  The amendment also does not legislate an exhaustion requirement for \nthose who have already filed military commission challenges. As such, \nnothing in the legislation alters or impacts the jurisdiction or merits \nof the Hamdan case.\n  Nothing in the legislation affirmatively authorizes, or even \nrecognizes,\n\n[[Page S14275]]\n\nthe legal status of the military commissions at issue in Hamdan. That \nis the precise question that the Supreme Court will decide in the next \nmonths. Right now, the military commissions are legal under a decision \nof the DC Circuit, and this amendment reflects but in no way endorses \nthat present status. It would be a grave mistake for our allies around \nthe world to think that we are endorsing this system at Guantanamo \nBay--a system that has produced not a single conviction in the 4 years \nsince the horrible attacks of September 11, 2001.\n  This provision attempts to address problems that have occurred in the \ndeterminations of the status of people detained by the military at \nGuantanamo Bay and elsewhere. It recognizes that the Combatant Status \nReview Tribunal, CSRT, procedures applied in the past were inadequate \nand must be changed going forward. As the former chief judge of the \nU.S. Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court found, in In Re Guantanamo \nDetainee Cases, the past CSRT procedures ``deprive[d] the detainees of \nsufficient notice of the factual bases for their detention and den[ied] \nthem a fair opportunity to challenge their incarceration,'' and allowed \n``reliance on statements possibly obtained through torture or other \ncoercion.'' Her review ``call[ed] into serious question the nature and \nthoroughness'' of the past CSRT process. The former CSRT procedures \nwere not issued by the Secretary of Defense, were not reported to or \napproved by Congress, did not provide for final determinations by a \ncivilian official answerable to Congress, did not provide for the \nconsideration of new evidence, and did not address the use of \nstatements possibly obtained through coercion.\n  To address these problems, this provision requires the Secretary of \nDefense to issue new CSRT procedures and report those procedures to the \nappropriate committees of Congress; it requires that going forward, the \ndeterminations be made by a Designated Civilian Official who is \nanswerable to Congress; it provides for the periodic review of new \nevidence; it provides for future CSRTs to assess whether statements \nwere derived from coercion and their probative value; and it provides \nfor review in the DC Circuit Court of Appeals for these future CSRT \ndeterminations.\n  Mr. REID. In a statement on November 15 of this year, I explained my \nvote on amendments offered by Senators Graham, Levin, and Bingaman \nregarding access to the Federal courts for detainees at Guantanamo Bay. \nNow that a conference report containing a revised version of these \nprovisions is before us, I want to reiterate a few points.\n  I voted in favor of the Graham-Levin amendment because I believed it \nwas better than the original Graham amendment. Similarly, I will vote \nin favor of this conference report because I favor the bill as a whole. \nBut I have mixed views on the detainee provisions of the conference \nreport, now in title X as the ``Detainee Treatment Act of 2005.''\n  On the one hand, I oppose stripping the courts of jurisdiction to \nhear habeas corpus petitions. The writ of habeas corpus is one of the \npillars of the Anglo-American legal system, and limiting the Great Writ \ninterferes with the independence of the judiciary and violates \nprinciples of separation of powers. The action we take today fails to \naddress adequately the Bush administration's flawed policy of detaining \nsuspects indefinitely, in secret, and without access to meaningful \njudicial oversight.\n  On the other hand, I support provisions in this bill that require \nimprovements in the procedures and oversight of the Combatant Status \nReview Tribunals. It is important to ensure that status determinations \nof those detained at Guantanamo Bay and elsewhere are conducted in \naccordance with basic requirements of due process and fairness. The \nDefense Department must address the serious problems identified earlier \nthis year by Judge Green, the former chief judge of the U.S. Foreign \nIntelligence Surveillance Court.\n  I am also pleased that the final law would allow courts to consider \nwhether the standards and procedures used by the Combatant Status \nReview Tribunals are consistent with the Constitution and U.S. laws, \nthat it does not apply retroactively to pending habeas claims that \nchallenge past enemy combatant determinations reached without the \nsafeguards this amendment requires, and that it would allow for court \nreview of the actions of military commissions. I commend Senator Levin \nfor his work on these issues.\n  On balance, I support the final detainee provisions with the \nfollowing understandings:\n  First, I am pleased that Senator Graham's original language was \naltered so that the Supreme Court would not be divested of jurisdiction \nto hear the pending case of Hamdan v. Rumsfeld. In fact, subsection (h) \nof section 1005 makes clear that the DC Circuit and other courts will \nmaintain jurisdiction to hear all pending habeas cases, in accordance \nwith the Supreme Court's decision in Lindh v. Murphy.\n  Second, on a related but distinct point, I believe this act has no \nimpact on the Supreme Court's ability to consider Hamdan's challenge at \nthis pre-conviction stage of the military commission proceedings. As \nthe DC Circuit held in Hamdan earlier this year, Ex Parte Quirin is a \ncompelling historical precedent for the power of civilian courts to \nentertain challenges that are raised during a military commission \nprocess. Nothing in these sections requires the courts to abstain at \nthis point in the litigation. Paragraph 3 of subsection 1005(e) governs \nchallenges to ``final decisions'' of the military commissions and does \nnot impact challenges like Hamdan's other cases not brought under that \nparagraph.\n  Third, this legislation does not represent congressional acquiescence \nin or authorization of the military commissions unilaterally \nestablished by the executive branch at Guantanamo Bay. Whether these \ncommissions are legal is precisely the question the Supreme Court will \nsoon decide in the Hamdan case. Rather, this legislation reflects the \nfact that the military commissions are currently legal under the DC \nCircuit's decision in Hamdan. We legislate against this backdrop in \nsetting up a procedure to challenge the commissions, but we do not \nnecessarily endorse the use of such commissions in this manner.\n  I hope that the Judiciary Committee soon considers legislation to \ndefine the rights of the detainees at Guantanamo with greater care and \nto develop sensible procedures for enforcing those rights. Congress \nshould be guided by principles of human rights and the rule of law upon \nwhich this Nation was founded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the conference \nreport.\n  The conference report was agreed to.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/12/21/senate-section/article/S14275-1", "month": "12", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14275-S14281]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    EXTENSION OF THE USA PATRIOT ACT\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will \nproceed to a bill at the desk relating to the extension of the PATRIOT \nAct which the clerk will report by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 2167) to amend the USA PATRIOT Act, and for \n     other purposes.\n\n  The Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, those of us working constructively to \nextend the USA PATRIOT Act have repeatedly offered to enter into a \nshort-term extension while we work out the differences and improve this \nreauthorization legislation. The extension we are passing for 6 months \nis a commonsense solution that allows us to take a few more weeks to \nget this right for all Americans.\n  A majority of Senators--Republicans, Democrats, those Senators who \nvoted for cloture, those who voted against cloture on the conference \nreport that failed to pass the Senate--have joined on a letter urging \nthe Republican leader to act on this commonsense offer by calling up a \nshort-term extension bill.\n  As soon as it became apparent that the conference report filed by the \nRepublican leadership would be unacceptable to the Senate, I joined on \nThursday, December 8, in urging a 3-month extension to work out a \nbetter bill. On the first day the Senate was in session, Monday, \nDecember 12, Senator Sununu and I introduced such a bill, S. 2082. We\n\n[[Page S14276]]\n\nsent out a Dear Colleague letter to other Senators on December 13 and \nthat bipartisan bill now has 47 cosponsors.\n  We offered this solution before the vote on the Senate floor last \nFriday. Contrary to the false claims and misrepresentations by some, \nthere is no effort to do away with the PATRIOT Act. That is just not \ntrue. Along with others here in the Senate, I am seeking to mend and \nextend the PATRIOT Act, not to end it. There is no reason why the \nAmerican people cannot have a PATRIOT Act that is both effective and \nthat adequately protects their rights and their privacy.\n  Republican and Democratic Senators joined together last week to say \nwe can do better to protect Americans' liberties while ensuring our \nnational security is as strong as it can be.\n  Every single Senator--Republican and Democratic--voted in July to \nmend and extend the PATRIOT Act. I have joined with Senators of both \nparties in an effort to enact a short-term extension so that we can \nkeep working to improve the bill. This is standard operating procedure \nin the Congress where we pass extensions in the nature of continuing \nresolutions regularly. The Sununu-Leahy bill to provide a 6-month \nextension, S. 2167, accomplishes this purpose. I thank the majority \nleader and Democratic leader for their leadership in passing this \nmeasure.\n  A clear majority of the Senate, Republican and Democrats, have come \ntogether and requested a short-term extension. These are Senators who \nvoted for cloture and Senators who voted against cloture in an effort \nto improve the long-term extension of the PATRIOT Act. These are \nRepublicans and Democrats.\n  No Democratic Senator opposes extending the PATRIOT Act. All of the \n52 Senators who signed the letter to the majority leader urged its \nextension.\n  Our Nation is a democracy, founded on the principles of balanced \ngovernment. We need to restore checks and balances in this country to \nprotect us all and all that we hold dear. Our Congress and our courts \nprovide checks on the abuse of executive authority and should protect \nour liberties.\n  We need to write the law so that Congress has provided its check in \nthe law and so that courts can play their role, as well. All Americans \nneed to take notice and need to demand that their liberties be \nmaintained. We can do better and must do better for the American \npeople.\n  Just this week, we celebrated the 214th anniversary of the passage of \nthe Bill of Rights, the first 10 amendments to the Constitution of the \nUnited States. These amendments ensure some of our most vital freedoms, \nincluding the freedom of speech, religion and press in the first \namendment. Within these amendments is also the right ``to be secure in \nour persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches \nand seizures.'' The Bill of Rights made clear not only the rights of \nthe American people, but also the limitations on the power of \ngovernment.\n  Just as we cannot allow ourselves to be lulled into a sense of false \nsecurity when it comes to our national security, we cannot allow \nourselves to be lulled into a blind trust regarding our freedoms and \nrights. We must remain vigilant on both counts or we stand to lose much \nthat we hold dear.\n  In arguing for reauthorization of the USA PATRIOT Act, Attorney \nGeneral Alberto Gonzales sought to assure us that ``concerns raised \nabout the act's impact on civil liberties, while sincere, were \nunfounded.'' I am not reassured, however.\n  We need only pick up a morning newspaper to see how the overreaching \nof the Bush administration plagues our efforts to uphold democracy at \nhome and throughout the world. We have seen secret arrests and secret \nhearings of hundreds of people for the first time in U.S. history; the \nabuse of detainees in U.S. custody; detentions without charges and \ndenial of access to counsel; and the misapplication of the material \nwitness statute as a sort of general preventive detention law. Such \nabuses harm our national security as well as our civil liberties \nbecause they serve as recruiting tools for terrorists, intimidate \nAmerican communities from cooperating with law enforcement, and, by \nmisusing limited antiterrorism resources, make it more likely that real \nterrorists will escape detection.\n  We have learned that the Pentagon maintains a secret database \ncontaining information on a wide cross-section of ordinary Americans. \nIt keeps track of people like those in Vermont who planned peaceful \nprotests of military recruiters, including one organized by Veterans \nfor Peace. It monitored the activities of an antiwar group that met at \nthe Quaker Meeting House in Lake Worth, FL, a year ago to plan a \nprotest against military recruiting at local high schools.\n  Similarly, the FBI also engages in monitoring other ordinary, law-\nabiding citizens. Records show that the FBI kept information on \nGreenpeace, the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee, and on \nstudents and peace activists who attended a conference at Stanford \nUniversity in 2002. In a similar story, a student at the University of \nMassachusetts/Dartmouth reportedly was visited by Federal agents in \nOctober, after he requested a copy of Mao Tse-Tung's tome on Communism \ncalled, ``The Little Red Book'' through the University's interlibrary \nloan program. If the FBI is investigating what book a college senior is \nborrowing, what is it that they are not investigating that they should \nbe?\n  The New York Times reports that after September 11, 2001, when former \nAttorney General John Ashcroft loosened restrictions on the FBI to \npermit it to monitor Web sites, mosques, and other public entities, \n``the FBI has used that authority to investigate not only groups with \nsuspected ties to foreign terrorists, but also protest groups suspected \nof having links to violent or disruptive activities.'' For example, \nrecently disclosed agency records show that FBI counterterrorism agents \nhave conducted surveillance and intelligence-gathering operations on \ngroups concerning the environment, animal cruelty, and poverty relief.\n  Now we are learning that President Bush has, for more than 4 years, \nbeen secretly authorizing warrantless surveillance of Americans inside \nthe United States. In fact, he acknowledges issuing secret Presidential \norders to authorize such warrantless surveillance more than 30 times \nsince September 11, 2001.\n  The U.S. Supreme Court has consistently held for nearly 40 years that \nthe monitoring and recording of private conversations constitutes a \n``search and seizure'' within the meaning of the fourth amendment, \nextending as far back as the 1967 case, Katz v. United States. It was \nbecause of concerns over unconstitutional surveillance of Americans in \nthe 1960s and 1970s that Congress enacted the Foreign Intelligence \nSurveillance Act in 1978 to provide a legal mechanism for the \nGovernment to engage in searches of Americans in connection with \nintelligence gathering. Unless pursuant to a criminal search warrant \nissued by a judge on a showing of probable cause, FISA warrants are the \nexclusive means by which electronic surveillance and the interception \nof electronic communications may be undertaken pursuant to the rule of \nlaw.\n  The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act has been amended over time, \nand it has been adjusted several times since 9/11. Indeed, much of the \nPATRIOT Act includes FISA amendments. The law has been further amended \nsince the PATRIOT Act, as well.\n  Congress allows the FISA Court to operate in secret and authorizes \nthe Government to begin immediate surveillance in an emergency \nsituation, so long as it seeks a warrant from the FISA Court within 72 \nhours. In addition, Congress has provided that following a declaration \nof war, the President may authorize electronic surveillance without a \ncourt order for a period not to exceed 15 days.\n  There has never been a leak reported out of the FISA Court. \nFurthermore, it has never been alleged that FISA's emergency procedures \nare inadequate or that FISA ties the hands of law enforcement. If the \nBush administration believed that FISA was inadequate, it should have \nalerted Congress to these flaws. It did not. Instead, it worked with me \nand with others in the days following 9/11 to amend FISA. I chaired the \nSenate Judiciary Committee at that time, apparently the same time that \nthe Bush administration began surveillance outside FISA. I was not \ninformed of the President's secret \n\n[[Page S14277]]\n\neavesdropping program while I chaired the Judiciary Committee in 2001 \nand 2002. I read about it for the first time in the press last week. \nSpying on Americans without safeguards to protect against the abuse of \ngovernment power is unnecessary, and it is wrong.\n\n  Over the last week, we have learned of long-term, widespread \neavesdropping on Americans by the Bush administration without \ncompliance to the law, without court oversight, and without \ncongressional authorization. Compounding that already troubling \ndiscovery were new, disturbing reports that the FBI has been monitoring \nU.S. advocacy groups working on behalf of the environment and civil \nrights issues, Quaker meetings and students checking out books to write \nschool papers. This is all too reminiscent of the dark days when a \nRepublican President compiled ``enemies lists'' and eavesdropped on \npolitical opponents and broke into doctors' offices and used the vast \npower of the executive branch to violate the constitutional rights of \nAmericans.\n  I was elected to the Senate in the aftermath of Watergate and the \nWhite House plumbers and the secret wars that led to the impeachment \narticles being considered against President Nixon. The Foreign \nIntelligence Surveillance Act was passed in 1978 as part of the reform \nand reaction to those abuses. As I have noted, this law has been \nextensively updated in accordance with the Bush administration's \nrequests in the aftermath of 9/11 and has been modified further in the \nlast 4 years with respect to so-called lone wolf terrorists. Neither in \nthe first year of his Presidency or in the aftermath of 9/11 or in the \n4 years since enactment of the PATRIOT Act has President Bush come to \nCongress and asked us for authority to engage in the kind of extensive \nsurveillance on Americans by the National Security Agency that The New \nYork Times reported and the President has now confirmed that he \nsecretly ordered and has reaffirmed more than 30 times.\n  We are a nation of laws, and the fact that no person is above the law \nis a bedrock principle upon which this Nation was founded and one we \nare defending and fighting for abroad. This type of covert spying on \nAmerican citizens and targeted groups on American soil betrays that \nprinciple.\n  The chairman of the Judiciary Committee has the right instinct and \nwas right to announce that we need hearings and an explanation, and the \nAmerican people deserve an accounting for this troubling revelation. \nEarlier this week, I joined with Senators Reid and Rockefeller in \nrequesting specific information from the Bush administration on its \ncovert spying operations domestically. I cannot emphasize strongly \nenough how important it is for the Bush administration to cooperate \nwith Congress on this matter. No one should be able to conduct secret, \nillegal spying programs on our soil with no accountability to Congress \nor the American people.\n  Congress has passed laws that established a legal way to eavesdrop on \nal-Qaida and other potential terrorist organizations. Internationally \nthat monitoring should have been done more effectively before 9/11 by \nthis administration. We have established legal authority in emergency \ncircumstances for the Attorney General to proceed first so long as he \npromptly seeks court approval thereafter. We even provided a 15-day \nwindow after a declaration of war. This program has apparently been \ngoing on for not 4 days or 14 days but for more than 4 years. That is \nnot pursuant to or consistent with FISA. In the PATRIOT Act and other \nactions since 9/11, Congress has created additional authorities. But it \nis Congress that passes laws. The President cannot simply declare when \nhe wishes to follow the law and when he chooses not to.\n  What happens to the rule of law if those in power abuse it and only \nadhere to it selectively? What happens to our liberties when the \nGovernment decides it would rather not follow the rules designed to \nprotect them?\n  The Bush administration, in secret legal justifications for a secret \neavesdropping program, apparently argues that when the Congress \nauthorized the use of force in September 2001 to attack al-Qaida in \nAfghanistan, it authorized warrantless searches and eavesdropping on \nAmericans. I voted for that authorization. This program is not what I \nvoted for. Congress did not sign a blank check. The power to eavesdrop \non Americans is not even authority that the Bush administration asked \nfor from Congress.\n  I was chairman of the Judiciary Committee when the President's \nprogram was undertaken, and I was never informed of the program or its \npurported legal justification. In this, as with its detention and \ninterrogation practices, this administration has chosen to go it alone. \nThat is wrong, and it is corrosive to our system of checks and \nbalances.\n  This is a Government with three co-equal branches. As Justice \nO'Connor reminded the Bush administration, even wartime does not give \nthe President a blank check with regard to power. As I said last week, \nthe same lawyers who advised the President that he was above the law \nwhen it came to torture, in a memorandum the Bush administration has \nhad to disavow and withdraw when it was brought to light, have \napparently advised the Bush administration that this President has \nauthority to conduct warrantless surveillance of Americans. That is \nwrong. Accountability is sacrificed when there is rampant \nunilateralism.\n  No one can just ignore the law or the constitutional limits on \nExecutive authority that protect Americans' liberties. Accordingly, I \nurge the Bush administration to make public its purported legal \njustification for what I view as an illegal program of spying on \nAmericans without court approval. I urge them not just to recite bumper \nsticker slogans or conclusory statements that they view their actions \nas consistent with the self-serving rewriting of the law they have \nsecretly made amongst themselves, but to provide that legal \njustification in the light of day so that Congress and Americans can \nconsider it. Provide and post the legal memoranda.\n  Al-Qaida knows that we eavesdrop and wiretap. Whether we do so \nlegally, whether we protect the liberties of Americans by respecting \nthe constitutional requirements for court-issued warrants, these \naspects are of little concern to terrorists but matter greatly to \nAmericans. I expect that when the supposed legal underpinnings for the \nPresident's eavesdropping program are examined, they, too, will be \nwithdrawn and disavowed by this administration. I also expect that they \nwill be rejected by an honest review in Congress, in the courts, and \ncertainly by the American people. I ask that a copy of a letter to the \nPresident of which I referred be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                Washington, DC, December 20, 2005.\n     The President,\n     The White House,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: Your recent acknowledgement of the \n     existence of a highly-classified program to conduct \n     electronic surveillance on U.S. citizens and permanent \n     residents without obtaining a court order as required by law \n     has raised a number of troubling issues in the minds of the \n     American people. That is why Democrats and Republicans have \n     called for prompt and thorough congressional investigation of \n     this program. We write to ask that you immediately provide \n     Congress with additional details on the extent and scope of \n     this program, your legal justification for your actions, and \n     your efforts to inform Congress about this program.\n       The relevant law governing surveillances, the Foreign \n     Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 (``EISA''), could not \n     be clearer on the need to obtain a court order for such \n     surveillance. It also provides for emergency procedures and \n     for authorization of electronic surveillance during a time of \n     war, with reasonable time limits beyond which a court order \n     must be obtained. We are deeply troubled by your assertions \n     that the Constitution and the Authorization for Use of \n     Military Force passed by Congress following the 9/11 attacks \n     provide you justification for contravening a statute's clear \n     language. In your public statements to date, you have not \n     made a convincing legal argument for the authority to do so.\n       In addition, public statements by several of the handful of \n     Members of Congress who were provided a briefing on this \n     program indicate that insufficient information was provided \n     to them under ground rules that did not enable Congress to \n     conduct satisfactory oversight. There are questions whether \n     your Administration has properly complied with the National \n     Security Act of 1947 requirement to keep the appropriate \n     committees of jurisdiction ``fully and currently informed of \n     the intelligence activities of the United States.''\n\n[[Page S14278]]\n\n       It is important for Congress to review these matters. We \n     respectfully ask that you cooperate fully to provide all \n     necessary information on all relevant aspects of this \n     program, including presidential orders, supporting legal \n     opinions, complete descriptions of actions taken under the \n     program, and other information, to the appropriate oversight \n     committees.\n       As Congress begins to examine this program in greater \n     detail, it is clear Congress and the American people need \n     immediately to understand at least four issues:\n       (1) Under what specific legal authorities did you authorize \n     warrantless electronic surveillance of American citizens and \n     permanent residents inside the United States?\n       (2) Given your assertion that the FISA is insufficient in \n     providing appropriate authority and procedures to protect \n     Americans from terrorism, what specific powers or authorities \n     are insufficient and why, in the four years since the 9/11 \n     attacks, has your Administration not proposed correcting \n     modifications?\n       (3) You have stated that you authorized the NSA to \n     intercept the international communications of people with \n     known links to al Qaeda and related terrorist organizations. \n     Have you ever authorized the interception, without a warrant, \n     of purely domestic communications, or communications of \n     people without known links to al Qaeda and related terrorist \n     organizations?\n       (4) Could you please provide additional information on the \n     legal and other justifications for limiting briefings on \n     these matters to a handful of Members of Congress, as well as \n     information on the dates, attendance, and issues discussed at \n     these briefings, so it can be determined whether you complied \n     with the letter and spirit of the National Security Act of \n     1947?\n           Sincerely,\n     Harry Reid,\n       Democratic Leader.\n     John D. Rockefeller IV,\n       Vice Chairman, Select Committee on Intelligence.\n     Patrick Leahy,\n       Ranking Democrat, Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, according to the Book of Mark, Jesus asked \nthis question: ``For what shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the \nwhole world, and lose his own soul?'' Mark 8:36.\n  I would ask the President of the United States a similar question--\nwhat good is it to expand the power of the President, if in the process \nyou erode the fundamental freedoms guaranteed by the U.S. Constitution?\n  Last week, we learnd--from a New York Times report and then from \nPresident Bush himself--that since September 11, 2001, the President of \nthe United States has authorized the National Security Agency to \nconduct electronic surveillance of American citizens on American soil \nwithout resort to the procedures of the Foreign Intelligence \nSurveillance Act.\n  Today we learn, contrary to assurances by administration officials, \nthat the NSA has also conducted warrantless surveillance of purely \ndomestic phone calls because of the technical difficulties of \ndetermining the physical location of a particular telephone.\n  There is still much that we do not know about this secret program and \nmuch that we do not know about the purported legal basis for it. In \nbriefing the press on Tuesday, the Attorney General noted that people \ncriticizing the administration are proffering opinions based on ``very \nlimited information,'' and that such critics ``probably don't have the \ninformation about our legal analysis.''\n  But we do know this: for the past 4 years, the Bush administration \nhas aggressively sought to expand the power of the President beyond \nrecognition. In the face of this campaign, a Republican Congress has \nlargely stood idle, reluctant to exercise its constitutional duty of \noversight.\n  The Framers provided for a system of checks and balances in the \nConstitution for one simple reason: to protect against abuse of power \nby any branch of government in order to protect our personal freedoms.\n  In its zeal to expand the power of the President, the Bush \nadministration's actions have threatened the fabric of the \nConstitution. These are hardly the actions of a self-described \nconservative who professes to want to reduce the power of the National \nGovernment.\n  It would be one thing if the President's actions to expand \nPresidential power reflected sound judgment and wisdom. But again and \nagain, the President's overreaching in the name of security has been \nprofoundly misguided, and has undermined support for the war against \nal-Qaida at home and abroad; in his decision to create special military \ntribunals for al-Qaida suspects held in Guantanamo Bay, a system that \nhas yet to produce a complete trial, in his decision to authorize \nsecret prisons abroad holding terrorist suspects--including, \napparently, using facilities once operated by Soviet Intelligence \nagencies; in his decision to play fast and loose with time-tested \nstandards against torture; and now in his decision to unilaterally \nauthorize secret wiretaps of Americans without a court order.\n  Without more information from the Executive, it is difficult to judge \nthe legality of the President's secret spying program. I call on the \nAttorney General, therefore, to provide the necessary information by \npromptly releasing the legal opinions governing this program--so that \nthe Congress and the American people can assess the propriety of the \nPresident's actions. And I call on the Director of National \nIntelligence to promptly provide full and complete briefings to the \nappropriate congressional committees on the scope and operation of this \nprogram.\n  What is clear today is that the President of the United States \ndecided to create a new system outside the framework of the Foreign \nIntelligence Surveillance Act of 1978--a framework that Congress \ndesigned to be comprehensive for electronic surveillance of foreign \npowers and agents of foreign powers. It is this framework on which I \nwill focus my remarks today.\n  The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, or FISA, was enacted in \n1978 after a 3-year effort to do so.\n  As stated in the report of the Senate Select Committee on \nIntelligence, the purpose of the law was to provide regulation for \n``all electronic surveillance conducted within the United States for \nforeign intelligence purposes'' in order to provide a check against \nabuses that had been revealed by the investigation of the Church \nCommittee.\n  The bill was a bipartisan product; in the Senate, the original \nversion introduced in 1977 that served as the basis of the 1978 law was \nsponsored by Senators across the ideological spectrum--including Birch \nBayh, Ted Kennedy, Mac Mathias, James Eastland, and Strom Thurmond. The \nSenate ultimately adopted the bill on April 20, 1978, by a strong, \nbipartisan vote of 95 to 1. At the time the bill was approved in the \nSenate, I stated that it ``was a reaffirmation of the principle that it \nis possible to protect national security and at the same time the Bill \nof Rights.'' I was also a member of the conference committee that \nproduced the final version of the law that was enacted with broad \nsupport in October 1978.\n\n  Here is what we did in 1978. FISA was designed to govern our \ncollection of ``foreign intelligence.'' Typically, in the criminal \ncontext, search warrants can only be issued if the Government can \ndemonstrate to a neutral judge that probable cause exists to believe a \ncrime has been committed.\n  Under FISA, surveillance orders are issued so long as probable cause \nexists that someone is an ``agent of a foreign power.'' That term has \nbeen expanded in the last year to even include a lone wolf terrorist; \nin other words, someone not affiliated with a known terrorist \norganization.\n  Not only is the standard different under FISA, but the FISA process \nis done in secret, with a special court known as the Foreign \nIntelligence Surveillance Court. This is a court made up of Federal \njudges who sit on U.S. district courts. I should parenthetically note \nthat we learned today that one of the 11 judges on this court just \nresigned in reaction to President Bush's unilateral domestic spying \nprogram.\n  When we wrote FISA, we knew there could be times when the President \nwould have to act quickly. We knew there would be times when probable \ncause would have to be demonstrated to the FISA court after the \nsurveillance began. We contemplated emergencies and wrote the law so \nthat it could deal with them.\n  First, we addressed emergency situations in section 105(f) of the \nact, which provides that if the Attorney General reasonably determines \nthat an emergency situation exists--and that his investigators need to \ntarget a wiretap against an agent before an application can be made to \nthe FISA Court--he may do so for 72 hours. The original act provided \nfor only a 24-hour emergency\n\n[[Page S14279]]\n\nperiod, but Congress expanded that period to 72 hours in December \n2001--after the attacks on 9/11. Similarly, in enacting the Patriot Act \nin 2001, Congress provided other changes to FISA.\n  It is therefore difficult to accept the contention of the Attorney \nGeneral that Congress has been unwilling to help the President meet the \nchallenges we now face.\n  The law is clear on the steps the Attorney General needs to take to \nwiretap suspects without first obtaining a warrant: he must tell a FISA \nCourt judge at the time of the authorization that he has taken such \nemergency measures, and he has to apply for post-hoc approval as soon \nas is practicable but not later than 72 hours after the surveillance \nhas commenced.\n  We envisioned another emergency that could authorize warrantless \nintelligence searches: a declaration of war. Section 111 lets the \nAttorney General authorize electronic surveillance without a court \norder to acquire foreign intelligence information for up to 15 calendar \ndays following a declaration of war by Congress. Although the \n``Authorization for the Use of Military Force'' approved just after 9/\n11 was not, technically speaking, a declaration of war, it was the \nconstitutional equivalent under the war clause to permit the use of \nforce in Afghanistan, and the President would have been justified to \nexercise these extraordinary surveillance powers in the first 2 weeks \nafter enactment of the joint resolution.\n  It is also important to note that FISA, on its own terms, set up a \ncomprehensive and exclusive system for domestic wiretapping. Section \n2511(2)(f) of Title 18, United States Code, states that FISA, when \ncombined with wiretap authority for domestic criminal investigations, \nis the ``exclusive means by which . . . the interception of domestic \nwire, oral and electronic communications may be conducted.''\n  That is why George Will recently had this to say about the \nadministration's tortured legal reasoning, ``The President's \nauthorization of domestic surveillance by the National Security Agency \ncontravened a statute's clear language.''\n  It is also worth looking at how the FISA system has operated \nthroughout its 27 years of existence. I would submit that it has served \nus well.\n  To those who would say it is too restrictive on our ability to gain \nintelligence, I would respond that the FISA Court has only rejected 5 \napplications out of approximately 19,000.\n  To those who would say that the system is too lenient, I would \nrespond that the important piece of the equation with FISA is that it \nhas some independent review of the executive branch--in this instance, \nby an independent Article III judge.\n  And yet, even with a history of a FISA court that approves the \noverwhelming majority of applications, and even with the two emergency \nexceptions, there are some who still argue that the administration \nneeds additional flexibility.\n  For example, there are some who would say that FISA wouldn't allow us \nto tap the phone numbers found in the cell phone of a top al-Qaida \ntarget. With all due respect, a phone number found in a top al-Qaida \noperative's cell phone would seem to me to comfortably satisfy the \n``probable cause'' standard outlined above. And if there were an urgent \nneed to tap these phone numbers promptly--as I am sure there would be--\nno one has explained why this couldn't be done under the 72-hour \nemergency exception.\n  Rather, we have the disturbing spectacle of the Deputy Director of \nNational Intelligence, General Hayden, complaining that ``FISA involves \nmarshaling arguments . . . FISA involves looping paperwork around.''\n  Exactly right. FISA isn't a high hurdle--but it does require the \nexecutive branch to justify the extraordinary surveillance of American \ncitizens to a judicial officer. Isn't this the rule of law that we are \nfighting to defend? And when FISA has needed updating over its 27-year \nexistence, Congress has, time and time again, stepped up to the plate.\n  When we first enacted FISA, its scope was limited to wiretapping and \nother electronic eavesdropping. It has since been amended to authorize \npen/trap orders and business record orders; in reaction to the Zacarias \nMoussaoui case, Congress created the so-called ``lone wolf'' provision; \nafter 9/11, we extended the emergency period from 24 to 72 hours; and \nthe list goes on and on.\n  If additional changes need to be made to FISA, this Senator stands \nready and willing to engage in that exercise.\n  The alternative is the course on which the President has embarked, \ndirectly contravening a specific statute and relying on a dangerously \nexpansive view of his Commander in Chief authority--a view that would \npotentially expose thousands of Americans who make a phone call abroad \nto surveillance of this sort. This is a course that we tried to avoid \nwhen we drafted the FISA Act in the first place. As I said in 1978 when \nFISA was originally passed, ``it is not necessary to compromise civil \nliberties in the name of national security.'' I hope the lessons from \n1978 and the real story about what FISA allows can inform the debate \ngoing on today.\n  This debate is just beginning. Congress must stand up to this \nPresidential overreaching, examine what occurred, and provide \ncorrective action. Senator Specter, the Chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee, has promised to hold hearings on this matter. I commend him \nfor that.\n  But we will need the full cooperation of the Executive in this \nundertaking, and the administration can start by coming clean with the \nfull legal reasoning for the President's domestic spying program.\n  There will be much more to say--and learn--in the second session of \nthe 109th Congress. The executive branch's program must be subjected to \nclose scrutiny by this Congress to ensure that in pursuit of terrorists \nor suspected terrorists, we are not sacrificing essential freedoms that \nwe hold dear.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, more than 50 years ago, Justice Robert \nJackson said:\n\n       With all its defects, delays and inconveniences, men have \n     discovered no technique for long preserving free government \n     except that the Executive be under the law, and that the law \n     be made by parliamentary deliberations.\n\n  I am deeply troubled by recent revelations that the President of the \nUnited States has apparently personally authorized spying on the \nprivate phone conversations of Americans without court approval, as is \nrequired by law. The President's decision to ignore the law Congress \nwrote and bypass the special court we created raises profound concerns \nthat deserve our immediate attention.\n  Yesterday, I joined several of my colleagues in requesting a joint \ninquiry into the President's actions by the Senate Intelligence and \nJudiciary Committees.\n  Checks and balances are the bedrock of our system of government. In \n1978, when Congress passed the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act to \npermit the Government to seek court orders to tap the phones of people \nin the United States, Congress put in the law a check--the FISA Court--\non the executive branch's authority.\n  Since 1979 the FISA Court has approved nearly 19,000 applications for \nFISA wiretaps. The Court has rejected only a handful.\n  Last year, at a speech in Buffalo, NY, the President explicitly cited \nthe need for a court order as a reason why Americans should have \nconfidence that their civil liberties are being protected. He said:\n\n       Any time you hear the United States government talking \n     about wiretap, it requires--a wiretap requires a court order. \n     Nothing has changed, by the way. When we're talking about \n     chasing down terrorists, we're talking about getting a court \n     order before we do so. It's important for our fellow citizens \n     to understand . . . constitutional guarantees are in place \n     when it comes to doing what is necessary to protect our \n     homeland, because we value the Constitution.\n\n  But now the President acknowledges that 4 years ago, he authorized \nwiretaps on Americans without court review. Now he asserts that he has \nthe authority--without court approval--to order the wiretaps himself \nand we now know that the Government was conducting warrantless wiretaps \nwhen the President made the statement in Buffalo.\n  If the court isn't consulted, where is the check on executive power?\n  The President has said that he consults with executive branch lawyers \nand has briefed Congressional leaders about the domestic spying \nprogram. But to suggest that consulting with executive branch lawyers \nis a check on\n\n[[Page S14280]]\n\nExecutive Branch authority demonstrates a fundamental misunderstanding \nof the concept of checks and balances. And notifying a few members of \nCongress--if that is in fact what the administration did--is not the \ncheck provided by law. That check is the court.\n  In the conference report that accompanied the FISA law, Congress made \nthe Supreme Court the only body that could authorize electronic \nsurveillance by the executive branch not explicitly authorized by the \nFISA law. The conference report said:\n\n       The conferees agree that the establishment by this act of \n     exclusive means by which the President may conduct electronic \n     surveillance does not foreclose a different decision by the \n     Supreme Court . . .\n\n  Executive Order 12333, issued by President Reagan in 1981, recognizes \nFISA as the governing law for foreign intelligence wiretaps. It \nprovides that:\n\n       Electronic surveillance, as defined in the Foreign \n     Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978, shall be conducted in \n     accordance with that Act, as well as this Order.\n\n  And, under FISA itself, a person is actually guilty of a crime if he \nengages in electronic surveillance except as authorized by statute.\n\n       A person is guilty of an offense if he intentionally--(1) \n     engages in electronic surveillance under color of law except \n     as authorized by statute.\n\n  The President has not provided any legal opinion that supports his \nclaim of authority.\n  On Monday, the President said that the targets of the spying are \n``those that are known al Qaeda ties and/or affiliates.'' But the FISA \nlaw says that wiretap orders may be issued by the court if there is \nprobable cause to believe that the target of the wiretap is a foreign \npower or an agent of a foreign power. If the targets of the spying have \nknown al Qaeda ties, why didn't he get a FISA court order?\n  The President has also tried to justify the warrantless spying by \nsaying ``Sometimes we have to move very, very quickly.'' That is true. \nIn some cases we do have to move quickly. But the FISA law addresses \nsuch occasions. It explicitly allows the Attorney General, to issue \nemergency wiretap orders without first obtaining court approval. His \nwiretap application need only be filed with the FISA court within 72 \nhours after surveillance is authorized.\n  The President claims that he has authority under the Constitution to \nauthorize wiretaps without court approval as required by law. Yet he \nrefuses to provide any legal opinions justifying that view.\n  The Attorney General is quoted in the Washington Post as saying \n``This is not a backdoor approach . . . We believe Congress has \nauthorized this kind of surveillance'' and he points to the \nAuthorization for Use of Military Force passed by Congress in September \n2001 as a source of Congressional authorization.\n  That Resolution states:\n\n       That the President is authorized to use all necessary and \n     appropriate force against those nations, organizations, or \n     persons he determines planned, authorized, committed, or \n     aided the terrorist attacks that occurred on September 11, \n     2001, or harbored such organizations or persons, in order to \n     prevent any future acts of international terrorism against \n     the United States by such nations, organizations or persons.\n\n  The assertion that ``necessary and appropriate force'' includes the \nauthority to wiretap American citizens in the United States, is, on its \nface, without merit. And again, the President has not provided any \nlegal opinion that would support that interpretation.\n  The Attorney General undermined his own statement that the Congress \nauthorized warrantless wiretaps by telling the Post that the President \nhad contemplated asking Congress to pass legislation granting him that \nauthority but decided against it because it ``would be difficult, if \nnot impossible'' to pass. Taken together, the two statements of the \nAttorney General make no sense. He asserts both that Congress \nauthorized the wiretapping and that it never would. The Attorney \nGeneral is trying to have it both ways. We need some straight answers.\n  So, why wasn't the FISA law followed?\n  Just this morning, the Washington Post reported that General Michael \nHayden the head of the National Security Agency--the agency the \nPresident has charged with carrying out the spying--suggested that \ngetting retroactive court approval is inefficient because it ``involves \nmarshaling arguments'' and ``looping paperwork around.''\n  I would remind General Hayden--and the President for that matter--of \nsomething else Justice Jackson said. He said:\n\n       The doctrine of the separation of powers was adopted by the \n     Convention of 1787, not to promote efficiency but to preclude \n     the exercise of arbitrary power.\n\n  Just as troubling as General Hayden's reason for bypassing FISA is \nthe Post's report that the decision to tap a phone without a warrant \n``requires only the approval of a shift supervisor.''\n  That is outrageous. We don't let shift supervisors at the airport \ndecide to stop screening passengers for explosives. And we shouldn't \nlet shift supervisors at the NSA decide whether to abide by the law or \nnot.\n  The President says that this is a different era and a different type \nof war. And he is right. But this is the same country, with the same \nConstitution, and the same system of checks and balances that have \nserved us so well for more than 200 years. And even Presidents are not \nabove the law.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise to speak on the PATRIOT Act \nReauthorization conference report.\n  I voted for the original legislation in 2001. Along with 98 of my \ncolleagues, I supported that bill because I decided that on balance, \nthe PATRIOT Act it would enhance our Nation's ability to fight \nterrorism without substantially encroaching on our citizens' civil \nliberties. At the same time, I and many of our colleagues understood \nthat aspects of the law should be revisited. For that reason, a number \nof provisions were set to sunset on December 31, 2005. After careful, \nbipartisan review of these provisions, it became evidence to many of us \nthat certain improvements are necessary to maintain the balance between \nfighting terrorism and protecting civil liberties. For that reason, I \njoined with a bipartisan group of Senators to cosponsor the SAFE Act, \nwhich would have modestly reformed the 2001 PATRIOT Act to provide \nprocedural safeguards and increase judicial review.\n  In July of this year, the Senate unanimously passed a PATRIOT Act \nreauthorization bill. While that bill was not perfect, it took \nsignificant steps to fix shortcomings in the current law and strength \nour Nation's ability to fight terrorism while still protecting the \ncivil liberties that are the cornerstone of a free and secure \ndemocratic society. The House also passed a reauthorization bill, which \ndid not come as close to reaching this goal. Conferees were appointed \nto work out a compromise.\n  Prior to the Thanksgiving recess, a draft PATRIOT Act reauthorization \nconference report was circulated by conferees. At the urging of several \nSenators, Senator Specter and others took the conference report back to \nthe conferees to try to negotiate additional modifications. They are to \nbe commended for their efforts to reach a compromise that would earn \nbroad bipartisan support.\n  When the conference was concluded, a number of our colleagues, \nincluding Senators Leahy, Kennedy, Rockefeller, and Levin declined to \nsign the conference report due to their exclusion from key negotiations \nand their conclusion that the conference report failed to sufficiently \nmeet the dual objective of combating terrorism and defending freedoms.\n  While I believe that the conference report is an improvement over \ncurrent law, the provisions related to section 215, national security \nletters, and roving wiretaps have still given me pause. First, under \nsection 215, also called the business records provision, current law \nallows the Justice Department to obtain medical records, business \nrecords, library records, or other tangible items of individuals by \nmerely showing that the items are relevant to a terrorism \ninvestigation. The unanimously agreed upon Senate bill requires that \nthe Government show that a person whose records are sought have some \nconnection to a suspected terrorist or spy organization. Unfortunately, \nthe conference report differs from the Senate version as it maintains \nthe minimal standard of relevance without a requirement of fact \nconnecting the\n\n[[Page S14281]]\n\nrecords sought, or the individual, suspected of terrorist activity. \nAdditionally, the conference report does not impose any limit on the \nbreadth of the records that can be requested or how long those records \ncan be kept by the Government.\n  Under the current PATRIOT Act, an individual who receives a section \n215 order to turn over business records is prohibited from telling \nanyone about the order. This is referred to as a ``gag order.'' The \nconference report is an improvement over current law as it explicitly \ngrants the right for a suspect to consult with an attorney regarding \nthis ``gag order'' but unlike the Senate version, the conference report \nalso requires an individual who receives a Section 215 order to notify \nthe FBI if he consults with an attorney and to identify the attorney.\n  Second, under current law, the FBI can issue a national security \nletter--``NSL''--without the approval of a judge, grand jury, or \nprosecutor, to obtain certain types of sensitive information about \ninnocent individuals. Similar to a 215 order, the targeted individual \nis restricted by a gag order. While the conference report does provide \nthe right to challenge the NSL demand, it also requires the court to \naccept as conclusive the Government's assertion that a gag order should \nnot be lifted, unless the court determines the Government is acting in \nbad faith.\n  I also find it troubling that the conference report would give the \nGovernment the authority to keep all evidence secret from an individual \nwho is challenging a 215 order or an NSL order. For example, if an \nattorney wants to challenge an order to turn over the business records \nof a client on the grounds of attorney/client privilege, they would not \nbe allowed to see the evidence the Government had requested or the \nreasoning behind the request. It is also important to note that the \nrecipient of a Section 215 ``business records'' order or an NSL order \nis usually not the subject of investigation. For example, a doctor \ncould receive a Section 215 order from law enforcement to reveal the \nmedical records of a patient. Under this conference report, that \npatient would not even receive notice that the Government had obtained \nhis personal information and would never have the opportunity to \nchallenge the use of that information in a trial.\n  Third, I would like to address ``roving wiretaps.'' A ``roving \nwiretap'' is a tap on any telephone that a suspect uses, moving from \none telephone to another, with no particular locational target. Under \nthe PATRIOT Act, the FBI is authorized to engage in roving wiretaps \nwithout court approval. The Senate bill mandated that a roving wiretap \ninclude sufficient information to describe the specific person to be \nwiretapped with ``particularity.'' ``Particularity'' is a legal term of \nart describing the place or places to be searched, the person or \npersons, thing or things to be seized, the communication to be \nintercepted, and the nature of evidence to be obtained. The conference \nreport does not include that requirement and it does not require the \nGovernment to determine whether the target of a roving intelligence \nwiretap is present before beginning surveillance. Without this level of \nspecification it is easy to see how roving wiretaps could be abused to \nsecretly record the conversations of Americans without their knowledge \nor consent.\n  However, I would also like to note that the conference report is an \nimprovement over current law as it includes a number of comprehensive \npublic reporting and auditing requirements which would help prevent \nabuse of section 215 orders and to help preserve civil liberties. \nAdditionally, the conference report also maintains provisions from the \nSenate bill that address the shortcomings of current law, including \nexpressly permitting the recipient of the national security letter or a \nsection 215 order to consult with an attorney, requiring the Government \nto notify a target of a warrantless search within a set number of days, \nand limiting the use of roving wiretaps to those cases in which the FBI \nincludes a ``specific'' description of the target and ``specific facts \nin the application'' that show the target's actions may thwart \nconventional surveillance efforts.\n  The PATRIOT Act Reauthorization conference report passed the House by \na vote to 251-174 on December 14 and was brought to the Senate floor \nfor debate. On December 16, Senator Frist attempted to invoke cloture \nto bring this body to a vote on the conference report. Cloture was not \ninvoked. I was necessarily absent from the Senate for health reasons.\n  Since then I have joined 47 of my colleagues in cosponsoring S. 2082. \nThe bipartisan legislation, introduced by Senators Sununu and Leahy, \nwould provide a 3-month extension of the expiring provisions of the \nPATRIOT Act. Unfortunately, Senator Frist has said he will not permit a \nvote on it; the House leadership has said they will not bring it to the \nfloor for a vote; and the Bush administration has stated that, even if \nthe extension were to pass both the House and the Senate, President \nBush would refuse to sign it. My fellow colleagues have asked this body \nmore than a half dozen times to allow this 3-month extension to come to \nthe floor. They have been denied this opportunity. This is playing \npolitics with an extremely important law that protects our citizens \nfrom terrorism.\n  Earlier this week, the President, in speaking of the PATRIOT Act, \nsaid, ``in a war on terror, we cannot afford to be without this law for \na single moment.'' I agree with his statement. That is why there is no \nreason why the President and those on the other side of the aisle \nshould refuse to extend this important law. This is why I remain \nhopeful that the majority leader will set aside politics and allow this \nextension to occur. Law enforcement officials should not be without \nthese important tools to fight terrorism for even a single moment. We \nwould then have the opportunity to return after the holidays to address \nthese areas of concern and hopefully pass a bipartisan bill that would \nenhance our ability to fight terrorism without substantially \nencroaching on our civil liberties.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the bill is read a \nthird time and passed, and the motion to reconsider is laid upon the \ntable.\n  The bill (S. 2167) was read a third time and passed, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2167\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, notwithstanding the previous order, I \nask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the consideration of \nthe conference report to accompany H.R. 3010, that the conference \nreport be agreed to, and the motion to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the conference report by \ntitle.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A conference report to accompany H.R. 3010 making \n     appropriations for Departments of Labor, Health and Human \n     Services and Education, and for other purposes.\n       There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider \n     the conference report.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I rise today to call attention to a provision \ncontained in the conference report to H.R. 3010, the fiscal year 2006 \nappropriations bill for Departments of Labor, HHS, and Education. I am \npleased to see that House and Senate conferees were able to provide \n$100 million for the Teacher Incentive Fund. The Teacher Incentive Fund \nwas first proposed in the President's fiscal year 2006 budget, and will \noffer an appropriate incentive to States and local education agencies \nto advance the goals of the No Child Left Behind Act.\n  The No Child Left Behind Act, enacted 4 years ago, raised \nexpectations for students and teachers. Students are expected to raise \ntheir achievement level, and teachers are accountable for reaching the \nspecific goals. The Teacher Incentive Fund is an appropriate follow up \nto the No Child Left Behind\n\n[[Page S14282]]\n\nAct. It is a pilot program for States and school districts to provide \nadditional compensation to teachers who make a measurable impact on \nraising student achievement. Under this incentive program, Federal \nfunds would be available to States and local school districts for the \npurpose of developing new compensation systems to reward teachers who \nraise achievement and to provide an incentive to attract effective \nteachers to what the Department of Education calls high-need schools. \nThese are schools with high poverty rates and poor performance on State \nassessments. The Teacher Incentive Fund provides States and school \ndistricts with another tool to raise teacher quality and, thus, close \nthe achievement gap, which, of course is the primary goal of the No \nChild Left Behind Act.\n  In October, the Senate Republican Policy Committee, of which I am the \nchairman, released a policy paper in support of merit pay for teachers \nin general and the Teacher Incentive Fund specifically. The paper, \ntitled ``Teachers Are Key to Success of `No Child Left Behind' Act: \nBetter Pay for Better Teaching,'' discusses research in support of \nmerit pay for teachers, and the success merit pay programs have \nachieved.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this paper be printed in \nthe Record following my remarks.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n Teachers Are Key to Success of `No Child Left Behind' Act: Better Pay \n                          for Better Teaching\n\n\n                              Introduction\n\n       Enacted four years ago, the No Child Left Behind (NCLB) Act \n     raised expectations for students and teachers. Students are \n     expected to raise their achievement level, and teachers are \n     accountable for reaching the specific goals. As such, it is \n     appropriate to reward and acknowledge those teachers who, by \n     working harder and smarter, have achieved measurable success \n     in their classrooms.\n       President Bush has proposed a pilot program for states and \n     school districts to provide additional compensation to \n     teachers who make a measurable impact on raising student \n     achievement. Under this incentive program, federal funds \n     would be available for the purpose of developing new \n     compensation systems to reward teachers who raise \n     achievement, and to provide an incentive to attract effective \n     teachers to what the Department of Education calls ``high-\n     need'' schools, which are schools with high poverty rates and \n     poor performance on state assessments.\n       In response to the President's proposal, the House of \n     Representatives included an incentive pay program for \n     teachers in its Fiscal Year 2006 appropriations bill that \n     funds the Department of Education (H.R. 3010). The House-\n     passed program, like the one proposed by the President, is a \n     voluntary pilot program available to interested states and \n     school districts. The Senate-reported bill does not contain \n     such a provision.\n       Some observers may be concerned that using federal dollars \n     for anything related to teacher pay is an inappropriate \n     intrusion of the federal government into an area that is \n     historically the jurisdiction of states and local school \n     districts. However, supporters of this concept view it in the \n     context of a natural follow-up to the four-year-old NCLB. \n     That law placed new accountability requirements upon schools; \n     thus, it is argued, it is now appropriate for the federal \n     government to make available financial incentives for \n     teachers who help meet those requirements. The concept of the \n     President's proposal and the House plan is to provide states \n     and school districts with another tool to raise teacher \n     quality and close the achievement gap, which stand as the \n     foundation of NCLB.\n       According to a November 2004 national survey, 80 percent of \n     the public supports salary increases for teachers who raise \n     student achievement. However, some observers suggest that \n     teachers' unions oppose anything that might be construed as \n     merit pay. At least one observer notes that union opposition \n     stands in the way of local districts implementing merit pay \n     systems on a larger scale. For example, in California, in \n     response to Governor Schwarzenegger's proposal to introduce \n     merit pay for teachers, the state's largest teachers' union \n     sought to impose a dues hike on its members to help raise \n     ``tens of millions of dollars'' to combat merit pay and other \n     budget initiatives. A federal pilot program, such as the one \n     proposed by the President, may be necessary to allow public \n     schools to overcome teachers' unions' opposition to \n     implementing a compensation program that links teacher \n     performance and student outcomes. The pilot program would \n     provide funds directly to state and local educational \n     agencies to allow this concept--one that has already proven \n     successful in other schools--the chance to prove itself and \n     build support within the community. This was the case in \n     Little Rock, Arkansas. Merit-pay bonuses were paid in the \n     first year by an anonymous donor; the next year, the school \n     district, pleased with the results of the first year, voted \n     to use its own funds to pay performance bonuses.\n\n\n                  Background: An Antiquated Pay System\n\n       Today, the majority of teachers in the United States are \n     compensated through a ``single salary schedule,'' which bases \n     teachers' pay on their years of experience and their \n     education credits and degrees. According to the National \n     Center for Education Statistics, 96 percent of all public \n     school districts utilize a single-salary schedule for teacher \n     pay. The system was designed in the 1920s to ensure fairness \n     among elementary school teachers, who were mostly women, and \n     secondary teachers, who were mostly men. Critics contend that \n     this pay system fails teachers and students as it does \n     nothing to reward excellence. Indeed, it promotes equal pay \n     for unequal performance. Under the current system, an \n     increase for one teacher means an increase for all. The \n     following table shows the Denver Public Schools' salary \n     schedule as offered by Brad Jupp, education author and member \n     of the Denver Classroom Teachers Association. According to \n     Jupp, it is an example of a ``typical single-salary \n     schedule'' used for paying teachers.\n\n                 FIGURE 1.--DENVER'S SALARY SCHEDULE \\1\\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                       B.A.         M.A.      Doctorate\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nNew Hire.........................      $31,320      $31,779\nStep 1...........................       32,971       33,454      $39,169\nStep 2...........................       33,073       33,697       40,903\nStep 3...........................       33,225       35,101       42,642\nStep 4...........................       33,480       36,503       44,377\nStep 5...........................       33,785       38,053       46,251\nStep 6...........................       33,988       39,671       48,219\nStep 7...........................       35,421       41,337       50,290\nStep 8...........................       36,912       43,087       52,449\nStep 9...........................       38,456       44,924       54,702\nStep 10..........................       40,092       46,860       57,057\nStep 11..........................       41,784       48,843       59,521\nStep 12..........................       43,566       50,944       62,082\nStep 13..........................       45,546       53,401       64,919\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\1\\ With relatively low starting salaries and guaranteed raises over\n  time, the current Denver Public Schools salary schedule is typical of\n  compensation schemes for teachers. Each step represents a year of\n  teaching.\nSource: Denver Public Schools.\n\n       Proponents of changing teacher compensation argue that the \n     single-salary schedule deprives public school administrators \n     of the ability to adjust an individual teacher's pay to \n     reflect performance, attract sought-after skills, and assure \n     that teaching positions in low-income schools are filled by \n     high performers. For example, many school systems struggle to \n     fill teaching positions in fields that command high salaries \n     outside of education, such as math and science. The rigidity \n     of the single-salary schedule prevents them from addressing \n     this shortage in the obvious way--by raising pay in these \n     specialties. Likewise, few school systems provide extra \n     compensation to teachers who work with disadvantaged \n     students. Therefore, experienced teachers often use their \n     seniority to transfer to more attractive schools, leaving the \n     neediest students with more inexperienced teachers.\n       With such obvious flaws in this rigid pay system, why don't \n     states and local school districts reform their pay practices \n     for teachers? The short answer is teachers' unions. Unions \n     defend the single-salary schedule in the name of employee \n     equity and fairness, and oppose changes that rely on student \n     performance as a measure of a teacher's effectiveness. \n     Furthermore, teachers' unions, particularly the National \n     Education Association, have opposed merit pay systems because \n     they place the union in an awkward position: ``For every \n     teacher awarded merit pay, ten others will want the union to \n     file a grievance alleging that they deserved merit pay more \n     than the teacher who received it.''\n\n\n                   Why Merit Pay Enhances NCLB Goals\n\n       The No Child Left Behind Act requires that all students \n     become proficient in reading and math, and that the \n     achievement gap between students of different socio-economic \n     backgrounds be closed. Schools that do not make progress must \n     provide supplemental services,\n\n[[Page S14283]]\n\n     such as free tutoring, and/or offering the option of choosing \n     another public school. They must also take corrective action \n     with regard to the way the school is run. The law, \n     recognizing that high-quality, effective teachers are a \n     necessary component to obtaining these results, established \n     certain teacher-quality requirements for states, including \n     the requirement that core academic subjects be taught by \n     ``highly qualified teachers.'' And while federal funds \n     already are in place for professional training and \n     development to help states and school districts meet this \n     requirement, that program alone may be insufficient. The \n     General Accounting Office (GAO) reported in 2003 that state \n     and district officials are hindered in their ability to \n     obtain all highly qualified teachers for a number of reasons, \n     including ``the lack of incentive pay programs.''\n       In keeping with the rationale that teachers are the key to \n     the success of NCLB's goals, and so should be rewarded for \n     meeting them, the President proposed a $500 million Teacher \n     Incentive Fund as part of his FY 2006 budget request. This \n     formula grant program is for states and school districts that \n     choose to reward effective teachers--those who are closing \n     the achievement gap for students in schools most in need, and \n     those who otherwise are meeting NCLB annual targets for \n     student achievement. Under the President's proposal, states \n     would be authorized to create a statewide system to reward \n     these teachers, and to provide grant money to local school \n     districts in order to recruit highly qualified teachers to \n     high-need schools. Additionally, the President requested that \n     a portion of the funds be used for competitive grants for the \n     development and implementation of performance-based teacher \n     compensation systems in order to aid school districts that \n     choose to change to such a system.\n       H.R. 3010, the House-passed Fiscal Year 2006 appropriations \n     bill for the Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, \n     and Education, and Related Agencies, included $100 million \n     for a pilot Teacher Incentive Fund program available to \n     states willing to develop and implement innovative ways to \n     provide financial incentives for teachers (and also \n     principals) who raise student achievement and close the \n     achievement gap. In the interest of ensuring that the states \n     remain in control of this issue--and are committed to it--the \n     bill requires states and schools to pay for an increasing \n     share of the total cost of the project in subsequent years \n     with non-federal funds. And, in order to assure that workable \n     plans can be implemented elsewhere, the bill requires the \n     Department of Education to assess each project through an \n     independent evaluator, and then share these assessments with \n     other interested parties.\n       It is important to note that the proposals of both the \n     President and the House allow state and local schools a great \n     deal of latitude in how they develop merit pay plans. For \n     example, they may include additional measures and goals, \n     combined with student performance, but the fundamental shift \n     would be that the merit pay systems consider outputs, such as \n     student achievement, rather than only inputs, such as the \n     number of courses a teacher takes.\n       The provisions in the House funding bill were applauded by \n     the chairman of the Department of Education's authorizing \n     committee who noted, ``The federal government is spending \n     tens of billions of dollars a year on K-12 education \n     programs. States and schools ought to be allowed to use at \n     least a fraction of that money to provide financial rewards \n     for highly qualified teachers and principals who are working \n     successfully to raise student achievement.'' Chairman John \n     Boehner (R-OH) also noted that the funds provided in the \n     House bill are not new, but are being diverted from existing \n     funds that were used for what he termed ``less effective \n     programs.'' Meanwhile, the Senate-reported appropriations \n     bill that funds the Department of Education (as reported on \n     July 14), does not include a similar provision.\n\n\n                     Merit Pay is Soundly Supported\n\n       Support for the use of merit pay in public education has \n     not been limited to one political party. In addition to the \n     support of the President and House Republicans noted above, \n     the 2004 Democratic Presidential candidate, John Kerry (D-\n     MA), voiced his support. In his policy plan, ``A Great \n     Teacher for Every Child,'' the candidate stated that \n     ``teachers should be rewarded for demonstrating more skill or \n     better results.''\n       Another Democratic advocate is former Clinton \n     Administration official Joel Klein, now Chancellor of the New \n     York City public schools. According to Chancellor Klein, \n     ``Our system is built on principles of non-meritocracy and \n     non-differentiation, and those two principles are killing us. \n     At the heart of the problem are the three pillars of civil \n     service: lock-step pay, seniority, and life tenure. Together, \n     they act as handcuffs and prevent us from making the changes \n     that will encourage excellence in our system.''\n       In addition to the bipartisan support it has garnered from \n     elected officials, merit pay for educators is supported by \n     teachers, parents, and education researchers. In November \n     2004, two national surveys were conducted for The Teaching \n     Commission, a private panelled by former IBM chairman Louis \n     Gerstner, Jr. The surveys found that 80 percent of those \n     surveyed support salary increases for ``teachers who improve \n     student achievement, raise teaching standards and increase \n     accountability for teachers.'' The surveys also found that \n     three out of four surveyed support paying higher salaries to \n     teachers willing to serve in high-poverty schools that \n     struggle to attract and retain good teachers. Furthermore, a \n     2003 survey conducted by the research group Public Agenda \n     found that 85 percent of teachers and 72 percent of \n     principals reported that providing financial incentives would \n     ``help a lot'' when it comes to attracting and retaining \n     quality teachers. Similarly, 72 percent of the public \n     supported paying more for those who teach in subjects such as \n     math, science, and special education in order to attract \n     teachers with knowledge in these subjects.\n\n\nReasons to Support Merit Pay for Teachers: Merit Pay Has Proven Results\n\n       A number of school districts have explored merit pay as a \n     means to attract, motivate, and retain high-quality teachers. \n     Below are examples of merit pay systems that proponents point \n     to as promising models.\n       Starting in 1999, the Denver Classroom Teachers Association \n     and the Denver Public Schools agreed to study the \n     relationship between student achievement and teacher \n     compensation. The initial study included a pilot project at \n     16 schools for four years. As a result of the initial pilot \n     program, it was determined that teacher compensation ``could \n     not be based on student achievement alone.'' Therefore, the \n     district and the teacher association formed a task force to \n     design a new comprehensive pay system for teachers. The task \n     force of teachers, school administrators, and local citizens \n     used private funds to develop a system dubbed ``ProComp,'' \n     which linked teacher pay to the school district's \n     instructional mission.\n       Denver's ProComp system has four components that allow \n     teachers to earn additional pay. The first component is \n     ``knowledge and skill,'' which allows teachers to earn \n     additional compensation by completing annual training. The \n     second component is ``professional evaluation,'' which allows \n     salary increases based on evaluation. The third, ``student \n     growth,'' rewards teachers based on the academic achievement \n     of their students. And the fourth is ``market incentives,'' \n     which allows the district to offer additional pay for \n     difficult-to-fill positions.\n       The Denver Board of Education and the teachers' association \n     approved ProComp in 2004. Next, the program will be submitted \n     to Denver voters later this year in order to raise the $25 \n     million needed to finance the system.\n       A second program proving successful is in Chattanooga, \n     Tennessee. In 2001, nine of Tennessee's twenty worst \n     performing schools were located in Chattanooga. The mayor and \n     the school district, with cooperation from the teacher \n     association (with funds provided by two private foundations), \n     devised a plan to address these nine elementary schools, \n     known as the ``Benwood schools.'' To attract highly qualified \n     teachers to teach in the Benwood schools, the group developed \n     a teacher-incentive package. The package included a $5,000 \n     bonus for highly-qualified teachers as defined by student \n     achievement, and a $2,000 annual bonus for every teacher in a \n     school that significantly increased its test scores, among \n     other incentives.\n       The ``Benwood schools'' results are impressive. The \n     percentage of third graders reading at or above grade level \n     rose from 23 percent in 2001 to 36 percent in 2003. Across \n     all grades, the percentage of students at or above grade \n     level in reading/language arts rose from 57 percent in 2003 \n     to 77 percent in 2005. Math achievement increased from 54 \n     percent to 70 percent during the same period. In addition to \n     raising student achievement, the Benwood schools report that \n     filling their teacher positions has been easier, turnover has \n     been reduced, and teacher morale has improved.\n\n\n            Merit Pay Helps With Difficult-to-Fill Positions\n\n       The success of the NCLB depends particularly on raising \n     achievement at high-needs schools, but, as Secretary of \n     Education Margaret Spellings describes it, the current system \n     detracts from that goal: ``We have a system that doesn't give \n     the teachers who want to help these students the support they \n     deserve. While most professions reward those willing to take \n     on the hardest assignments, the public school system often \n     does the opposite. Teachers with the skill and desire to \n     close the achievement gap find themselves drawn away from the \n     schools that need the most help. Many school systems even \n     offer de facto incentives for teachers to leave these \n     schools.'' That is, sometimes experienced teachers use their \n     seniority to transfer to more desirable schools.\n       To address this, a number of school districts have employed \n     merit pay to reward highly qualified teachers who work in \n     designated high-poverty schools. One such program is the \n     Teacher Advancement Program (TAP) developed by the Milken \n     Family Foundation. In addition to merit pay, the TAP system \n     rewards teachers who take on additional responsibilities with \n     additional pay. In Arizona, talented teachers have shown \n     their support for this program by taking jobs at some high-\n     need schools. Of the 61 teachers in one school district who \n     moved to high-need schools, 13 (or 21 percent) came from \n     schools in high socioeconomic areas, schools that are ``among \n     the best in the area.'' Additionally, school districts in \n     Florida, Alabama, Maryland, and Tennessee are offering \n     rewards to qualified teachers who work in designated high-\n     poverty schools. According to the superintendent of one such \n     school district, since the initiative began,\n\n[[Page S14284]]\n\n     ``staffing the urban schools has become much easier.''\n\n\n Merit Pay Raises Teacher Ouality and Treats Teachers as Professionals\n\n       Education research demonstrates that teacher quality is the \n     single most important factor affecting student achievement. \n     That said, one recent study documents a decline in teacher \n     quality--which its authors attribute to lack of financial \n     reward for quality work. Economists Carline Hoxby of Harvard \n     University and Andrew Leigh of Australian National University \n     found that salary distribution for U.S. public school \n     teachers ``has narrowed so dramatically that those with the \n     highest aptitude can expect to earn no more than those with \n     the lowest. This alone accounts for more than three-quarters \n     of the decline in teacher quality.'' According to their \n     research (which used mean SAT scores to define ``aptitude'' \n     and was limited to women), 16 percent of American female \n     teachers in 1963 were of low aptitude, compared to 36 percent \n     in 2000. At the other end the spectrum, only one percent of \n     female teachers in 2000 were high-aptitude, compared to five \n     percent in 1963.\n       This study underscores the assertion that, especially in \n     this highly competitive economy, the single-salary schedule \n     that bases compensation solely on college credits, education \n     degrees, and years of experience does not attract the best \n     and brightest. Highly capable and competent people are more \n     likely to be attracted to a system that rewards individual \n     performance.\n       Teaching is a profession like none other. It is responsible \n     for educating, training, and preparing all others with the \n     skills needed to succeed. As such, it should be held to high \n     standards. Merit pay allows top teachers to be acknowledged \n     for their efforts, provides an incentive to other teachers, \n     and raises the bar of professionalism in teaching. It allows \n     teachers to be held more accountable and judged in relation \n     to their peers. Merit pay brings evaluation of outputs to \n     teaching, a standard used in most professions.\n\n\n           Merit Pay Is More Cost-Effective for the Taxpayers\n\n       Under the current single-salary teacher pay system, a \n     salary increase for one means a salary increase for all. \n     Based on survey data, a majority of the public (71 percent) \n     believes teachers deserve to earn more. However, ``just to \n     bring the salaries in the below-average states to the \n     national average would cost $8.5 billion--an amount that \n     is fiscally irrational.'' Proponents of merit pay note \n     that it would be less costly and would produce greater \n     results to target raises toward the most effective \n     teachers. According to the April 2005 Harris-Hart survey, \n     ``public support for paying the costs of higher teacher \n     salaries is enhanced if higher pay is linked to teacher \n     performance and other accountability measures.''\n\n\n                            Refuting Critics\n\n       Among the criticisms raised by opponents of merit pay is \n     that it inappropriately uses student performance as a measure \n     of a teacher's effectiveness. Yet, as the aforementioned \n     studies show, a merit pay system can be built around a \n     variety of objective and subjective measures, decided at the \n     local level. Successful pay systems can factor in a variety \n     of measures of excellence, including peer and principal \n     review, in addition to student achievement.\n       A parallel issue is outcome-based payments for physicians \n     under Medicare, which is currently under consideration by the \n     Senate Finance Committee. The aim of merit pay for teachers \n     is similar to that of outcome-based payments for physicians. \n     As expressed by Senator Max Baucus (D-MT), that proposal \n     would ``reward better health-care quality with better \n     payment.''\n       Critics also contend that it is unfair to grade teachers \n     and that grading could be subject to favoritism. One only \n     needs to be reminded that testing is a reality in education. \n     If gauging performance is inappropriate, then why do we give \n     grades to students? The typical response, as noted in the \n     Christian Science Monitor, is, ``We give grades because they \n     help us understand which areas need improvement and because \n     they acknowledge superb effort and ability.'' Also, grading \n     based on student performance is not subject to favoritism; \n     grading is simply a reflection of the numbers. A carefully \n     crafted merit pay program with clearly defined measures and \n     expectations should alleviate this concern.\n       Another criticism by opponents is that merit pay plans have \n     not proven successful. A number of merit pay experiments \n     tried in the 1980s are no longer in place. Critics argue that \n     the decline of such programs was due to the difficulties of \n     accurately identifying effective teachers and rewarding good \n     teaching practices. These difficulties have been erased \n     following annual testing of grades three through eight as \n     required by NCLB, which provides objective measures to \n     identify effective teachers. Proponents of change insist the \n     experiments in the 1980s were too limited in scope, and were \n     destined to fail due to the stiff resistance from teachers \n     and unions. The programs running in Denver and Chattanooga \n     are two examples of programs that are yielding positive \n     results. Furthermore, now that NCLB gives parents the choice \n     to transfer out of low-performing public schools, a new sense \n     of competition among schools has emerged that has forced \n     changes in how parents and teachers view public schools.\n       Critics also raise concerns that teachers will ``cherry \n     pick'' the best students to be in their class. Supporters of \n     merit pay note that this concern can largely be addressed by \n     measuring student achievement using ``value-added \n     standards,'' which look at student improvement or gain over \n     the course of the year instead of students' level of \n     achievement at the end of a year. Furthermore, when value-\n     added standards are used, merit pay remains available to \n     teachers of all students. That is, it likely is easier to get \n     a 25-percentile gain from a student starting in the 30th \n     percentile than a 15-percentile gain from a student already \n     at the 80th percentile.\n       Critics of merit pay argue that it damages the school \n     culture when ``superior teachers'' are singled out and given \n     special awards. They note that in competitive industries, \n     both employers and employees must consider the possibility \n     that competing companies will provide better products or \n     services at a lower price, and these incentives ``are not \n     present in public education.'' In response, supporters of \n     merit pay point to its wide and successful use in private \n     schools, which suggests that it is neither infeasible nor \n     unattractive. Private schools note they use merit pay to \n     recruit and retain the quality teachers demanded by tuition-\n     paying parents. This broad use of merit pay by private \n     schools, of course, highlights a critical distinction between \n     public and private schools: such initiatives are ``easier in \n     the private sector because administrators are seldom subject \n     to the constraints imposed by a collective bargaining \n     process.'' Even so, the successes seen in the private schools \n     could point to the direction public schools might take if \n     teachers were rewarded for student achievements.\n       Along the same lines, some critics assert that rewarding \n     some teachers and not others harms teacher collaboration \n     within a school. Yet, this did not prove true in the Denver \n     program. When Denver teachers were asked whether their pilot \n     program had an impact on ``cooperation among teachers,'' the \n     results were that 53 percent of the participating teachers \n     said the impact was positive, and only 2 percent said the \n     impact was negative. According to Brad Jupp, the teacher \n     representative to the ProComp taskforce, the Denver teachers' \n     survey response ``flies in the face of preconceptions that \n     teachers fear pay for performance based on student growth \n     because it will harm collegial relations.'' Furthermore, \n     schools need to reward the best teachers to attract and \n     retain them in the schools that need them the most. According \n     to education researchers Caroline Hoxby and Andrew Leigh, in \n     order to attract high-aptitude individuals back into \n     teaching, ``school districts need to reward teachers in the \n     same way that college graduates are paid in other \n     professions--that is, according to their performance.''\n       The National Education Association argues that, rather than \n     pay increases for some, all teachers should be paid more. \n     However, history shows that there is no direct connection \n     between spending more money on education and increased \n     student achievement. According to the most recent analysis by \n     the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development \n     (OECD) of its member countries' spending on education as a \n     percentage of Gross Domestic Product, the United States \n     spends the second-highest amount. And yet, U.S. student \n     achievement does not match the higher-than-average \n     expenditure. While the proportion of individuals completing \n     high school has been rising in all OECD countries, the rates \n     of students graduating from high school in most OECD \n     countries are now higher than those in the United States. \n     Another study shows a similar lack of correlation. According \n     to the National Center for Education Statistics, the United \n     States outspends the other G-8 countries in per-student \n     expenditures. And yet, fourth-grade students in the United \n     States ranked in the middle of the list of countries in \n     mathematics, and eighth-grade students ranked 15th among the \n     45 countries in mathematics.\n\n\n                               Conclusion\n\n       Expectations are greater now for teachers because the No \n     Child Left Behind Act holds schools accountable for student \n     achievement. Merit pay is a positive way to reward those who \n     are effective in raising student achievement. Congress needs \n     to help states to implement alternatives to the traditional, \n     single-salary schedule used by the majority of public schools \n     to pay teachers if it wants to assure that schools nationwide \n     meet the NCLB's important goals. Merit pay increases schools' \n     ability to attract and retain highly qualified teachers, \n     especially in fields that command high salaries outside of \n     education, such as math and sciences, and it encourages \n     teachers to work in high-needs schools. A carefully developed \n     merit pay plan, with clearly defined measures and \n     expectations, should be able to address any legitimate \n     concerns raised by teachers and their unions. Eighty percent \n     of parents and teachers support salary increases for teachers \n     who improve student achievement. The Teacher Incentive Fund \n     proposed by the President and passed by the House will permit \n     many more schools to implement public-supported reforms, and \n     will provide a major incentive for needed changes in teacher \n     compensation nationally.\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I rise today to express my strong support \nfor the extension of a program that has provided vital support to our \nNation's\n\n[[Page S14285]]\n\ndairy farmers, helped to maintain the milk supply, and perhaps more \nimportantly has helped to preserve an important way of life in rural \nAmerica. The program I speak of is the Milk Income Loss Contract, MILC, \nProgram, which since its inception in the 2002 farm bill has provided a \ncrucial buffer between our Nation's hard-working dairy farmers and the \nrollercoaster ups and downs of the milk market.\n  America's farmers are the backbone of its rural communities, and as \nmarkets, weather, and other challenges become more daunting we must \nmake every effort to support them when they are in need. It is not just \nfor the benefit of our farmers, who work hard year-round, often in the \nface of unforgiving circumstances, and their families, but for the \ntowns that they help to support and for the health of the land that \nthey steward. Small farms are the big business of rural America, and if \nit becomes too hard for them to survive, the communities where they are \nlost will suffer, both economically and culturally. Likewise, as the \neconomic pressure to develop grows, more and more open space will be \nlost to suburban sprawl if small farms disappear. Allowing these farms \nto go under by failing to extend sensible supports like the MILC \nProgram would be bad for the economy, bad for our environment, and bad \nfor consumers.\n  In very few places across the country are the stakes of the MILC \nProgram's survival more starkly apparent than in my State of New York. \nAgriculture is a dominant industry in New York, and dairy farmers are \nthe bulwark of New York's agricultural economy. In light of dramatic \nprice swings and development pressures that are more severe than almost \nanywhere else in the country, the dairy farmers of my State need the \ntype of support provided by the MILC Program when prices hit rock \nbottom. New York's farmers have received millions of dollars under the \nprogram, and I can tell you that that money has made a real difference \nin helping small family farms pull back from the brink and stay in \nbusiness.\n  Let me be clear about one thing. While this program provides crucial \nand timely support, it is not simply a big-dollar bonanza for America's \ndairy farmers. Payments under the program only kick in when prices dip \nbelow the trigger price of $16.94 per hundredweight, when they are most \nneeded. In fact, in the almost 4 years covered by the program, there \nwere only 26 months in which USDA had to issue payments. There was an \nentire year, from May of 2004 to May of 2005, where prices were \nfortunately high enough that support was not necessary. I raise these \nfacts simply to say that anyone who would oppose this program, which \nprovides crucial, targeted assistance to small dairy farms, on the \ngrounds that it is a budget buster or boondoggle is way off the mark.\n  The MILC Program expired at the end of September, so the need to \nextend it is pressing and vital. As we enter the New Year, milk prices \nmay once again drop below the trigger price, and we need to make sure \nthat the MILC Program is in place to do its job should our dairy \nfarmers find themselves in need. The MILC Program is very important to \nNew York, but not just to New York. The fact that the extension of this \nprogram has drawn strong support from Democrats and Republicans from \nmultiple regions demonstrates its importance to our entire Nation.\n  While I have serious misgivings with other provisions contained in \nthis budget reconciliation conference report, the 2-year extension of \nthe MILC Program is one item that I am glad to see is included. The \nMILC Program has shown itself to be an effective and vital part of our \nGovernment's commitment to support America's farmers, and I strongly \nsupport its extension.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, this evening the Senate passed the \nconference report to the fiscal year 2006 Department of Labor, Health \nand Human Services, and Education appropriations bill. I want to \nexpress my concerns with this conference report. Not only does this \nlegislation shortchange important priorities compared to the Senate \nversion of this bill, which passed on a near unanimous vote of 94 to 3, \nit is not the only affront to these programs since an additional \nacross-the-board cut to discretionary spending is included in the \nDepartment of Defense appropriations conference report.\n  I am disappointed that this conference report fails to provide our \nchildren with the resources they need to compete in today's world. \nChildren of all ages will be affected by the decisions we make today.\n  This conference report decreases funding to programs that help \nstudents succeed at every stage. Indeed, it cuts education funding for \nthe first time in 10 years. Despite rising tuition costs, college \nstudents will not see an increase in financial aid. The supplemental \neducational opportunity grant, SEOG, program will receive $26 million \nless than the Senate bill we passed in October. The maximum Pell grant \naward will be frozen at $4,050 for the fourth year in a row, making it \nmore difficult for students to keep up with tuition and the cost of \nattending college.\n  Funding for No Child Left Behind Act programs are reduced by 3 \npercent, for a total that is $13.1 billion below the authorized level. \nElementary and secondary school children will experience a decrease in \nservices funded through the School Improvement Programs, the \neducational technology State grants, and the Javits Gifted and Talented \nProgram, which all received less funding than in the Senate bill.\n  Title I of the No Child Left Behind Act will see its smallest \nincrease in 8 years, for a total of $12.8 billion. This is $9.9 billion \nless than the $22.75 billion authorized in the No Child Left Behind \nAct. This funding is critical to improve education in this country. In \n2001, members of this chamber made a commitment with the No Child Left \nBehind Act to give every child an opportunity at an excellent \neducation. The President and our colleagues from across the aisle \nshould join us in seeking to uphold that commitment.\n  Infants and toddlers will also receive fewer services. The \nPresident's fiscal year 2006 budget proposal, the House bill, and the \nSenate bill all included increases in funding for Head Start. However, \nthis conference report ignores those increases and instead includes \nless than 1 percent increase for this important early childhood \nprogram. Head Start centers across the country are cutting back \non comprehensive services, the core of this program's success, because \nfunding has been minimal year after year and has not kept pace with \ninflation. In a time when we should be increasing our investment in \nearly childhood development, this conference report moves us in the \nwrong direction.\n\n  The conference report also reduces health funding by a total of $466 \nmillion. It will set back critical research at the National Institutes \nof Health, unravel already fragile health care safety net programs, \nundermine essential health professions training programs, and leave our \nNation completely unprepared to respond to a looming avian influenza \npandemic.\n  In this conference report, the National Institutes of Health, NIH, \nafter seeing its budget doubled only a few years ago, will face the \nsmallest percentage increase--less than 1 percent--in more than three \ndecades. Withdrawing our support for revolutionary basic and clinical \nresearch at such a crucial time will undoubtedly set back our efforts \nin the war against cancer, as well as impede our quest to learn about \nthe causes of and find effective methods to diagnose and treat \ndebilitating conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, Alzheimer's, \nParkinson's, Multiple Sclerosis, Lou Gehrig's disease, and autism. \nThese diseases are not only devastating to those who are afflicted and \nthe families who care for them, they continue to be a significant drain \non our health care system and our economy.\n  This bill also deals a devastating blow to essential safety net \nprograms. First, it essentially stops cold the President's initiative \nto create 1,200 new or expanded health center sites to serve an \nadditional 6.1 million people by 2006. The Senate-passed bill provided \n$105 million over the fiscal year 2005 level for community health \ncenters while this bill contains an increase of only $66 million, in \nessence freezing any new competition for community health center funds. \nSecond, the report slashes funding for programs that train health care \nproviders who serve in health centers and other safety net sites.\n  Title VII health professions programs have a long tradition of \nresponding to\n\n[[Page S14286]]\n\nthe needs of medically underserved communities as well as providing \nsupport to increase the racial and ethnic diversity of our health care \nworkforce. Under this bill, a broad array of small but essential \nprograms pertaining to trauma care systems, geriatrics training and \neducation, and emergency medical services will be eliminated. Over the \npast several years, Senator Roberts and I have led a strong bipartisan \neffort in support of these essential education and training programs. \nGutting these programs is penny-wise and pound-foolish. It will cripple \nour ability as a nation to be better prepared for the inevitable \nemergencies and tragedies that happen every day and the demographic \ntidal wave that will soon be hitting our health care system.\n  The bill also neglected to include a Senate amendment allocating \nnearly $8 billion in emergency funds to combat the avian flu. Instead, \nthe conference report actually diverts millions from the annual \ninfluenza program budget to pay for rural health programs, with a \npromise that funding for avian flu would be included in the pending \nDefense appropriations bill but at a much lower amount than the Senate \noriginally provided.\n  This conference report fails to provide sufficient funding for the \nLow Income Home Energy Assistance Program, LIHEAP. Rising energy prices \nthreaten to financially overwhelm low-income families and seniors. This \nwinter, the average family will face a $1,000 natural gas bill, an \nincrease of 38 percent from just last year. For families using heating \noil, prices are projected to hit $1,400, an increase of 21 percent over \nlast year. These price increases are overcoming workers' salaries and \nseniors' Social Security checks. American families need economic relief \nfrom high energy prices. They need the security to know they will not \nhave to decide between heating their homes or feeding their families \nand paying the energy bill or buying lifesaving medicines. With a sharp \nincrease in energy prices this year, it is obvious that level funding \nfor the LIHEAP program is inadequate. A majority of the Senate supports \n$5.1 billion in funding for LIHEAP, but this conference report does not \nreflect the will of my colleagues.\n  This conference report fails the American people in a number of very \nimportant ways. It fails to maintain our promise to give children the \nopportunity to achieve their full potential. It fails to preserve our \ncommitment to groundbreaking and potentially lifesaving advancements in \nmedicine. And it fails to sustain support for essential programs that \nhelp vulnerable Americans.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, American families are ready for a change. \nThey take a look at the priorities of this Republican Congress and the \nrecord of the Republican Party and say: it is time for a new direction \nfor our country.\n  You need to look no further than the Labor-HHS conference report. It \nis a low point of a Republican Congress that is disengaged from the \nreal needs of American families. This bill is a crowning achievement of \na Republican agenda out of touch with voters.\n  Republicans are ignoring the problems that matter most to families in \nIllinois and all across the country health care, education, and jobs.\n  What we have is a bill that cuts education funding for the first the \nfirst time in a decade, slashes health funding by more than $300 \nmillion, and eliminates funding for trauma care.\n  This bill pulls the rug out from under America's working families.\n  Many working families have children in public schools. I have been in \na lot of public schools in Illinois that serve lower income kids. No \nmatter how successful those schools are, I can tell you--they don't \nhave money to spare. This bill actually spends less Federal money on \nschools and education than any federal budget in the last 10 years.\n  How can we in good conscience reduce our commitment to education for \nlow-income kids in public schools?\n  But perhaps one of the more striking failures of the reconferenced \nversion of the Labor-HHS appropriations bill is the utter lack of \nconcern over preparing for the avian flu.\n  Never mind that this bill eliminates the $7.9 billion added to this \nbill on the Senate floor to help local hospitals and health departments \nget ready for what pandemic flu.\n  This conference report goes so far as to take an additional $120 \nmillion out of already underfunded accounts at the CDC-money \nspecifically designated to prepare for pandemic flu.\n  ``We'll take care of that later,'' we were told.\n  Meanwhile, my understanding is that the Defense appropriations bill \nincludes half of the funding the Senate approved--half of the funding \nthe President requested--to prepare for avian flu.\n  What is driving these cuts is a tax reconciliation that benefits \ncorporations and the wealthiest among us. Those benefits come at the \nexpense of basic guarantees for working American families--that they \ncan have decent public schools; that they can see a doctor; that they \nhave a chance to getting back into the workforce when they are out; and \nthat if a killer flu pandemic breaks out in this country we will have \nthe capacity, the drugs, and the organization to beat it back.\n  As a member of the conference committee, I did not sign the \nconference report and strongly oppose it.\n  Together, America can do better.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, tonight the Senate adopted the fiscal year \n2006 Labor-HHS-Education conference report by a voice vote. I would \nlike to note for the Record that I do not support this legislation.\n  This bill reflects the misguided priorities of the Republican \nCongress and will shortchange vital health care, education, and labor \nprograms in order to cut taxes.\n  At a time when the need for a well-educated, well-trained workforce \nis more critical than ever, Republican conferees provided education, \nhealth care, and job training programs $1.4 billion below last year's \nlevel.\n  This bill cuts education funding for the first time in a decade. It \ncuts funding for No Child Left Behind Act programs, and the maximum \nPell grant is frozen for the fourth year in a row, even as college \ncosts are skyrocketing. And, for the first time 10 years, the Federal \nGovernment will slide backward on its commitment to students with \ndisabilities because this bill cuts the Federal share of the costs of \nspecial education.\n  At a time when most Americans cite health care as their top priority, \nRepublican conferees provided health care programs $466 million below \nlast year's level, including a $137 million in cuts to rural health \nprograms and a $185 million cut to the Bureau of Health Professions. \nCutting these programs will make it even harder to recruit qualified \nprofessionals in many parts of the country.\n  Moreover, Republican conferees eliminated nine vital health care \nprograms altogether, including trauma care, rural emergency medical \nservices, the geriatric education centers, health education training \ncenters, and the healthy community access program. As a result of these \ncuts, not one new community health center will be created next year.\n  At a time when we are the verge of major new breakthroughs in disease \nprevention and treatment, the conference agreement also includes the \nsmallest percentage increase for the National Institutes of Health, \nNIH, since 1970, which will hinder promising medical research and \ndisease prevention initiatives.\n  These are just a few examples of the unconscionable cuts to crucial \nprograms in this bill. Unfortunately, these cuts will be even deeper \nbecause the Republicans imposed an across-the-board cut against all \nnondefense and homeland security programs in the Defense appropriations \nbill.\n  In summary, Mr. President this bill is bad for our children, bad for \nworkers, bad for seniors, and bad for this nation. America can do \nbetter.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today in opposition to the conference \nreport to accompany the Labor, Health and Human Services, Education and \nRelated Agencies Appropriations bill. This bill does not reflect our \nNation's shared priorities and is a far cry from representing Wisconsin \nvalues. The people of Wisconsin value quality education for their \nchildren, affordable and decent health care for their families, and \nsound job training for workers. This bill falls short on all three \naccounts.\n  For the first time in a decade, the LHHS bill cuts total Federal \neducation\n\n[[Page S14287]]\n\nfunding. Funding for No Child Left Behind programs would be cut by $779 \nmillion bringing it to its lowest level since 2002. Funding for Title \nI, which serves low-income, disadvantaged students and schools across \nthe nation, would receive $9.9 billion below the authorized level, its \nsmallest increase in 8 years. And again, Congress fails to live up to \nits promise to provide 40 percent of the costs of educating students \nwith disabilities: the bill cuts the Federal share of special education \nspending from 18.6 percent to 18.0 percent, just as our school \ndistricts are struggling to keep up with rising costs. Funding for Pell \ngrant awards, which help make higher education affordable for many \nstudents, is frozen at $4,050 for the fourth year in a row, funding for \nEven Start and Education Technology is slashed, and funding for the \nNational Youth Sports Program is eliminated, leaving almost 1,500 \nWisconsin young people without summer enrichment programs they have \ncome to count on. The list goes on and on.\n  And education is not the only investment shortchanged. Some of the \nlargest cuts in the LHHS bill are in programs that help shore up the \nhealth care safety net for people lacking other access to care and that \naddress shortages of healthcare providers in underserved urban and \nrural areas. The conference report cuts funding for community health \ncenters, which serve the uninsured and underinsured, to a lower level \nthan provided in either the House or Senate versions of the bill. This \namount would not allow a single new community health center to open in \nthe coming year. Funding for the Bureau of Health Professions, which \nhelps recruit qualified health professions throughout the country, \nwould be cut by $185 million, including the elimination of geriatric \neducation centers and health education training centers. Rural health \nprograms would be cut by $137 million, including the elimination of the \nhealthy community access program and rural emergency medical services.\n  In addition, funding levels have not kept pace with our need for \ninvestment in lifesaving biomedical research. The National Institutes \nof Health's budget would receive a funding increase of less than 1 \npercent, the smallest percentage increase to NIH since 1970. NIH will \nhave to reduce the numbers of research grants awarded by 355. The bill \nwould provide no increase in Federal funding for Alzheimer's research \nthreatening the progress of promising research on that devastating \ndisease. Less money would be available to support new research grants, \nattract talented, young researchers to the promising field of \nAlzheimer's research and fund clinical trials to test new drugs to \ntreat the disease--and this is just one example of the damage to vital \nresearch that the LHHS conference report would do.\n  Labor programs are not immune from the slash and burn approach to \nappropriations embodied in the conference report before us. They are \ncut by $430 million. At a time when five percent of Americans, and four \nand a half percent of people from my State of Wisconsin, are \nunemployed, this bill wrongly reduces adult job training by $31 million \nand youth job training by $36 million. Instead of helping the \nunemployed find work and providing training to upgrade the skills of \nthose who have jobs, this conference report turns its back to them.\n  I know we can do better for our children and families. I supported \nthe Senate version of this bill, which was bipartisan and passed by a \nvote of 94-3. Unfortunately, this conference report falls far short; it \nis neither bipartisan nor bicameral, and actually provides $1.4 billion \nless than last year's level. In fact, LHHS is the only fiscal year 2006 \nappropriations bill to receive an overall cut in funding from last \nyear.\n  I want to thank Senators Specter and Harkin for working tirelessly to \nimprove this bill. I also want to thank them for the modest increases \nthey provided in the CMS Survey and Certification program, the \nombudsman program, as well as their work to restore Perkins funding. \nHowever, I cannot support a bill that forces our schools, our health \ncare system, and our workforce to do more with less. I urge my \ncolleagues to join me in rejecting this conference report.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the Christmas spirit was nowhere to be \nfound tonight on the floor of the United States Senate as Republicans \nrushed through unconscionable cuts to the programs that American \nfamilies deserve. This conference report affects the lives of every \nsingle American, and it lets them down. It fails our commitments to the \neducation of our children, to our health care, to the poor, and to our \njobs. At a time when we should be moving forward, and helping families \nmeet the challenges of higher costs, this conference report moves us \nbackward.\n\n\n                               Education\n\n  Parents know that education is a critical factor in making the \nAmerican dream a reality for their children. An educated citizenry also \nmakes a strong Nation possible. We cannot compete in the world without \nskilled workers. We cannot maintain a strong defense without a skilled \nand educated military.\n  Once again, the United States has been presented with a global \nchallenge, as we were when the Soviets launched Sputnik in 1958. In \norder to face this challenge with confidence, we should invest in the \ntransforming power of education. That's not what this conference report \nsays. This conference report says that education is not a priority. It \nsays global competitiveness is not a priority. It says basic fairness \nis not a priority. It says the American dream is not a priority.\n  In the face of this global challenge, this conference report does not \ninvest more in education. In fact, for the first time in a decade, this \nconference report cuts the education budget. As we learn more about the \ncritical importance of early education, as our elementary and secondary \nschools struggle to help our children meet higher standards, as a \ncollege degree is becoming an imperative, and as the cost of that \ndegree is skyrocketing, the Federal budget for education is actually \ngoing down.\n  If our country is to remain strong in this rapidly changing world, \nour economy must work for everyone, and every American must have an \nequal opportunity to succeed. No Child Left Behind is not just a \npolitical slogan. It's a solemn pledge to every parent and every child \nin America.\n  At a time when requirements under the law are more demanding than \never, this conference report cuts funding overall for No Child Left \nBehind programs by $1 billion, for a total that is $13.4 billion less \nthan promised in the law. Over 3.2 million children will be left \nbehind. Next year, schools have to raise the bar for adequate yearly \nprogress, administer tests in reading and math on an annual basis, and \nensure that all teachers are highly qualified. This conference report \ntells them they're on their own.\n  Title I--the key NCLB program, which targets disadvantaged students--\nis cut for the first time in 13 years. Title I funds will be $28 \nmillion lower than last year, and 160,000 fewer children will be \nserved. Funding to Massachusetts schools will be cut more than $4.3 \nmillion.\n  The conference report cuts Head Start funds by $68.5 million, leaving \n750,000 eligible preschoolers without services, and dropping from the \nprogram 9,500 children who are currently enrolled in Head Start \nclassrooms. It slashes the Even Start family literacy program, taking \nservices away from nearly 35,000 children.\n  The conference report cuts funds for after-school programs, denying \nafter-school programs to 13,000 children currently enrolled. The \nconference report also cuts funds to keep our schools safe and drug-\nfree.\n  With the first cut to special education funding in a decade, this \nconference report moves backwards on our commitment to disabled \nstudents. The Federal share of the cost of educating students with \ndisabilities actually drops from 18.6 percent last year to 17.8 percent \nthis year. The funding in the report is more than $4 billion short of \nthe amount promised just 1 year ago when we passed the IDEA Improvement \nAct.\n  At a time when American students are performing below the \ninternational average in math and science, the conference report cuts \n$13 million in funds for the Math and Science Partnerships at the \nDepartment of Education, leaving funding well below half of the amount \npromised in No Child Left Behind.\n  At a time when technology is more and more prevalent in our lives and \nin\n\n[[Page S14288]]\n\nour economy, this conference report continues the bewildering downward \ntrend in educational technology funding. In fiscal year 2004, the \nprogram was funded at almost $700 million. This conference report \nincludes $248 million, a 50 percent cut since last year and just over a \nthird of the 2004 funding.\n  At a time when college costs have skyrocketed 46 percent since 2001, \nand almost 400,000 college-ready students do not go to a 4-year college \nbecause of financial need, this conference report provides no increase \nin student aid. It leaves Pell grants frozen in place for the fourth \nyear in a row.\n\n\n                                  Jobs\n\n  Just as this conference report leaves millions of children behind, it \nalso leaves millions of American workers behind.\n  Close to 8 million Americans are unemployed, and most remain \nunemployed for 18 weeks or more. The picture is so bleak that many \nworkers have given up hope of finding work altogether. The real \nunemployment rate is almost 9 percent when these discouraged workers \nare counted.\n  Workers affected by the recent storms in the gulf are particularly at \nrisk. Hundreds of thousands of gulf coast workers continue to struggle \nto find work in the wake of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. Twenty-five \npercent of Katrina evacuees are unemployed, including 30 percent of \nthose evacuees that have been relocated across the country. African-\nAmerican and Hispanic evacuees fare even worse, with an overall \nunemployment rate of about 43 percent. Thus far, a total of 502,000 \ninitial claims for unemployment benefits can be traced to the two \nstorms.\n  Yet, the conference report would cut funding for unemployment \ninsurance and employment services offices that help jobless workers \naround the country. The conference report also cuts job training, as \nmany workers struggle to improve their skills in order to secure good \njobs. These illogical steps are an insult to those struggling to \nrecover from our Nation's greatest national disaster and those \nstruggling to meet the challenges of a global economy.\n\n  In addition, as we continue the long process of rebuilding the gulf \ncoast, thousands of relief and recovery workers are facing toxic \nworking conditions. Workers cleaning up in the aftermath of the storms \nare being exposed to hazardous chemicals, oil and sewage contaminated \nwaters, mold, and other hazardous substances. Even outside of the gulf \ncoast region, death rates among Hispanic and immigrant workers continue \nto be alarmingly high. Yet, our Government will be doing less to \nprotect the lives and health of our workers. The small, 1.8 percent \nincrease that the conference report provides for funding the \nOccupational Safety and Health Administration is more than eaten up by \ninflation and won't be enough to maintain current levels of enforcement \nand training.\n  The conference report also short-sightedly ignores the future needs \nof health care workers. We are facing a looming threat of a pandemic \nflu epidemic, yet the conference report prohibits the Department of \nLabor from enforcing key safety standards to protect health care \nworkers from tuberculosis. These are very basic measures that would \nhelp protect healthcare workers from all deadly infectious diseases, \nand it is unconscionable to bow to special interests at the expense of \nthose who will be on the front lines of our battle against this public \nhealth crisis.\n  In addition to threatening the safety of American workers, the \nconference report also threatens their job security. It is hardly news \nto any of us that globalization is rapidly creating a single global \nworkforce. Now more than ever, the jobs of American workers are at risk \ndue to the poor wages and working conditions in other parts of the \nworld. It's critical that we invest in efforts to improve working \nconditions around the world, for the sake of all workers, including our \nown. Yet, the conference report slashes the budget for the \nInternational Labor Affairs Bureau, ILAB, by 22 percent--from $93 \nmillion to $72.5 million--threatening our ability to protect American \njobs and protect the basic rights of workers and children across the \nglobe.\n\n\n                                 Health\n\n  The conference report also fails to protect American families from \npublic health catastrophes.\n  Congress has few higher priorities than protecting the American \npeople from the deadly strain of influenza that is threatening the \nworld and could take the lives of millions of Americans and damage the \nhealth of millions more.\n  The threat from this deadly new disease has been compounded by our \ninattention and failure to prepare. For years, public health experts \nsounded warning after warning about the devastation that a flu pandemic \nwould bring, but year after year, we failed to respond to this deadly \nthreat in its earliest stages.\n  Canada, Australia, Britain, Japan, and other nations released plans \nlong ago. They're implementing their plans now, but the Bush \nadministration has put out a plan for only one Federal agency. A \nresponse plan for the Department of Health and Human Services is a \ncritical first step, but even that plan is incomplete. It's missing the \nactual operational plans for responding to a pandemic.\n  The President has called, however, for a significant investment in \npreparedness. I attended his speech at NIH, where he urged that $7 \nbillion be appropriated immediately for preparedness.\n  We still have time to avert the serious consequences that a pandemic \nwould bring, but only if we act now to begin improving our readiness. \nThe Senate heeded the call to action by unanimously approving an \namendment for $8 billion in preparedness funding offered by Senator \nHarkin.\n  But the Republican leadership isn't on board. They stripped the $8 \nbillion amendment out of this conference report, and provided only half \nthat amount in the Defense Appropriations conference report. These \nirresponsible cuts will mean that critical programs will have to be \ndelayed. Which parts of our response do our Republican colleagues think \nwe should delay? Production of new vaccines? Stockpiling of flu \nmedicine? Support for hospitals and health agencies preparing for the \npandemic? I'd like to hear them explain to the American people which of \nthese activities they think are unimportant, which of these priorities \ncan wait, and which are not needed if disaster strikes.\n  This conference report also means that we will fail to capitalize on \nthe promise of this century of the life sciences. With the 1 percent \nacross the board cut, funding for NIH will decrease. This has happened \nonly four other times in NIH history. This is woefully inadequate to \nmaintain our tradition of research excellence and breakthrough medical \nscience. This is the lowest NIH funding level in 35 years and the \nresearch and development budget fails to keep up with inflation. These \nbudget cuts will mean that four of five innovative new ideas will be \nignored. Over 500 new research grants will fall by the wayside. It's \nunbelievable that with the threat of a pandemic looming over America, \nthe Republican Congress is denying the resources we need to discover \nnew, life-saving treatments and cures.\n  Not only does the conference report not include funding for the avian \nflu preparedness, funding that would help to improve State and local \npreparedness against bioterrorist attacks was cut by over $96 million.\n  As we know, maintaining the health of our Nation is not limited to \nemergency preparedness. Providing basic health services to the most \nvulnerable Americans and health promotion, and disease prevention are \nalso vitally important. But this conference report cuts critical health \npromotion and prevention programs at the CDC will be cut by $307 \nmillion and HRSA programs are slashed by $754 million.\n  This conference report funds community health centers, that serve as \na safety net of care for the most vulnerable, at less than half of the \nincrease passed by the Senate, while eliminating the Healthy \nCommunities Access Program which provides funds for health care \nproviders, community-based organizations and local government to \ncoordinate and strengthen health services for the poor and uninsured \nmembers of their communities. Funding is also cut for critical health \nprofessions training programs that address the shortages of providers \nand train them to deliver care in underserved areas and to serve the 46 \nmillion Americans who lack health insurance--often in community health \ncenters. Funding for critical health professions\n\n[[Page S14289]]\n\ntraining programs that encourage diversity in the health professions \nand train health care providers that will deliver care in underserved \nareas are cut 52 percent and training for geriatric medicine was cut by \n100 percent.\n  With a 1 percent across the board cut, several programs, including \nfamily planning and HIV/AIDS prevention programs, will now receive a \ndecrease in funding, despite the growing need for these services.\n\n\n                                 LIHEAP\n\n  The conference report leaves our poorest Americans out in the cold in \na time of soaring energy prices. Households heating primarily with \nnatural gas will pay an average of $281 more this winter for heat--an \nincrease of an incredible 38 percent over last year. Those relying \nprimarily on oil for heat will pay $255 more--an increase of 21 \npercent.\n  This fall, the Senate voted against fully funding LIHEAP four times, \nand this conference report only provides flat funds. This is \nunacceptable.\n  We know that heating costs are at record levels this year.\n  Big oil profits are fatter than ever. Exxon-Mobil--the largest oil \ncompany in the United States--reported 3rd quarter profits of almost \n$10 billion, a 75 percent increase over last year.\n  Exxon-Mobil alone made $10 billion in the last quarter--yet the \nRepublican leadership refuses to fund LIHEAP at its authorized level of \n$5.1 billion. The Republican leadership is Robin Hood in reverse--\nrobbing the poor to pay the rich.\n  So this conference report leaves our children behind, American \nworkers behind, and American families behind. It leaves America behind.\n  It's unfortunate that Christmas comes this week, because this \nconference report is the Grinch that steals Christmas for so many. \nWhile the neediest Americans are struggling to find some hope this \nseason, the special interests are sledding away with all the presents. \nBah humbug.\n  We should embrace the hopes and dreams of millions of Americans--not \nabandon them, as this conference report does. All parents want their \nchildren to have lives of fulfillment and opportunity; to raise strong \nand healthy families and afford to live comfortably in safe \nneighborhoods. Our actions in Congress should strengthen, not weaken \nAmerica.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the conference report is \nagreed to, and the motion to reconsider is laid on the table.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/12/21/senate-section/article/S14289-1", "month": "12", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14289]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Mr. President, I have a unanimous consent request to remake.\n  As my colleagues know, there is one major unfinished piece of \nbusiness yet that we need to conclude, and it is the action on the tax \nreconciliation bill. This is a bill which has the section 179, small \nbusiness expensing, the small savers credit for low-income families, \nthose making under $25,000 a year, above-the-line deduction for college \ntuition costs, R, tax credit, and extension of capital gains and \ndividends.\n  These are all-important matters that we need to act on.\n  As a result, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the \nimmediate consideration of Calendar No. 325, H.R. 4297, the House \nreconciliation bill.\n  I ask unanimous consent that all after the enacting clause be \nstricken and the text of S. 2020 as passed by the Senate be inserted \nthereof; that the bill, as amended, be read a third time and passed, \nthe motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, the Senate insist upon \nits amendment and request a conference with the House and the Chair be \nauthorized to appoint conferees at a ratio of 2 to 1.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, the \nmajority seeks to go to conference on the House-passed tax \nreconciliation bill. The House-passed bill includes tax cuts for \ndividends and capital gains. And the House-passed bill does not include \nlanguage to prevent 17 million middle-income Americans from getting a \ntax increase from the alternative minimum tax.\n  The Constitution requires the House to go first on tax measures like \nthis. In order to build momentum for their tax cuts, the majority in \nthe Senate chose to proceed before the House. But now the Constitution \nrequires that the Senate take up the House-passed tax reconciliation \nbill and amendment.\n\n  That is where we are.\n  There are a number of Senators on this side of the aisle who would \nlike to avail themselves of the opportunity to propose amendments to \nthe House-passed bill. I expect that several Senators would choose to \nsubstitute middle-income tax cuts as alternatives to the dividend and \ncapital gains tax cuts.\n  It is important to remember that under the Budget Act Senators would \nhave up to 20 hours to debate amendments to the House-passed bill. I, \nfor one, would seek to offer a motion to instruct conferees on this \nbill to ensure that we do not raise taxes on those 17 million Americans \nwho become subject to the AMT, unless we act. Under the Budget Act, \nSenators would have an additional 10 hours to debate motions to \ninstruct conferees. We are not in the position to conduct 10 hours of \ndebate at this late hour. The exercise, I might say, would be \ninappropriate. So I must object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/12/21/senate-section/article/S14289-3", "month": "12", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14289-S14290]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  UNANIMOUS-CONSENT REQUEST--H.R. 4096\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, if we are not going to take up the \nmajor tax cut at this time, I am going to ask unanimous consent to take \nup the AMT.\n  In 1969, when Congress passed the AMT it was supposed to affect 1 in \n500,000 taxpayers who make over $200,000 a year. In fact, that is not \nthe case today. By 2010, the AMT is expected to ensnare 32 million \ntaxpayers, the majority of whom have adjusted gross incomes of under \n$100,000. In fact, this especially hits people with children. By the \nyear 2010, among married taxpayers with two or more children, 85 \npercent of married taxpayers with two or more children in 2010 will \nface the AMT. It prohibits the ability to deduct for children.\n  So I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the immediate \nconsideration of Calendar No. 326, H.R. 4096, the alternative minimum \ntax relief.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the bill be read a third time and \npassed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, and that any \nstatements related thereto be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, the \nmajority, through the Senator from Texas, seeks unanimous consent to \npass the House bill which extends the AMT exemption level. The House-\npassed bill purports to be an AMT hold harmless bill. It is not. It \ndoes not hold everyone harmless.\n  In fact, 600,000 additional families will pay AMT next year under \nthat House bill which the majority seeks our consent. Under the version \nwe in the Senate passed last month, with 64 Senators in support, we \nensure that not one additional taxpayer faces higher taxes in 2006 due \nto an onerous alternative minimum tax.\n  The same cannot be said of this House bill for which consent is \nagreed to.\n  It is true that if Congress does not act, 17 million more middle-\nincome Americans will be subject to the AMT come January 1. We would \nprefer to get it right the first time and not have to make promises to \nclose the gap for those 600,000 hard-working American taxpayers next \nyear.\n  I ask the Senator from Texas if she would amend her request instead \nto seek consent for an AMT relief amendment that I believe the majority \nwould be supportive of, since it shows the Senate's provision, so that \nno AMT taxpayers are created next year. Further, while we are seeking \nto do these tax cuts outside of reconciliation, we would have them \ncount against the total allowed under reconciliation. That would be \npart of the amendment.\n\n[[Page S14290]]\n\nThe text of that Senate amendment is pending at the desk, and I am \nasking, Will the Senator from Texas accept this amendment?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, with all due respect to the Senator \nfrom Montana, I don't see how we can take part but not all of the tax \nreconciliation bill. It is time to do away with the AMT.\n  I appreciate the fact that the Senator from Montana has said he, too, \nwants to do that and that we need to do it right. To do it right we \nneed to do the whole tax reconciliation bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I ask the Senator, will she object to an amendment I \nsuggested that the whole AMT be held harmless and that it count under \npay-go in terms of the tax, the budget provisions which provide for $70 \nbillion over the next 5 years? Those are the two conditions.\n  Mr. KYL. Reserving the right to object to the proposed amendment to \nthe unanimous consent, I believe on our side we would not object to the \nform of the so-called AMT patch that the Senator from Montana has \nproposed. Of course, we would object to his counting of that against \nthe reconciliation number, or the so-called pay-go provision.\n  I guess I ask for an amendment to his proposed amendment which would \naccept the broader AMT patch, as the Senator first described it, but \nnothing in addition to that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. As I hear their response, they will not agree to my two \nsuggested conditions and amendments. Therefore, I must respectfully \nobject.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. An objection has been heard.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I do hope the Senator from Montana, \nworking with the chairman of the Committee on Finance, will make it a \npriority early next year to have the tax reconciliation package go \nthrough with AMT and with the other tax cuts that would be extended to \nshow the American people they can rely on the tax cuts that have been \npassed and have helped the economy in its recovery.\n  It is very important we not leave any question in anyone's mind that \nthe tax cuts that started the economic upturn 2 years ago will be \nextended. The American people will get to keep the money in their \npocketbooks, spend it, and fuel the jobs our economy has produced.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I listened carefully to the Senator from \nTexas. I think we all agree we have to do something about the AMT. It \nis a big problem.\n  I, frankly, tell the Senator I have introduced a bill to totally \nrepeal AMT. It is a pernicious stealth tax and should not be incurred. \nWe would like to work with the Senator to try and find a way to \naccomplish that.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I sign on to that effort immediately. With this kind \nof coalition maybe we can do something very important by doing away \nwith the AMT in this country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/12/21/senate-section/article/S14290-1", "month": "12", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14290]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   UNANIMOUS-CONSENT REQUEST--S. 2164\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, as part of a bipartisan action this \nmorning, Democrats and Republicans agree to send a reconciliation bill \nback to the House of Representatives for further consideration. Even \nthough the vast majority of this bill hurts working families and the \nmost vulnerable among them, there were a handful of important proposals \nthat we support in that bill that need to be enacted immediately. That \nis why I am going to be asking unanimous consent in just a moment for \nthe Senate to pass the Health and Welfare Relief Act of Senator \nStabenow of Michigan.\n  This bill prevents the scheduled reduction in Medicare physician \npayments while holding Part B premiums harmless for beneficiaries. The \nbill extends TANF and transitional medical assistance, TMA, for an \nadditional year. Finally, the bill provides temporary Medicaid relief \nto Katrina victims.\n  We should all be able to agree, even if there are parts of the bill \nsubject to a point of order, parts that will be debated, there are many \nprovisions in that bill that meet pressing needs that are important and \nneed to be addressed on a timely basis. Many of them are taken directly \nfrom the conference report my friends across the aisle have just \nsupported. I hope we can take up this bill and pass it today.\n  Therefore, I ask unanimous consent the Senate proceed to the \nimmediate consideration of S. 2164, the Health and Welfare Relief Act \nof 2005, introduced earlier by Senators Stabenow, Reid, Baucus, and \nothers; that the bill be read three times, passed, and the motion to \nreconsider be laid upon the table without any intervening action or \ndebate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The nominations considered and confirmed en bloc are as follows:\n\n\n                             the judiciary\n\n       Joseph Frank Bianco, of New York, to be United States \n     District Judge for the Eastern District of New York.\n       Timothy Mark Burgess, of Alaska, to be United States \n     District Judge for the District of Alaska.\n       Gregory F.

Mr. President, if I may, Calendar No. 459, that I just \nread and was just confirmed by the Senate, is a former member of my \nstaff, Greg Van Tatenhove, who is, at the moment, the U.S. attorney for \nthe Eastern District of Kentucky. He is an outstanding lawyer. He will \nbe a fine addition to the Federal judiciary.\n  As a former staff member of mine, I say to my colleagues, you have \ndone a great thing in confirming him. He will be a distinguished member \nof the Federal judiciary.\n  Mr. President, I strongly support the nomination of Greg Van \nTatenhove to the U.S. District Court in the Eastern District of \nKentucky.\n  Greg Van Tatenhove has been an outstanding public servant for the \nbetter part of 20 years. I first met Greg when he was a young aide to a \nMember of Congress. He later joined my legislative staff, where he \nperformed superbly before leaving to attend law school.\n  Greg distinguished himself in law school by being chosen as an \nArticles Editor of the Kentucky Law Journal and receiving a citation \nfor Excellence in Oral Advocacy in the Moot Court Program. After \ngraduation from law school, Greg spent a year as clerk to U.S. District \nCourt Judge Eugene Siler.\n  Greg was then chosen to join the Federal Programs Branch of the \nDepartment of Justice through the Attorney General's Honors Program. He \nwas one of only eleven young attorneys to be chosen nationwide out of \nhundreds of applicants for this prestigious branch. This branch is well \nknown for handling especially complex and precedent-setting legal cases \non behalf of the United States. During his 4 years\n\n[[Page S14291]]\n\nat DOJ, the Department recognized Greg for his excellent performance \nwith its Special Achievement Award.\n  Greg then returned to Capitol Hill, where he spent 7 years as Chief \nof Staff and Legal Counsel to Representative Ron Lewis of Kentucky. \nDuring his tenure, he developed a reputation as one of the \nCommonwealth's outstanding young legal minds, and in 2001, he was \nnominated by President Bush as United States Attorney in the Eastern \nDistrict of Kentucky, a position which he has ably filled for the past \n4 years.\n  In the course of his service as the chief federal law enforcement \nofficer in the Eastern District, he approves all indictments, all major \nplea bargains, and is directly involved in all of the major cases \ninvolving the United States that come before the court, both civil and \ncriminal.\n  Based on Greg's outstanding record, it should come as no surprise \nthat President Bush nominated him as a judge for the U.S. District \nCourt for the Eastern District of Kentucky on September 13, 2005. I \napplaud the President's choice, and I proudly support his nomination. \nGreg's high intellect, integrity, character, and devotion to public \nservice make him an ideal choice for the District Court.\n  Greg's nomination has been widely praised by those who know him best, \nincluding two members of the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals, five \nmembers of the District Court on which he will serve, and numerous \nformer colleagues. They share my conviction that Greg will be a \nsplendid addition to the federal bench.\n  In addition to his outstanding intellectual and professional \nabilities, Greg is a devoted family man. I know his wife Jane and his \ntwo beautiful children, Cooper and Catherine, are proud of him as he \nassumes this new position of responsibility.\n  It was clear to me 20 years ago when I hired Greg, even then a young \nman of great accomplishment, that he would go on to greater success. \nHis confirmation is the result of many years of hard work, great \nintellect, commitment to public service, and the highest ethical and \nprofessional standards.\n  Greg Van Tatenhove will be an outstanding District Court judge, and I \nurge my colleagues to support his nomination.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Last week marked the 214th anniversary of the adoption of \nthe Bill of Rights to the Constitution. Over the last week, this Nation \nand this Senate have been engaged in a debate about the importance of \nprotecting and preserving those rights as we consider how best to \nrevise and reauthorize the PATRIOT Act. We have also learned about the \nWhite House's domestic surveillance program that short-circuited the \njudicial safeguards established by Congress.\n  Today we engage in an action unique to the Senate. We consider for \nconfirmation to lifetime appointments to the judiciary a number of \nnominees. This is an instance in which all three branches of the \ngovernment are involved. The President nominates, the Senate considers \nthe nominations and, if confirmed, the nominee is appointed to become a \nmember of the judiciary. The judiciary has a particularly important \nrole in the protection of the rights and liberties of all Americans. It \nwas Justice O'Connor who, writing for the Supreme Court, noted that \neven wartime does not give the President a ``blank check'' when it \ncomes to actions that impact Americans' rights. Every day in courtrooms \nacross the country federal judges are the last line of defense for \nAmericans' rights.\n  If anyone doubts the importance of the position of Federal district \ncourt judges, they need look no further than the district court judges \nassigned to sit on Federal Intelligence Surveillance Act, or FISA \nCourt. This court was designed specifically to act as a check on the \nExecutive Branch, and when it is consulted as the law requires, it \nperforms a crucial role in our Government's system of checks and \nbalances. In an extraordinary development, we read today that a federal \njudge assigned by the Chief Justice of the United States to serve on \nthat court has resigned in the face of the disclosure of this \nPresident's secret surveillance program outside of the legal FISA \nprocess.\n  With the votes today, the Senate will be called upon to grant or \nwithhold its consent to another seven judicial nominees. If they are \nconfirmed, the Senate will have confirmed 225 of this President's \njudicial nominees to lifetime appointments. If they are confirmed, the \nSenate will increase the number of confirmations this year by 50 \npercent in just one day, from 14 to 21.\n  I chaired the Judiciary Committee for the second half of 2001. No \njudges had been confirmed that year before I became chair. In the last \n5 months of the year we were able to have hearings, Committee \nconsideration, and Senate votes on 28 new judges. We worked hard in \nspite of the 9/11 attacks and the anthrax attacks and succeeded in \nreducing vacancies and filling longstanding vacancies. Indeed in the 17 \nmonths I chaired the Judiciary Committee, the Senate proceeded to \nconfirm 100 of this President's nominees. It took Republicans more than \ntwice as long to match our record. Democrats proceeded in spite of the \nrecent history of Republicans pocket filibustering more than 60 of \nPresident Clinton's qualified, moderate nominees.\n  As is clear from our record since that time, we have been willing to \ncontinue working with the Republican majority to fill vacancies on the \nfederal bench--if only the President would send nominees. \nUnfortunately, along with home heating prices, gasoline prices, \ninterest rates, the budget deficit and the trade deficit, judicial \nvacancies have also increased dramatically this year. It almost seems \nthat unless the White House can pick a partisan political fight, it \nreally does not care very much about the Federal judiciary. I noted in \nthe spring that we had not received new nominations this year from the \nPresident. Only recently has that begun to change but there are still \nmore than 25 vacancies without a nominee. I urge the President, as the \nDemocratic leader and I have urged him for some time, to work with \nSenators on both sides of the aisle to identify qualified, consensus \ncandidates to fill these vacancies.\n\n\n                  Nomination of Virginia Mary Kendall\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, included in the nominations just approved \nby the Senate is the nomination of Virginia Mary Kendall of Illinois to \nbe the U.S. district judge for the Northern District of Illinois. She \nis replacing the retired Susanne Conlon. This is an extraordinary woman \nwho will make a great contribution to the Federal judiciary.\n  She is strongly supported by Senator Obama and myself, as well as \nSpeaker Dennis Hastert. On a bipartisan basis, we reviewed many fine \ncandidates for this vacancy and found Virginia Kendall to be the best. \nWith the approval of the White House, she moved through the Senate \nJudiciary Committee.\n  I am anxious, as soon as I finish these remarks, to go to the \ncloakroom, place a phone call, and give her a Christmas present and let \nher know her nomination has been approved by the Senate.\n  I would like to thank Judiciary Committee Chairman Specter, as well \nas Ranking Member Leahy, for expediting the consideration of Ms. \nKendall's nomination. I also want to thank Senator Obama for the \nsignificant role that he played in the selection process. Finally, I \nwant to thank House Speaker Hastert for his role in the process and for \nhis willingness to continue an Illinois tradition of seeking bipartisan \ncooperation in the recommendation of Federal district court nominees \nfor presidential consideration.\n  Virginia Kendall is a highly respected federal prosecutor in Chicago \nwith a stellar reputation for diligence, intelligence, and integrity. \nShe has been in the U.S. Attorney's office in the Northern District of \nIllinois for the past decade, and she has a great depth of experience.\n  She is one of the leading prosecutors in the country in the area of \nchild exploitation over the Internet, and she was the lead counsel in \nthe first Internet kidnaping case brought by the Department of Justice. \nShe has also prosecuted domestic terrorism and corporate fraud cases.\n  Ms. Kendall has helped reduce Chicago's murder rate, by creating a \nnovel program that emphasizes better outreach by law enforcement to \nparolee gun offenders and to at-risk students in the Chicago Public \nSchools. She has been the lead prosecutor in cases involving the sale \nof weapons over the Internet to minors.\n\n[[Page S14292]]\n\n  Ms. Kendall has also been extremely active in pro bono work. She has \ncreated programs in which Federal prosecutors go into Chicago high \nschools and educate students about the dangers of gun violence and the \nworkings of the criminal justice system. One of her programs received \nan award from the Department of Justice as the most outstanding \nvolunteer program in the country. Ms. Kendall and her husband have \nworked closely with students from the Cristo Rey Jesuit High School, an \namazing success story of a high school in Pilson, a low-income Latino \nneighborhood in Chicago.\n  In addition, Ms. Kendall has served as an adjunct law professor at \nLoyola University law school for the past 12 years. Some of her former \nlaw school students contacted me and said she was the best professor \nthey ever had. That speaks very well of Ms. Kendall's ability not only \nto understand the law, but to teach it.\n  One of Ms. Kendall's biggest supporters is her boss--Patrick \nFitzgerald--the United States Attorney in the Northern District of \nIllinois. He wrote me a long letter singing her praises, and he \nconcluded:\n\n       I can also assure you that Ginny is a warm and \n     compassionate person who is very attentive to the human needs \n     of those she works with and supervises. Ginny's combination \n     of legal talents, experience as a prosecutor, supervisor and \n     instructor, and commitment to bettering the communities most \n     in need of help would stand her in great stead if she were \n     selected as a federal judge in this district.\n\n  I am pleased to report that Ms. Kendall also receives high marks from \nher opposing counsel and has an excellent reputation in the criminal \ndefense bar. One of her opposing counsel described her as ``honorable, \ndecent, ethical, and someone with an ideal temperament.'' Another \nopposing counsel said Ms. Kendall was ``down to earth, honest, \nstraightforward, reliable, and full of integrity.''\n  I was not surprised to learn that a substantial majority of the \nAmerican Bar Association's judicial nomination review committee gave \nMs. Kendall their highest possible rating of ``Well Qualified.'' I am \nconfident that, as a judge, Ms. Kendall will serve with honor, courage, \nand distinction on the Federal bench in the Northern District of \nIllinois for many years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/12/21/senate-section/article/S14292-1", "month": "12", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14292]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          LEGISLATIVE SESSION\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, while we did leave a lot of work to be \ndone, I do want to thank my colleagues, particularly Chairman Cochran \nand Senator Byrd, for shepherding through a tremendous direct relief \nbill. That would not have happened without these two leaders. It was \ninitially sent to us at $17 billion, with an anemic funding level for \nour levees. It was basically a bill that fixed Federal buildings and \nsent money to Federal bureaucracies and didn't reach the people \ndirectly or our cities or counties or parishes or churches or schools \nor hospitals. Senator Cochran took that bill and he stood it up and \nadded some extraordinary pieces to it and fought like a tiger to keep \nthat money flexible but accountable so our Governors could start \nrebuilding our States again, with help from the Federal Government; not \njust promises but real help. If it had not been for Senators Cochran \nand Byrd and the appropriators who helped to stand this bill up, we \nwould be leaving here tonight in a much less hopeful situation.\n  We passed that bill out of here a little while ago. It is headed to \nthe House of Representatives. That part is not controversial, but the \nprocess is controversial. I hope the House Members will pass that \ntomorrow so the people of the gulf coast, who have been waiting not for \na week, not for 2 weeks, but for 4 months for this Congress to send \nsome package of hope, other than money to FEMA, but a package of hope \nto our elected officials so they can get their parishes stood up, \npeople back home, the lights turned on, the hospitals working again, \nthe universities functioning again, and stop firing and start hiring \npeople so we can stand up this economy.\n  I am hoping that tomorrow the House will act, and we will at least \nsend this $29 billion home. Just today the President signed an $8 \nbillion tax relief package that is full of targeted and specific tax \ncredits and tax relief for businesses and individuals that will help as \nwell. I thank the administration for their support of that bill.\n  Particularly I thank Senators Baucus and Grassley. Senator Blanche \nLincoln worked very hard on many portions of this bill as a member of \nthe Finance Committee. I could not leave tonight to go home for the \nholidays without thanking Senators Grassley and Baucus. Without them, \nthat bill never would have made it through the process. On the House \nside, Congressman Jim McCrery and my own Congressman from New Orleans, \nBill Jefferson, had a great deal to do with the success of that bill.\n  As we get ready to celebrate Christmas and we remember members of our \nown family, my parents, my siblings, cousins, very good friends who \nhave lost their homes and their businesses, as we remember the 250,000 \nhomes that have been destroyed and the millions of people impacted \nnegatively, at least this Congress can say we passed an $8 billion tax \nbill that will help many directly and give them immediate relief as it \nwas signed today, and this $29 billion direct package reallocating FEMA \nmoney that is sitting in a bank account and give it to people for this \nChristmas holiday, and then to resolve when we get back to take up and \ndesign some new tools for reconstruction that can help in the area \nparticularly of housing, which is such a desperate need, and \nreorganization of our neighborhoods and communities.\n  I can rest assured that the leadership in Louisiana, with the \nLouisiana Recovery District, led by the Governor, who appointed Norman \nFrancis and Walter Isaacson, the two leaders of the LRA, is prepared, \nwith our local officials, to come up with new and innovative strategies \nto build a great city of New Orleans again, the great parishes of \nJefferson, St. Bernard, and Plaquemine, then to move over to the \nsouthwest and give the small parishes, such as Cameron, which was \ntotally destroyed, the help they need to stand back up, so we can stand \nup our farms, hospitals, petrochemical industry, keep our ports open, \nstart hiring teachers and doctors back, and start building up the \n18,000 businesses that were lost. Forty-one percent of the businesses \nin Louisiana were destroyed by this hurricane. Our income fell 25 \npercent, our personal income, in a report released today.\n  I know everybody is tired. It has been a long day. I am ready to go \nhome myself and have a few Christmas gifts wrapped before the weekend. \nBut I can say that last night in New Orleans, there was the first party \nthrown in a long time at Gallier Hall, the old city hall. Although \nSenator Vitter and I couldn't be there, 500 people showed up. While \nthere were a lot of stories about the heartache that had occurred, \nthere was a lot of hope in the hearts of the people who came. There \nwere former mayors and former council members and leaders of the \ncommunity, Black and White, Hispanic and Asian. And despite the fact \nthat still this Congress doesn't understand in every way why New \nOrleans matters, I can promise you that the spirit of the people who \nlive in this city will not let it die, will not let south Louisiana \ndie.\n  We are going to come back and work even harder to add to the package \nwe passed tonight to get the job done and to be a model for the \ncountry, should this catastrophe ever strike another area again.\n  I thank my colleagues for getting through at least tonight the $29 \nbillion of direct relief and the $8 billion tax package. When we come \nback, we have work to do on coastal, work to do on housing. I look \nforward to working with Members on both sides of the aisle to get the \njob done for the people of Louisiana and the gulf coast.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n\n[[Page S14293]]\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

For 75 years, the Magen David Adom has served as Israel's \nemergency relief service..\n  Founded in 1930 by seven Israeli doctors and a one-room emergency \nmedical service, the MDA has grown to play a major role working \nalongside the Israeli Army Medical Corps in times of war and peace.\n  Twelve hundred employees and more than 10,000 volunteers have helped \ncountless disaster, accident, and terrorism victims within Israel's \nborders.\n  And on battlefields and disaster areas around the world, the relief \nservice has distinguished itself with consummate caring, \nprofessionalism and bravery.\n  Even the United States has been a beneficiary of the MDA's \nhumanitarian efforts.\n  Most recently, in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina MDA Israel \nlaunched an emergency mission named ``United Brotherhood'' to collect \ndonations, funds, clothing and other equipment for the New Orleans \nsurvivors who were left homeless.\n  Despite their indisputably noble work, for nearly 60 years the \norganization has been excluded from the International Red Cross and Red \nCrescent Movement.\n  The reason? The Israeli agency has been excluded for 60 years because \nof its decision to retain its own protective symbol rather than adopt \nthe Red Cross or the Red Crescent.\n  Finally, this month, the impasse was broken.\n  An overwhelming majority of the state-parties to the Geneva \nConventions approved a new protective symbol--a ``Red Crystal''--to \nallow the relief agency to operate as a member of the global \nhumanitarian movement.\n  Within Israel's territory, the agency will still use the Red Star of \nDavid.\n  Around the world, it will use the Red Crystal Protective Symbol, with \nthe option of also displaying its traditional logo if the host country \npermits.\n  Aside from a few remaining formalities, the Israeli emergency service \nwill, finally, at long last, take its place as a full member of the \nInternational Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement.\n  I would have liked to have seen straightforward international \nrecognition of the traditional symbol. But the new Red Crystal is a \nworthy and fair compromise.\n  I commend the International Committee of the Red Cross and the \nAmerican Red Cross for their efforts to bring this vital and life \nsaving organization into the fold.\n  And I applaud the Magen David Adom for their compassionate and \nhonorable work inspired by faith and carried out everyday with \nextraordinary courage.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/12/21/senate-section/article/S14293-2", "month": "12", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14293]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               AVIAN FLU\n\n  Mr. FRIST. In the 20th century, three influenza pandemics. The worst \nof the three, the 1918 Spanish flu, killed over half-a-million \nAmericans and more than 40 million worldwide.\n  Secretary Leavitt warns that if past is prologue, the world is \noverdue for another flu pandemic.\n  The avian flu spreading from East Asia to Romania and Turkey looks \nand acts more like the virus of 1918 than of any of its more moderate \ncousins.\n  If it achieves the final step of human-to-human transmission, the \nconsequences could be catastrophic both in loss of human life and \neconomic meltdown.\n  Recently, the Congressional Budget Office released a study which I \nhad specifically requested on the economic impact of a flu pandemic. \nThe CBO predicts that the American economy could suffer a $675 billion \nsetback, a 5-percent loss in GDP, in the year a pandemic might hit.\n  The clock is ticking, and we need to act now.\n  We need to put the wheels in motion so that when and if the avian flu \nhits, America is prepared.\n  If we don't, and an avian flu epidemic comes to our shores, we will \nrightly be blamed for failing to do our best to protect the American \npeople. The finger will be pointing straight at the Congress.\n  What we need in order to be prepared is a six-pronged approach.\n  We need communication, surveillance, antivirals, vaccines, research, \nand stockpiling and surge capacity.\n  This may sound like a lot of moving parts, but between our \nresearchers, entrepreneurs, and public health experts, we have the \nintellect, the ingenuity, and the knowledge to get the job done.\n  My duty as an elected official and as a doctor is to see this through \nto make sure that we are adequately prepared and we can look our \nconstituents in the eye and tell them we have done everything we can to \nbe prepared.\n  Our economy, our country, and our lives are depending on it.\n  The President has laid out a comprehensive plan. It is our job, now, \nto set aside sufficient resources to tackle this looming threat.\n  I urge my colleagues to set aside their partisan differences and pull \ntogether to protect the American people.\n  The flu virus won't know who is Republican and who is Democrat, but \nthe people who suffer will know who didn't get the job done.\n  We don't need to panic, but we do need to be prepared.\n  We need to act, and that is what we intend to do.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/12/21/senate-section/article/S14293-3", "month": "12", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14293-S14294]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              AFGHANISTAN\n\n  Mr. FRIST. On Monday, Afghanistan's first democratically elected \nParliament in more than 30 years convened before the eyes of the world. \nIt was an emotional moment and one of great pride for the Afghan \npeople.\n  As President Karzai told his audience of 351 new parliament members, \nwith Vice President Dick Cheney and his wife Lynne listening in the \nfront row, ``This dear Afghanistan has risen again from the ashes.''\n  Here in the United States, we are full of hope for the Afghan people \nand we share in their joy.\n  They have suffered a long and difficult journey.\n  Twenty years of civil war. Nearly another decade of total repression.\n  But they have finally reached the shores of freedom, and the future \nspread out before them is one of hope, progress, and limitless \npossibility.\n  We are proud to count Afghanistan as a free country, a fellow \ndemocracy, and a friend of the United States of America.\n  This past year has been one of extraordinary events in the Middle \nEast.\n  We have seen amazing images of people celebrating their newfound \nliberty--cheering, dancing and singing in the streets that they, too, \nare now free.\n  From the cedar revolution in Lebanon to the historic elections in \nIraq, the winds of democratic change are blowing across Arab lands.\n  A new report by the highly respected human rights group Freedom House \nfinds genuine stirrings of democratic progress: local elections in \nSaudi Arabia; women's new voting rights in Kuwait; improved elections \nin Egypt and the Palestinian territories.\n  The organization's director of research notes that, ``Many people \npredicted that American policy in Iraq and elsewhere would set back the \ncause of freedom. This year's results suggest that hasn't been the \ncase.''\n  Indeed, I would go further to say that President Bush, our brave men \nand women in uniform, our coalition partners, and courageous citizens \nacross the Middle East deserve tremendous credit for advancing the \ncause of freedom.\n  That freedom is bringing hope and optimism to millions of people long \noppressed.\n  Last week's ABC News poll found that Iraqis believe their lives are \ngoing well, and nearly two-thirds expect things to improve in the year \nahead.\n  Average Iraqi household incomes have skyrocketed by 60 percent in the \nlast 20 months. Iraqis are quickly joining the swift current of modern \nlife with cell phones and the Internet, cars, washing machines, and \nsatellite dishes.\n  Another new poll in Pakistan found that in that Muslim country, \npublic opinion toward the United States has dramatically improved.\n  Favorable opinion toward the United States has more than doubled \nsince May to nearly half of those polled, while support for al-Qaida \nhas plunged to its lowest level since 9/11.\n  Times are changing, and they are changing for the better.\n  It is true, we still face a terrorist enemy who targets innocent \ncivilians\n\n[[Page S14294]]\n\nwith bombings and beheadings, who dreams of inflicting massive violence \non the American people.\n  These same enemies sent suicide bombers to murder innocent Jordanians \nonly a few weeks ago. They despise freedom, and they are bending every \neffort to derail the democratic process.\n  But they will not succeed.\n  I am confident that America and her allies will prevail. I am \nconfident that we will defeat the terrorist enemy and bury its twisted \naims.\n  And all the while, we will continue to stand behind Iraq, Afghanistan \nand all champions of freedom as they work to secure the blessings of \nliberty.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/12/21/senate-section/article/S14294-1", "month": "12", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14294]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    RETIREMENT OF MR. ROBERT J. SHUE\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to Robert J. Shue, \na senior official in the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense, \nComptroller, who in early January, 2006, will retire from a \ndistinguished career spanning 37 years of exemplary service to America.\n  Mr. Shue began his career serving over 13 years in the Bureau of \nEconomic Analysis in the Department of Commerce. He joined the \nDepartment of Defense in 1982 and quickly became a highly valuable \nmember of the Secretary of Defense's staff.\n  During his 23 years in the Comptroller's office, Mr. Shue was a \nhighly respected leader and expert on the Defense Department budget and \na wide range of related matters. He played a critical role in the \nformulation, approval, and execution of defense budgets that produced a \nmuch-needed strengthening of America's defense posture and enabled our \nmilitary to fulfill its many demanding commitments.\n  Mr. Shue developed and led a diverse staff of analysts and liaison \nofficers and made his office the Defense Department's primary leader in \ntracking and resolving high-level budget issues. He meticulously \ntracked numerous and complex actions affecting the funding available to \nthe Department. He was a pivotal leader in presenting and justifying \neach new budget to the Congress and the American public.\n  Mr. Shue was vital to the Department's analysis of congressional \naction on Defense Department funding and to devising strategies to \ninfluence that action. He skillfully led staff in achieving and \nsustaining a highly productive relationship with congressional \noversight committees. This resulted in accurate and constructive \ninformation flow between Congress and the Department, helping each meet \nits responsibilities more successfully.\n  Mr. Shue produced substantial top-quality analysis on complex \neconomic, fiscal, and budget topics for the Secretary of Defense and \nother senior DoD leaders. He also improved support for these leaders by \ninitiating important management reforms that saved staff time and \nimproved the quality of decision making data.\n  For his extraordinary achievements, Mr. Shue received the \nPresidential Rank Award for Meritorious Service. He earned the deep \nrespect of leaders throughout the Department of Defense, in the Office \nof Management and Budget, and with Congress's defense oversight \ncommittees. These leaders benefited enormously from his exceptional \nknowledge and dedication. Mr. Shue's service has substantially helped \nour Nation's leaders make the wisest possible allocation of its defense \nresources in order to ensure America's future security.\n  Throughout his distinguished career, Mr. Shue has had the resolute \nsupport of his wife, Suzi, and his three children. He has earned the \ndeep gratitude of the American people. I wish Mr. Shue and his family \nall the best in the coming years.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/12/21/senate-section/article/S14294-2", "month": "12", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14294]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               GIVE OUR VETERANS THE CARE THEY'VE EARNED\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, it has been 3 weeks since President Bush \nsigned into law the 2006 spending bill providing funding for the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs. Unfortunately, his signature was \naccompanied by a glaring asterisk. Instead of approving the full amount \nof funding that Congress provided for veterans health care, the \nPresident bottled up $1.2 billion in emergency funding that the VA \nurgently needs to make ends meet.\n  Congress added the emergency money to the bill after discovering that \nthe President's 2006 budget request for the VA was woefully inadequate, \ncompounding a series of errors in funding assumptions by the \nadministration that led to a massive shortfall in VA funding in fiscal \nyear 2005.\n  The $1.2 billion in emergency funding was not some kind of optional \nChristmas bonus for America's veterans. It is money that the VA needs \nto cover the baseline cost of veterans health care programs. But that \nmoney cannot be released to the VA until the President signs on the \ndotted line and designates it as an emergency. Unless and until the \nPresident acts, the money will simply languish in the Treasury, \nbenefitting nobody while jeopardizing the VA's ability to meet the \nneeds of veterans. Make no mistake about it: without this money, the VA \nwill experience another shortfall in funding in 2006, and veterans will \nsuffer the consequences of diminished services and longer waiting times \nfor health care.\n  So why is the President sitting on this money? When Congress passed \nthe VA funding bill, I wrote to the President urging him to release the \nemergency funding at the same time, thus assuring veterans that health \ncare services will continue uninterrupted for the next year. But for \nsome reason, the President has chosen not to release the emergency \nmoney. Instead of sending the VA the full amount of funding that \nCongress appropriated for veterans health care in 2006--a total of \n$22.5 billion--the President has chosen to hold $1.2 billion hostage at \nthe White House.\n  What possible reason could the President have for refusing to \nrelinquish this money to the VA? Does he expect America's veterans to \nbeg for the money? Could he possibly fail to understand the importance \nof fully funding the VA health care program? Or could he have somehow \nforgotten the chaos last summer when the VA revealed that it had at \nleast a $1 billion shortfall in health care funding for 2005, and was \nfacing another gaping shortfall in 2006?\n  What kind of a signal does this send to our Nation's veterans, and to \nour men and women fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan?\n  Congress has worked diligently over the past 6 months to clean up the \nbudget mess in the VA. As a result of amendments that I spearheaded in \nthe Appropriations Committee and on the floor, the Senate seized the \ninitiative to provide emergency funding to cover the shortfall that \noccurred in 2005 and to head off another shortfall in 2006. The \nadministration, by contrast, had to be dragged to the table and only \ngrudgingly owned up to the catastrophic consequences of its sloppy and \ninept budget estimates.\n  Congress has acted. Now the ball is in the President's court, and the \nclock is ticking. Mr. President, I again call on the President to \nimmediately release the $1.2 billion in emergency funding for veterans' \nhealth care that Congress has provided.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/12/21/senate-section/article/S14294-3", "month": "12", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14294-S14296]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       MILITARY AID TO INDONESIA\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, just 1 month ago, this Congress approved \nthe Department of State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs \nAppropriations Act, of 2006. President Bush signed the bill into law on \nNovember 14. The act contains strong language concerning the political \nand military situation in Indonesia.\n  Congress requested from the administration evidence of genuine \nprogress in military reform, the protection of human rights, and \naccountability for crimes against humanity. It asked for such evidence \nbefore the administration made available to Indonesia any funds \nappropriated under the Foreign Appropriations Act for the Foreign \nMilitary Financing Program and before it issued any licenses for the \nexport of lethal defense articles for the Indonesian Armed Forces.\n  Congress also gave the administration the authority to waive these \nconditions when it is in the interests of national security to do so, \nas it usually does when placing these kinds of conditions on this or \nany administration.\n  To measure the desired improvements in military reform, we asked the \nState Department to certify that, No. 1, the Indonesian Government is \nprosecuting and punishing, in a manner\n\n[[Page S14295]]\n\nproportional to the crime, members of the Armed Forces who have been \ncredibly alleged to have committed gross violations of human rights; \nNo. 2, at the direction of the President of Indonesia, the Armed Forces \nare cooperating with civilian judicial authorities and with \ninternational efforts to resolve cases of gross violations of human \nrights in East Timor and elsewhere; and No. 3, at the direction of the \nPresident of Indonesia, the Government of Indonesia is implementing \nreforms to improve civilian control of the military.\n  Congress does not make these requests lightly, and we based our \ndecision on four decades of Indonesian history and U.S.-Indonesian \nrelations. The Indonesian Armed Forces have frequently acted to \nforestall progress and the growth of democracy in Indonesia. Over the \nlast decade, taking note of this, Congress has placed certain \nrestrictions on military assistance to Indonesia, and--over that same \nspan of time--we have seen certain positive changes in TNI behavior.\n  This progress is occurring--of course--in a larger context. Indonesia \nis making commendable progress in building one of the world's largest \ndemocracies, with democratic elections most recently in 2004.\n  Congress did not include the conditions on aid for Indonesia's \nmilitary contained in the Foreign Operations Act to hinder the \ndevelopment of Indonesian democracy or punish the Indonesian people, \nbut to assist them as they build a better future for their country.\n  The Indonesian Armed Forces have rightly been criticized in the past, \nbut I also want to emphasize the changes we have seen, the positive \nsteps Indonesia's military authorities have taken. Those steps are \nimportant and praiseworthy.\n  The Armed Forces have revised their old ``Dual Function'' doctrine, \nan artifact of the Sukarno and Suharto years, under which the Armed \nForces claimed both a military and a socio political role in the life \nof the Indonesian state.\n  Under Suharto, military officers also served as parliamentarians, \nprovincial governors, mayors, civil servants, and teachers. The Armed \nForces also controlled the police. They effectively controlled giant \nindustrial and commercial concerns such as the state oil company.\n  That has stopped. The TNI has stepped back from politics, and given \nup its reserved seats in the Indonesian Parliament.\n  Indonesia's military officers have shown repeatedly in recent years \nthat they accept their place in the new Indonesia, and during their \ncountry's last two national elections, they have behaved in an \nexemplary fashion.\n  When Indonesia suffered the terrible blows inflicted upon it by last \nDecember's tsunami, the Indonesian military acted with bravery and \ngreat humanity to bring assistance to the victims of that most terrible \nnatural disaster.\n  We recognize what they have done and we admire their commitment to \nthe new and more democratic system their country is building.\n  Sadly, while the Indonesian Armed Forces have done a great deal, they \nhave not done enough. Too many reasons for serious concern remain.\n  Six years after the TNI's involvement in East Timor's referendum on \nindependence left 1,400 people dead, the Indonesian authorities have \nnot brought one Indonesian officer to justice for abuses committed in \nthe Timorese capital of Dili and elsewhere in that island nation. \nIndeed, some officers suspected of serious abuses have received not \npunishment or censure, but promotions to higher grades of their \nservices.\n  There are numerous cases of human rights activists being harassed and \neven murdered, and we still have not seen justice for these victims.\n  Last year, when Indonesia's Parliament was considering a South \nAfrican-style truth and reconciliation commission to discuss past \natrocities, military officials objected--strongly and publicly--to the \ninclusion of ``truth'' in the commission's title, warning any ensuing \ninvestigation into past human rights crimes would not help the aim of \nbuilding national unity.\n  During that debate, a retired Indonesian major general serving in \nParliament, a man named Djasri Marin, said a remarkable thing. \nAccording to Australia's The Age newspaper, he said, ``If we reveal \neverything, it will be far from the idea of reconciliation, because \nthere will be trials.'' He added, ``If we want to disclose everything \nfor the sake of mere truth, it will prevent us from real reconciliation \n. . . Let's bury the past and step towards the future.''\n  It will be difficult to move into a common future in a unified \nfashion if the Indonesian military cannot own up to its past and take \nresponsibility for its actions. That is one reason why we need to \ncontinue promoting positive change within the Indonesian Army. We need \nto continue pressing for evidence of genuine military reform, human \nrights protections, and accountability for crimes against humanity, \njust as Congress has requested.\n  In plain and simple language, Congress made its intent clear, asking \nthe administration for evidence of genuine improvement in these three \nareas. It seems unlikely that either the President or the Secretary of \nState could have misunderstood or misconstrued this congressional \nexpression of intent. Still, only a week after President Bush signed \nthe Foreign Operations bill into law, the State Department hastily \nwaived these conditions on military assistance, squandering an \nopportunity to encourage the TNI and Indonesian authorities to engage \nin meaningful reforms.\n  The waiver authority, granted to the administration by Congress, \ncomes with implicit expectations by Congress that the administration \nwill use it wisely and well. During the few days that passed between \nthe time the President affixed his signature to the Foreign \nAppropriations Act and the moment Under Secretary of State Nicholas \nBurns affixed his signature to the waiver, the President has little \ntime to act on congressional concerns.\n  We certainly saw no major advances in the three areas marked out by \nCongress. The TNI took no new steps to assure the appropriate \nprosecution and punishment of TNI members credibly alleged to have \ncommitted gross violations of human rights. The TNI took no new steps \nto show it is cooperating with civilian judicial authorities and with \ninternational efforts to resolve cases of gross violations of human \nrights in East Timor and elsewhere. The Indonesian authorities took no \nnew steps to improve civilian control of the military. How could they? \nA week is hardly any time.\n  The great irony of all this is that the amount of assistance affected \nwould have been small; small, but of great symbolic importance. I \nregret to say that the administration's decision to waive these \nconditions on national security grounds is also of great symbolic \nimportance. Congress was promoting accountability and the rule of law \nin a democratic system. The Department of State has said the \nadministration remains committed to accountability, but its actions \nsuggest otherwise.\n  To waive these conditions in such a preemptory fashion raises serious \nquestions about the relationship this administration has decided to \nhave with Congress. In truth, it makes a mockery of the waiver process. \nCan we trust the administration to implement conditions like this in \ngood faith? They waived the conditions--on supposed national security \ngrounds--a week after the President signed the bill into law. It \nprobably takes a week just to move a paper like that through the State \nDepartment bureaucracy.\n  In truth, it demeans the process, making a national security waiver a \nwaive-it-when-you-feel-like-it waiver, rather than a last resort when \nother priorities intrude.\n  And so, I ask the administration, how shall we do business with one \nanother in the future? Does the administration want us to eliminate \nsuch waiver authorities, so that its officers are required to give our \nconcerns a fair hearing?\n  The administration needs to do more to make sure that U.S. policy and \nU.S. assistance to Indonesia promote TNI accountability and discourage \nthe impunity the TNI still enjoys. I respectfully disagree with MG \nDjasri Marin. Nobody can step towards the future by burying the past.\n  We are intensely interested in Indonesia's future and the success of \nits democracy. Indonesia is the world's fourth most populous country, \nwith an Islamic population larger than that of\n\n[[Page S14296]]\n\nany other country on the planet. It unwillingly hosts a number of \nradical terrorist groups that have killed hundreds of Indonesian \ncitizens and hundreds of foreign visitors to Indonesia's shores. It \nsits astride vital trade routes linking the Middle East to the Pacific.\n  We want Indonesia to succeed, and we will continue to support the \nIndonesia Government and the Indonesian people. But uncritical \nassistance to the TNI will only hinder Indonesia's democratic \ntransition and undermine our interests in that country.\n  We know Indonesia faces a serious terrorist threat and that the \nIndonesian authorities must act to protect their nation's citizens from \nthat threat. We have urged closer U.S. cooperation with Indonesian \npolice authorities to face down terrorism, and we support efforts to \nfund, train, and equip the Indonesian police's antiterrorism units. We \napplaud the Indonesian Government's determination to vet all members of \nsuch units to make sure they have not been involved in human rights \nviolations.\n  We do not dispute that the TNI could play an important and \nappropriate role in Indonesia's own fight against terrorism, but we \ncannot ignore the institution's history of human rights abuses. We \nshould not lend American support to an unreformed TNI, a TNI that no \nIndonesian democratic institution can hold accountable for human rights \nabuses. Congress clearly expressed its intent in this regard.\n  We will find ourselves on shaky ground--and place our \ncounterterrorism strategy in the region at risk--if we do not press for \nreforms in an Army that considers itself above the law.\n  I strongly urge the State Department to reconsider its decision to \nwaive in such a preemptory fashion the restrictions placed upon \nmilitary assistance to Indonesia by this Congress. The administration \nneeds to provide Congress with a better sense of the benchmarks it is \nusing to encourage TNI reform and measure TNI progress. And it needs to \nuse its waiver authority more judiciously if it expects Congress to \ncontinue granting such authority.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/12/21/senate-section/article/S14296-1", "month": "12", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14296]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             DORRANCE SMITH\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, earlier this week, the Committee on Armed \nServices favorably reported the nomination of Mr. Dorrance Smith to the \nfull Senate. Mr. Smith is an experienced and highly accomplished \ntelevision executive, who has been nominated to be the Assistant \nSecretary of Defense for Public Affairs. I have a copy of Mr. Smith's \nbiography, and I would note that he is a four-time Emmy award winning \ntelevision producer who spent 9 months in Iraq from 2003 to 2004 where \nhe served as Senior Media Advisor to Ambassador Paul Bremer. I have met \nwith Mr. Smith on several occasions. I believe him to be highly \nqualified, and I fully support his nomination.\n  At a full Armed Services Committee hearing on October 25, 2005, and \nlater, at an executive session of the Armed Services Committee on \nDecember 13, at which Mr. Smith was present, he fully and respectfully \nanswered all questions posed to him. Many questions focused on an op ed \narticle he wrote as a private citizen that appeared in the Wall Street \nJournal on April 25, 2005. In this article, based on his ``in the \ntrenches'' experience as Ambassador Bremer's senior media advisor in \nBaghdad, Mr. Smith questioned the practice relied on by major media \noutlets in the United States of airing video of insurgent attacks \nsupplied by the Arab satellite news channel Al Jazeera. I am satisfied \nwith Mr. Smith's responses. I would note that no major media outlet, \nexcept Al Jazeera, expressed any concern about Mr. Smith's op ed.\n  The post of Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs has been vacant \nsince June 2003. Mr. Smith is an outstanding nominee. I urge favorable, \nrapid action by the full Senate on his nomination.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the above-referenced biography be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                             Dorrance Smith\n\n       Dorrance Smith is a four-time Emmy award winning television \n     producer, political consultant, and media strategist who has \n     worked over 30 years in television and politics.\n       Mr. Smith spent nine months in Iraq in 2003-2004 where he \n     served as Senior Media Adviser to Ambassador Paul Bremer. He \n     was responsible for developing a state of the art \n     communications facility in Baghdad for the Coalition \n     Provisional Authority and a public diplomacy strategy for the \n     United States government. In addition, Mr. Smith was asked to \n     overhaul the fledgling Iraqi Media Network. By April, 2004 \n     this effort was deemed so successful that the terrestrial \n     channel--Al Iraqiya--was launched on satellite. For his \n     efforts he was awarded the Secretary of Defense Medal for \n     Exceptional Public Service.\n       More recently he has been a consultant to the Joint \n     Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies and the 2004 \n     Republican National Convention.\n       A four time Emmy Award winning ABC News and Sports \n     producer, he has held a number of positions at the network, \n     including serving as the first executive producer of ``This \n     Week with David Brinkley.''\n       From 1989 until 1991, Smith was the executive producer of \n     ABC News ``Nightline.'' During his tenure he was responsible \n     for the weeklong ``Nightline'' series originating from South \n     Africa, which covered the release of Nelson Mandela. The \n     broadcasts won an Emmy award. In addition he served as \n     executive producer of the prime time special ``Tragedy at \n     Tiananmen--The Untold Story,'' which was honored with the \n     duPont Columbia University Award, the Overseas Press Club \n     Award and an Emmy. ``Nightline'' also won an Emmy in 1991 for \n     outstanding news coverage of the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait.\n       Prior to his work on ``Nightline,'' Smith was the executive \n     producer of the number one rated Sunday public affairs \n     program, ``This Week with David Brinkley,'' a post he held \n     from the program's inception in 1981 until 1989. During his \n     tenure the broadcast received the first Joan Barone Award, \n     the George Foster Peabody Award, and was named the Best \n     National TV Interview Discussion Program by the readers of \n     the Washington Journalism Review.\n       In 1991 Smith left ABC News to become Assistant to the \n     President for Media Affairs at the White House. In this \n     capacity Smith handled all television and radio events \n     involving President Bush, members of the White House staff \n     and Cabinet. In addition his office handled all regional \n     media; coordinated media strategy for administration \n     officials seeking confirmation; and organized the debate \n     preparation during the 1992 political campaign.\n       In 2001, Smith was designated by FEMA Director Joe Allbaugh \n     to handle all media following the events of September 11th. \n     In this capacity Smith was responsible for FEMA's media \n     strategy for print, radio and television. Smith organized and \n     distributed the now famous FEMA video feeds from Ground Zero. \n     He reorganized the Public Affairs Office to meet the post \n     September 11th media demands.\n       At ABC News, Smith became executive producer of all weekend \n     news programming in 1980. He was responsible for the \n     production and programming of ``World News Saturday,'' \n     ``World News Sunday,'' ``The Weekend Report,'' and ``The \n     Health Show.''\n       Prior to his weekend assignment. Smith was Washington \n     producer of ABC News' ``The Iran Crises: America Held \n     Hostage.'' He also served as ABC News Senior Producer at the \n     1980 Winter Olympics, the 1984 Winter and Summer Games, and \n     the 1988 Winter Olympics in Calgary.\n       From 1978-1979, Smith served as ABC News' White House \n     producer. Smith joined ABC News as a Washington producer in \n     1977. Previously he was staff assistant to President Gerald \n     Ford.\n       He began his broadcasting career at ABC Sports in 1973 as \n     an assistant to the producer. In 1974 he was made Manager of \n     Program Planning for ABC's Wide World of Sports.\n       Smith is a member of the Advisory Council for the George \n     Bush Library in College Station, Texas.\n       He graduated from Claremont Men's College in 1973 with a \n     Bachelor of Arts degree.

I rise today to speak in review of the first session of \nthis 109th Congress. I have served in the Congress since 1991, and I \ncan say without exaggeration that this year has been the single most \nproductive year I have participated in. As I will detail, we have \npassed numerous significant legislative items, some of which have \nlanguished in Congress for many years. We have stayed a determined \ncourse in the global war on terror, maintaining our commitment to our \ntroops and to those eager to adopt a democratic way of life in place of \ntyranny. We have stayed a proven course to reduce the tax burden on \nAmericans and on American business. Economic indicators in the markets, \nhome ownership data, and employment all illustrate the wisdom of this \ncourse. This Congress has shown a very real commitment to principle. \nWhile there are those in this body and in the media who would like to \ndeny it,\n\n[[Page S14297]]\n\nI am confident that this session of Congress will go down in history as \nsingularly productive and representative of the will of the people.\n  The list of significant legislative items passed and signed into law \nthis year is extensive. We got off on the right foot by passing a \nbudget resolution out of the Senate on March 17, and the Congress \nadopted the budget conference report on April 28. This is amazingly \nearly when compared to the struggles we have encountered in recent \nyears. The Budget, as I have said many times before, is a vital \nblueprint for our work and a responsibility we must assume to serve the \ntaxpayers. I am a member of the Senate Budget Committee and a former \nmember of the House Budget Committee, and I am pleased to say that our \nchairman in the Senate has been as efficient and principled an advocate \nfor good budgeting policy as I have ever worked with.\n  In previous years, we have also struggled to complete our work on \nappropriations legislation. The House, where appropriations measures \nare to originate, reported every single appropriations bill out of \ncommittee by June 21. The Senate passed every bill before October 27. \nToday, as we wrap up a few remaining issues, all but the Defense and \nLabor-HHS bills have been signed into law, but it is important to note \nthat these bills were passed by the Senate in October. The leadership \non both sides of the Capitol and the members of the various \nappropriations subcommittees certainly deserve accolades for making \nsuch quick work of these difficult legislative items.\n  Congress passed the Safe, Accountable, Flexible and Efficient \nTransportation Equity Act authorizing more than $286 billion of \ninvestment in our national infrastructure. The Congress also took a \nmajor step forward this year by passing a comprehensive energy policy. \nA comprehensive energy policy will help America meet long-term demands \nfor energy. This policy will encourage greater domestic production, \nfuel diversity, research and development of new energy technologies, \nand an across-the-board improvement of energy infrastructure. One piece \nof this forward-looking policy includes the Oil Shale Development Act, \nwhich I worked on with my colleagues. This has been a prominent issue \nfor years, but we have made the right policy decision, and it is one \nthat will benefit millions of Americans in the decades to come. This \nyear, Congress also addressed the energy needs of low-income families \nby increasing funds for the Low Income Heating Assistance Program, \nLIHEAP. Increased funding for this program will help those in need as \nwinter grows more cold.\n  The work we have done on energy and transportation represents \nhistoric commitments to the public good. Virtually no aspect of our \neconomic prosperity is unaffected by our fortunes in transportation and \nenergy, and I am pleased to have been a part of these policy \nachievements.\n  After years of opposition that cost consumers untold millions, \nCongress finally passed the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer \nProtection Act, the first major revision to the U.S. Bankruptcy Code \nsince 1978. This law will save approximately $3 billion a year for \nconsumers through lower interest rates and better products and \nservices. Consumers will further benefit from The Protection of Lawful \nCommerce in Arms Act and the Class Action Fairness Act. The former puts \nan end to the frivolous lawsuits that sought to financially drain \nlawful firearms manufacturers for the acts of criminals, and the latter \ncurbs abuses in our courts that have driven costs for consumers up \nwithout benefitting the public. Frivolous lawsuits forced the firearms \nindustry to spend nearly $200 million a year to defend itself from \nthird-party actions and class action lawsuits had grown over 1,000 \npercent nationwide. Lawyers were getting rich while consumers suffered. \nThese two bills represent a major accomplishment for both consumers and \nAmerican business. We also passed the Dominican Republic-Central \nAmerica-United States Free Trade Implementation Act which will benefit \nAmerican business, consumers, and our neighbors in this hemisphere.\n  I would like to highlight another recent achievement of this \nadministration and of this Congress that we celebrated this week when \nthe first shipment of U.S. beef since December 2003 arrived in Japan. \nAs my colleagues know the Japan Government recently declared that U.S. \nbeef is every bit as safe as Japanese beef and that the beef trade may \nresume. This is a tribute to sound science, the hard work of our beef \nproducers, and the diligent work of policymakers. It is with some pride \nthat I note the first shipment of beef to be shipped to Japan was sent \nfrom Denver, CO.\n  In addition to these notable and historically significant \naccomplishments, the Congress has also passed a more humble pair of \nconsumer-friendly items in the Junk Fax Prevention Act and The Family \nEntertainment and Copyright Act. These aren't the kinds of bills that \nthe Washington, DC, crowd may see as being vital national issues, but \nthese are issues felt deeply by our constituents and the small business \ncommunity.\n  It cannot be overstated that these policies have fostered continued \neconomic growth and prosperity. More than 56,000 jobs were created in \nour economy in October this year, and more than 4.2 million jobs have \nbeen created sine May 2003. Unemployment continues to steadily decline \nas more Americans than ever are working. This is a remarkable feat by \npolicymakers, investors, small businesspeople, and families across the \ncountry. Our economy is strong.\n  Congress continued the national commitment to our men and women in \nuniform in a variety of ways this year. Though we await completion on \nthe Department of Defense appropriations bill, we have already passed \ninto law more than $80 billion for the further prosecution of the war \nin Iraq, the reconstruction of Afghanistan, and aid for our \ninternational partners. We have increased the pay of our service men \nand women with an across-the-board 3.1 percent raise, increased housing \nallowances, increased bonuses for additional retention and recruiting, \nand increased specific bonuses for those deployed overseas. We have \nalso increased the maximum life insurance allowed for an insured \nveteran or service member and secured more than $140 million for body \narmor and personal protection.\n  I am particularly pleased with the steps we have taken to support our \ntroops. Too often policymakers talk the talk without regard to action. \nIt is my hope that we will continue to be responsive and supportive of \nour troops. The people of the United States are grateful for their \ndedication and courage. We tackled important veterans health issues \nthis year, as well, by passing the Veterans Medical Services \nSupplemental. This legislation provided $1.5 billion to meet our \ncommitment to those who have served our Nation.\n  The same Defense supplemental appropriations bill included almost a \nbillion dollars in aid for those impacted by the tsunami in the Indian \nOcean almost a year ago, including more than $650 million for the \nRecovery and Reconstruction Fund.\n  Though not a legislative accomplishment, this would be a good time to \nmention the tremendous yield we have seen from the years of work by \nthis administration, the military, and Congress. This year started with \nParliamentary elections in Iraq to democratically select those \nresponsible for drafting the framework of a free Iraq. In October, the \nIraqi people approved their new constitution, and the mechanisms of \ndemocracy are still working. In Afghanistan, after many years of \nturmoil, we also witnessed the free election of a Prime Minister and of \nthe new Parliament. We must stay this course.\n  In the past year, we have also enacted a series of legislative \nproposals to provide relief to families in the gulf region. The \nunprecedented impact of Hurricane Katrina demanded an immediate \nresponse. The Gulf Coast Emergency Water Infrastructure Assistance Act, \nThe Community Disaster Loan Act, The Natural Disaster Student Aid \nFairness Act, Pell Grant Hurricane and Disaster Relief Act, Temporary \nAssistance for Needy Families Emergency Response and Recovery Act, and \nKatrina Tax Relief Act, among others, put us on the road to recovery. \nThe pair of emergency supplemental appropriations bills that Congress \npassed total well over $65 billion and have provided needed \ninfrastructure, security,\n\n[[Page S14298]]\n\nand humanitarian relief. While there is a great deal of work to be done \nin the Gulf States, Congress has and will continue to demonstrate an \nongoing commitment to this region.\n  Congress also engaged in one of the most important debates we could \nhope to have as far as our national security is concerned, that of \nenhancing the security of our borders. This year's Homeland Security \nAppropriations Act provides unprecedented funding to protect our \nborders from those who wish to enter illegally. This year we passed \nmore than $31 billion in new budget authority for the Department of \nHomeland Security, increasing border security accounts, providing an \nadditional 1,000 border patrol agents, and providing more 220 detention \nbeds.\n  Among the most high-profile issues of the year were the nominations, \nhearings, and thus far one confirmation for the U.S. Supreme Court. Not \nonly did the Senate confirm John Roberts to the Court, but Justice \nRoberts was also named to be the new Chief Justice of the Supreme \nCourt. In the time since Chief Justice Roberts came before the Senate, \nwe have also worked through a pair of nominations, one of which we will \ntake up as our first order of business in the new year. The Roberts \nnomination demonstrated the value of our system and all of its various \nparts, working together for a greater good. I look forward to the \ntimely hearings on Judge Alito's nomination and an up-or-down vote on \nhis nomination.\n  This has been an amazing year of accomplishment for the Congress. As \nI said earlier, there has not been a more productive year in my time \nhere. As proud as I am of these many accomplishments I would also like \nto discuss a few accomplishments a little closer to my home, the State \nof Colorado, where we have had a pretty big year, as well.\n  One of the ongoing projects I have worked on for many years now is \nthe cleanup of Rocky Flats. This year, we secured more than $560 \nmillion for the final stages of the cleanup. Contrary to what many may \nexpect, this cleanup was completed ahead of time and below projected \ncosts, serving both the region and the taxpayer by cleaning up this \nfacility.\n  Another long-term project that I have worked on is the destruction of \nchemical weapons at the Pueblo Depot. By working with the Department of \nDefense, we have increased funding and maintained good management \nprinciples to meet our treaty obligations in the destruction of more \nthan three-quarters of a million chemical weapons on site.\n  Just down the road from Pueblo is Fort Carson. I recently held a town \nmeeting at Fort Carson to discuss a variety of issues important to that \nbase and to that community, including the political process that \naccompanies BRAC. We secured more than $120 million in military \nconstruction funds for new barracks and training at the facility as \nwell as securing funds to prevent encroachment at the base. Even \nfurther on up the road is another jewel in America's military \ninfrastructure, the U.S. Air Force Academy. Our ongoing efforts to \nassess progress and address problems at the Academy have been very \nproductive thus far, and we secured $18 million to upgrade academic \nfacilities and family housing this year. It is with some pleasure that \nI can also say I attended all four board of visitor meetings at the \nacademy this year.\n  This has also been a year of accomplishment for Colorado's space \nindustry. This year we added $60 million for military satellite \nprojects in Colorado, secured $12 million for the space control \nfacility at Peterson Air Force Base, and $6 million for the space \nwarning facility in Greeley. In keeping with these efforts to modernize \nand expand our posture in space I held four Space Power Caucus events. \nSpace is indeed a great frontier, and it is one where we must maintain \nan aggressive stance. Just as it is important that the military sector \nbe moving forward in space, it is equally vital that our workforce and \nour students learn about space science and perform cutting-edge \nresearch. This year we secured more than $10,000,000 for student space \nprograms at the University of Colorado, Colorado State University, the \nChallenger Learning Center, and the Space Foundation. The students who \nwill benefit from these programs are our future.\n\n  Students in my home State will likewise benefit from our continued \nsupport of the University of Colorado's Center for Micro and Nano-\ntechnology, which will receive three-quarters of a million dollars for \ncutting edge scientific research that dwells on the cutting edge. \nCongress has seen fit to support Colorado State University's Pueblo \ncampus, as well, providing $250,000 for the Western Forensic Law \nEnforcement Training Center.\n  I spoke earlier of the importance of the highway bill and its impact \non our Nation's infrastructure. In Colorado, this will translate in to \na variety of projects. We secured $80,000,000 for the T-Rex highway \nimprovement program, $5 million for the west corridor, and $9 million \nfor the Colorado Association of Transit Agencies, a statewide coalition \nof agencies focused on the future of mass transit in my home State. Our \nsuccessful year of investment in infrastructure includes a variety of \nprojects around the State, including projects such as the Rio Grande \nbike trail in Garfield County, funding for the Pikes Peak Highway, \nState Highway 145 from Dolores to Stoner, the Ports-to-Plains Corridor, \nand Frisco's West Main Street.\n  In the Agriculture Appropriations Act we secured more than $300,000 \nfor the Cooperative State Research, Education and Extension Services \nfor the Russian Wheat Aphid Resistance, Stress Tolerance and Quality \nEnhancement Project, more than 800,000 for infectious disease research \nto the Center for Economically Important Infectious Animal Diseases at \nColorado State University, and almost $900,000 for the National Beef \nCattle Evaluation Consortium, comprised of Colorado State University in \nFort Collins, Cornell University, and the University of Georgia.\n  Our efforts this year also yielded $400,000 for tamarisk eradication \nefforts, more than $10,000,000 for new science and technology facility \nat the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, and $10,000,000 for design \nand construction of a new NREL Administrative Facility, and more than \n$55,000,000 for the Animas-La Plata project. In addition to securing \nfunding to help my home State combat chronic wasting disease, we worked \nthis year to direct the Animal Plant Health Inspection Service at USDA \nto begin to promulgate rules for dealing with this disease.\n  Another ongoing project that I have been pleased to work on with my \ncolleagues is the modernization and expansion of the Centers for \nDisease Control lab in Ft. Collins. This facility, which provides vital \nresearch on vector-borne disease, will receive $24,000,000 this year.\n  We have been very fortunate in the State of Colorado. I appreciate \nthe efforts of my colleagues in recognizing the vital research, \nmilitary, and educational facilities housed in Colorado.\n  On a more personal note, this year I opened a new State office in \nDurango, CO. I would like to urge colleagues, if they have not been, to \npay a visit to this charming mountain community in southwestern \nColorado. Durango offers terrific recreation in summer and winter, and \nI look forward to being able to enhance my constituent service with \nthis new office.\n  Each of my State offices and my office here in Washington joined with \nthe University of Denver and the University of Northern Colorado this \nyear to host the sixth annual Allard Capitol Conference. This year, we \nhosted more than 100 Colorado citizens for 3 days of civic learning and \nparticipation. This annual conference is one of the most enjoyable \nthings I am able to do with constituents each year.\n  It has been an extraordinary year of accomplishment for the Congress \nand for Colorado. We have a tremendous amount of inertia going in to \nthe second half of the 109th Congress, and I look forward to the new \nyear and all of its challenges.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/12/21/senate-section/article/S14298-1", "month": "12", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14298-S14299]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      CLERICAL ERROR CLARIFICATION\n\n  Mr. GREGG.

Mr. President, I rise today to speak in support of the \nreauthorization of the Trafficking Victims Protection Act.\n  The scourge of trafficking in women and children was a priority for \nme as First Lady and continues to be a priority for me as a Senator. \nSince the United Nations Fourth World Conference on Women in 1995, I \nhave been working to raise awareness of the heinous practice of buying \nand selling women and children like commodities. I have seen the \ndevastation that it causes, and the lives it ruins. I have met with the \nfamilies from Eastern and Central Europe, who, with tears in their \neyes, pleaded with me to help them find lost ones who had been stolen \nfrom them, and I have met with the victims, including a 12-year-old \ngirl in Thailand who was dying of AIDS after being sold twice by her \nfamily. This barbaric practice has caused far too many to exist in a \nperpetual state of fear and vulnerability, and we must do everything in \nour power to bring the scourge of trafficking out of the shadows and to \nthe attention of the world.\n  I am proud to say that the United States has, for the past decade, \nbeen the leader in trying to persuade the rest of the world to \neradicate this abhorrent practice. As the Clinton administration \nincreased the antitrafficking activities of our Government through \nprograms at the State Department and the Department of Justice, \nCongress was developing legislation to eradicate trafficking. We worked \nwith the late Senator Wellstone, his Republican cosponsor, Senator \nBrownback, and Congressman Chris Smith and former Congressman Sam \nGejdenson in the House, to introduce the first comprehensive \nantitrafficking bill in Congress. This culminated in the passage of the \nVictims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act of 2000. I believed \nthen, and I believe now, that this is one of the Clinton \nadministration's greatest achievements and one of the most important \nparts of Senator Wellstone's legacy. That law has meant the difference \nbetween freedom and enslavement for unknown numbers of potential \ntrafficking victims, and this reauthorization provides us with the \nopportunity to strengthen its ability to help those who have been \ntrafficked, and I would like to thank Senator Brownback and \nRepresentative Smith, my colleagues on the Helsinki Commission, for \ntheir continued commitment to this act since its initial passage.\n  I am proud to see that this reauthorization enhances the 3 P's \nstrategy--prevention of trafficking, prosecution of those that engage \nin these acts, and protection of the vulnerable individuals who have \nbeen trafficked--that we developed in the Clinton administration. It \ngives the Justice Department the authority to pursue extraterritorial \nprosecutions of Federal employees or those accompanying them if they \nengage in trafficking activities. It encourages the prevention of \ntrafficking by requiring organizations or contractors engaged in U.S.-\nsupported peacekeeping efforts to have antitrafficking policies in \nplace. And it will protect those who have been trafficked overseas by \nincreasing funding for programs like residential treatment facilities.\n  But there is still so much work to be done. Although reliable \nstatistics are difficult to find, we know that 800,000 individuals--the \nvast majority of whom are women and children--are trafficked from one \ncountry to another every year, with 15,000 being trafficked to the \nUnited States. The FBI estimates that trafficking generates $9.5 \nbillion annually for organized crime syndicates around the world.\n  I am deeply concerned about the growing domestic commercial sex \ntrade, and I believe that we need to increase funding and target \nefforts to end all forms of exploitation. Any expansion of our focus \nmust not dilute our commitment to eradicating human trafficking in all \nits forms in the United States, nor detract from the progress we have \nmade in increasing prosecutions and working with law enforcement \nagencies. We must ensure that our government has all the resources it \nneeds to make inroads against these awful acts on our own soil.\n  In the fight against trafficking in persons, patience simply is not \nan option. I look forward to continuing to work with my colleagues to \nend this barbaric practice in both the United States and around the \nworld, because this is not about politics, but about what we all share: \nuniversal freedom and universal human rights.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/12/21/senate-section/article/S14299-2", "month": "12", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14299-S14300]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        KATRINA RECOVERY EFFORTS\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, this holiday season is a time for \nfamilies to come together, reflect on the year's challenges and \nopportunities, and give thanks for all that has been accomplished. It \nis also a time to take action to help those less fortunate.\n  The year 2005 was a year of great challenges, and among the greatest \nwere the hurricanes that ripped through the gulf coast.\n  The magnitude of Hurricane Katrina was unprecedented. Its aftermath \nbrought us images that we thought we would never see in America--lives \nlost, communities destroyed, families uprooted.\n  The toll was particularly devastating for hundreds of thousands of \nyoung children and students torn from the surroundings and institutions \nthey depend on, and I'd like to spend a few moments discussing this \naspect of the recovery effort.\n  We are all familiar with the devastation that past hurricanes have \ncaused. Some have temporarily closed schools and colleges. In the \naftermath of Hurricane Andrew in 1992, the Army, Navy, and National \nGuard joined in helping to repair classrooms and reopen school doors in \nabout 3 weeks. Last year, Florida schools damaged by Hurricane Charley \nreopened within a month, and students were quickly back on track in \ntheir classrooms.\n  But Hurricane Katrina caused vastly greater devastation, especially \nin Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama. More than 700 schools and 30 \ncolleges and universities were damaged or destroyed. Almost all have \nbeen closed, at least temporarily, and many will not open until January \nat the earliest. Some are in danger of never reopening.\n  The number of students affected is staggering. More than 370,000 \nelementary, middle, and high school students were displaced. Over \n100,000 college students were affected by the disaster. And 18,500 Head \nStart or Early Head Start children were uprooted from programs.\n  These are not just statistics. These are real people whose lives have \nbeen changed forever.\n  Hurricane Katrina reminded us that we are all part of a single \nAmerican family. And we have a responsibility to help members of that \nfamily when they are in need.\n  For too many weeks, our friends in the gulf region have waited for \nCongress to provide help in rebuilding their lives and their \ncommunities. Today, I am pleased that we will take an important step in \nactually providing the assistance so obviously needed.\n  The Katrina and Rita relief provisions in the conference report \npassed by the Senate today include several proposals developed by \nSenator Enzi and myself to help the children and students affected by \nthese hurricanes.\n  It includes assistance to ensure that the youngest children uprooted \nby these tragic storms receive the services, help, and support they \nneed. The bill dedicates funding to provide access to Head Start \npreschool programs and child care.\n  It provides much-needed relief for the public and private schools \nacross the country that generously opened their doors to schoolchildren \nwhose lives were turned upside-down by these disasters. These schools \nprovided classrooms, teachers, and services for all of these students, \nand did so without a penny from the Federal Government.\n  It also includes relief for colleges in the affected areas, and \nensures that college students displaced by the hurricane will receive \nthe financial aid they need to stay in school and continue working \ntoward their degree. Several colleges in Louisiana are in danger of\n\n[[Page S14300]]\n\nclosing their doors for good, unless they receive this critical \nassistance soon. The funding approved by the Senate today may not be \nenough to guarantee their future, but at least it offers much needed \nsupport.\n  This relief is long overdue, and I commend the Senate for taking \naction.\n  When these devastating storms struck, the entire nation responded in \na way that is as caring and as generous as the American spirit.\n  Thousands volunteered to help. Families opened their homes. School \ndistricts across the country accommodated displaced students in their \nschools. Colleges and universities graciously opened their doors.\n  The Nation is grateful to all who did so much to help respond in the \ntragic aftermath of the hurricanes. We are grateful to the school \nprincipals and superintendents and the college presidents and deans who \nserved as first-Responders and helped so many students continue their \neducation.\n  But these educators need help as they struggle to accommodate the \nstudents. Congress must do its part to help these devastated \ncommunities get back on their feet and enable students to return to \ntheir schools. We also need to help the institutions that are laboring \nso hard to provide a safety net for these children and their families.\n  That is why the proposals in this conference report are so important. \nThis funding will rehabilitate and strengthen the educational \ninstitutions that serve and assist children and students affected by \nHurricanes Katrina and Rita, and help meet the needs of early \neducation, elementary and secondary education, and higher education.\n  Thousands of young children affected by the storms need to return \nhome to safe and healthy settings. They need good early childhood \nprograms in adequate facilities. Their families need health and \ncounseling services to cope with the trauma brought on by the storms.\n  The bill facilitates enrollment in Head Start and Early Head Start by \nwaiving income eligibility and other requirements, so that families \naffected by Katrina will be able to enroll their children more easily. \nIt provides $90 million for affected Head Start centers to provide \npreschool opportunities to displaced students. It also provides \nadditional support and guidance to meet the emotional needs of children \nand their families.\n  We are reminded by this disaster that schools are the heart of local \ncommunities across America. When schools open, families return, \nbusinesses return, and lives begin to return to normal. So I am pleased \nthat the report provides $750 million for special school reopening \ngrants to districts and communities significantly affected by Hurricane \nKatrina.\n  These grants will aid in the effort to retain highly qualified \nteachers, recover lost data, establish temporary facilities, and take \nother steps necessary to reopen the schools.\n  The bill also responds to the efforts of schools in Texas, Georgia, \nFlorida, and other States that opened their doors to displaced \nstudents. It provides $645 million for public and private schools that \nhave enrolled displaced students, in order to ease the transition of \nstudents into new schools, support basic instruction, purchase \ntextbooks and materials, and temporarily expand facilities to avoid \novercrowding.\n  Both public and private schools can benefit from this aid, but the \nproposal sets ideology aside and rejects the attempts by the House and \nthe administration to provide this aid in the form of vouchers to \nparents through a 1-800 number. Instead, the bill uses the mechanisms \nof current law to provide aid for students in private schools through \nthe public school system.\n  The funds can only be used for the same list of allowable educational \nservices as for public schools and so cannot and should not be used for \nreligious activities. It makes clear that all of the aid is temporary, \nand is being provided in response to the extraordinary circumstances \nresulting from these disasters. It is not a precedent for future \npolicymaking.\n  In addition, to help meet the demand for qualified teachers, the bill \nauthorizes the Secretary of Education to encourage states to extend \ntemporary reciprocity for the certification of teachers and para-\nprofessionals across state lines. Teachers certified as highly \nqualified in one state should be recognized as meeting this standard in \nother States as well.\n  To ease the burden faced by colleges and universities in the declared \ndisaster area, the bill also authorizes the Secretary of Education to \nwaive various Federal reporting requirements. It includes $200 million \nfor student aid and waives the institutional matching requirement for \nstudents affected by the hurricane. These funds can also be used to \nhelp institutions in Louisiana rebuild their facilities and welcome \ntheir students home. Our priority should be to help these colleges and \nuniversities move into the future.\n  This relief package is a welcome step to help life return to normal \nfor the hundreds of thousands of children and students uprooted by \nthese deadly storms. We begin today to help the gulf coast communities \nrebuild and re-open their schools and colleges.\n  We need to continue this important work in the coming weeks, by \nassessing the ongoing needs of those affected by the hurricanes, and \ndoing all that is necessary to help them rebuild their lives.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/12/21/senate-section/article/S14300-1", "month": "12", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14300]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          FAILURE OF HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES TO PASS S. 1558\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. I am disappointed that the House of Representatives has \nfailed to act on S. 1558, which passed the Senate on November 10. This \nbill was introduced by Senators Collins and Lieberman. I worked with \nthem to amend it to extend for 4 years the ``sunset'' of a provision \nfirst enacted in the Identity Theft and Assumption Deterrence Act of \n1998 that grants the Judicial Conference of the United States the \nauthority to redact information from a judge's mandatory financial \ndisclosure in circumstances in which it is determined that the release \nof the information could endanger the filer or the filer's family. The \nbill, as amended, also extends the protections of this provision to the \nfamily members of filers.\n  Like the more comprehensive court security measure Senator Specter \nand I have introduced, S, 1968, the Court Security Improvement Act of \n2005, CSIA, from which it is drawn, S. 1558 provides judges and their \nfamilies with needed security by extending the judges' redaction \nauthority without interruption and expanding it to their families. It \nalso strikes the right balance with the need for continuing \ncongressional oversight to prevent the misuse of this redaction \nauthority, which has been a matter of some concern to me. I appreciate \nthat the Judicial Conference is seeking to improve its practices and \nthe Senate passed S. 1558 because none of us wants to see judges or \ntheir families endangered. Now, because of the failure of the House to \npass S. 1558 and enact the reauthorization of redaction authority for \nanother 4-year period, these protections will lapse at the end of the \nyear.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/12/21/senate-section/article/S14300-2", "month": "12", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14300-S14301]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              EPA'S PROPOSED PARTICULATE MATTER STANDARDS\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise to speak on behalf of myself and \nSenators Carper, Boxer, Clinton, Lautenberg, Lieberman, and Obama.\n  Last night, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency proposed new \nNational Ambient Air Quality Standards for fine particulate matter. The \nNational Ambient Air Quality Standards are the cornerstone of the Clean \nAir Act. These standards must be set at a level ``requisite to public \nhealth'' with ``an adequate margin of safety.'' They are to be based on \nthe ``latest scientific knowledge,'' and EPA is prohibited from \nconsidering costs in setting them. Their fundamental purpose is to \nensure that our air is safe to breathe.\n  We have known for years that fine particle pollution causes premature \ndeath, increased asthma attacks, and numerous other health effects. In \n1997, EPA revised the particulate matter standard on the basis of that \nevidence. The Clean Air Act directs that EPA, together with an \nindependent scientific review panel, examine the available scientific \nevidence and determine whether the existing standard needs to be \nchanged. The proposal by EPA last night, coming almost 5 years late, \nrepresents the end result of that effort. Unfortunately, EPA selected \nthe weakest option available to it.\n  In determining whether to revise the standard, EPA reviewed the more \nthan\n\n[[Page S14301]]\n\n2000 scientific studies that have been published since 1996. These \nstudies confirm the earlier research results that demonstrate the \nstrong relationship between particle pollution and illness, \nhospitalization, and premature death. Some of the more recent studies \nshow the strong relationship between particle pollution and \ncardiovascular illnesses that trigger heart attacks and strokes. These \nstudies also indicate a stronger relationship between short term PM \nexposure and health effects than was evident in 1997.\n  Under the Clean Air Act, EPA is required to consider the advice of an \nindependent scientific review panel, the Clean Air Science Advisory \nCommittee, CASAC, which must include at least one member of the \nNational Academy of Sciences, one physician, and one person \nrepresenting State air pollution control agencies. That body \nexhaustively reviewed the current body of scientific evidence and \nconcluded that EPA must revise both its short term--24 hour or daily--\nPM standard, and its annual PM standard. Unfortunately, EPA chose to \ndisregard that advice and proposed to only revise the daily standard. \nAnd in making its proposal on the 24-hour standard, it choose the \nhighest level recommended by CASAC--35 micrograms per cubic meter.\n  It is apparent that the level proposed by EPA was not based entirely \non the latest scientific knowledge. The level of the standard proposed \nby EPA will leave millions of Americans unprotected. It will also \nrequire few, if any, additional controls to be put in place. EPA chose \nthe least protective approach that it could and disregarded the advice \nof the CASAC by failing to revise the annual standard. Had EPA followed \nthe recommendations of CASAC, it could have proposed options that would \nhave prevented more than twice as many deaths. That is not even \nconsidering the Clean Air Act requirement for an ``adequate margin of \nsafety'' that considers ``sensitive subpopulations.''\n  Playing politics with public health is unconscionable. When these \nstandards were last revised in 1997, they were subject to multiyear \nlitigation battle. Ultimately the Supreme Court unanimously upheld the \n1997 standards and the scientific process that was used to develop \nthem. The science we have available to us today is even clearer than it \nwas then. Fine particle pollution kills people at levels below the \nexisting standards. We need to change these standards and heed the \nadvice of our best and brightest scientific minds. We need to let them \ntell us when the air is safe to breathe. When EPA makes its final \ndecision in September regarding a new national ambient air quality \nstandard, it must do so based on scientific, rather than political \nconsiderations. The very lives of our citizens depend on it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/12/21/senate-section/article/S14301-1", "month": "12", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14301-S14302]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           CAPITAL PUNISHMENT\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, we recently passed a disturbing \nmilestone in this country. One morning just a few weeks ago in North \nCarolina, Kenneth Lee Boyd was put to death by lethal injection. Mr. \nBoyd's was the one thousandth execution since the death penalty was \nreinstated in 1976. While a jury decided that his guilt was not in \ndoubt, confidence in the extraordinary punishment he received \nincreasingly is.\n  Across the Nation, people are reconsidering capital punishment. \nRecent polls, jury verdicts, and actions taken by all three branches of \ngovernment in States across the country reflect the changing attitudes \nabout the death penalty in this country. Americans are increasingly \nconcerned about the use of this very final punishment.\n  With advances in DNA technology, numerous exonerations of people on \ndeath row, and new revelations that innocent people have actually been \nput to death, more and more people are questioning the accuracy and \nfairness of the administration of the death penalty. In addition, more \nand more people have qualms about the very concept of state-sponsored \nexecutions. This trend is a hopeful sign, as I believe there continue \nto be numerous moral, ethical and legal problems with the death \npenalty.\n  According to a series of Gallup polls, opposition to the death \npenalty has grown from 13 percent of Americans in 1995 to 30 percent in \nOctober of this year. Think about that. In just 10 years, we went from \na vast majority of Americans supporting the death penalty, to nearly \none-third now opposing it. That is the highest level of opposition \nsince its reinstatement almost 30 years ago. And a CBS News poll from \nApril indicates that when people were asked whether they prefer the \ndeath penalty or life without parole for individuals convicted of \nmurder, only 39 percent supported the death penalty.\n  Evidence of the changing attitudes about the death penalty can be \nseen across America. The U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops recently \nlaunched a campaign to end the use of the death penalty. In New York \nearlier this year, the State's highest court struck down the State's \ncapital punishment statute, which had passed only 10 years earlier in \n1995. The legislature then declined to reinstate the law, making New \nYork the first state to abandon capital punishment since 1976. That is \na remarkable sign of progress.\n  Meanwhile, just over the river in Virginia, the death penalty was a \nkey issue in the last gubernatorial election. Tim Kaine, the current \nLieutenant Governor, has long been personally opposed to the death \npenalty, although he pledged to enforce the law in Virginia. In the \nfinal weeks before the election, his opponent Jerry Kilgore began an ad \ncampaign that heavily criticized Kaine's opposition to the death \npenalty. Kilgore strongly supports capital punishment and during the \ncampaign he said he would push to expand its use in Virginia. But when \nKilgore went after Kaine on the death penalty, Virginians did not take \nthe bait. Despite Kilgore's attack ads, the citizens of Virginia \nelected Kaine Governor, and he will become Virginia's Governor in \nJanuary.\n  I think what happened in Virginia strongly demonstrates how far we \nhave come. This issue can no longer be used as a political grenade. A \nmajority of Americans may not yet oppose the death penalty, but the \nelectorate understands what a serious issue this is, and it will not \nstand for capital punishment to be exploited for political purposes.\n\n  Yet another example of the seriousness with which citizens and \npoliticians alike are treating this .issue is outgoing Virginia \nGovernor Mark Warner's recent commutation of the sentence of Robin \nLovitt to life in prison. Mr. Lovitt was convicted of robbery and \nmurder and sentenced to death, but before he had exhausted all judicial \nremedies, a court employee destroyed the physical evidence in his \ncase--the very evidence that Lovitt said would exonerate him if \nsubjected to new advanced DNA analysis. Under Virginia law, the \nCommonwealth must keep all physical evidence until the defendant has \nexhausted all posttrial remedies. Although Governor Warner is a death \npenalty supporter, he decided that he simply could not put a man to \ndeath when the State itself had destroyed his ability to prove his \ninnocence. As he put it, he believed that the case ``require[d] \nexecutive intervention to reaffirm public confidence in our justice \nsystem.'' In his almost 4 years as Governor, this was the first time \nGovernor Warner granted a clemency petition.\n  On the other side of the country, we have seen a great deal of public \ndebate as Governor Schwarzenegger considered a clemency petition for \nStanley Tookie Williams. Williams was a founding member of the Crips \ngang and was convicted of four murders in 1981. During his years in \nprison, however, Williams, by all accounts, worked to turn his life \naround. He denounced gang violence, tried to keep kids out of gangs, \nand even helped broker peace deals between rival gangs. Governor \nSchwarzenegger denied clemency and refused to commute Mr. Williams' \ndeath sentence to life without parole. The State of California put Mr. \nWilliams to death on December 13.\n  Much more is happening at the State level that has not received \nnearly as much attention. North Carolina and California recently \ncreated commissions to study the administration of the death penalty in \ntheir respective States, joining many other states that have already \ndone so. Moratoriums on executions remain in place in Illinois and New \nJersey, and are under consideration in other States. Many State \nlegislatures have worked to address flaws in their systems or even \nrejected\n\n[[Page S14302]]\n\nefforts to reinstate the death penalty. State courts have limited or \nbanned the death penalty, including the Kansas Supreme Court, which in \n2001 ruled that State's death penalty law unconstitutional. That case, \nKansas v. Marsh, was heard in the U.S. Supreme Court just last week. \nEven in Texas, the State that executes by far the most people every \nyear, a life-without-parole sentence was recently enacted, giving \njuries a strong alternative to the death penalty. And Texas Governor \nPerry also established a Criminal Justice Advisory Council to review \nthe State's capital punishment procedures.\n  These signs of progress have coincided with critical new restraints \nimposed by the Supreme Court, which in recent years has issued two key \nrulings that limited the application of the death penalty. In 2002, the \nCourt held in Atkins v. Virginia that applying the death penalty to \nmentally retarded defendants was excessive and constituted cruel and \nunusual punishment in violation of the Eighth Amendment. And just this \nyear, in Roper v. Simmons, the Court made the same decision with regard \nto individuals who commit crimes before their eighteenth birthday. \nCapital punishment for mentally retarded defendants and juveniles is \nnow unconstitutional in the United States.\n\n  Mr. President, as I mentioned before, there are many reasons people \nare questioning the death penalty in ever-increasing numbers. A common \nconcern is that innocent people end up on death row, and we cannot \ntolerate errors when the state is imposing such a final penalty. More \nthan 120 people on death row have been exonerated and released. Think \nabout that. Just over one thousand people have been executed in the era \nof the modem death penalty, while a number equaling 12 percent of those \nexecuted have been exonerated. Those are not good odds, Mr. President.\n  Even more horrific is the prospect that we have already executed \nindividuals who were, in fact, innocent. It saddens me greatly to \nreport that information has come to light strongly demonstrating that \ntwo men put to death in this country in the 1990s may well have been \ninnocent. That sends chills down my spine, as I'm sure it must for my \ncolleagues.\n  Earlier this year in Missouri, local prosecutors in St. Louis \nreopened the case of a 1980 murder because the evidence against the man \nconvicted of the crime had fallen apart. That man, Larry Griffin, was \nsentenced to death, and he was executed by the State of Missouri more \nthan 10 years ago. Yet now, 25 years after the crime and more than 10 \nyears after his execution, very serious questions about his guilt are \nbeing raised. CNN recently reported that a University of Michigan law \nprofessor who researched the case found that the first police officer \non the scene now claims the person who testified as an eyewitness gave \nfalse testimony. A victim of the shooting, who was never contacted \nbefore Mr. Griffin's original trial, stated that the person claiming to \nbe an eyewitness at the original trial was not present at the scene of \nthe crime. Samuel Gross, the Michigan law professor who supervised the \nnew investigation of the case that led to the St. Louis Circuit \nAttorney's decision, was quoted as saying with regard to this man's \ninnocence: ``There's no case that I know of where the evidence that's \nbeen produced in public is as strong as what we see here.''\n  The second case is from Texas, where a young man named Ruben Cantu \nwas executed in 1993. He was just seventeen at the time of the murder \nfor which he was executed. Again, in this case, the only eyewitness to \nthe crime has recanted his statement, and told the Houston Chronicle \nthat Cantu was innocent. The Houston Chronicle also reported that the \njudge, prosecutor, head juror, and defense attorney have since realized \nthat, as the newspaper put it, ``his conviction seems to have been \nbuilt on omission and lies.''\n  The loss of one innocent life through capital punishment should be \nenough to force all of us to stop and reconsider this penalty. These \ncases illustrate the grave danger in imposing the death penalty. \nWhatever the new evidence that might come to light, it doesn't matter. \nThere's no going back.\n  Mr. President, I know that many people in this country say that it \ndoesn't matter what other countries do or say, that we should not look \nabroad for ideas. But the fact is that attitudes are changing around \nthe world about capital punishment, and the United States is in poor \ncompany internationally on this issue. We are the only Western \ndemocracy ranked in the top ten countries in executions in 2004. And \nincreasingly, other countries are rejecting capital punishment. Over \nthe past 10 years, according to Amnesty International, an average of \nthree countries per year has abolished the death penalty.\n  In closing, I urge my colleagues to take a long, hard look at capital \npunishment. Years of study have shown that the death penalty does \nlittle to deter crime, and that defendants' likelihood of being \nsentenced to death depends heavily on whether they are rich or poor, \nand what race their victims were. We have experienced again and again \nthe risks, and realities, of innocent people being sentenced to death. \nI believe that is it wrong for the State to put people to death, \nespecially when we can achieve our public safety goals by sentencing \nthem to life without parole. It is heartening to see so many people \nreconsidering the death penalty, and it is my hope that in time we will \nend it in the United States.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/12/21/senate-section/article/S14302-1", "month": "12", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14302-S14303]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                  IRAQ\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, over the weekend the Senate passed my \nresolution, S. Res. 338, to honor the first 2,152 troops who have died \nin Iraq and Afghanistan by listing their names and hometowns in the \nCongressional Record. They deserve this tribute for their valiant \nsupport of their military obligations.\n  I appreciate the support of my colleagues on this measure. It is a \nsymbolic way for us to honor each of our fallen heroes individually.\n  But there is another way we can honor their memory. And that is to be \nhonest and truthful about the war in which they fought--Iraq.\n  The President has taken small steps toward candor on Iraq, but the \ndenial of reality is still apparent in his speeches.\n  To make matters worse, the President is still making insulting \ninsinuations about those who criticize his Iraq policy. In his Sunday \nnight address to the nation, President Bush said:\n\n       Some look at the challenges in Iraq and conclude that the \n     war is lost, and not worth another dime or another day.\n\n  Does this statement suggest that those who disagree with the \nPresident would not even spend a trivial amount to protect America's \ninternational interests?\n  The President states that the sacrifices in Iraq are made in dimes \nand days. But what about lives?\n  What about the more than two American lives given each day so far \nthis year in Iraq? The President didn't mention that.\n  I have gone to many memorial services and funerals for brave, young \nAmericans from New Jersey who died in Iraq. Seventy-three soldiers with \nties to New Jersey have died in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n  I have also visited Walter Reed Army Hospital here in Washington \nseveral times, and I have been struck by the incredible resilience and \ndedication to country of those young Americans.\n  While these brave men and women put their lives on the line, this \nadministration bypasses reality.\n  Today we know that Iraq did not pose an imminent threat to our \nnational security. We know that there were not weapons of mass \ndestruction. We also learned that Iraq had nothinq to do with 9/11 and \nactually had an adversarial relationship with al-Qaida.\n  There is no doubt Saddam Hussein was a maniacal dictator who killed, \ntortured, and suppressed his own people.\n  But President Bush did not call for an invasion of Iraq based on \nSaddam's treatment of his own people. President Bush called for war \nwith Iraq because he argued that Saddam was a direct threat to the \nAmerican people.\n  That turned out to be untrue, plain and simple.\n  Now, in the wake of the administration's mishandling of this war, \nmuch of Iraq has turned into a magnet for terrorists and extremists. \nPresident Bush continues to say that Iraq is a ``central\n\n[[Page S14303]]\n\nfront of the war on terror.'' But the reality is that Iraq has become a \nterrorist front as a result of President Bush's mistakes.\n  Our 160,000 troops in Iraq have become a tarqet for cowardly \ninsurgents who attack us with roadside bombs and suicide attacks.\n  This is not progress.\n  Despite claims by supporters of the President's Iraq policy we are \nnot making sufficient progress in Iraq. Unfortunately, we may be \nsinking deeper into a quaqmire.\n  We have not made progress because the President has never put \ntogether a coherent plan for postinvasion Iraq.\n  For evidence of this, one need only look at the infamous speech \naboard the aircraft carrier on May 1, 2003, when President Bush \ndeclared ``mission accomplished.''\n  ``Mission accomplished'' sure sounded like the job was done and our \ntroops can begin to come home.\n  But we now know the mission was not accomplished on May 1, 2003.\n  More recently, over the past few weeks, President Bush has been \nmaking speeches about Iraq in an attempt to reshape people's \nperceptions of the war. The President knows that polls show that a \nmajority of the American people do not believe that the war is being \nmanaged properly.\n  President Bush thinks if something is repeated often enough, people \nwill eventually believe it.\n  But the American people will not stand still while we lose more of \nour courageous young men and women.\n  We all pray that Thursday's Iraqi elections will lead to a viable \ngovernment that will create stability. It could be a critical first \nstep.\n  But where are the plans if the elections do not lead to success? How \nlong until more lost lives exhaust the patience and will of the \nAmerican people?\n  In the meantime, supporters of the President point to evidence of \nsignificant progress as more satellite dishes appear on Iraqi roofs and \ncell phones are in Iraqi hands. But while the anxiety and fear existing \nin thousands of American families continues, Iraqi satellite dishes and \ncell phones do not suggest relief.\n  It seems possible to get an honest assessment from the administration \nof any future plans to get our people home.\n  That probably explains why some of President Bush's statements on \nIraq have been contradicted by current military leaders.\n  For example, last June President Bush said there were 160,000 Iraqi \ntroops trained and ready to fight. But then, a few months later, Gen. \nGeorqe W. Casey, Jr.--the top U.S. commander in Iraq--said only one \nIraqi battalion was able to conduct operations independently of \nAmerican forces. That means less than a thousand Iraqi soldiers were \nactually equipped to fight without our help.\n  And we should pay close attention to what the former head of U.S. \nCentral Command--retired Gen. Anthony Zinni--said about this Iraq \noperation.\n  General Zinni has described the poor planning for the Iraq war as, \n``at a minimum true dereliction, negligence and irresponsibility, at \nworse, lying, incompetence and corruption.''\n  General Zinni went on to say, ``And to think that we are going to \n`stay the course'--the course is headed over Niagra Falls.''\n  Other generals with vast experience voiced serious doubt to the White \nHouse about Iraq, including Norman Schwarzkopf, Wesley Clark, Brent \nScowcroft and Eric Shinseki.\n  But the people who wear a suit--not a uniform--in the administration \ndidn't listen.\n  I served in the Army. I have met thousands of soldiers. I know that \nit takes about 3 months to turn a young American into a trained and \ndedicated soldier. So why has it taken almost 3 years to train a \nhandful of Iraqis to be able to fight for their country?\n  President Bush also said this war has made us safer. But Iraq is not \nsafe for our troops or the Iraqi people. We had 85 soldiers killed last \nmonth--one of the deadliest months since the war began.\n  There have been over 70 suicide bombings in the last 2 months, an \naverage of more than one a day and more than 3,000 concealed bombs \neither exploded or discovered.\n  President Bush points to last Thursday's parliamentary elections in \nIraq as a sign that there is light at the end of the tunnel. Let's hope \nthis is true.\n  But we have heard rosy predictions from this President before, yet \nthe insurgency seemed to only grow each time.\n  Remember: We also heard rosy predictions when the President said \n``mission accomplished.'' We heard it when Saddam Hussein was captured. \nWe heard it a year ago after the first election in Iraq.\n  Meanwhile, 2,158 of our best young Americans have been killed. And \nnearly 16,000 have been wounded--many with injuries that will forever \nchange their lives. No wonder a significant majority of the American \npeople do not believe that President Bush has a plan to end this war.\n  That is why it is time for the President to give the American people \na realistic plan for bringing our troops home.\n  What needs to happen? How many Iraqi troops need to be trained?\n  Let us set reliable goals for our mission, with an understanding of \nwhat it will take to get the job done and brinq our troops back home to \ntheir families.\n  Mr. President, we don't want our leader to deny us the hard facts of \nwar. And we don't want the price of this conflict hidden by prohibiting \nphotographs of the flag-draped coffins that carry heroes back to our \nshores.\n  We need a leader who recognizes what a majority of the American \npeople see taking place in front of their eyes on television, in our \nnewspapers, in our homes, and in our hearts.\n  President Bush, I ask you to be frank with us about what we are \nfacing in the future in Iraq. Show us how you will work to avoid \nfurther loss of life. And while we honor the memories of those who have \nperished, we must do whatever we can to make life more bearable for \ntheir families.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/12/21/senate-section/article/S14303-1", "month": "12", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14303-S14304]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        KOREAN FAIR TRADE COMMISSION DECISION AGAINST MICROSOFT\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise today regarding the December 7 \nKorean Fair Trade Commission, KFTC, decision against Microsoft. A major \nemployer in Washington, Microsoft is being unfairly penalized by Korea, \nbut this decision goes well beyond Microsoft as the Korean Fair Trade \nCommission's decision is ultimately a decision against free and fair \ntrade.\n  When the European Commission issued its competition decision against \nMicrosoft in March 2004, I was one of many Members who expressed \nserious concerns about the decision and its impact on one of America's \nmost innovative companies and its workers. Like many of my colleagues, \nhowever, I was also alarmed at the broader policy implications of the \ndecision--that Europe would adopt a decision whose negative impact on \ntrade was so clear, and which diverged so markedly from the Department \nof Justice's remedy addressing the same conduct.\n  I believe that the December 7 decision of the Korean Fair Trade \nCommission against Microsoft is yet another warning sign that our \ntrading partners are limiting competition in order to benefit their \ndomestic interests. In this case, the Korean Fair Trade Commission not \nonly followed the EU's market-distorting, anticonsumer approach, but \nappears to have gone substantially further than the EU remedies in \nseveral respects. The KFTC's decision makes me wonder whether the \nMicrosoft case is not a unique case but instead indicates the beginning \nof a trend among some of our key trading partners to use competition \nlaw as a means to pursue protectionist agendas or advance domestic \nindustrial policy goals. If so, this should be of tremendous concern to \nevery member of this body.\n  Last week I wrote to U.S. Trade Representative Portman about this \nissue, and I would like to ask unanimous consent to place that letter \ninto the record.\n  The letter urges Ambassador Portman to work with others in the \nadministration--including at the White House and the Departments of \nJustice, State, and Commerce--to develop and implement mechanisms for \naddressing these issues in a more coherent and effective fashion. At \nthe same time, I urged Ambassador Portman to work with others in the \nadministration to take whatever steps are still available to advance \nthe U.S. perspective in the Microsoft case, so that the\n\n[[Page S14304]]\n\nanticonsumer, anti-innovation decisions do not establish a precedent \nthat harms U.S. competitiveness for years to come.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                Washington, DC, December 12, 2005.\n     Hon. Rob Portman,\n     U.S. Trade Representative,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Ambassador Portman: When the European Commission \n     issued its competition decision against Microsoft in March \n     2004, I was one of many Members who expressed serious \n     concerns about the decision and its impact on one of \n     America's most innovative companies and its workers. Like \n     many of my colleagues, however, I was also alarmed at the \n     broader policy implications of the decision--that Europe \n     would adopt a decision whose negative impact on trade was so \n     clear, and which diverged so markedly from the Department of \n     Justice's remedy addressing the same conduct. At the time, my \n     hope was that the Commission's decision was the counter-\n     example that proved the rule--namely, that comity was alive \n     and well among the U.S. and its trading partners, and that \n     the international community was increasingly moving towards \n     adopting U.S.-style antitrust principles and rules.\n       Recent developments, however, suggest otherwise. \n     Specifically, the December 7 decision of the Korean Fair \n     Trade Commission (KFTC) against Microsoft--in which the KFTC \n     not only followed the EU's market-distorting, anti-consumer \n     approach, but appears to have gone substantially further than \n     the EU remedies in several respects--makes me wonder whether \n     the Microsoft case is not a unique case, but instead \n     indicates the beginning of a trend among some of our key \n     trading partners to use competition law as a means to pursue \n     protectionist agendas or advance domestic industrial policy \n     goals. If so, this should be of tremendous concern to the \n     United States and your office.\n       I understand that your Office, and you personally, have \n     been following this issue closely, and that you and other \n     USTR representatives have expressed the Administration's \n     strong concerns on these issues with your Korean counterparts \n     on more than one occasion. As a Member who represents a State \n     with dozens of leading innovative companies employing several \n     hundreds of thousands of workers, please know that these \n     efforts are greatly appreciated. Clearly, however, the \n     results to date are not what we would have hoped.\n       I am deeply concerned that, without a strategy for \n     addressing these issues more effectively--not only in the EU \n     and Korea, but also more broadly--leading U.S. firms will \n     increasingly face competition rulings in foreign nations that \n     have little or no economic justification, but that make it \n     much more difficult for U.S. industry to compete in global \n     markets. With all of the other challenges facing the global \n     trading regime at the moment, the United States can ill \n     afford yet another barrier denying U.S. industry and workers \n     the benefits of international trade.\n       I would therefore urge you to work with others in the \n     Administration--including at the White House and the \n     Departments of Justice, State, and Commerce--to develop and \n     implement mechanisms for addressing these issues in a more \n     coherent and effective fashion. At the same time, I would \n     urge you and others in the Administration to take whatever \n     steps are still available to you to advance the U.S. \n     perspective in the Microsoft case, so that the anti-consumer, \n     anti-innovation decisions do not establish a precedent that \n     harms U.S. competitiveness for years to come.\n       I would appreciate your response to this letter and look \n     forward to continuing our dialogue on these issues in the \n     months ahead.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Patty Murray,\n     U.S. Senator.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/12/21/senate-section/article/S14304-1", "month": "12", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14304]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               FOURTH TERM FOR MAYOR TOM MENINO OF BOSTON\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I welcome this opportunity to \ncongratulate our outstanding mayor in Boston, Tom Menino, on his \nreelection last month. The people of Boston love Tom, and for good \nreason.\n  Running for his fourth full term as mayor, Tom received an incredible \n68 percent of the vote on election day, an extraordinary new mandate to \ncontinue his leadership that has meant so much to our city.\n  Tom is Boston's modern FDR, and at the end of this term he will \nbecome the longest serving mayor in Boston's 375-year history.\n  It is a distinction Tom Menino has earned through his unwavering \ndedication and commitment to the people of Boston.\n  For 12 years, Mayor Menino has worked day in and day out to unite our \ndiverse city, make its neighborhoods and communities stronger, create \nfertile opportunities for businesses, and improve the quality of life \nfor all the people of Boston.\n  He has fought to protect and expand housing for low-income families \nin the midst of the Nation's tightest housing market. He has never \nstopped working to meet the needs and protect the basic rights of every \nresident of our city--regardless of their race or background.\n  He has been a pioneer in education, creating Read Boston to help \nevery child read at grade level by third grade and the Afterschool for \nAll partnership so that learning doesn't end once school lets out for \nthe day. He has fought to close the achievement gap for all of Boston's \nchildren and made Boston the first urban school district to have every \nschool wired to the Internet.\n  Tom Menino has proven that America's great urban areas can succeed \nand thrive in this new economy, at a time when more and more of our \nNation seems headed for the suburbs. Tom modestly describes himself as \nan urban mechanic, but it is far more accurate to say that he is an \nurban genius. Each day, he adds new proof that there are second and \nthird acts for America's cities in our modern Nation.\n  Above all, Mayor Tom Menino has always worked tirelessly to ensure \nthat Boston's brightest days lie ahead and that our city will continue \nto build on its incomparable history.\n  Tom has worked especially closely with our local colleges and \nuniversities to make certain that Boston remains the most prestigious \ndestination in America for young men and women seeking excellence in \nhigher education.\n  He has welcomed our burgeoning biotech and medical research sectors \nin order to guarantee that Boston stays at the cutting edge of these \nhighly promising industries of the future. This new century may well be \nthe century of the life sciences, and Tom Menino is making sure that \nBoston helps write that history.\n  Next year marks the 100th anniversary of the inauguration of another \nvisionary Mayor of Boston, my grandfather, John F. Fitzgerald, whose \nlove of our city was legendary and whose commitment to progress was \nunchallenged.\n  Grampa Fitzgerald might not immediately recognize modern Boston as \nhis beloved hometown, but he would be thoroughly at home with its \nvitality and its spirit of innovation, progress, and opportunity. Those \nqualities he fought so hard for a century ago are alive and well today, \nan he would be grateful that the city he loved so dearly is now in the \ncapable hands of Mayor Tom Menino.\n  In the years ahead, I look forward to continuing to work with Mayor \nMenino to find solutions to the real and often daunting challenges \nfacing Boston and all of urban America. No one is more committed to \nsolving the big issues than Tom Menino.\n  He and his extraordinary wife Angela have made a remarkable team for \nBoston, and all of us in the city look forward very much to more of the \nunique brand of Menino leadership in the years ahead.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/12/21/senate-section/article/S14304-2", "month": "12", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14304-S14305]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO JULIA SERNA\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI.

Julia will retire at the end of \n2005.\n  Julia's positive outlook is remarkable, and her smile and zest for \nlife is contagious. And her jovial attitude and eagerness to deal with \nchallenges is commendable. So many of those from my home State have \ncome to know and love Julia over the years. Julia has always been known \nas someone always willing to listen to my constituents and lend a \nhelping hand.\n  During her work on immigration and veterans issues, she has gone to \ngreat lengths to help a great many people in my home State.

Mr. President I rise to make a few remarks about a matter \nrelating to judicial philosophy that has been discussed by some during \nthe course of this year in connection with the public debate over \nSupreme Court vacancies that have occurred this year.\n  Some have attempted to create a false conclusion by criticizing a \nschool of judicial philosophy sometimes referred to as the \n``constitution in exile''.\n  For example, earlier this year, my esteemed colleague from Delaware, \nSenator Biden, who, I understand, teaches constitutional law at the \nUniversity of Delaware, entered into this debate. My friend from \nDelaware specifically asked us to reflect upon the judicial philosophy \nof one of our Nation's most respected Federal appellate judges, Chief \nJudge Douglas Ginsburg of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of \nColumbia Circuit.\n  I was recently in attendance at the DC Circuit for the formal \nswearing in of Judge Thomas Griffith and was once again impressed with \nthe quality of jurists of this extremely important and influential \ncourt.\n  I commend Senator Biden for his support for the nomination of Judge \nGriffith.\n  As I will explain, I do take exception to some of the \ncharacterizations that the former chairman of the Judiciary Committee \nmade about the views of Chief Judge Ginsburg.\n  The senior Senator from Delaware invited us to ``read Judge \nGinsburg's ideas about the `Constitution in Exile'. . . [and to] read \nwhat Judge Ginsburg has written'' about the ``fifth amendment's taking \nclause, the non-delegation doctrine, the 11th amendment, and the 10th \nAmendment.'' Since the Chief Judge of the DC Circuit is one of our \nNation's finest jurists, I welcomed this opportunity to reacquaint \nmyself with his opinions and writings. I was surprised and somewhat \ndismayed, then, to discover that this was such a short assignment.\n  Considering the sharp criticism by my Judiciary Committee colleague, \nSenator Biden, of Chief Judge Ginsburg's views as ``radical,'' I was \ntaken aback to discover how little he had actually written on the \nspecified subjects.\n  It is no exaggeration to say that on most of these issues, Judge \nGinsburg had written nothing of substance.\n  That being said, having considered what little he did write on these \ntopics, the characterization of his views as ``radical'' is, at best, a \nstretch.\n  If the research that I have seen is correct, Chief Judge Ginsburg has \nauthored only two opinions that even refer to the takings clause of the \nConstitution. In neither did he decide the takings claim being \npresented.\n  In Corporation of Presiding Bishop of the Church of Jesus Christ of \nthe Latter-Day Saints v. Hodel, 830 F.2d 374, 381, DC Cir. 1987, Chief \nJudge Ginsburg, writing for the court, noted that ``[t]he question of \nwhether courts, as opposed to legislative bodies, can ever `take' \nproperty in violation of the Fifth Amendment is an interesting and by \nno means a settled issue of law.'' He determined, however, that the \ncourt did not need to decide this issue. Similarly, in City of Los \nAngeles v. United States Dept. of Transp., 90 F.3d 591, D.C. Cir. 1996, \nunpublished, Chief Judge Ginsburg, writing for the court, determined \nthat the takings claims were not ripe for resolution.\n\n  Many of my colleagues have denounced ideological decision-making by \njudges who are eager to promote their own speculative constitutional \nunderstanding at the expense of the American people's traditional \nviews. I actually think that is a fair description of judicial \nactivism, and it is clear that Chief Judge Ginsburg has not engaged in \nit. Quite the contrary, in these cases where he declined the \nopportunity to reach for and resolve constitutional questions \nprematurely, he exhibited the moderation and prudence we should expect \nof our judges.\n  Similarly, Chief Judge Ginsburg does not appear to have written \nanything of significance on the tenth or eleventh amendments. In the \none and only case in which he even mentions the tenth amendment, \nChenoweth v. Clinton, 181 F.3d 112, D.C. Cir. 1999, Chief Judge \nGinsburg, writing for the court, did not address the merits of the \nclaim because the court had determined that the party lacked standing. \nAs for the eleventh amendment, Chief Judge Ginsburg's ``radical'' \ncontribution was to note, in Brown v. Secretary of Army, 78 F.3d 645, \n653, D.C. Cir. 1996, that a case referred to by the appellant citing \nthe eleventh amendment was inapposite to the case before the court. \nThis is hardly the controversial statement in support of State \nsovereign immunity one would expect given my colleague's remarks.\n  So, as far as I am aware, Chief Judge Ginsburg has not written \nsubstantively on the tenth amendment, the eleventh amendment, or the \ntakings clause. How then can anyone fairly conclude that Chief Judge \nGinsburg has such radical views about the constitutionally limited \npowers of the national government? Perhaps some are reading between the \nlines and seeing emanations and penumbras that others do not discern.\n  The only topic singled out for criticism by my friend from Delaware \nthat I could find was, in fact, substantively addressed by Chief Judge \nGinsburg is the non-delegation doctrine. In a 1995 book review of David \nSchoenbrod's ``Power Without Responsibility'', Chief Judge Ginsburg \nemployed the term ``Constitution-in-exile.''\n  Apparently some liberal critics of the President's judicial nominees \nhave seized on this expression, perhaps in the hope that it will scare \nthe American people into fearing some super-secret rightwing led by \nwayward judges.\n  Of course, this is nonsense.\n  But it is worth noting that the many of the critics who talk today \nabout the Constitution-in-exile have completely unmoored that term from \nChief Justice Ginsburg's original formulation.\n  In an article in the journal Regulation, Chief Judge Ginsburg wrote \nthe following:\n\n       [F]or 60 years the non-delegation doctrine has existed only \n     as part of the Constitution-in-exile, along with the \n     doctrines of enumerated powers, unconstitutional conditions, \n     and substantive due process, and their textual cousins, the \n     Necessary and Proper, Contracts, Takings, and Commerce \n     Clauses. David Schoenbrod, ``Power Without Responsibility: \n     How Congress Abuses the People Through Delegation,'' \n     Regulation Magazine (1995 No. 1) (Book Review), at 84.\n\n  He went on to explain that, ``The memory of these ancient exiles, \nbanished for standing in opposition to unlimited government, is kept \nalive by a few scholars who labor on in the hopes of a restoration, a \nsecond coming of the Constitution of liberty--even if perhaps not in \ntheir own lifetimes.'' Id.\n\n  So two sentences equal a judicial scheme to advance substantive \neconomic liberty and restrain Federal authority? For a careful reader, \nit is clear that Chief Judge Ginsburg promotes no such agenda. First, \nhe was referring only to the non-delegation doctrine, the supposedly \nradical proposition that Congress, not unelected bureaucrats, should be \nresponsible for making our laws. And second, Chief Judge Ginsburg was \nwriting a book review, and his reference to those ``few scholars'' was \nobviously not a reference to himself because he had not written on this \nsubject.\n  His point was that the author of the book he was reviewing was \nmisguided in thinking that the Supreme Court was likely to put teeth \nback into the non-delegation doctrine. Far from arguing that courts \nshould strip Congress of their authority to delegate its lawmaking \nauthority, he suggested that it would be more productive to ask \nCongress to change the way it delegates lawmaking authority to \nadministrative agencies. Chief Judge Ginsburg was Administrator of \nInformation and Regulatory Affairs of the Office of Management and \nBudget during the Reagan administration. This is the office within the \nExecutive Office of the President charged with reviewing all Federal \nregulations. So Chief Judge Ginsburg has considerable experience and \nexpertise in these matters.\n  In the referenced book review, Chief Judge Ginsburg endorses then-\nJudge\n\n[[Page S14306]]\n\nBreyer's suggestion that ``[p]roposed regulations, or at least those \nthat would impose a burden in excess of a specified amount, say $100 \nmillion, would not take effect unless affirmatively approved by both \nhouses of Congress.'' In this regard, I would note that Justice Breyer \nwas one of the seminal thinkers in the field of regulatory reform and I \nwould recommend that everyone read his 1982 book, ``Regulation and Its \nReform'' in which he lays out a comprehensive analysis of, and \nsuggestions for, regulatory reform.\n  In Chief Judge Ginsburg's speech, On Constitutionalism, published in \nthe Cato Supreme Court Review in 2003, he articulates much the same \nposition, stating that the separation of powers doctrine clearly \nindicates that ``there must be a limit upon the ability of Congress to \ndelegate lawmaking functions to the executive branch.'' Id. at 16. That \nis, the Constitution does seem to prohibit legislators from simply \ndelegating their constitutional authority to legislate to an executive \nbranch agency and then go home. Yet he also notes the Supreme Court's \nfailure since the mid 1930's to find any act of Congress a violation of \nthe non-delegation doctrine, demonstrating the High Court's reluctance \nto give meaning to the doctrine. So this is the view some have \ncharacterized as radical, the Constitution assigns the legislative \npower to Congress, and it violates the principle of separation of \npowers to have unlimited delegation of that law-making authority to \nexecutive branch agencies. Yet because the courts have been reluctant \nto adjudicate these arrangements, any remedy must come through \npolitical persuasion.\n  Chief Judge Ginsburg did join an opinion, the relevant part of which \nwas written by another judge, in which the court held that the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency had interpreted sections of the Clean \nAir Act authorizing the national ambient air quality standards, NAAQS, \nfor ozone and particulate matter so loosely as to render them \nunconstitutional delegations of legislative power. See American \nTrucking Ass'n. v. EPA, 175 F.3d 1027, 1034-40, D.C. Cir. 1999. More \nspecifically, the court determined that it was unclear what in EPA's \nview was the ``intelligible principle'' the Congress had directed the \nagency to follow and no such principle was apparent to the court on the \nface of the act.\n\n  The court therefore remanded the cases to the EPA so that it could \ndetail the principle limiting the agency's discretion. The full DC \nCircuit then denied the EPA's petition for rehearing en banc. See 195 \nF.3d 4, DC Cir. 1999. It is true, however, the Supreme Court granted \nthe EPA's petition for certiorari and held that the act's delegation of \nauthority to the EPA to set the NAAQS at the level ``requisite to \nprotect the public health'', although broad, provided an ``intelligible \nprinciple'' for setting air quality standards and was therefore \nconstitutional without further delineation by the agency. Whitman v. \nAmerican Trucking Ass'n, 531 U.S. 457, 473, 2001. But this is hardly \nthe first time the Supreme Court overruled an appellate court and, in \nany case, is a pretty thin reed on which to reach a conclusion that the \nlower court decision represented a radical break with constitutional \njurisprudence.\n  I encourage everyone to examine Chief Judge Ginsburg's writings \npertaining to the takings clause, the non-delegation doctrine, and the \ntenth and eleventh amendments. A fair reading warrants a conclusion \nthat there is nothing radical about his reasoning or conclusions. Chief \nJudge Ginsburg's writings on these matters are neither extensive nor \nextreme. Characterizing them as a ``stark departure from current \nconstitutional law'' is not justified.\n  I also might add that the issue of non-delegation is not as black or \nwhite as many have come to believe in recent times. Some appear--\nincluding many advocates of the liberal welfare state administered by \nso many Federal agencies--to argue, contrary to the Constitution's \nclear commitment to limited government, that there should be little, if \nany, judicial oversight over congressional actions and claim that even \nmodest judicial requirements that Congress act within its \nconstitutional authority are radical changes to our law. It seems \ncounterintuitive then that these same people argue for an unlimited \ncongressional authority to delegate their lawmaking power to another \nbranch of Government. On the one hand, Congress is all powerful. On the \nother hand, they can give that power away.\n  The record reflects that Chief Judge Ginsburg is a mainstream \nconservative judge, who applies the Constitution faithfully. He is no \njudicial radical. He is one of the most respected judges in the Federal \njudiciary. Suggestions to the contrary are not supported by the facts.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/12/21/senate-section/article/S14306-1", "month": "12", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14306-S14307]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   NOTICE OF CHANGE IN INTERNET SERVICES USAGE RULES AND REGULATIONS\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

During the 60 day period immediately preceding the date \n     of any primary or general election (whether regular, special, \n     or runoff) for any national, state, or local office in which \n     the Senator is a candidate, no Member may solicit constituent \n     input or inquiries (such as online petitions or opinion polls \n     or issue alerts) using a Senate Internet Server (``World Wide \n     Web and Electronic mail,\n\n[[Page S14307]]\n\n     BLOGs, Podcasting, streaming media, etc.''), unless the \n     candidacy of the Senator in such election is uncontested.\n       2. Electronic mail may not be transmitted by a Member \n     during the 60 day period before the date of the Member's \n     primary or general election unless it is in response to a \n     ``direct inquiry''. Exceptions to this moratorium include the \n     following: press release distribution to press organizations \n     and email to perform administrative communication. \n     ``Direct inquiries'' do not include a request to be added \n     to a mailing list, subscription list, or other request to \n     receive future mailings.

An uncontested candidacy is established when the Rules \n     Committee receives written certification from the appropriate \n     state official that the Senator's candidacy may not be \n     contested under state law. Since the candidacy of a Senator \n     who is running for re-election from a state which permits \n     write-in votes on elections day without prior registration or \n     other advance qualification by the candidate may be \n     contested, such a Member is subject to the above \n     restrictions.\n       5. If a Member is under the restrictions as defined in \n     subtitle C, paragraph (1), above, the following statement \n     must appear on the homepage: (``Pursuant to Senate policy, \n     newsletters, petitions, opinion polls and issue alerts and \n     other electronic communications cannot be initiated by this \n     office for the 60 day period immediately before the date of a \n     primary or general election.''). The words ``Senate Policy'' \n     must be hypertext linked to the Internet services policy on \n     the Senate Home Page.\n       6. A Senator's homepage may not refer or be hypertext \n     linked to another Member's site or electronic mail address \n     without authorization from that Member.\n       7.

Mr. President, this is the third time in the past 6 months \nthat I have spoken in this chamber about Nepal. I do so because this \nland of mostly impoverished tea and rice farmers who toil between India \nand China on precipitous hillsides in the shadows of the Himalayas, is \nexperiencing a political crisis that may plunge the country into chaos.\n  As many predicted, King Gyanendra's seizure of absolute power on \nFebruary 1 and suppression of civil liberties has damaged Nepal's \nforeign relations, triggered clashes between prodemocracy demonstrators \nand the police, and strengthened the Maoist insurgency.\n  The Maoists, whose use of extortion and brutality against poor \nvillagers has spread throughout the country, announced a unilateral \nceasefire on September 3 which they recently extended for an additional \nmonth. Although flawed, the ceasefire was the impetus for a loose \nalliance with Nepal's weak political parties after the King refused to \nnegotiate with them and sought instead to consolidate his own grip on \npower.\n  Last month, the Maoists and the parties endorsed a vaguely worded but \nimportant 12 point understanding that could be the basis for a national \ndialogue to restore democracy and end the conflict. That, however, \nwould require some reciprocal confidence building measures by the army, \nwhich has so far rejected the Maoist ceasefire as a ploy and continues \nto see itself as the defender of an anachronistic, corrupt and \nautocratic monarchy.\n  Although the army has won praise for its role in international \npeacekeeping missions, its reputation has been badly tarnished because \nof its abusive and ineffective campaign against the Maoists. It has \nengaged in arbitrary arrests, torture and extrajudicial killings of \nordinary citizens, which has alienated many of the same people who have \nbeen victims of the Maoists.\n  On December 10, when hundreds of Nepali citizens took to the streets \nto protest the King's repressive actions, the police used force to \nbreak up the rally and arrested several dozen people. The press \nreported another 120 arrests and dozens injured in demonstrations on \nDecember 17. More protests are likely, and it may be only a matter of \ntime before Katmandu is in the full throes of a pitched battle between \nprodemocracy demonstrators and the King's security forces.\n  This is the disheartening situation in which Nepal finds itself \ntoday. The immediate challenge for the United States is how to help \npromote a political dialogue which includes the broadest possible \nparticipation from Nepali society to restore and strengthen democracy \nand end the conflict.\n  The Maoist cease-fire, while welcome, was a tactical move to lure the \npolitical parties into an alliance and further isolate the palace. \nThere is no way to predict with confidence if the Maoists would \nparticipate in a political process in good faith, or simply use it as a \nruse to gain new recruits and weapons. A resumption of attacks against \ncivilians would be condemned and resisted by the international \ncommunity. The Maoists should know that they cannot defeat the \ngovernment by force, and as long as they extort money and property and \nabduct children they will be seen as enemies of the Nepali people.\n  Similarly, military experts have concluded that Nepal's undisciplined \narmy cannot defeat a determined insurgency that attacks civilians and \narmy posts and then disappears into the mountains.\n  There are also concerns about Nepal's political parties, who do not \nhave a record of putting the interests of the nation above their own \nself interest. But the political parties, for all their flaws, are the \nreal representatives of the Nepali people. They urgently need to \nreform, but there is no substitute for them.\n  Despite these difficulties and uncertainties, it is clear that the \nKing has failed to provide the leadership to build bridges with the \ncountry's democratic forces and develop a workable plan. It is also \nclear that efforts by the international community, including the United \nStates, to appeal to the King to start such a process, have failed. The \nBush administration should apply whatever pressure it can, including \ndenying U.S. visas to Nepali officials and their families.\n  With few options and no guarantees, Nepal's hour of reckoning is \napproaching. There is a growing possibility that the King's obstinacy \nand unpopularity will trigger massive civil unrest, shootings and \narrests of many more civilians by soldiers and police, Nepal's further \nisolation, and perhaps the end of the monarchy itself.\n  Only the army has the ability to convince the King to abandon his \nimperial ambitions, but time is running out. The army's chief of staff, \nGeneral Pyar Jung Thapa, was privileged to receive training at the Army \nWar College and he has participated in other U.S. military training \nprograms. He has led Nepali troops in UN peacekeeping missions. He \nknows, or he should have learned, that the function of a modern, \nprofessional military is to protect the rights and security of the \npeople, not the privileges of a dictator who has squandered the moral \nauthority of his office. It is not only in the interests of Nepal, but \nin the army's long-term self-interest, to show real leadership at this \ncritical time.\n  The United States should do everything possible to encourage the army \nto announce its own cease-fire, to accept international observers as \nthe Maoists have said they would do, and to support a broadly inclusive \npolitical dialogue with or without the participation of the palace.\n  Such a process, to be meaningful, must lead to free and fair \nelections. The municipal elections announced by King Gyanendra for \nearly next year, without any consultation with the political parties, \nare no solution. An attempt to apply a veneer of legitimacy to an \notherwise undemocratic process will only prolong and exacerbate this \ncrisis.\n  Many of the Maoist's grievances mirror those of the majority of \nNepal's people who for centuries have suffered from discrimination, \npoverty, and abuse by one corrupt government after another. But Nepal's \nproblems, which\n\n[[Page S14308]]\n\nare at the root of the conflict, can only be solved through a \ntransparent, democratic process. The Maoists have opened the door a \ncrack for that to begin. The army should reciprocate. The international \ncommunity should lend its support.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/12/21/senate-section/article/S14308-1", "month": "12", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14308]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      RECOGNIZING SENATOR CORZINE\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI.

SCHULMAN, USN\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise to recognize LCDR Andrew \nSchulman, U.S. Navy for the outstanding contributions he rendered this \npast year while serving as a legislative fellow on my staff. Andrew is \ncompleting his Capitol Hill fellowship this month, and it is my hope \nthat he has benefited as much from this experience as have I from \nhaving him on my staff.\n  Lieutenant Commander Schulman is a member of the U.S. Navy Civil \nEngineer Corps and is a Seabee Combat Warfare qualified officer. To my \ngreat benefit, Andrew joined my office in a year when the Department of \nDefense, made public its Base Closure and Realignment list. When an Air \nForce base in my home State of New Mexico was designated for closure, \nAndrew's expertise in facilities planning and assessment proved \ncritical in our successful effort to convince the BRAC Commission that \nthe DOD's decision on Cannon Air Force Base was premature and deserved \na second look. I have no doubt that Andrew's tireless work and \ndedication was key to the Commission's ultimate finding that DOD \n``substantially deviated'' on several BRAC selection criteria and that \nthe Department ``shall seek'' a new mission for Cannon.\n  Andrew's experience as the officer in charge of designing and \nconstructing detention cells for enemy combatants at Guantanamo Bay \nalso provided me a firsthand insight on the issue of enemy prisoner \ndetainment. It is an issue that has been carefully scrutinized by \nCongress this year, and Andrew provided sharp memoranda and oral \nbriefings on both legal and policy aspects that greatly informed my own \nunderstanding of both interrogation and detainee policies of the \nDepartment of Defense.\n  I must also thank Andrew's family for enduring his many late nights \nat work. So to Mary Rose, Andrew's wife, and the Schulman children, \nAdam and Emma, I say thank you. And without question, you can be \nextremely proud of Andrew's dedication to our country.\n  Finally, I want to give my heartfelt thank you to Andrew for his \nservice. His ``can-do'' attitude and tireless work ethic were \ninfectious. His willingness to tackle issues which were new to him and \nto embrace the goals I have set for my staff on behalf of both the men \nand women of the armed forces and the citizens of New Mexico were truly \ncommendable. I have no doubt that as Andrew continues his military \ncareer, he will achieve great things for both the U.S. Navy and his \ncountry, and I wish him the very best of luck in all his future \nendeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/12/21/senate-section/article/S14308-3", "month": "12", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14308]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  TRIBUTE TO SENATOR WILLIAM PROXMIRE\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to honor a long-time friend and \nan esteemed colleague William Proxmire, who passed away last week at \nthe age of 90. I had the privilege of serving with him in this body for \n8 years.\n  Senator Proxmire retired from this Chamber 16 years ago, but he is \nstill remembered for his staunch work ethic and his unique dedication \nto a set of closely held principles. His standards of conduct as a U.S. \nSenator are legendary. In 22 years of service, he attended more than \n10,000 rollcall votes--still a record in the Senate. In his last two \ncampaigns for office, he declined all campaign donations--from anyone. \nDuring each race, he spent less than $200, all out of his own pocket, \nmostly to pay for postage and envelopes to return donations offered to \nhim by his supporters. In both instances, he won by a landslide, a \ntestament to the overwhelming support of his constituency in Wisconsin.\n  I have always felt a special affinity for Senator Proxmire and the \nissues that he championed. He was one of the few Senators who served \nwith both my father and me. And he dedicated a great deal of time and \neffort to an issue that both my father and I considered paramount to \nour Nation's future. Over 19 years, he made over 3,000 statements on \nthe Floor in support of ratification of an international treaty \noutlawing genocide. My father, as Senator Proxmire put it, \n``contributed a special zeal to this effort,'' fighting for this issue \neven before he entered the Senate. In 1950, as a member of a special \ncommittee of the American Bar Association, my father was one of the \nfirst witnesses to appear before the Foreign Relations Committee in \nfavor of a treaty condemning genocide. Senator Proxmire's efforts over \nthe years to champion this issue meant a great deal to me. And I am \nparticularly honored to have brokered a deal with Senator Jesse Helms \nin 1988 to finally commit the United States as a signatory to this \ntreaty.\n  I also had the privilege of serving with Senator Proxmire on the \nBanking Committee when he was the chairman of that body, and I can tell \nyou, that he performed his duties with a unique commitment both to \ncompetition and the rights of the consumer. Early in his career, he \npassed the Truth-in-Lending Act, ensuring consumer access to \ninformation and forcing banks to compete openly and on equal terms. He \nalso helped pass a bill deregulating the banking industry, which helped \nfinancial institutions offer better services at lower costs to \nconsumers.\n  Senator Proxmire is perhaps best remembered for his fervent devotion \nto slowing Government spending. He returned over $1 million of his \nstaff budget to the Treasury. He refused to travel abroad at the \nexpense of the taxpayers. And he developed the ``Golden Fleece'' award \nto expose government programs that he considered wasteful. He gave \nstatements on the floor exposing studies that explored the effects of \nalcohol on fish, documented the body measurements of airline flight \nattendants, and examined why people fall in love. Each ``Golden \nFleece'' not only illuminated Government programs that might be \nconsidered profligate, but reminded us of the humor and personality of \nthis noble public servant.\n  My wife Jackie and I offer our deepest condolences to his wife Helen, \nto his family, and to the people of Wisconsin and the citizens of our \nNation, for the loss of such a dedicated public servant and an \nexceptional man.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/12/21/senate-section/article/S14308-4", "month": "12", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14308-S14309]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          BROADCASTING BALANCE\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I rise today to reaffirm the \nCorporation for Public Broadcasting's requirement to ensure ``strict \nadherence to objectivity and balance in all programs or series of \nprograms of a controversial nature.'' CPB receives roughly $400 million \nfrom Congress as part of the Labor, Health and Human Services, \nEducation Appropriations bill.\n  CPB's requirement to see that recipients like the Public Broadcasting \nService and National Public Radio uphold the objectivity and balance \nstandard does not stem from congressional micro-management or partisan \ninterference. Rather, it is a matter of complying with the law under \nwhich CPB dispenses taxpayers' money.\n  That law mandates CPB to see to both ``maximum freedom of the public \ntelecommunications entities'' and their ``strict adherence to \nobjectivity\n\n[[Page S14309]]\n\nand balance.'' These mandates are not in conflict. Instead, they \ncomplement each other, and to maintain Americans' confidence in public \nbroadcasting the Corporation for Public Broadcasting must see that both \nmandates are fulfilled.

Mr. President, I rise today to express my strong \ndisagreement with the language in the Defense appropriations and \nDefense authorization conference reports concerning the treatment of \nprisoners being held in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.\n  Under the McCain amendment, U.S. personnel are prohibited from \nengaging in torture or cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment. I \nstrongly support this. This ban applies to all military and \nintelligence personnel regardless of where they are located throughout \nthe world. This is a clear statement that the United States will abide \nby its obligation to follow the law, and it is a step forward in \nreinstating our Nation's moral authority.\n  However, the Graham amendment would undercut much of what we are \naccomplishing with the McCain amendment in two respects. First, it \nwould undercut our commitment to prohibiting the use of torture by \nallowing evidence produced as a result of torture to be used in \nmilitary legal proceedings. Second, it would undercut any enforcement \nof this prohibition by barring individuals from seeking judicial review \nof the legality of their detention or bringing a suit to stop unlawful \ntreatment.\n  When the Graham-Levin compromise passed the Senate, it had some good \nlanguage in it, and it had some very troubling language.\n  On the good side, the amendment provided that the Combatant Status \nReview Tribunals at Guantanamo, which are charged with determining \nwhether individuals should be classified as so called enemy combatants, \nare not allowed to use evidence that is derived through ``undue \ncoercion,'' such as torture. This was an important step forward. We \nshould not be relying on information that is inherently unreliable in \ndeciding whether to indefinitely detain a person. Unfortunately, this \nprovision is now gone.\n  In the conference report the outright prohibition on using evidence \nderived through torture was replaced with a mere assessment of whether \nthe evidence has been derived through coercive means, such as torture, \nand whether the evidence has any probative value. I would hope that a \nmilitary tribunal assessing such evidence would realize that evidence \nderived through torture is not reliable. However, as drafted, this bill \nwould allow a Combatant Status Review Tribunal to use evidence derived \nthrough torture if the tribunal finds that the evidence is helpful.\n  To the best of my knowledge this would be the first time in U.S. \nhistory that the United States would be on record as allowing this type \nof evidence in any type of legal proceeding. This is wrong and a huge \nstep backwards.\n  Furthermore, from a practical standpoint the assessment with regard \nto whether the evidence is derived though torture is essentially \npointless. The conference report states that this assessment is only \napplicable prospectively. The problem is that of the over 500 prisoners \nbeing held at Guantanamo, every single one has already undergone a \nstatus hearing to determine whether or not they are an ``enemy \ncombatant.'' Under the existing procedures, there is no exclusionary \nrule prohibiting the use of evidence derived through torture. \nTherefore, the Government may be basing its finding that some of these \nprisoners are ``enemy combatants'' on faulty evidence that is \ncompletely unreliable.\n\n  Let me provide an example of why this language is so problematic. \nSuppose a person is detained by the U.S. Government and handed over to \na foreign intelligence service for interrogation. While U.S. personnel \nare prohibited from using interrogation techniques that amount to \ntorture or cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment, other countries use \ninterrogation techniques, such as electric shock or pulling off a \nperson's fingernails, which do not comply with this standard. If a \nperson is tortured while in the custody of one of these intelligence \nservices, any statements that the person makes, either incriminating \nhimself or another person, could be admissible in the Combatant Status \nTribunal Review, or CSRT, process. Frankly, I, and most people, would \nconfess to nearly anything to avoid the harshest forms of torture. We \nshould not be permitting the use of this type of evidence in any legal \nproceeding.\n  It is inconsistent to say that we will prohibit the use of torture by \nour military and intelligence personnel because it is legally and \nmorally repugnant, but we will allow evidence derived in this manner to \nbe used in our military proceedings. ``We don't do it, but if you do it \nwe will use it,'' is hardly a position of clarity with regard to our \ncommitment to uphold the prohibition on torture, or cruel, inhuman, or \ndegrading treatment.\n  The conference report also limits the ability of a prisoner at \nGuantanamo to file a writ of habeas corpus. This fundamental right has \nits foundation in the Magna Carta and is enshrined in our Constitution. \nSimply, it is the right to go to court when a person is detained by the \nGovernment and ask whether or not one's detention is justified. \nContrary to how this right was characterized during debate on this \nbill, this is not about prisoners suing to get access to DVD movies or \nbecause they are unhappy with the type of peanut butter that they are \nbeing served--the Great Writ, as habeas is known, is meant to provide a \nbasic check in preventing the Executive Branch from exercising \nunfettered authority in imprisoning individuals without judicial \nreview.\n  The fact is that mistakes happen. For example, take the recent case \nof the innocent German citizen who was picked up by the CIA in \nMacedonia and flown to a prison in Afghanistan where he was held in a \nsecret facility for over 5 months because he was thought to be involved \nin terrorism--he wasn't. We made a mistake. Judicial review is \nimportant in reducing the likelihood that we are wrongfully imprisoning \npeople, and we should have a viable process for weeding out these \nmistakes.\n  According to news reports, commanders in Guantanamo have estimated \nthat 70 percent of the individuals imprisoned there may be no threat at \nall. Whether this number is correct or not, it is reasonable to require \nthat there be some meaningful judicial review in place to make sure \nthat we are not indefinitely imprisoning people who pose no threat. If \nyou are going to hold someone indefinitely for years on end without \naffording them a trial, I think it is fair to allow a person to \nchallenge the basic legality of their detention.\n  The Graham amendment, as it passed the Senate, restricted habeas \ncorpus.\n  Unfortunately, the conference report goes much further. It also \nprohibits a prisoner from bringing ``any other action'' against the \nGovernment regarding ``any aspect'' of their detention. This is an \nexcessively broad restriction. It seems to eliminate all other causes \nof action, including the ability of a person to bring a suit to stop \nongoing torture. This significantly undermines the McCain amendment. \nUltimately, I have confidence that a court will hold that this \nprovision is overly broad and unconstitutional.\n  In addition, it is also important to note what the conference report \ndoes not do. The language contained in the conference report limits \naccess to U.S. courts. But the conference report does not provide an \nexception for people who have been found not to be a threat and have \nbeen determined to be ``non-enemy combatants.''\n  Recently, the Washington Post has done a series of articles \nhighlighting the plight of the ethnic Uighurs, who are Chinese Muslims \nopposed to the Communist government in China and who are seeking their \nown homeland in northwestern China. Mr. President, I ask unanimous \nconsent that these Washington Post articles be inserted into the Record \nat the end of my statement.\n  The Department of Defense has been holding a group of Uighurs in \nGuantanamo for the last 4 years. CSRT hearings have been held for these \nindividuals, and the Department of Defense has determined that they are \n``non-enemy combatants.'' They are not a threat to our country and are \nnot part of the al Qaida terrorist organization. The problem is that \ndespite the finding\n\n[[Page S14310]]\n\nthat they are not ``enemy combatants,'' the Defense Department has \nrefused to release them from Guantanamo because it can't find a country \nto take them--if they are sent to China they will likely be arrested \nand tortured, and countries such as Saudi Arabia, where many have lived \npreviously, won't take them back. And the United States will not allow \nthem to enter our country because it does not want them to apply for \nasylum.\n  In essence, we are taking away the right of a person who is being \nheld without charge, indefinitely, to go to court and ask for their \nrelease after the Department of Defense has said that they are \nessentially innocent. Not only is this repugnant to our Nation's \nvalues, it is also blatantly unconstitutional.\n  Mr. President, over the last several years this administration has \ndiminished our standing in the world by backing away from our \nlongstanding commitment to human rights and the rule of law. I look \nforward to the day when the United States is once again viewed as a \nleader in this regard.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Dec. 15, 2005]\n\n         Detainee Cleared for Release is in Limbo at Guantanamo\n\n                    (By Josh White and Robin Wright)\n\n       When U.S. forces freed Saddiq Ahmad Turkistani from a \n     Taliban prison in Kandahar, Afghanistan, in late 2001, the \n     detainee met with reporters at a news conference and told \n     U.S. officials that he had been wrongly imprisoned for \n     allegedly plotting to kill Osama bin Laden.\n       An ethnic Uighur who was born and raised in Saudi Arabia, \n     Turkistani said he believed in the U.S. campaign against \n     terrorism. He professed hatred for al Qaeda and the Taliban--\n     groups he said tortured him in prison--and offered to help \n     the United States. Intelligence officials and U.N. \n     representatives told Turkistani they would seek to find him \n     refuge, possibly in Pakistan, according to accounts he later \n     gave his lawyers.\n       Instead, Turkistani was taken to a U.S. military base in \n     Afghanistan, where he was stripped, bound and thrown behind \n     bars. U.S. officials then strapped him into an airplane, \n     fitted him with dark goggles and sent him to the U.S. \n     detention facility at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, in January 2002, \n     according to U.S. lawyers who represent him.\n       Nearly four years later, Turkistani remains there, despite \n     being cleared for release early this year after a government \n     review concluded he is ``no longer an enemy combatant.'' It \n     is unclear exactly when that determination was made, but \n     Justice Department lawyers gave notice of it in an Oct. 11 \n     court filing.\n       Turkistani wrote a letter to his lawyers in recent months, \n     in which he asked about the welfare of his family, whom he \n     has not heard from in eight years: ``Now, I have been under \n     the control of the Americans for the past three years and \n     eight months. Six months ago, I was told by the Americans \n     that I am innocent and I am not an enemy combatant.''\n       It remains a mystery why Turkistani was sent to Guantanamo \n     Bay at all. Some officials and his lawyers speculate that he \n     has been held by mistake. Or, they say, some officials may \n     have believed he had intelligence value because bin Laden \n     accused him of trying to plot his killing in 1998. U.S. \n     officials have offered no public explanation.\n       Like a group of five Chinese Uighurs (pronounced wee-gurs), \n     Turkistani remains incarcerated because the United States \n     simply does not know what to do with him. He does not have \n     Saudi citizenship, and U.S. officials are having trouble \n     getting his home country to take him back. U.S. officials do \n     not want to send him to China, where Uighurs are seeking a \n     separate homeland, saying he is likely to be tortured.\n       But unlike many detainees at Guantanamo Bay, Turkistani was \n     not captured on the battlefield, nor was he a suspected \n     terrorist. Instead, he was swept up in the confusion that \n     marked the early days of the U.S. war in Afghanistan, and \n     even as a potential ally found himself with no recourse to \n     challenge his detention.\n       ``The crowning irony is that he is an enemy of bin Laden, \n     who was charged with conspiring to kill him, and we hold him \n     prisoner today,'' said Sabin Willett, a lawyer who has filed \n     a petition with the U.S. District Court in Washington on \n     Turkistani's behalf. ``It's heartbreaking that we throw \n     people into jail to rot.''\n       Turkistani is one of nine detainees who live at Guantanamo \n     Bay's Camp Iguana, a less restrictive area of the prison \n     where detainees have limited privileges including access to \n     television and a few DVDs. Besides five Chinese Uighurs who \n     have not been accepted by any country, there is a Russian, an \n     Algerian and an Egyptian. All have been cleared for release \n     but have not been given their freedom.\n       A former U.S. official familiar with detention operations \n     said mistakes were made in Afghanistan, when some detainees \n     were shipped to Cuba because space at the U.S. facility in \n     Bagram was limited and there was no clear plan on where to \n     house suspected enemy combatants.\n       ``It's possible to get stuck there if you don't have a \n     state,'' the former official said. ``Particularly at that \n     time, when there were a lot of people getting picked up in \n     Afghanistan, cases people were unsure about tended to end up \n     in Cuba. People did get caught up in the situation.''\n       Another U.S. official familiar with Guantanamo Bay said it \n     is likely that other ``stateless'' people will surface as the \n     military prepares to release more detainees.\n       The Defense and State departments are working to return \n     such people to their home countries, if possible, and have \n     unsuccessfully tried to persuade at least 20 nations to take \n     in the Uighurs--including Sweden, Finland, Switzerland and \n     Turkey.\n       ``The government is serious about finding a place for \n     resettlement for the Uighurs and will continue diplomatic \n     efforts to accomplish that goal,'' said Lt. Col. Mark \n     Ballesteros, a Pentagon spokesman. ``The United States has \n     made it clear that it does not expel, return or extradite \n     individuals to other countries where it believes it is more \n     likely than not they will be tortured.''\n       Turkistani is one of more than 200 Guantanamo Bay detainees \n     who have filed habeas corpus petitions in U.S. District Court \n     in Washington, arguing that they are being held unlawfully \n     and asking the court to order their release.\n       Turkistani told his lawyers that he was deported to \n     Afghanistan from Saudi Arabia sometime in 1997, after he was \n     jailed for alleged possession of hashish. Turkistani said he \n     was given fake Afghan identification and put on a plane from \n     Jeddah to Kabul because the Saudi government did not \n     recognize him as a citizen. He said that Afghan officials \n     detained him for six days before releasing him.\n       He said he made his way to Khost, Afghanistan, and \n     befriended an Iraqi man. Before long, he and his friend were \n     arrested by four Arab al Qaeda members. Turkistani said he \n     was accused of being a Saudi spy, interrogated and tortured.\n       Fearing for his life, after 20 days of severe beatings and \n     sleep deprivation, Turkistani said he ultimately gave what he \n     called a ``lengthy story'' about how the Saudis had sent him \n     there to kill bin Laden. He was turned over to the Taliban \n     and held in Kandahar for more than four years.\n       Susan Baker Manning, another lawyer representing Turkistani \n     who met with him last month, said he denies allegations that \n     he tried to kill bin Laden and confessed only under torture. \n     Bin Laden, however, asserted in a statement in December 1998 \n     that Turkistani and two accomplices had been hired by Saudi \n     Arabian officials to kill him and failed.\n       Foreign news reports have indicated that the attack, \n     allegedly by poison, caused bin Laden's kidneys to fail and \n     netted Turkistani and his alleged accomplices hundreds of \n     thousands of dollars.\n       Manning said that the government has been challenging \n     lawyers' efforts to represent Turkistani, and that he has \n     become intensely frustrated by his lengthy confinement.\n       ``It's entirely possible that it's just a mistake,'' \n     Manning said. ``The enemy took away his life for 4\\1/2\\ \n     years, and we reward him for that by taking away his life for \n     another four years. He clearly opposed al Qaeda and the \n     Taliban, and he still feels that way. He's not a huge fan of \n     the U.S. anymore.''\n                                  ____\n\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Dec. 13, 2005]\n\n               Court May Hear Chinese (Uyghur) Detainees\n\n                            (By Josh White)\n\n       A federal judge in Washington said yesterday that he will \n     consider allowing two detainees in the military prison at \n     Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, to appear before him in court to \n     challenge their confinement, telling lawyers that the ethnic \n     Uighurs who have been cleared for release have been held too \n     long.\n       U.S. District Judge James Robertson said he believes the \n     case of the Uighurs (pronounced wee-gurs ) presents ``a \n     genuine dilemma'' because the government has determined they \n     are not enemy combatants but has not found a country to \n     accept them. U.S. officials are not willing to send the \n     Uighurs--Muslims who are seeking their own homeland on what \n     is now part of northwestern China--to their native country \n     for fear that they would be tortured or killed.\n       U.S. authorities have tried to persuade nearly two dozen \n     nations to provide refuge for the Uighurs but have refused to \n     allow them into the United States.\n       No Guantanamo Bay detainee has been allowed to travel to \n     the United States and appear before a federal judge. The \n     government has fought efforts at judicial review after a 2004 \n     Supreme Court ruling entitling detainees to a ``competent \n     tribunal'' to determine whether they are enemy combatants. \n     The issue is currently before the appellate court for the \n     District of Columbia Circuit.\n       Government lawyers are concerned that such a move could \n     allow the Uighurs to immediately apply for asylum when they \n     arrive on U.S. soil.\n       But Sabin Willett, an attorney for the detainees, said his \n     clients are essentially on U.S. soil already and asked the \n     judge to consider granting them a provisional ``parole'' that \n     would allow them to live with ethnic Uighurs in the \n     Washington area while their cases are considered.\n       Robertson, who in August sought more time to consider the \n     cases, said yesterday that he is frustrated by the \n     government's inability to move forward, essentially stranding \n     five Uighurs who have been housed in a\n\n[[Page S14311]]\n\n     part of the detention facility known as Camp Iguana, which is \n     less restrictive than the rest of the prison. The five \n     Uighurs are living with four others at the camp as they await \n     a country to accept them.\n       The Uighur detainees have been held, without charges, for \n     more than four years since their arrests in the Middle East.\n       The judge said he had three options: deny the detainees' \n     motion and allow the case to go to an appellate court; order \n     them to appear before him for a hearing on their immediate \n     release; or order the government to release them outright \n     ``and see what happens, see how the government responds.''\n       ``As far as I can tell, nothing is happening,'' Robertson \n     said, adding that he doesn't believe diplomatic progress has \n     been made. ``The time has stretched out to the point where \n     indefinite is not an inappropriate word to describe what is \n     happening.''\n       Terry Henry, a Justice Department lawyer, said that \n     government officials have been working on a diplomatic \n     solution but that he could discuss it only in private. \n     Robertson declined to hear the information off the record.\n       ``The government is serious about finding a place for \n     resettlement for the petitioners,'' Henry said.\n       The Uighurs, through their lawyers, have argued that \n     because they are not a threat they should be moved to more \n     hospitable living conditions and have asked to be released to \n     live in the Washington area. Willett said his clients have \n     gone from elation in August--when they were moved to Camp \n     Iguana and given hope of release--to frustration as their \n     cases have dragged on.\n       ``I am deeply concerned about the human impact of the \n     indefinite nature of this,'' Willett said.\n       Rabiya Kadeer, president of the Washington-based \n     International Uyghur Human Rights and Democracy Foundation, \n     attended the brief hearing yesterday and pledged to provide \n     homes and jobs for the Uighurs should they be released to the \n     United States.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/12/21/senate-section/article/S14311-1", "month": "12", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14311]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            HONORING WINTER WONDERLAND WALK FOR THE CURE DAY\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, breast cancer is one of the most \nfrequently diagnosed cancers in women. More than 211,240 new cases of \nbreast cancer in women will be diagnosed in the United States in 2005. \nIn my own State of Connecticut, more than 2,600 women are expected to \nbe diagnosed and 530 are expected to die from breast cancer this year. \nOverall, it is believed that 1 in every 10 women will develop breast \ncancer at least once in their lifetime.\n  The best defense against breast cancer, is early detection. The \nsooner one can detect breast cancer, the better the chances that the \ndisease can be successfully treated. It is because of this that the \nAmerican Cancer Society suggests that all women age 40 and over have a \nmammogram annually. As important, women must learn to do regular self \nbreast exams.\n  Women generally will understand their bodies better than doctors. In \nConnecticut, early detection from mammograms and self breast exam has \nhelped our State achieve a 5-year survival rate, for those women \ndiagnosed with breast cancer, of 97 percent. That is one of the highest \nsuch survival rates in the country.\n  As successful as my State has been, we have not been successful \nenough. We must strive to increase awareness and education of breast \ncancer so that all women are aware of the risk it poses and the \nindisputable benefits of early detection. We must increase research \ninto the relationship between environmental exposures, genetic \npredisposition, and breast cancer risk and also seek new drugs and \ntools that will allow health care professionals to better treat breast \ncancer patients with the goal of cure.\n  It is in this spirit on January 21, 2006, Eastern Mountain Sports \nConnecticut stores will sponsor the Winter Wonderland Walk for the Cure \nto benefit both breast cancer research and the Connecticut chapter of \nthe Susan G. Women Breast Cancer Foundation, at Tarrywile Park in \nDanbury, CT.\n  Therefore, it is my pleasure to join Connecticut's Governor, M. Jodi \nRell, herself a breast cancer survivor, in celebrating, in recognition \nof the need to increase awareness about breast cancer and the need for \nearly detection, January 21, 2006 as Winter Wonderland Walk for the \nCure Day in Danbury, CT.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/12/21/senate-section/article/S14311-2", "month": "12", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14311]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS IN ETHIOPIA\n\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I rise to speak on the disturbing \nreports of political chaos in Ethiopia. With allegations of vote \ntampering and emerging pictures of large-scale human rights abuses \ntaking place in Ethiopia, that the administration must impress upon \nPrime Minister Meles Zenawi and other global neighbors, that severe \nconsequences follow actions which undermine democratic ideals.\n  Ethiopia held its first ever democratic elections on May 15, 2005. \nRevelations since then of violence and mass detention of Ethiopian \ncitizens by the Me1es government are not only alarming and \ndisconcerting to me and the American people who have supported the \ncountry in its effort to advance the cause of democracy. It is \nregretful to have to witness a regress in democratization.\n  Roughly 90 percent of Ethiopia's populace turned out for the \ndemocratic election. Rather than a sentiment of accomplishment or \nprogress, the mood of the country remains nihilistically somber. \nAccording to international human rights observers, increased repression \nof the Ethiopian people is connected to the seeming loss of power from \nthe ruling Meles government to the opposing party, the Coalition for \nUnity & Democracy, CUD--has shown by early vote counts during the \nelection. With the Meles government accused of voting irregularities, \nit is not surprising that the people of Ethiopia protested the \nunofficial election results.\n  Recent reports of human rights abuses in Ethiopia range from arrest \nand intimidation by government authorities and illegal arrests of \ninnocent people, including ranking members of the CUD party and media \nrepresentatives, to the loss of life. For example, some 14,000 people \nwere detained when riots ensued following the election. Among other \njournalists, Getachew Simie, former editor of the Amharic-language \nweekly, and Leykun Dngeda, former publisher of the Dagim WonchifWeekly, \nhave been given jail sentences for covering the anti-government \nprotests. Even Prime Minister Meles reported that 48 people were killed \nlast month in relation to the unrest caused by the alleged fraud in the \nMay polls.\n  Prime Minister Meles must fulfill his good faith commitment to human \nrights. With any successful transition to democracy, civil society \nrequires the firm accountability of its government authorities. Until \nthe Meles government brings an end to the intimidation of its people, \npolitical unrest will remain high and America's support for the \ndemocratization of Ethiopia will be muted by concern for the country's \npolitical instability.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/12/21/senate-section/article/S14311-3", "month": "12", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14311-S14312]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            TRIBUTE TO SENATOR EUGENE McCARTHY OF MINNESOTA\n\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, Minnesota and the Nation have lost a \ngreat leader and deep thinker, Senator Gene McCarthy of Minnesota. He \nplayed an import part in the history of this body and of this Nation, \nand we should carefully consider the lessons of his unique and deeply \nsignificant public life.\n  Gene McCarthy has been described as a philosopher who was a Senator. \nIn his youth, many describe Gene as the brightest of scholars and later \nin his life; he was celebrated as skilled poet. In between, he was a \nfive term Congressman and two-term Senator. His time in Washington and \non the national political scene was a display of thoughtfulness, \nserious inquiry, and passionate pursuit of the truth. In the business \nof politics where there is safety in conformity, Gene McCarthy \ncelebrated the role of the maverick. He says his role was to provoke \nthought and debate in our system and ensure we adhere more closely to \nlasting principles.\n  Eugene Robert McCarthy was born in the town of Watkins, in rural \nMeeker County, MN, on March 29, 1916. He began a life time of1eing in \nthe schools of Watkins. He graduated from St. John's University, \nCollegeville, MN, in 1935 with the highest GPA in the school's history. \nHe also studied at the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis until \n1939. Professionally, he was a high school teacher in Minnesota and \nNorth Dakota for 5 years and eventually became a professor of economics \nand education at St. John's University from 1940 to 1943 an instructor \nin sociology and economics at St. Thomas College, St. Paul, MN, from \n1946 to 1949.\n  In 1944, his service to the United States began during World War II, \nwhen he was a civilian technical assistant in the Military Intelligence \nDivision of the War Department.\n\n[[Page S14312]]\n\n  He was first elected to the U.S. Congress as a Representative from \nMinnesota in 1948 and served five terms. In 1958, he won a seat in the \nSenate where he remained for two terms. One of the focuses of his \nSenate career was the work of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, \nwhich has been a common interest of most of Minnesota's Senators and an \nindication of the strong international character of our State.\n  I first became aware of Gene McCarthy in 1967 when I was campus \norganizer at Hofstra University. In a time of boiling-over passions, I \nremember being impressed with Gene McCarthy's thoughtfulness and \nseriousness. He was an unlikely leader for ``youth revolution,'' but he \nbalanced our youthful over-exuberance with a steady articulation of \nprinciples and commitment. He encouraged young people to ``Get Clean \nwith Gene:'' to stop ``tuning in, turning on and dropping out'' and to \nclean up our act and get involved in the political process. He knew \nthat a movement based on self-indulgence was doomed to failure.\n  Gene McCarthy's life predates the experience of contemporary American \nyouth, but still has important lessons for them. First, political \ninvolvement should not rest on raw emotion. Instead, to sustain your \nposition you need to ``do your homework,'' which could mean years of \nstudy.\n  Second, you should not be intimidated by the generation in power. The \ngreat movements of history have been led and supported by young people, \nso the force of youthful enthusiasm should never be underestimated. \nThird, Gene McCarthy demonstrated that you earn the right to have your \nideas taken seriously by engaging responsibly in the political process. \nHe believed that the solution to all problems in a democracy is more \ndemocracy, which means participation, ideas, hard work and \nperseverance. His personal experience in 1968, even though it was \npolitically unsuccessful, opened a door into the political process that \ncan't be closed. Young people of all political persuasions should seize \nthat opportunity and help shape the world in which they will grow old.\n  In 1968, Gene McCarthy certainly seized opportunities. He announced \nthat he was willing and available to be President in November of 1968 \nand two months later stunned President Johnson, and the political world \nwith a close second place finish in the New Hampshire primary. His \nsuccess encouraged Robert Kennedy to enter the race and President \nJohnson withdrew shortly thereafter. McCarthy did not win the \nnomination, which went to fellow Minnesotan Hubert Humphrey, but he \nchanged the dynamics of politics in America. He helped create the \nphenomenon of bringing young people into the process in large numbers \nto challenge the power of the ``smoke filled room.''\n  When Gene McCarthy left the Senate, he returned to the place he \nalways was most at home: the world of ideas and words. When you look at \nthe list of the 15 books he published, it is remarkable to see that \nthey are either challenging works of non-fiction policy analysis or \npoetry. As a poet, Gene McCarthy probably knew Samuel Johnson's \nstatement that ``poetry is the art of uniting pleasure with truth.'' \nThat sums up his life.\n  Like a lot of Minnesotans, Eugene McCarthy took great pleasure not in \nthe usual ways, but through service. He served as a teacher. He served \nas a scholar. He served as a public policy leader. He served as a \nmotivator and organizer of youth. He served as a brave voice, \nchallenging the powerful status quo. And he served as a poet, rendering \ngreat ideas into beautiful words.\n  Gene McCarthy lived a bold and uncompromising life, which is the only \nkind of life that creates real change. He was always more interested in \nthe truth than in people's opinion of him. He lived out Amelia \nEarhart's statement that ``Courage is price that life exacts for \ngranting peace.'' His life was about living out the courage of his \nconvictions and that was his peace. He changed a nation by choosing \nthat tough road instead of a life of compliance.\n  We are grateful for his service and memory, and we should all be \ninspired to take up his courage of conviction for the new chapters of \nAmerican challenge and progress ahead.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/12/21/senate-section/article/S14312-1", "month": "12", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14312]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                EXTEND RELOCATION EXPENSES TEST PROGRAMS\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, on Tuesday, December 20, I introduced a \nsimple but important bill that would allow an existing General Services \nAdministration, GSA, program for streamlined Government employee \nrelocations to continue for an additional 4 years. Under a pilot \nprogram enacted in 1998, government agencies including GSA, Customs and \nBorder Protection, and the Department of Defense have been able to \nrelocate staff in a more economical manner than what can be done under \nthe existing Federal relocation regulations. This innovative and cost \nsaving test program, known as the Voluntary Relocation Program, \nprovides Government agencies additional flexibility to relocate \npersonnel to meet mission critical staffing needs and, according to \nCustoms and Border Protection, has resulted in a cost savings of nearly \n$25 million in their organization alone.\n  I am very pleased that Senators Lieberman and Akaka have joined me in \ncosponsoring this legislation.\n  The Department of Homeland Security began using the Voluntary \nRelocation Program to relocate hundreds of Border Patrol agents to \ncritical U.S. border locations after the terrorist attacks of September \n11, 2001. As part of its new mission to protect national borders from \nsecurity threats, agents from the Office of Border Patrol, OBP, eagerly \nvolunteered to transfer to border locations deemed most vulnerable. \nHowever, these transfers took a long time to process and were very \ncostly under the Federal travel regulations, FTR.\n  According to Customs and Border Protection, CBP, relocation of \npersonnel under the Federal travel regulations typically cost the \nFederal Government an average of $72,000 per Border Patrol agent move. \nUnderstandably, the agency's ability to relocate significant numbers of \nBorder Patrol agents was limited, so customs and border protection, \nCBP, sought alternative funding sources.\n  Under this voluntary program, employees receive a lump-sum payment to \ncover relocation costs, rather than submitting expense reports \nsupported by receipts. Transferees that choose to relocate to a new \nduty station under the Voluntary Relocation Program manage the details \nof their own move and are fully responsible for determining how to \nspend the pre-determined lump-sum payment allocated by the Federal \nGovernment. Furthermore, employees enjoy greater input in how funds are \nallocated and transferees have more control over the logistics of their \nmove. To date, the VRP has saved customs and border protection more \nthan $23,500,000 in Border Patrol agent relocation costs.\n  This Voluntary Relocation Program has provided both the government \nand its employees with both reduced administrative burdens and \nincreased responsiveness to employees and the organization's mission.\n  From April 2004 through September 2005, CBP processed 435 relocations \nat an average cost of $16,888 per move. Interim reports published by \ncustoms and border protection on the VRP indicate that participating \nemployees are satisfied with the program and are interested in its \ncontinuation. It is anticipated that if the VRP program is extended, \n``several hundred'' CBP agents will seek to take advantage of the VRP \nfor career ladder promotions within the first year of it being offered. \nBased upon the promise of the program's early results, the continuation \nof the VRP test program would benefit national security needs and the \nagency's mission.\n  I believe that the VRP is an excellent example of how Government can \nwork better and more cost effectively to best serve the interests of \nthe public and government employees. This legislation would allow \nFederal agencies to provide an additional relocation incentive that \nwould assist them in the accomplishment of their mission. I urge my \ncolleagues to join me, Senator Lieberman and Senator Akaka in support \nof this legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/12/21/senate-section/article/S14312-2", "month": "12", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14312-S14313]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 HEALTH AND WELFARE RELIEF ACT OF 2005\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I support the Health and Welfare Relief Act of 2005. This \nbill\n\n[[Page S14313]]\n\nwill provide funding for important initiatives that take effect in \nJanuary 2006, just a few days from now.\n  This morning the Senate passed, by the slimmest of margins, S. 1932, \nlegislation to cut about $40 billion from mandatory spending programs \nover the next 5 years. I did not support S. 1932 because I believe it \ncontains bad policy on Medicaid, on welfare, and on child support \nenforcement, among other things.\n  For example, S. 1932 includes $5 billion in cuts to the child support \nenforcement program, which will mean that an estimated $19.6 million in \nchild support funds will go uncollected in Montana over the next 10 \nyears. That is money that should go to needy Montana kids.\n  As for Medicaid, S. 1932 contains almost $2 billion in increased \ncopays for Medicaid beneficiaries, as well as other Medicaid cuts. \nThere are right ways to cut health care costs, through greater \nefficiencies that will save more money over time, and there is a wrong \nway to cut costs: on the backs of the Americans who can least afford to \npay more for their health care. S. 1932 goes the wrong way and ignores \nthe Senate's strong instruction to protect Medicaid beneficiaries from \ndeep spending cuts. Last week 75 Senators supported a motion I offered \nin the Senate instructing budget conferees not to come back with a bill \nthat included higher Medicaid copays and benefit cuts. Passage of S. \n1932 is inconsistent with that vote.\n  S. 1932 is bad news for the welfare program as well. Despite a Senate \nvote of 64 to 27 in support of removing TANF from S. 1932, the bill \nthat the Senate passed today does just that: it reauthorizes TANF \nthrough the budget reconciliation process, with a punitive and \nunnecessarily austere set of provisions. The TANF Program, originally \npassed in 1996, has successfully reduced welfare caseloads and focused \non moving parents from welfare to work. Changes to the TANF Program \nshould build on the success of 1996 reforms, not reverse that success, \nas S. 1932 will ultimately do.\n  Unfortunately, S. 1932 takes something that is not broken--and fixes \nit. For example, S. 1932 would raise work requirements without \nproviding the funding needed to help States get people working. In \nfact, while S. 1932 includes $1 billion in additional funding for \nchildcare, that is $7.4 billion short of what the Congressional Budget \nOffice estimates to be the cost to States of meeting the TANF work \nrequirements under this bill.\n  The Health and Welfare Relief Act would extend TANF for an additional \nyear, maintaining current policy on this important program. The Health \nand Welfare Relief Act would also extend transitional medical \nassistance, TMA, for an additional year, a program that is critical for \nhelping families make the transition from welfare to work.\n  The Health and Welfare Relief Act also contains a fix to the Medicare \nphysician payment formula, which is set to cut Medicare physician \npayments by 4.4 percent on January 1. It prevents a cap on Medicare \nphysical therapy from taking effect. And it extends an important \nprovision for small rural hospitals' outpatient departments, helping \nthem stay afloat. The bill also provides $60 million for CMS \nadministrative funding, which should be spent to help educate seniors \nabout the new Medicare drug benefit. And it contains $80 million for \nimportant legislation that I have sponsored related to high-risk pools, \nwhich are often the insurer of last resort.\n  Finally, the Health and Welfare Relief Act includes important \nlegislation providing relief to individuals and States harmed by \nHurricane Katrina. Like the Lincoln amendment voted on in the Senate \nNovember 3, this bill contains provisions to: provide temporary \nMedicaid relief to Katrina survivors; help States struggling to meet \nhealth care costs incurred as a result of Katrina; and assist providers \ndealing with Katrina-related uncompensated care costs.\n  I support the minority leader's efforts to pass these timely and \ncritical provisions through the Health and Welfare Relief Act of 2005. \nWhile I do not support S. 1932, we should take the positive elements of \nthat bill--as well as important provisions to aid Katrina victims--and \npass them today.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/12/21/senate-section/article/S14313-1", "month": "12", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14313]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             NATIVE HAWAIIAN GOVERNMENT REORGANIZATION ACT\n\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I rise to seek clarification from our \nesteemed majority leader, Senator Frist, on the scheduling of S. 147, \nthe Native Hawaiian Government Reorganization Act, for consideration of \nthe full Senate.\n  As you may recall, in December of last year, the majority and \nminority leaders joined us in reaching agreement on a schedule for the \nSenate's action on the Native Hawaiian Government Reorganization Act \nbill with Senators Domenici and Kyl. Specifically, in an exchange of \ncorrespondence that was made part of the Congressional Record for the \n108th session of the Congress, the leaders agreed that S. 147 would be \nbrought before the Senate on or before August 7, 2005.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, we commend our majority leader for his \ndiligent efforts to secure the agreement of other Senators so that the \nSenate could proceed to consideration of this measure that is so \nimportant to the citizens of Hawaii. I know that Senator Inouye joins \nme in expressing our deep appreciation for our leader's action in \nlaying down a cloture petition prior to the August recess when \nunanimous consent could not be achieved.\n  However, when the Senate reconvened in September, the tragic \ndevastation of Hurricane Katrina clearly demanded the Congress's \nimmediate action, and thus, Senator Inouye and I agreed to the proposal \nof the minority and the majority leader, that the cloture petition be \nvitiated.\n  As we now approach the end of the first session of the 109th \nCongress--with pressing matters requiring the Nation's attention once \nagain moving the Senate's consideration of S. 147 to the sidelines--we \nseek the guidance of the majority leader as to when our Leader \nanticipates that this measure may be brought before the Senate.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I thank the Senators from Hawaii for their \nreview of our actions and intent in securing the Senate's action on S. \n147. In addition to our two Senators from Hawaii, the Governor of \nHawaii has consistently sought our action on this bill, and I am fully \ncommitted to assuring that the measure is brought before the Senate \nearly in the next session of the Congress.\n  Mr. President, because a few of our colleagues are apparently not \ninclined to allow the bill to be considered under unanimous consent, it \nmay be necessary to once again file a cloture petition to enable the \nmeasure to be given the Senate's full consideration. I want to assure \nmy colleagues from Hawaii that the commitment I made in December of \nlast year remains firm, and that I will work with them to take the \nappropriate steps to assure Senate action on S. 147 early in the second \nsession of the 109th Congress.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I thank the majority leader for his \nclarification and his commitment. We look forward to working with both \nleaders to bring S. 147 to the Senate floor at the earliest possible \ntime in the second session of the 109th Congress.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/12/21/senate-section/article/S14313-2", "month": "12", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14313-S14314]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ON THE PASSING OF EUGENE McCARTHY\n\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the memory of Senator \nEugene McCarthy, who passed away earlier this month.\n  I did not have the pleasure of knowing him. But I know how powerful \nand stirring he was--a man who was not afraid to speak the truth. A man \nwho, in 1968, had already resided in the corridors of power for nearly \n20 years, but had not been corrupted by them.\n  Accomplished and beloved by his constituents, Senator McCarthy could \nhave rested on his laurels and kept his views to himself; he could have \ntoed the line in the name of unity and loyalty to the president.\n  But that was not in Senator McCarthy's character. There is something \nabout Minnesota that produces people and politicians who care more \nabout what is right than about being liked. In this tradition, he was a \nclarion voice of courage and conviction.\n  Senator McCarthy retired after 22 years of service in Congress, but \nhe never abandoned his beliefs or moderated his tone. He was not \ninterested in conforming to society's expectations\n\n[[Page S14314]]\n\nfor an elder statesman. Nor was he afraid to turn his wit against his \nadversaries when discussing their policies with which he disagreed.\n  While he took more than his share of criticism, he stuck to his \nprinciples and gave as good as he got. The Senate is better because \nEugene McCarthy served here, and the country is as well.

His death \n     comes just three weeks after the passing of his fellow owner, \n     Wellington Mara, who died of cancer on Oct. 25 at the age of \n     89.\n       Tisch realized a longtime dream in 1991 when he completed \n     negotiations with Wellington Mara's nephew, Tim Mara, and his \n     family and paid $75 million for a 50 percent interest in the \n     Giants.\n       ``I was very fortunate,'' Tisch said in a 2002 interview. \n     ``I got a call from (former Cleveland and Baltimore owner) \n     Art Modell telling me that Tim Mara wanted to sell his half \n     of the team and asking me if I would be interested in \n     purchasing it. I met with Wellington Mara and John Mara and \n     said I'd be very interested. There were no problems with \n     them, and then I bought my share of the team from Tim Mara. \n     It's been a great relationship and a great boon to me. I'm \n     very happy to be the 50 percent owner of the New York \n     Giants.''\n       Tisch played an active role in the organization. As a \n     member of the National Football League's Finance and Super \n     Bowl Policy Committees, he attained a prominence in the \n     sports arena equal to his position in the world of business.\n       Owning the Giants was one of many careers Tisch pursued \n     simultaneously. Forbes magazine ranks him 56th on its list of \n     the country's 400 wealthiest people and estimates his net \n     worth to be about $3.9 billion.\n       He was the Chairman and Director of the Loews Corporation, \n     one of the country's most successful financial companies. The \n     company, with a 2004 net income of $1.2 billion and assets \n     exceeding $74 billion, owns and operates 91 percent of CNA \n     Financial Corporation; 100 percent of Lorillard; 100 percent \n     of Boardwalk Pipelines, which consists of Texas Gas \n     Transmission and Gulf South Pipelines; 52 percent of Diamond \n     Offshore Drilling; 100 percent of Loews Hotels and 100 \n     percent of Bulova.\n       Tisch served as Postmaster General of the United States \n     from Aug. 1986 until returning to New York in March 1988. \n     Prior to his appointment as Postmaster, he served as \n     President and Chief Operating Officer of Loews Corporation \n     and its corporate predecessor, Loews Theaters, Inc., a \n     position held from 1960 until his appointment as Co-Chairman \n     and CoCEO.\n       Tisch also served as Chairman of the New York Convention & \n     Visitors Bureau for 19 years and currently serves as the \n     Bureau's (now called NYC & Co.) Chairman Emeritus. He was \n     also founding Chairman of the New York City Convention and \n     Exhibition Center Corporation and Chairman of the Citizens \n     Committee for the Democratic National Conventions held in New \n     York City in 1976 and 1980.\n       In May 1990, Mayor David Dinkins appointed Tisch as New \n     York City's Ambassador to Washington, D.C. Through 1993, he \n     served as a liaison between the City of New York and his \n     friends and colleagues in both the national government in \n     Washington, D.C. and the business community in New York City.\n       From 1990-1993, Tisch served as Chairman of the New York \n     City Partnership, Inc. and the New York Chamber of Commerce \n     and Industry, where he was instrumental in developing a \n     campaign to enhance New York's position as an international \n     business center. After completing his stint as chairman, \n     Tisch remained on the Board of Directors of both \n     organizations, now merged.\n       Tisch was also a Trustee of New York University.\n       The Giants, however, were truly a labor of love for Tisch, \n     a lifelong sports fan. He attended every Giants game, home \n     and away, and spent as much time working in his stadium \n     office as possible. His two sons are now important members of \n     the organization: Steven as executive vice president and Jon \n     as treasurer.\n       The process of going from fan to owner took at least three \n     decades for Tisch.\n       ``I came to New York in 1960, and a couple of propitious \n     things happened,'' he said. ``Our company owned a radio \n     station at that time, WHN. During the 1950s they broadcast \n     Giants games. The president of the radio station had ten 50-\n     yard-line tickets at Yankee Stadium. When we sold the radio \n     station he decided he wanted to stay with us, so he came over \n     to Loews Theaters to become the controller. So for about \n     seven or eight years, I had the use of these tickets.\n       ``Also, when we came to New York we moved to Scarsdale, and \n     I got to know Allie Sherman, who was then coach of the \n     Giants. Actually, Allie's son Randy and my son Jon were born \n     one day apart. So we got to know the Sherman family. Then in \n     1975 or '76, Pete Rozelle moved to Harrison. We lived in the \n     city, but we have a house in Harrison, which was a mile away \n     from where Pete Rozelle and his family resided. We became \n     very friendly with Pete Rozelle. So I have a history in the \n     last 40-some odd years of being involved. I went to most of \n     the owners meetings and all the Super Bowls with Pete \n     Rozelle. I was chairman of a group of his friends called \n     Rozelle's Raiders--I was responsible for getting him to the \n     right place at the right time. He finally gave me a whistle \n     and a sign that said `Rozelle's Raiders.' I've been very \n     lucky. In my own mind, I've been involved in football since \n     1960.''\n       It was about that time that Tisch first began to consider \n     buying a professional team.\n       ``I had tried several times before (purchasing his interest \n     in the Giants),'' he said. ``Steve Ross, who ended up as CEO \n     of Time-Warner, Inc. and I tried to buy the Jets in about \n     1967 or '68 and it didn't work out. I looked at other things. \n     In 1988, when I came out of the Postal Service, I decided I \n     would try to buy a sports team. I looked at many of them, \n     both in football and basketball. I looked at the Dallas \n     Cowboys and a couple of other teams. But I made up my mind I \n     was never going to buy a team that was more than one hour \n     from New York. I was interested in becoming owner of the new \n     franchise that was in Baltimore. We were putting together a \n     group when the opportunity came about to become the 50 \n     percent owner of the New York Giants, which I jumped at and \n     dropped everything else.''\n       He completed the negotiations with Tim Mara just a few \n     months after the Giants won Super Bowl XXV.\n\n[[Page S14315]]\n\n       Tisch's business success was but a small part of his life's \n     achievements. His generosity and commitment to civic and \n     charitable causes was legendary. Tisch was a tireless and \n     influential participant in civic affairs throughout his adult \n     life.\n       In Feb. 2000, he helped found Take the Field, Inc., a non-\n     profit organization dedicated to renovating and rebuilding \n     the athletic fields at New York City's public high schools. \n     Tisch, a product of those schools who graduated from Erasmus \n     Hall High in Brooklyn, was Chairman of Take the Field, Inc. \n     He launched the organization with a $1 million donation, and \n     as of earlier this year had raised more than $147 million in \n     public and private dollars.\n       Tisch and two partners in Take the Field, Tony Kiser and \n     Richard Kahan, believed the private sector had to play a \n     leading role in repairing sports fields at schools throughout \n     the city that had been slowly destroyed by more than two \n     decades of neglect. Tisch approached then-mayor Rudy Giuliani \n     with his idea. The city agreed to match every dollar raised \n     by Take the Field with three of its own, and the mission was \n     to re-do every athletic field in the city that was \n     classified as ``needy.''\n       ``Take the Field is one of the most innovative and \n     wonderful ideas of my life in the city,'' said New York Mets \n     owner Fred Wilpon, one of Tisch's best friends. ``And it \n     doesn't happen without Bob. At a time in his life when he \n     could have just sat back and enjoyed everything he had \n     accomplished, he went to work.''\n       That's what Tisch did throughout his life. He was a \n     founding Co-Chairman of Citymeals-on-Wheels, President of the \n     Board of Directors from 1993 to 2002, and later served on the \n     Board as Honorary Chairman. He also served as chairman of \n     Public Private Initiative, a public private partnership that \n     raises funds for important community programs, from 1997 to \n     1998.\n       Tisch's philanthropy continued even after he became gravely \n     ill. His family picked a physician at the Duke University \n     Medical Center to supervise his treatment for the brain \n     cancer. Tisch and his family recently donated $10 million to \n     the Duke Comprehensive Cancer Center and the school's Brain \n     Tumor Center.\n       The gift accounted for the majority of a $16.3 million \n     package of subsidies that Duke will use to support research \n     into the treatment of brain tumors.\n       ``I was very, very impressed by the program at Duke, and \n     very taken by more than just its medical approach,'' said \n     Steve Tisch. ``For me, there was the intangible that became \n     so important, of the spiritual and emotional commitment that \n     these programs and their doctors have.''\n       Duke officials have pledged to use $5 million from the \n     Tisch family to underwrite the hiring of additional \n     researchers. The medical center is matching that with $5 \n     million of its own money. Another $2.5 million from the Tisch \n     family will finance the screening of drugs that might be \n     useful in treating brain tumors. Duke officials are now are \n     calling the treatment center the Preston Robert Tisch Brain \n     Tumor Center.\n       Given his many accomplishments and interesting ventures, \n     Tisch was asked in that 2002 interview what was most \n     rewarding to him.\n       ``My brother (Laurence, who died of cancer at age 80 two \n     years ago today on Nov. 15, 2003) and I took the Loews \n     Corporation from a corporation that did about $20 million \n     worth of business and built it up to a $13 billon company, \n     which is now run by the next generation,'' Tisch said. \n     ``Building the company and seeing it grow has been extremely \n     gratifying. I also enjoyed my time at the Postal Service when \n     I was appointed Postmaster General. People said, `How can you \n     stand a job like that?' I loved it. I made one mistake--I \n     stayed two years when I should have stayed three years.\n       ``Then, of course, my involvement with the New York Giants \n     has been very rewarding. I've been very, very lucky in my \n     life and what I've been able to achieve.''\n       Everyone who knew him, worked with him or were touched by \n     his generosity were just as fortunate.\n       Preston Robert Tisch was born on April 29, 1926 in New York \n     City. He attended Bucknell University before entering the \n     Army in 1944. After military service in World War II, he \n     earned a B.A. degree in economics from the University of \n     Michigan in 1948. Tisch is survived by his wife, the former \n     Joan Hyman, and their three children, Steven, Laurie and \n     Jonathan, and nine grandchildren.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/12/21/senate-section/article/S14315-1", "month": "12", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14315]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     BELATED THANK YOU TO THE MERCHANT MARINERS OF WORLD WAR II ACT\n\n Mr. BURNS.

The Merchant Marine is the forgotten \nservice of World War II.\n  Although their numbers were small, they suffered the highest \ncasualties of any service in World War II. Merchant mariners were \nresponsible for transporting troops, tanks, food, fuel, airplanes and \nother supplies and, as a result, their likelihood of combat was \nextremely high. In fact, enemy forces sank over 800 of their ships \nbetween 1941 and 1944.\n  For more than 40 years, Merchant Mariners were denied any G.I. bill \nof rights benefits. In 1988, they were granted a ``watered down'' \nversion of the G.I. bill of rights, but some portions of those benefits \nwere never made available to them. In addition, they still have not \nreceived proper recognition as veterans for Social Security purposes.\n  This legislation would rectify that inequity by recognizing these \nAmerican heroes with the status of ``veteran,'' and it would grant a \nsmall monthly stipend to these veterans or their widows in order to \noffset their lost benefits.\n  As a veteran, I will always seek to protect the honored place of our \nmilitary heroes. I cherish their service, and I will do everything in \nmy power to support their interests. I look forward to working with my \nSenate colleagues to pass this important piece of legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/12/21/senate-section/article/S14315-2", "month": "12", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14315]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNIZING THE NEWARK HUD OFFICE\n\n Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, it is with great pleasure that \nI rise today to pay tribute to the Newark field office of the U.S. \nDepartment of Housing and Urban Development on the occasion of its 40th \nanniversary in my home State of New Jersey.\n  The Department of Housing and Urban Development, HUD, administers \nprograms that increase homeownership, provide aid for housing for lower \nincome people, support community development, and increase access to \nhousing free from discrimination.\n  For 40 years, the staff of the Newark field office has embraced this \nmission and effectively partnered with faith-based and community \norganizations to help provide housing assistance to the homeless, \nelderly, people with disabilities, and people living with AIDS.\n  Today, under the leadership of Diane Johnson, the Newark field office \nis leading the way in helping more low- and moderate-income New \nJerseyans realize the American dream of becoming homeowners. For \nexample, in the city of Trenton, the HUD-designated ``Homeownership \nZone'' is helping first-time homebuyers and minority families purchase \nhomes.\n  Since its creation in 1992, the HOPE VI Program has helped transform \nthe HUD's approach to housing assistance for the poor. In New Jersey, \nHOPE VI has successfully generated over $1 billion to revitalize \ndistressed public housing. This investment has changed the housing \nlandscape in towns and cities throughout the State by replacing \nseverely distressed public housing projects, occupied exclusively by \npoor families, with redesigned mixed-income housing.\n  The Housing Choice Voucher Program has grown into the dominant form \nof federal housing assistance, helping 65,000 low-income families in \nNew Jersey afford decent, safe, and sanitary housing in the private \nmarket.\n  It is with great respect that I extend my warmest congratulations to \nthe Newark field office on four decades of success and to Diane Johnson \nwho has been a tireless advocate on behalf of HUD's programs and the \npeople who benefit from them.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/12/21/senate-section/article/S14315-3", "month": "12", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14315-S14316]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   SILVER HIGH SCHOOL FIGHTING COLTS\n\n Mr. BINGAMAN.

Mr. President, I would like to take this \nopportunity to recognize Matrix Human Services, one of Michigan's \noldest and largest nonprofit social service organizations, as it \ncelebrates 100 years of tireless and dedicated service.\n  Matrix Human Services was founded in 1906 by a small group of \nCatholic women, later known as the League of Catholic Women, who \nrecognized a growing need to provide support for low income and at-risk \npopulations in the Detroit Metropolitan area. Over the years as the \nLeague's membership continued to grow, it was able to dedicate more \nresources and personnel to its mission of fostering self-sufficiency \nand hope to those in need. These efforts ultimately lead to a broadened \nscope of services that sought to address the growing and diverse needs \nof the community, which grew into what we now refer to as Matrix Human \nServices.\n  Today, Matrix Human Services is a diverse organization with more than \n300 staff members and dedicated volunteers, serving 30 locations across \nthe Detroit Metropolitan area. It continues to focus on its mission to \nhelp prepare individuals and families to live a more positive, \nproductive and meaningful life. Matrix Human Services has organized \neducational training, childcare, social work, mentoring, abuse \nprevention, and housing assistance for the homeless programs. Each \nyear, Matrix is able to serve thousands of individuals through a \nnetwork of specialized divisions that include Head Start Family Service \nCenter, Project Transition Housing, Walter and May Reuther Senior \nServices, Barat Child and Family Services, Casa Maria Family Services, \nVistas Nuevas Head Start, and Off the Streets.\n  I know my Senate colleagues join me in congratulating Matrix Human \nServices on its many years of excellent service and wish its staff, \nvolunteers, and community partners many more productive years of \nservice to the community.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/12/21/senate-section/article/S14316-2", "month": "12", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14316]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/12/21/senate-section/article/S14316-3", "month": "12", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14316]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations and withdrawals which were referred to the appropriate \ncommittees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/12/21/senate-section/article/S14316-4", "month": "12", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14316]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                          ENROLLED BILL SIGNED\n\n  At 1:35 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the Speaker \nhas signed the following enrolled bills:\n\n       S. 205.

He was well liked by his colleagues who \nknew they had a leader they could trust.\n  In addition to his active professional life, Robert Ferguson found \ntime to serve his community. As President of the Clay County Shrine \nClub in 1992, he organized events to raise thousands of dollars for the \nShriner's Hospital for Children. In 1996, he raised money to assist a \nlocal family after a storm destroyed their mobile home. In 2002, Mr. \nFerguson created a Hospital Directory for Southern Illinois, which aid \nlocal citizens by providing phone numbers and addresses of local \nhospitals.\n  In 1996, the Flora Chamber of Commerce named Robert Ferguson the \n``Outstanding Citizen of Flora''.\n  Mr. President, post offices are often designated in honor of \nindividuals who have made valuable contributions to their community, \nState, and country. I can think of no more fitting way to permanently \nand publicly recognize Robert Ferguson's work than to name the Flora, \nIllinois post office in his honor. It would be a most appropriate way \nto commemorate his exemplary service to the Flora community and to \npostal workers and patrons throughout Southern Illinois.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. BOXER:\n\n[[Page S14319]]\n\n  S. 2157. A bill to amend title 10, United States Code, to provide for \nthe Purple Heart to be awarded to prisoners of war who die in captivity \nunder circumstances not otherwise establishing eligibility for the \nPurple Heart; to the Committee on Armed Services.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce legislation \ntoday to provide for the Purple Heart to be awarded to all prisoners of \nwar who die in captivity, regardless of the cause of death. The ``Honor \nOur Fallen Prisoners of War Act'' was previously introduced by \nRepresentative Bob Filner in the House of Representatives. I am proud \nto join him in this effort.\n  The ``Honor Our Fallen Prisoners of War Act'' would make members of \nthe Armed Forces who die in captivity of any circumstance eligible for \nthe Purple Heart. Currently, only prisoners of war who die during their \nimprisonment of wounds inflicted by an instrument of war are eligible \nfor posthumous Purple Heart recognition. Those who die of starvation, \ndisease, abuse, or other causes during captivity are not.\n  I believe this is an injustice to the thousands of POWs who paid the \nultimate price in service to our Nation. The purpose of the Purple \nHeart is to honor those who are killed or wounded in action as the \nresult of an act of an enemy of the United States. It makes no sense \nthat prisoner of war camps--where thousands of Americans have been held \nagainst their will and have endured great suffering at the hands of \nenemy forces--are not considered a battlefield.\n  The legislation is retro-active to December 7, 1941 and would \ntherefore include all POWs who have died in captivity since World War \nII.\n  The ``Honor Our Fallen Prisoners of War Act'' has been endorsed by \nthe Tiger Survivors, Veterans of Foreign Wars, Military Order of the \nPurple Heart, Korean War Veterans Association, National League of POW/\nMIA Families, and a number of other prominent veterans organizations.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LIEBERMAN (for himself and Ms. Collins):\n  S. 2158. A bill to establish a National Homeland Security Academy \nwithin the Department of Homeland Security; to the Committee on \nHomeland Security and Governmental Affairs.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce today the \nNational Homeland Security Academy Act of 2005. I am delighted that \nChairman Collins has joined me in sponsoring this legislation.\n  Shortly after the Homeland Security Department was formed in 2003, I \nlaid out my vision for what the country needed to do to protect against \nanother terrorist attack, or major natural disaster, in a speech at \nGeorge Washington University. Among the areas I identified as in need \nof additional work was the training of those who agreed to commit \nthemselves to the protection of Americans here at home. At the time, I \nsaid we needed to make sure homeland security professionals were given \nthe full range of skills necessary to make this country as safe as it \nshould be and I proposed a National Homeland Security Academy to \neducate and train the best and brightest of our future leaders.\n  The bill Senator Collins and I are introducing today, the National \nHomeland Security Academy Act of 2005, is the fulfillment of that idea.\n  It was clear to me as I was working to create a Department of \nHomeland Security that we would need to find a way to make sure \nDepartment professionals, as well as the State and local officials with \nwhom they work, understand the full scope and range of responsibilities \nentrusted to the Department--not just the details of their own \nparticular jobs. This academy would accomplish that. It would cultivate \nleaders, teach the full range of skills necessary for robust homeland \nsecurity, and provide cross-disciplinary and joint education and \ntraining to government officials at the Federal, State and local levels \nso that they can develop the bonds and relationships that will make \ntheir work more efficient and effective.\n  The National Homeland Security Academy Act of 2005 is the product of \nmy work with the Chairman of the Homeland Security and Governmental \nAffairs Committee, Senator Collins, as well as homeland security \nexperts, scholars, and education and professional development experts. \nTogether, we have refined the concept of homeland security education \nand training to meet the Department's needs today and into the future.\n  The academy I envision would be a professional development \ninstitution, much like the War College created by the Department of \nDefense to provide its leaders with a deep and thorough understanding \nof military and defense matters. The National Homeland Security Academy \nwould ensure that new and mid-level executive employees at the \nDepartment of Homeland Security--as well as other Federal, State, and \nlocal leaders with homeland security responsibilities--have a thorough \nunderstanding of the strategic missions of the Department, as well \naccess to hands-on training exercises, and real-time simulation.\n  Four months ago, Hurricane Katrina reminded us in no uncertain terms \nthat our homeland security workers at all levels still have much to \nlearn. How and when to share critical information? What does it mean to \nactivate the National Response Plan? Who is responsible for which \nemergency response mission? These are the types of questions we on the \nHomeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee have been hearing \nas we investigate why the preparedness for and response to the \nhurricane was so lacking. The National Homeland Security Academy would \nprovide answers to these and many more questions and ensure homeland \nsecurity officials are better equipped to respond to the next disaster.\n  The centerpiece of the Academy would be the National Homeland \nSecurity Education and Strategy Center, where Federal homeland security \nofficials would receive initial and continuing homeland security \neducation. The Academy would also incorporate the Center for Homeland \nDefense and Security run by the Naval Postgraduate School at the \nDirection of the Office of State and Local Government Coordination and \nPreparedness. In addition, the bill establishes a National Homeland \nSecurity Education Network comprised of the academies and training \ncenters within the jurisdiction of DHS--like the Federal Law \nEnforcement Training Center--as well as a communications network \ncapable of providing distance learning opportunities.\n  It also creates a new State and Local Education and Training \nCoordinator within the Office of State and Local Government \nCoordination and Preparedness to address one of the most frequent \ncriticisms local first responders have with the Department of Homeland \nSecurity, and that is the fact that many people in the Department seem \nto be unaware of or unwilling to make use of excellent state and local \neducation and training programs. A liaison officer would rectify that.\n  This bill does not change the system for first responder training. \nLocal first responders will continue to work with the Office of State \nand Local Government Coordination and Preparedness to ensure they have \nthe necessary training to deal with the situations they face everyday. \nBut we believe that bringing people together from all levels of \ngovernment to study homeland security issues from different \nperspectives would be healthy. And we do think that homeland security \nwill benefit overall from the relationships that would inevitably form \nbetween officials at every level and from every corner of the country.\n  The National Homeland Security Act of 2005 addresses a deficiency in \nthe education and training of our homeland security professionals by \nhelping to foster connected, experienced, and knowledgeable homeland \nsecurity leaders who will be able to provide the best possible \nprotection for the American people. I look forward to working with \nChairman Collins in the next session to mark up this bill and make it \nlaw.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2158\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``National Homeland Security \n     Academy Act of 2005''.\n\n[[Page S14320]]\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) homeland security poses a complex challenge for the \n     Nation that can only be successfully addressed by the \n     combined effort of Federal, State, and local governments and \n     the private sector;\n       (2) the United States fields a dedicated workforce to \n     provide homeland security, but lacks a coordinated homeland \n     security education system that links a strategy-based \n     education with hands on training and real time simulation, \n     and fails to make such a system available to the appropriate \n     government and private sector personnel on a wide scale;\n       (3) officials at all levels of government should understand \n     the strategic mission of the Department of Homeland Security, \n     and have access to continuing education and hands-on training \n     exercises;\n       (4) the development of a program of professional education \n     and training that links strategy and training, and \n     coordinates current training among the many academies and \n     training facilities that fall under the jurisdiction of the \n     Department of Homeland Security, is essential to meeting the \n     goals and intent of the Homeland Security Act of 2002;\n       (5) lessons learned from the Department of Homeland \n     Security's Top Official Exercises (TOPOFF), and the tragedy \n     of Hurricane Katrina, demonstrate there is a need to build up \n     institutional knowledge within the Department and cultivate \n     leaders capable of guiding the Department and the Nation when \n     catastrophic incidents occur;\n       (6) modern information technologies provide uniquely \n     powerful tools for ensuring that material is presented in a \n     way that facilitates rapid and effective learning for a \n     diverse student body, material being taught is continuously \n     upgraded and reviewed, and training is available anytime and \n     anywhere it is needed; and\n       (7) as the Homeland Security Act of 2002 brought together a \n     number of Federal agencies with specific and often nonrelated \n     functions to form a single department, the National Homeland \n     Security Academy will draw upon the expertise of a variety of \n     existing academic institutions and innovative programs to \n     educate our homeland security workforce.\n\n     SEC. 3. ESTABLISHMENT OF NATIONAL HOMELAND SECURITY ACADEMY.\n\n       (a) In General.--Title VIII of the Homeland Security Act of \n     2002 (6 U.S.C. 361 et seq.) is amended by adding after \n     section 801 the following:\n\n     ``SEC. 802.

Mr. President, each year Congress appropriates millions \nof dollars to institutions of higher learning that serve minority \nstudents. Currently, funds go to historically Black colleges and \nuniversities, Hispanic-serving institutions, tribally controlled \ncolleges and universities, and Alaska Native and Native Hawaiian-\nserving institutions. These funds--which exceeded $890 million in \nfiscal year 2005--\n\n[[Page S14322]]\n\nhelp institutions provide more higher education opportunities for low-\nincome minority students.\n  For schools that serve a large number of low-income Asian Americans \nand Pacific Islanders, however, Federal assistance is not available. A \nneed is not being served.\n  Over 42 percent of Cambodian Americans, almost 35 percent of Laotian \nAmericans and 25 percent of Vietnamese Americans live in poverty. And \nthe graduation rates among these populations are low. Only 13.8 percent \nof Vietnamese Americans, 5.8 percent of Laotian Americans, 6.1 percent \nof Cambodian Americans, and 5.1 percent of Hmong have college degrees.\n  So, today, I am introducing the Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders \nHigher Education Enhancement Act. I am pleased to be joined in this \neffort by Senator Akaka.\n  This legislation creates a new Federal grant program for institutions \nwhere Asian and Pacific Islander students make up at least 10 percent \nof the undergraduate student body. Priority will be given based on the \nnumber of low-income students.\n  The grants--authorized at $30 million in the first year, and such \nsums as necessary for the next 4 years--could be used for a variety of \npurposes, including outreach to secondary and elementary school \nstudents, curriculum development, tutoring, counseling, and student \nsupport services.\n  Mr. President, we need to make college accessible for low-income \nAsian American students as we do for with other minority students. This \nbill is an important step toward this goal.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. BOXER (for herself and Mr. Akaka):\n  S. 2160. A bill to amend the Higher Education Act of 1965 to \nauthorize grants for institutions of higher education serving Asian \nAmericans and Pacific Islanders; to the Committee on Health, Education, \nLabor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, as a member of the Congressional Asian \nPacific American Caucus, the only Chinese American in the U.S. Senate, \nand sole native Hawaiian in the U.S. Congress, I thank my colleague \nfrom California, Senator Boxer, for introducing a bill to establish \nAsian American and Pacific Islander, AAPI, Serving Institutions which \nwill improve the educational opportunities available to Asian Americans \nand Pacific Islanders throughout our Nation. I am proud to stand with \nher as a cosponsor of her bill. I also commend my colleagues, \nCongressmen David Wu and Mike Honda, in the other body for working to \nadvance an AAPI Serving Institution bill.\n  This legislation would authorize the Department of Education to \nestablish an Asian American and Pacific Islander Serving Institution \ndesignation under the Higher Education Act. A higher education \ninstitution with an AAPI undergraduate enrollment of at least 10 \npercent would be eligible for grants to address and improve the \ninstitution's capacity to serve the AAPI community. In the Higher \nEducation Act, titles III and V were established to provide aid for \ncolleges and universities to expand educational opportunities for \nhistorically under represented and financially disadvantaged students. \nHowever, we need a program specifically for Asian American and Pacific \nIslander Americans. This legislation would assist in providing AAPI \nstudents with the equal opportunity to pursue a quality education.\n  The AAPI community has made many significant contributions to our \ncountry, and is known as having the highest percentage of undergraduate \nand advanced degrees when compared to other racial or ethnic groups \naccording to the College Board. However, as one of the most ethnically, \nculturally, and linguistically diverse groups in America, the success \nof the community as a whole masks the needs of its disparate groups who \nmay not be doing so well. This is the ``model minority'' myth. In fact, \nserious challenges face Cambodian, Hmong, and Pacific Islander \nstudents, particularly in the acquisition of the English language.\n  The AAPI population is one of the fastest growing populations in this \ncountry, including nearly 12 million Asian Americans and 1 million \nPacific Islanders. Census projections show the AAPI population more \nthan doubling by 2050 and comprising about 9 percent of the total U.S. \npopulation. As a significant part of our society, AAPIs and their \nhigher education needs should be better understood and addressed, and \nthe establishment of AAPI Serving Institutions would be a major step in \nthe right direction for this multifaceted population.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting Senator Boxer's \nlegislation to enhance educational opportunities for Asian Americans \nand Pacific Islanders.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. INHOFE (for himself, Mr. Domenici, Mr. Hagel, and Mr. \n        Nelson of Nebraska):\n  S. 2161. A bill to amend the Safe Drinking Water Act to prevent the \nenforcement of certain national primary drinking water regulations \nunless sufficient funding is available or variance technology has been \nidentified; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce The Small System \nDrinking Water Act of 2005 to assist water systems throughout the \ncountry comply with the numerous Federal drinking water standards. My \nbill will require the Federal Government to live up to its obligations \nand require the EPA to use all of the tools given the Agency in the \n1996 Safe Drinking Water Act amendments (SDWA).\n  In Oklahoma we continue to have municipalities struggling with the \narsenic rule. Further nearly 80 percent of our small systems, those \nserving less than 10,000 people, are not in compliance with the \nDisinfection Byproducts (DBP) Stage I rule. In EPA's most recent \ndrinking water needs survey, Oklahoma identified $4.5 billion in \ninfrastructure needs over the next 20 years. $40 million a year of that \nneed is to meet Federal drinking water standards. This does not include \ncosts imposed by Oklahoma communities to meet Federal clean water \nrequirements.\n  The EPA on December 15th finalized the Disinfection Byproducts Stage \nII rule and the Long Term 2 Enhanced Surface Water Treatment Rule. The \ncosts of complying with these two rules are not included in the $40 \nmillion a year need recently identified by the State. At current \nfunding rates, the State receives $8.5 million dollars for its drinking \nwater revolving loan fund.\n  My bill proposes a few simple steps to help systems comply with the \nrules. First, it reauthorizes the technical assistance program in the \nSDWA. The DBP Stage I rule is very complex and involves a lot of \nmonitoring and testing. The other rules are equally complex in nature \nand many small systems simply do not have the expertise needed to \nimplement them. If we are going to impose complicated requirements on \nsystems, we need to provide them with help to implement those \nrequirements. Therefore, my legislation also requires that each system \nreceive the help it needs to come into compliance before an enforcement \naction can be taken.\n  The bill also creates a pilot program to demonstrate new technologies \nand approaches for systems of all sizes to comply with these \ncomplicated rules. It requires the EPA to convene a working group to \nexamine the science behind the rules compared to new developments since \ntheir publication.\n  Section 1412(b)(4)(E) of the SDWA Amendments of 1996 authorizes the \nuse of point of entry treatment, point of use treatment and package \nplants to economically meet the requirements of the Act. However, to \ndate, these approaches are not widely used by small water systems. My \nlegislation directs the EPA to convene a working group to identify \nbarriers to the use of these approaches. The EPA will then use the \nrecommendations of the working group to draft a model guidance document \nthat states can use to create their own programs.\n  This legislation seeks to provide communities with more tools in \norder to comply with these Federal requirements while also requiring \nEPA to use the tools it has been provided, including the identification \nof variance technologies.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. SNOWE:\n  S. 2162. A bill to foster local development by facilitating the \ndelivery of financial assistance to small businesses, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship.\n\n[[Page S14323]]\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the ``Local \nDevelopment Business Loan Program Act of 2005.'' This bill will improve \nthe Small Business Administration's (SBA) Certified Development Company \nLoan Program, also known as the ``504 Loan Program,'' by streamlining \nthe lending process and providing small businesses with greater \nopportunities to obtain affordable financing. The 504 Loan Program \nprovides small businesses with long-term, fixed-rate financing for real \nestate and machinery.\n  As Chair of the Senate Committee on Small Business and \nEntrepreneurship, one of my primary responsibilities is to ensure small \nbusinesses are afforded the best possible environment to grow and \nflourish. The fundamental purpose of the SBA is to maintain and \nstrengthen the nation's economy by aiding, counseling, assisting, and \nprotecting the interests of small business concerns. This bill would \nstrengthen the SBA's ability to pursue those goals.\n  The legislation responds to one of the primary needs of small \nbusinesses: access to affordable capital. For many small businesses, \nexpansion plans face constraints imposed by facilities that are too \nsmall, or equipment that has insufficient capacity or outdated \nfeatures. These small businesses often lack capital to remedy these \nneeds, and without the SBA they would be limited to obtaining short-\nterm financing with higher, often variable, rates. As a result, the 504 \nloan program is a key element of these small businesses' eventual \nsuccess, because the program provides long-term capital, at fixed \nrates, that allows businesses to obtain new facilities, expand existing \nfacilities, and update their machinery.\n  In Fiscal Year 2004, the SBA's financing programs, combined, \nsupported over $20 billion in loans and venture capital for small \nbusinesses. In the 504 program alone, small businesses obtained 8,357 \nloans in 2004. Through those loans the SBA guaranteed over $4 billion \nin financing. The SBA portion of each 504 program loan is only 40 \npercent of the total loan size. This program thus produced \napproximately $10 billion in financing for small businesses in 2004! \nThat financing allowed small businesses to create or retain 140,000 \njobs in 2004.\n  Although the 504 program is already assisting entrepreneurial small \nbusinesses throughout the nation, it can be improved. The program works \nby combining in each financing package provided to a small business a \nloan from a Certified Development Company (CDC) that is guaranteed by \nthe SBA, this is 40 percent of the total package; a non-guaranteed loan \nprovided by a private ``first-mortgage'' lender, 50 percent of the \ntotal package; and a 10 percent down-payment provided by the small \nbusiness. This bill offers improvements to all three aspects of the \nprogram, to increase the program's efficiency and impact. If approved \nby the Congress and signed into law, this bill will increase the number \nof small businesses that can utilize the program to grow and succeed.\n  Job creation and retention is a bedrock element of local development \nefforts throughout the country. One of the statutory purposes of the \n504 loan program is to create new jobs and to help small businesses \nretain existing jobs. This bill's purpose is to further strengthen the \nlocal development impact of the 504 loan program. To reflect that, the \nbill re-names the 504 loan program as the ``Local Development Business \nLoan Program'' (Local Development Program). This new name will also \nhelp borrowers to understand the intent of the program; many small \nbusiness owners had commented to the Committee that the name ``504 \nprogram'' was neither clear nor indicative of the program's purposes. \nThe bill will not require the SBA to waste money by discarding existing \nprogram materials that refer to the previous name; the SBA may continue \nto use those materials, but it will use the new name on any new \nmaterials produced after the bill's enactment.\n  If the Local Development Program continues to grow at its recent \npace, it may exceed $6 billion in guaranteed loans during 2006. The \nbill would authorize a maximum program level of $8 billion in \nguaranteed loans in fiscal year 2007, and $8.5 billion for fiscal year \n2008.\n  This legislation will also reduce regulatory barriers that have \nconstrained CDCs from expanding their operations into new areas. By \nincreasing competitive opportunities for CDCs, the bill seeks to \nincrease the number and qualify of financing options available to small \nbusinesses. For instance, existing SBA regulations require CDCs to have \na separate loan committee for each State and to account for all revenue \nand expenses separately for each state. Regulations of this type have \nmade compliance both costly and difficult and have deterred many CDCs \nfrom expanding into new areas. Simplifying these regulations will \nresult in increased access to capital for small business.\n  The bill allows borrowers to provide more than the required minimum \namount of equity when initiating their loan, and to use the excess \nequity to reduce the amount of the first-lien mortgage made by a \nprivate lender in the program. By contributing a larger down-payment at \nthe onset of the loan, this provision will provide an opportunity for \nthese borrowers to reduce their periodic payment obligations.\n  This legislation would also designate Local Development Program loans \nthat qualify under the New Markets Tax Credit Program as a public \npolicy goal under the Local Development Program, and thus make them \neligible for larger financing packages. The New Market Tax Credit \nProgram permits taxpayers to receive a credit against Federal income \ntaxes for making qualified equity investments in designated Community \nDevelopment Entities.\n  The Act will also permit the ownership interest of two or more small \nbusiness owners to be combined to determine whether the small business \nis 51 percent owned by minorities, women, or veterans in order to \nqualify as a business eligible for a public policy loan. The Act's goal \nof improving access to capital for small businesses is also furthered \nby another provision that permits Local Development Program borrowers \nto obtain financing in the maximum amount permitted under this program \nand also under the SBA's ``7(a) loan program.''\n  This legislation would also allow a borrower to refinance a limited \namount of existing debt. The amount that could be refinanced could not \nexceed 50 percent of the expansion project funded by the loan, and \nwould be limited to certain situations. By giving these small \nbusinesses the opportunity to refinance and obtain lower-cost capital, \nthe bill would provide them a greater chance to succeed.\n  The bill would also eliminate a fee now imposed on the first mortgage \nlenders, private banks, in a Local Development Program financing \npackage. The lender's fee is a one-time fee equal to 0.5 percent of the \nfirst mortgage loan. Currently, the first mortgage lenders pass this \nfee on to CDCs and to borrowers. The bill will not increase the total \nfees paid by the CDCs or the borrowers, but clarifies that the CDC's \nstipulated annual fee would be increased by 0.06 percent, 6/100ths of \none percent, and the borrower's stipulated fee would increase by \napproximately 0.06 percent, to replace the fees currently imposed on \nCDCs and borrowers by private lenders. In other words, instead of a fee \nimposed on CDCs and borrowers by the private lenders, which is not \nalways clearly identifiable to those outside the program, this \nprovision will specify the fee be paid directly by the CDCs and \nborrowers. It is hoped that this provision will clarify the fee \nobligations owed within the program, and will clearly identify to banks \nthe total costs of participating in the program.\n  The SBA's current 504 Program provides our Nation's small businesses \nwith low-cost, long-term financing that is absolutely critical to \nstarting and developing a successful business. In turn, small \nbusinesses create the majority of new jobs created in the United \nStates. This program, re-named as the Local Development Business Loan \nProgram, will continue to help small businesses create jobs and support \ntheir local communities. In fact, the provisions in this bill will \nimprove those efforts significantly.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n[[Page S14324]]\n\n                                S. 2162\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend titles 10 and 38 of the United States Code, \nto increase and index educational benefits for veterans under the \nMontgomery GI bill to ensure adequate and equitable benefits for active \nduty members and members of the selected Reserve, and to include \ncertain servicemembers previously excluded from such benefits; to the \nCommittee on Veterans' Affairs.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, the original GI Bill of 1944 was intended \nto help veterans readjust to civilian life, and to recognize the \nservice they provided to their country. Subsequent GI Bills, including \nthe one in force today, have been important tools to recruit the \nworld's best troops.\n  The GI Bill is meant ``to help meet, in part, the expenses of such \nindividual's subsistence, tuition, fees, supplies, books, equipment, \nand other educational costs.'' At certain points historically the \npayment has met over 100 percent of these costs.\n  Yet, today's troops, performing with such distinction in Iraq, \nAfghanistan, and other locations around the world, are returning home \nto a GI Bill that covers only 63 percent of the average price of a \npublic four-year secondary education.\n  Veterans are struggling to make up the difference in the price of \ntheir education.\n  We have heard of a 28-year-old Navy veteran who served two \ndeployments in the Persian Gulf between 1996 and 2002. When he went to \nschool he had to supplement his GI Bill benefits by working part-time \nas a bartender and taking out tens of thousands of dollars in emergency \nloans.\n  We've heard of a veteran who served 4 years in the airborne infantry \nprior to enrolling in a local community college in California under the \nGI Bill. He has been able to make ends meet at the community college by \nsubsidizing his GI Bill benefits through part time work, but he worries \nthat he will be unable to fulfill his dream of finishing up at UC Davis \nbecause his benefits and part time job will not cover the higher costs \nat the 4-year public secondary institution.\n  But not all veterans are in a position where they can worry only \nabout their education. Almost 60 percent of enlisted men and women are \nmarried today, compared with 40 percent in 1973. These veterans are \nfaced with choosing to borrow in order to invest for the future or take \ncare of their family now.\n  We know of veterans who have lost that fight. One was unable to come \nup with the remaining third of the cost of his education and support \nhis wife and baby daughter. His wife had convinced him to use his GI \nBill benefits, but for this young veteran, ``the benefit just didn't \nmatch up to the cost of living'' and he dropped out of school after \nonly one semester.\n  Over the past 10 years, less than 10 percent of eligible veterans who \nsigned up for the GI Bill from 1985 to 1994 used their entire \neducational benefit, although 70 percent have used some portion of it.\n  The legislation I introduce today is the start of an effort to help \nveterans meet the everincreasing costs of education. It is only a \nstart. I recognize that the cost of this proposal has to be addressed \nfor the legislation to advance. Toward this end, Senator Ensign and I \nhave written to the Veterans' Affairs Committee seeking reauthorization \nof a reporting requirement that will inform this process. And I plan to \nwork with my colleagues in the coming months to find a solution that \nmeets the needs of America's veterans.\n  We know that improving GI Bill benefits isn't just about saying thank \nyou. It is critical to recruiting the world's finest military. As \nrecently as 2004, a survey of active duty service members found that GI \nBill education benefits were the primary reason individuals chose to \nenlist. We recently increased sign-up and reenlistment bonuses for \nmembers of the military. The GI Bill must increase too.\n  This legislation, the Armed Forces Education Benefits Improvement \nAct, would increase GI Bill educational benefits to cover the average \nprice of a 4-year secondary education. According to the most recent \nreport by the U.S. Department of Education, an average public 4-year \neducation cost $14,260 in 2004-05, compared with the $9,036 provided \nunder the current GI Bill for the same time period.\n  The Armed Forces Education Benefits Improvement Act would also \nprovide for real growth in future benefits that keep paces with the \never increasing cost of education. The bill would index the increased \nbenefit to the ``college tuition and fees'' component of the Consumer \nPrice Index. Currently, the increasing cost of education is out-pacing \ngrowth in GI Bill benefits, which are indexed to the less rapidly \ngrowing overall inflation.\n  This legislation would also increase the base amount provided for \nmembers of the Selected Reserve by approximately 59 percent. And it \nmaintains the same ratio in the FY05 Defense Authorization Act for \nthose members of the Selected Reserve called up to active duty for at \nleast 90 days.\n\n[[Page S14327]]\n\n  Finally, the Armed Forces Education Benefits Improvement Act would \nopen' enrollment for updated Montgomery GI bill benefits to certain \nactive duty service members who declined to accept the Veterans \nEducation Assistance Program, VEAP, offered between January 1, 1977 and \nJune 30, 1985. These veterans are the only group of active duty service \nmembers--other than service academy graduates and recipients of certain \nROTC scholarships--who have not been able to sign up for GI Bill \neducational benefits.\n  I am pleased that this legislation has been endorsed by the Military \nOfficers Association of America and the Reserve Enlisted Association.\n  I know my colleagues are as inspired as I am by the dedication, \ncourage, and honor of the soldiers, sailors, airmen, and Marines we \nmeet around the world. They serve with a selfless devotion to their \ncountry and their mission--and we are all so very proud of them. The \nleast that we can do is ensure the GI Bill education benefits keep pace \nwith the cost of education in this country. I look forward to working \nwith my colleagues over the coming months to bring this legislation to \nfruition.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2163\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to direct the Election Assistance Commission to make \ngrants to States to restore and replace election administration \nsupplies, materials, records, equipment, and technology which were \ndamaged, destroyed, or dislocated as a result of Hurricane Katrina or \nHurricane Rita; to the Committee on Rules and Administration.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Hurricane \nElection Relief Act of 2005. I thank my friend Senator Dodd--the \nranking member of the committee I chair, the Senate Committee on Rules \nand Administration--for joining me in sponsoring this important \nlegislation.\n  It has now been over three months since Hurricanes Katrina and Rita \nwreaked havoc throughout the gulf coast region, leaving almost \nunimaginable wreckage and destruction in their wakes. The good people \nin the region have suffered a terrible toll in terms of lives lost and \nproperty destroyed. Though their plight no longer dominates the \nheadlines, the difficulties and hardships that these individuals \ncontinue to confront on a daily basis remain formidable. However, one \nthing that gulf coast residents should not have to face in the \naftermath of the hurricanes is an impediment to their ability to fully \nparticipate in our Nation's democracy. The right to vote must not \nbecome a further casualty of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita.\n  The hurricane-related damage to election infrastructure was extensive \nthroughout my home State of Mississippi as well as Louisiana and other \ngulf States. Voting equipment was destroyed; voter records were lost; \npolling places were leveled. If this infrastructure is not restored in \na timely manner, the voting rights of thousands of citizens in the \nregion will be substantially impaired. This is not acceptable.\n  But replacing damaged and destroyed election equipment and technology \nis not the only election-related challenge these States face. Thousands \nand thousands of individuals were forced to evacuate their homes and \ntheir communities and relocate to other areas and, in some instances, \nother States. Large numbers of these displaced individuals will not be \nable to return to their homes anytime soon. Consequently, if these \ncitizens are going to participate in the upcoming elections that will \nshape the rebuilding efforts in their communities, they will have to do \nso largely by means of absentee ballots. This increased demand for \nabsentee ballots will, in turn, present significant logistical \nchallenges for localities that are already cash-strapped and struggling \nto recover in the aftermath of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. Therefore, \nto ensure that gulf coast residents remain fully enfranchised, it is \nessential that the impacted States receive sufficient resources to \nrestore their election infrastructure to pre-hurricane levels.\n  For this reason, I am proud to introduce today the Hurricane Election \nRelief Act of 2005, which provides much needed funds to the States that \nbore the brunt of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita to aid them in rebuilding \nelection infrastructure that was damaged or destroyed. Specifically, \nthe Hurricane Election Relief Act authorizes $50 million in grants to \nbe distributed by the Election Assistance Commission, EAC, to assist \naffected States in restoring and replacing supplies, materials, \nrecords, equipment, and technology used in administering Federal \nelections that were damaged, destroyed, or dislocated as a result of \nthe hurricanes. The act also permits the authorized funds to be used to \nensure the full electoral participation of displaced individuals. Thus, \nState and local election officials could use monies furnished by the \nact to offset the costs associated with printing and processing voter \nregistration and absentee ballot materials for displaced voters. \nFinally, the use of the funds provided under this act would have to be \nconsistent with the requirements of Title III of the Help America Vote \nAct of 2002.\n  Much work remains to be done to help the communities impacted by \nHurricanes Katrina and Rita get back on their feet. I realize this fact \nmore than most. Thus, it is my hope that my fellow Senators will \nenthusiastically support this important legislation, which will ensure \nthat those individuals in my home State as well as those in the \nsurrounding States whose lives were thrown into such turmoil as a \nresult of the hurricanes will retain their ability to fully exercise \ntheir right to vote.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2166\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Hurricane Election Relief \n     Act of 2005''.\n\n     SEC. 2. GRANTS TO STATES FOR RESTORING AND REPLACING ELECTION \n                   ADMINISTRATION SUPPLIES, MATERIALS, RECORDS, \n                   EQUIPMENT, AND TECHNOLOGY WHICH WERE DAMAGED, \n                   DESTROYED, OR DISLOCATED BY HURRICANES KATRINA \n                   OR RITA.\n\n       (a) Authority to Make Grants.--The Election Assistance \n     Commission shall make a grant to each eligible State, in such \n     amount as the Commission considers appropriate, for purposes \n     of restoring and replacing supplies, materials, records, \n     equipment, and technology used in the administration of \n     Federal elections in the State which were damaged, destroyed, \n     or dislocated as a result of Hurricane Katrina or Hurricane \n     Rita and ensuring the full participation in such elections by \n     individuals who were displaced as a result of Hurricane \n     Katrina or Hurricane Rita.\n       (b) Use of Grant Funds.--Funds received under a grant under \n     subsection (a) shall be used in a manner that is consistent \n     with the requirements of title III of the Help America Vote \n     Act of 2002.\n       (c) Eligibility.--A State is eligible to receive a grant \n     under this section if it submits to the Commission (at such \n     time and in such form as the Commission may require) a \n     certification that--\n       (1) supplies, materials, records, equipment, and technology \n     used in the administration of Federal elections in the State \n     were damaged, destroyed, or dislocated as a result of \n     Hurricane Katrina or Hurricane Rita; or\n       (2) the system of such State for conducting Federal \n     elections has been significantly impacted by the displacement \n     of individuals as a result of Hurricane Katrina or Hurricane \n     Rita.\n\n     SEC. 3. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.\n\n       There are authorized to be appropriated for fiscal year \n     2006 for grants under this Act $50,000,000, to remain \n     available until expended.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, nearly three months have passed since \nHurricanes Katrina and Rita ravaged the lives of the good people of our \nGulf Coast region. Congress has taken great efforts to address the \nimmediate needs of those affected by the hurricanes and continues to \nconsider how we can assist the long-term needs of these communities. I \npreviously came to the floor with the distinguished Chairman of the \nSenate Rules Committee, Senator Lott, to discuss the needs for\n\n[[Page S14329]]\n\nfunding to restore the elections infrastructure of the impacted States, \nincluding not just those directly hit by the storms but also States \nthat welcomed and provided shelter to those displaced by the storms.\n  As the ranking member of the Rules Committee, I rise today to \nintroduce with Senator Lott, the Hurricane Election Relief Act of 2005, \na bill that authorizes the necessary funding to impacted States for the \npurpose of ensuring that they will be capable of conducting the up-\ncoming Federal elections next year, consistent with the Help America \nVote Act (\"HAVA'). This bill will ensure that impacted States will be \nable to strengthen the foundation of our democracy and the process by \nwhich we build communities. Specifically, this bill provides funding to \nStates to restore and replace supplies, materials, records, equipment \nand technology that were damaged, destroyed, or dislocated as result of \nthe storms. The Election Assistance Commission (EAC) is charged with \ndistribution of the appropriate funding to the States.\n  Earlier this month, Louisiana Secretary of State Al Ater postponed \nfor up to eight months the elections for mayor and City Council in New \nOrleans from the scheduled February 4, 2006 date, after explaining that \nthe infrastructure to hold an election is simply absent. Secretary of \nState Alter noted that polling places must be rebuilt, voting systems \nmust be repaired, poll workers must be located, and a system to process \nthe anticipated increase in absentee ballots must be developed. \nFollowing the storms, Ater requested $2 million from the Federal \nEmergency Management Agency (FEMA) solely to repair voting machines. To \ndate, he has not received any of the requested funds and there does not \nyet appear to be a projected FEMA disbursement date for such funds.\n  Mississippi Secretary of State Eric Clark surveyed the 43 counties \naffected by the storms in his State and announced that in order to \nfacilitate elections without long lines, Mississippi needs $3.3 million \nto replace 966 voting machines as well as additional funding to assure \nthat the counties meet the HAVA requirements effective January 1, 2006.\n  In light of the above, it is essential that we rise and join together \nto ensure that all States, including those States impacted by the \nhurricanes, may conduct timely Federal elections that enable every \neligible voter to cast a vote and have that vote counted, regardless of \nrace, ethnicity, language, age, disability or community resources. The \nhealth of our democracy depends upon it.\n  As we approach the end of the first session of the 109th Congress and \nprepare to return to the comfort of our families and constituents, let \nus give thanks for the well-being of our communities and provide the \nauthority to allocate funding to those States which are rebuilding \ntheir communities in the aftermath of these devastating natural \ndisasters.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. SNOWE (for herself and Mr. Nelson of Florida):\n  S. 2168. A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nprovide extended and additional protections to Medicare beneficiaries \nenrolled under part C or D or such title; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Medicare Drug \nBenefit Protections Act of 2005 with my colleague, Senator Bill Nelson. \nOur bill provides additional protections for Medicare beneficiaries \nenrolling in the new Medicare Part D prescription drug benefit, \nprotections which we believe are essential. Our bill extends the \ninitial enrollment period for the new benefit until the end of 2006, \nprovides more flexibility for beneficiaries to change plans, and adds \ncrucial protections for those enrolled in a plan.\n  We are now in the midst of the rollout of the new Medicare drug \nbenefit, and, as of November 15, seniors and individuals with \ndisabilities on Medicare have begun enrolling in various plans. \nUnfortunately, many seniors are confused and angry, frustrated and \nconcerned that they do not have adequate information about the plans \nbeing offered. Seniors may ultimately decide not to enroll in a plan if \nthey do not have enough expert assistance--readily available and \naccessible--to help them choose an appropriate plan. To make matters \nworse, many say the information available from the Centers for Medicare \nand Medicaid Services, CMS, the agency overseeing the plan, is either \nnot helpful or simply overwhelming.\n  Beneficiaries are worried they could make a poor choice in selecting \na plan and that, once enrolled, the drugs offered by the plan they \nchoose may not be the drugs they need. We must assure them that they \nwill not be saddled with monthly premiums for plans which, in the end, \ndo not adequately cover their prescription drug needs.\n  Our bill would address these concerns in several ways. The bill \nincludes two provisions from Senator Nelson's bill, the Medicare \nInformed Choice Act of 2005, which give beneficiaries additional \nprotection. The bill extends the initial six-month period for enrolling \nin a plan from May 15, 2006, to December 31, 2006, thus delaying late \nenrollment penalties until 2007 and giving beneficiaries the rest of \nthis year and all of next year to decide whether to enroll in a plan. \nOnce beneficiaries have enrolled in a plan, the bill provides a one-\ntime opportunity during 2006 to change to another plan without penalty, \nshould they wish to do so.\n  The Medicare Drug Benefit Protections Act includes additional \nsafeguards, as well. Seniors are getting misinformation from the CMS \nwebsite, especially in regard to the cost of drugs being offered by \ncertain plans. Seniors in my home State of Maine have experienced \nserious problems with inaccurate drug pricing information being \nprovided by the CMS website devoted to the new Medicare Part D plans, \nwww.medicare.gov. In one instance, the CMS website quoted one price for \na senior's drug costs for 2006 but the plan itself quoted a cost of \napproximately $2,000 more than the CMS website. Under our bill, \nbeneficiaries could change plans without penalty if they relied on \nmisinformation from CMS to their detriment.\n  Beneficiaries would also be allowed to change plans without penalty \nshould their circumstances change significantly, due to medical \nreasons, for example. Beneficiaries who meet these criteria would have \nan extended period of time to change plans, a minimum of four months \nrather than the current 90 days. The bill would also extend the annual \nopen season, as of 2007, from November 15th through December 31st, to a \nfull two months, from November 1st through December 31st, in order to \nallow all beneficiaries more time outside the busy and travel-filled \nholiday season to study and compare plans should they wish to make a \nchange.\n  Finally, our bill authorizes $25 million in funding for grants to \nStates, non-profit organizations, and other entities to conduct \nadditional education and outreach efforts on the drug benefit during \nfiscal years 2007 and 2008.\n  Our goal is to ensure that beneficiaries have sufficient time, \ncomfort, and peace of mind to understand the new drug benefit and \nenroll in a plan well-suited to their needs so they can derive the \nmuch-needed assistance with their prescription drugs offered by these \nplans. We must provide flexibility, safeguards, and outreach efforts \nbeyond what currently exists to reduce the anxiety and frustration that \ntoo many seniors are experiencing today.\n  The new Medicare drug benefit is the first comprehensive outpatient \nprescription drug benefit in the 40-year history of Medicare. The \nbenefit is not perfect by any means, but rather a beginning.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Global Pathogen Surveillance \n     Act of 2005''.\n\n[[Page S14330]]\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS; PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The frequency of the occurrence of biological events \n     that could threaten the national security of the United \n     States has increased and is likely increasing. The threat to \n     the United States from such events includes threats from \n     diseases that infect humans, animals, or plants regardless of \n     if such diseases are introduced naturally, accidentally, or \n     intentionally.\n       (2) The United States lacks an effective and real-time \n     system to detect, identify, contain, and respond to global \n     threats and also lacks an effective mechanism to disseminate \n     information to the national response community if such \n     threats arise.\n       (3) Bioterrorism poses a grave national security threat to \n     the United States. The insidious nature of a bioterrorist \n     attack, the likelihood that the recognition of such an attack \n     would be delayed, and the underpreparedness of the domestic \n     public health infrastructure to respond to such an attack \n     could result in catastrophic consequences following a \n     biological weapons attack against the United States.\n       (4) The ability to recognize that a country or organization \n     is carrying out a covert biological weapons programs is \n     dependent on a number of indications and warnings. A critical \n     component of this recognition is the timely detection of \n     sentinel events such as laboratory accidents and community-\n     level outbreaks that could be the earliest indication of an \n     emerging bioterrorist program in a foreign country. Early \n     detection of such events may enable earlier \n     counterproliferation intervention.\n       (5) A contagious pathogen engineered as a biological weapon \n     and developed, tested, produced, or released in a foreign \n     country could quickly spread to the United States. \n     Considering the realities of international travel, trade, and \n     migration patterns, a dangerous pathogen appearing naturally, \n     accidentally, or intentionally anywhere in the world can \n     spread to the United States in a matter of days, before any \n     effective quarantine or isolation measures could be \n     implemented.\n       (6) To combat bioterrorism effectively and ensure that the \n     United States is fully prepared to prevent, recognize, and \n     contain a biological weapons attack, or emerging infectious \n     disease, measures to strengthen the domestic public health \n     infrastructure and improve domestic event detection, \n     surveillance, and response, while absolutely essential, are \n     not sufficient.\n       (7) The United States should enhance cooperation with the \n     World Health Organization, regional international health \n     organizations, and individual countries, including data \n     sharing with appropriate agencies and departments of the \n     United States, to help detect and quickly contain infectious \n     disease outbreaks or a bioterrorism agent before such a \n     disease or agent is spread.\n       (8) The World Health Organization has done an impressive \n     job in monitoring infectious disease outbreaks around the \n     world, particularly with the establishment in April 2000 of \n     the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network.\n       (9) The capabilities of the World Health Organization \n     depend on the quality of the data and information the \n     Organization receives from the countries that are members of \n     the Organization and is further limited by the narrow list of \n     diseases (such as plague, cholera, and yellow fever) on which \n     such surveillance and monitoring is based and by the \n     consensus process used by the Organization to add new \n     diseases to the list. Developing countries, in particular, \n     often are unable to devote the necessary resources to build \n     and maintain public health infrastructures.\n       (10) In particular, developing countries could benefit \n     from--\n       (A) better trained public health professionals and \n     epidemiologists to recognize disease patterns;\n       (B) appropriate laboratory equipment for diagnosis of \n     pathogens;\n       (C) disease reporting systems that--\n       (i) are based on disease and syndrome surveillance; and\n       (ii) could enable an effective response to a biological \n     event to begin at the earliest possible opportunity;\n       (D) a narrowing of the existing technology gap in disease \n     and syndrome surveillance capabilities, based on reported \n     symptoms, and real-time information dissemination to public \n     health officials; and\n       (E) appropriate communications equipment and information \n     technology to efficiently transmit information and data \n     within national, international regional, and international \n     health networks, including inexpensive, Internet-based \n     Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and relevant telephone-\n     based systems for early recognition and diagnosis of \n     diseases.\n       (11) An effective international capability to detect, \n     monitor, and quickly diagnose infectious disease outbreaks \n     will offer dividends not only in the event of biological \n     weapons development, testing, production, and attack, but \n     also in the more likely cases of naturally occurring \n     infectious disease outbreaks that could threaten the United \n     States. Furthermore, a robust surveillance system will serve \n     to deter, prevent, or contain terrorist use of biological \n     weapons, mitigating the intended effects of such malevolent \n     uses.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are as follows:\n       (1) To provide the United States with an effective and \n     real-time system to detect biological threats that--\n       (A) utilizes classified and unclassified information to \n     detect such threats; and\n       (B) may be utilized by the human or the agricultural \n     domestic disease response community.\n       (2) To enhance the capability of the international \n     community, through the World Health Organization and \n     individual countries, to detect, identify, and contain \n     infectious disease outbreaks, whether the cause of those \n     outbreaks is intentional human action or natural in origin.\n       (3) To enhance the training of public health professionals \n     and epidemiologists from eligible developing countries in \n     advanced Internet-based disease and syndrome surveillance \n     systems, in addition to traditional epidemiology methods, so \n     that such professionals and epidemiologists may better \n     detect, diagnose, and contain infectious disease outbreaks, \n     especially such outbreaks caused by the pathogens that may be \n     likely to be used in a biological weapons attack.\n       (4) To provide assistance to developing countries to \n     purchase appropriate communications equipment and information \n     technology to detect, analyze, and report biological threats, \n     including--\n       (A) relevant computer equipment, Internet connectivity \n     mechanisms, and telephone-based applications to effectively \n     gather, analyze, and transmit public health information for \n     infectious disease surveillance and diagnosis; and\n       (B) appropriate computer equipment and Internet \n     connectivity mechanisms--\n       (i) to facilitate the exchange of Geographic Information \n     Systems-based disease and syndrome surveillance information; \n     and\n       (ii) to effectively gather, analyze, and transmit public \n     health information for infectious disease surveillance and \n     diagnosis.\n       (5) To make available greater numbers of public health \n     professionals who are employed by the Government of the \n     United States to international regional and international \n     health organizations, international regional and \n     international health networks, and United States diplomatic \n     missions, as appropriate.\n       (6) To expand the training and outreach activities of \n     United States laboratories located in foreign countries, \n     including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention or \n     Department of Defense laboratories, to enhance the public \n     health capabilities of developing countries.\n       (7) To provide appropriate technical assistance to existing \n     international regional and international health networks and, \n     as appropriate, seed money for new international regional and \n     international networks.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to provide for response to Hurricane Katrina by \nestablishing a Louisiana Recovery Corporation, providing for housing \nand community rebuilding, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nBanking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I will speak just for a moment about \neach of these important measures. Before I do, I know today has been a \nlong day, and it has been complicated by many procedural votes and a \nseries of bills that we just passed out of here, many important bills. \nOf course, the Defense appropriations, Defense authorization bill, two \nof the major bills that Congress works on throughout the year, and it \nis important we get them through.\n  On the Defense appropriations bill, as it was amended, there was a \nvery important piece for the gulf coast, $29 billion direct relief \npackage. I will speak just for a moment about that because it has \nbearing on what we are going to do in the future when we are faced with \ncatastrophic events.\n  Senator Vitter and I, my colleague from Louisiana, returned to the \nCongress over 4 months ago to try to describe to our colleagues the \ndevastation that occurred with not one but two hurricanes and then \nmultiple levee breaks which have devastated a major American city and a \nregion, the southern part of Louisiana and Mississippi.\n  I have said now on many occasions that FEMA, on its best day, is not \nadequate to address the emergency and enormous needs of the people who \nhave been affected: their need for housing, their need for employment, \ntheir need for capital, their need for emotional security, their need \nfor public infrastructure, their need for police, their need for \nfirefighters, their need for health care, their need for education.\n  I cannot even describe the tremendous angst, anxiety, and despair \nsetting in on many communities in the gulf coast region because help \nhas been slow in coming. And when it has been offered, it has been \ninadequate to address the situation we find ourselves in.\n  I do not know if we have ever considered what needs to be done when \nwe have a catastrophic incident such as we had. So we are going to come \nback after the recess and I hope talk about how FEMA can be \nrestructured, how it can be made to be more efficient, how it can be \nmade to be more accountable, how it can be made to act more quickly. \nBut we are also going to need some additional tools.\n  That is what the two bills address I have introduced tonight as a \ncompanion to a House bill that was introduced and has been worked on \nvery diligently by my colleague Congressman Richard Baker from Baton \nRouge, who is the ranking member on the Banking Committee in the House. \nHe has done some excellent work on this bill and has moved it out of \nthe House committee. It establishes a brand new corporation that can \nstep in. It would be established by appointment by the President and by \nthe Governor, with seven members, to establish a corporation that could \nthen access the capital markets by issuing bonds, to step up and into \nthe gulf coast area to work with our local officials, to work with the \nofficials at the city level, at the parish level, to provide \nopportunities, to provide equity for homeowners who find themselves \nwith homes that are uninhabitable, with mortgages that need to be paid \nand no possible way to sell their property because it is of \nquestionable value, given the situation.\n  We are very fortunate in America that we have not had to face these \ntragedies very often, and this is the first time we faced a tragedy of \nthis magnitude. Mr. President, 275,000 homes destroyed, 10 times the \namount of homes destroyed by Hurricane Andrew in 1992. Mr. President, \n28,000 homes were destroyed in the worst disaster before we faced Rita \nand Katrina. But with 275,000 homes destroyed, clearly, we have to do \nmore than send money through FEMA.\n  Money is not the only answer for the challenges before us. So we need \nnew tools. That is why I have come to the Senate tonight to introduce, \nafter a long day, a bill that was crafted in the House by Congressman \nBaker, amended through input from a variety of his colleagues in the \nHouse, input from myself and some Senators in anticipation of the bill \nmoving over here, and have had a verbal commitment from Senator Shelby, \nthe chairman of the Banking Committee, and very positive comments from \nDemocrats on the Banking Committee that we could have an expedited \nhearing on this bill when we return.\n  Because even with the $29 billion in direct aid that is included in \nthe Defense appropriations bill, I can promise my colleagues, to stand \nup the great city of New Orleans and the region and the gulf coast is \ngoing to take more than FEMA, more than direct aid through community \ndevelopment block grants and aid to our schools and universities and \nhospitals. It is going to take some new tools we are going to have to \ninvent, we are going to have to place into a toolbox and then give out \nto local elected officials, to business leaders, to community \norganizations, to rebuild this great community.\n  But the great opportunity is, if we can invent these tools, and we \ncan design them appropriately, they will then be available for us in \nthe event a catastrophe such as this or something similar strikes \nagain, whether it is an earthquake in San Francisco, massive tornadoes \nin the Midwest or, God forbid, a terror strike that would decimate or \ndestroy a population or vast area such as we are experiencing from a \nhurricane and levee breaks in New Orleans.\n  There is all this work we can do on this housing corporation bill \nwhen we get back. I urge my colleagues' involvement because of the \nextraordinary need, as outlined and expressed so beautifully by Senator \nStevens' remarks toward the end of this evening about how he was so \nemotionally taken aback by what he saw in New Orleans. I can most \ncertainly understand it. Senator Vitter and I have been living that as \nwe have moved through New Orleans and the region and all through south \nLouisiana, and share his view that more has to be done.\n\n  So these two bills that I introduce--one is a companion bill to \nCongressman Baker's bill with some important, I think, improvements or \nimportant amendments. One is to ensure a strong local input through \nlocal advisory committees, appointed by parish governments and \nmunicipalities. Also there is an underlining or emphasis, if you will, \nthat the corporation must comply with State and local planning \nordinances and direction.\n  This Senate version will also increase the potential equity recovery \nfrom 60 percent to 80 percent and will increase the potential cap of \nrecovery from $500,000 to $750,000. We also put something in this bill \nto try to give corporate or commercial property owners some relief.\n  So between the Baker bill in the House, which needs to continue to \nmove through the process, and this bill which will get, hopefully, some \nexpedited hearings when we return, hopefully, we can quickly put into \nthe hands of our communities, our large cities, our suburban areas, our \nrural areas, and individual property owners--who have seen in the last \n4 months everything they have worked for in their life, perhaps even a \nlittle bit they were able to inherit, and all they hoped to pass on to \ntheir children or their grandchildren gone, without a whole lot of \noptions for recovery--assistance.\n  We have every intention to rebuild our city and to rebuild our \nregion. Just as if there were an earthquake in San Francisco, I don't \nthink Congress would suggest that the millions of people who live there \nshould simply pick up and move to New York and abandon the city of San \nFrancisco, we have no intention of abandoning the city of New Orleans. \nWe may lie 5 feet below sea level, but let me assure you, there are \nplaces in this world that are as or more productive than this region \nthat lie 20 feet below sea level and manage their water properly and \ninvest in their civil works properly in a way we could model ourselves \nafter and do very well.\n  The city of New Orleans and the State of Louisiana have contributed \nbillions of dollars to the economy of this Nation and to the general \nfund of\n\n[[Page S14334]]\n\nthis Nation, and we want to continue to do so. We are not asking for a \nhandout but a hand up. We are not asking for charity. We are asking for \na portion of the taxes we pay, a portion of the money we send to the \nnational Government, to be redirected, to give us the security for our \ncoast and our hurricane protection that we warrant and the industries \nthis infrastructure protects warrant for the benefit of not just the \n4.5 million people who live in the State of Louisiana, and the 3 \nmillion-plus people who live in Mississippi, but which protect and \nsupport the almost 300 million people who live in the United States of \nAmerica.\n  So these two bills are very important. I look forward to working on \nthem when we get back.\n  The second bill is a bill where we picked up an idea from the New \nYork situation, 9/11--a terrible situation that is still seared into \nour memory and our collective conscience.\n  There were some real problems with housing following the destruction \nof that neighborhood. This second bill I have introduced would allow \nFEMA to extend some of their rental and housing programs to give some \nimmediate help to families who find themselves unable to recover their \nequity for whatever reason out of the houses they have that are \nuninhabitable but who have to find a decent place to live so they can \nrebuild and regroup. That bill will address that situation.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nthat will help ensure beneficiaries who are eligible for both Medicare \nand Medicaid, the so-called ``dual-eligibles,'' make a smooth and \nsuccessful transition from Medicaid prescription drug coverage to \nMedicare Part D.\n  The 6.4 million seniors and disabled Americans who are dually \neligible are the most vulnerable members of an already vulnerable \npopulation. They are the poorest of the elderly, with incomes of less \nthan $10,000 per year. And they are the sickest of the elderly, with \napproximately 25 percent residing in a long-term care facility. They \nhave significant health care needs, have often been diagnosed with \nmultiple chronic conditions, and are in greatest danger of being \naffected by poor implementation of Medicare's new prescription drug \nbenefit.\n  On November 15, beneficiaries began signing up for Medicare Part D \nprescription drug plans, and on January 1, the drug benefit actually \nbegins. But this date does not only mark the beginning of a new \nMedicare drug benefit. For the 6.4 million dual eligibles, January 1 is \nalso the day that they stop receiving a Medicaid drug benefit.\n  I voted against the Medicare bill when it was before the Senate in \n2003 and we are all well aware of the many flaws and shortcomings: the \ninsurance company slush fund, the ``donut hole,'' the prohibition on \nthe Government negotiating for lower drug costs and on the safe \nimportation of prescription medications, among others.\n  But the short timeframe in which dual eligibles have to complete this \ntransition is one of the most worrisome.\n  There are only 6 weeks between the time when seniors began signing up \nfor the new drug plans, and the date when Medicaid coverage ceases. \nThat means that dual eligibles--the poorest and sickest portion of the \nMedicare population--have very little time in which to accurately \nbalance the benefits and drawbacks of their prescription drug plan \nchoices.\n  We're giving most seniors 6 months to consider their options of a \nprescription drug plan, but we're giving the most vulnerable only 6 \nweeks.\n  While it would be my preference that the existence of a Medicaid drug \nbenefit be extended beyond January 1 to provide adequate time for the \ntransition, Republicans in Congress have blocked legislation that would \ndo this, leaving these individuals without coverage if their transition \nfrom Medicaid to Medicare doesn't happen before the end of the year.\n  In response to the concern over the short implementation period, CMS \nannounced that it will automatically enroll dual eligibles in a \nrandomly chosen prescription drug plan by January 1, 2006.\n  CMS reports that at the end of November they had automatically \nenrolled over 5 million of the 6.4 million dually eligible \nbeneficiaries in a Medicare Part D plan. But this leaves more than 1 \nmillion of our poorest and sickest vulnerable to falling through the \ncracks if they are not enrolled in a Medicare Part D plan in the next \nseveral weeks.\n  CMS Administrator Mark McClellan has himself said that some dual \neligibles may not be auto-enrolled before January 1, when their \nMedicaid drug benefit ceases to exist. In fact, if CMS is able to auto-\nenroll 95 percent of all dual eligibles, more than 300,000 would still \nbe left without prescription drug coverage and access to critical \nmedications. At 98 percent enrollment, almost 130,000 would be left \nwithout coverage. These are unacceptable numbers.\n  In light of growing concern that some dual eligible beneficiaries \nwill arrive at their pharmacy counter on January 1 without coverage, \nCMS has announced a procedure to allow pharmacies to fill the \nprescription and a contractor to follow up with the beneficiary to \nfacilitate enrollment in a Part D plan.\n  While I am glad that CMS has taken this step, I am concerned that \npharmacies will not be aware of this option and some beneficiaries will \nstill fall through the cracks.\n  In addition, pharmacies will be charged a transaction fee if they use \nthis procedure and electronically inquire about the status of a \nbeneficiary that comes to their pharmacy counter and isn't sure what \ncoverage they have or if they have coverage at all.\n  The legislation I am introducing today aims to address this problem. \nThe Medicare Dual Eligible Identification and Enrollment Facilitation \nAct would require outreach and education to pharmacies, particularly \nindependent pharmacies, and a hold harmless provision for transaction \nfees that pharmacies incur when they use this procedure.\n  It is critical that we do everything we can to ensure that our most \nvulnerable seniors do not fall through the cracks and the pharmacies \nacross the country are now our last line of defense. Helping them help \nthese beneficiaries and eliminating fees they incur for doing so are \nsimple but critical steps we should take to ensure that not a single \ndual eligible beneficiary is left without prescription drug coverage.\n  I urge speedy passage of the Medicare Dual Eligible Identification \nand Enrollment Facilitation Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KENNEDY (for himself, Mr. Rockefeller, and Mr. Reid):\n  S. 2175.

the Parliament of \n     Croatia, Ratko Gajica, Milorad Pupovac, and Vojislav \n     Stanimirovic, who represent the Serb minority, sent a letter \n     to the Assistant to the President for National Security \n     Affairs, Stephen Hadley, expressing their support for the \n     Prime Minister of Croatia, Ivo Sanader, and for Croatia's \n     path toward membership in the European Union and in the North \n     Atlantic Treaty Organization (``NATO'');\n       Whereas Croatia has shown dedication to advancing the \n     return, reconstruction, and restitution of property in \n     Croatia;\n       Whereas Croatia has proven to be a reliable partner of the \n     United States in seeking the stabilization of the region;\n       Whereas Croatia participated in the Iraq International \n     Conference held in Brussels on June 22, 2005, and offered to \n     train and educate nationals of Iraq at universities in \n     Croatia;\n       Whereas Croatia is taking part in the training of Iraqi \n     security forces at the International Training Center in \n     Jordan and has offered to train additional security personnel \n     for Iraq in Croatia;\n       Whereas Croatia has been a partner in the war against \n     terrorism, sent troops to Afghanistan as part of the NATO-led \n     International Security Assistance Force in support of the war \n     against terrorism in 2002, and has provided civilians to \n     staff the Provincial Reconstruction Team under the leadership \n     of NATO in Fayzabad;\n       Whereas, during July 2005, Croatia adopted a decision to \n     triple its military presence in the International Security \n     Assistance Force;\n       Whereas Croatia has endorsed and is participating in the \n     Proliferation Security Initiative with like-minded nations \n     across the world to prevent the flow of weapons of mass \n     destruction, missile systems, and related material;\n       Whereas, on June 1, 2005, Croatia was the fourth nation to \n     sign the Proliferation Security Initiative Shipboarding \n     Agreement with the United States to prevent the maritime \n     transfer of dangerous shipments of weapons or other illicit \n     materials to keep such weapons and materials out of the hands \n     of dangerous actors and terrorists;\n       Whereas, since Croatia has become an independent country, \n     the United States has shown support for Croatia in many ways, \n     including by providing Croatia with economic and military \n     assistance that has contributed significantly to the progress \n     and continued success occurring in Croatia;\n       Whereas the United States has encouraged Croatia's \n     transformation and the future membership of Croatia in NATO;\n       Whereas a whole and free Europe cannot be fully achieved \n     without the integration into NATO of all countries that share \n     the common values of democracy, the rule of law, and respect \n     for human rights;\n       Whereas the Membership Action Plan developed for NATO, \n     which was launched in April 1999, is a program of assistance \n     that provides both goals and a roadmap for countries aspiring \n     to membership in NATO;\n       Whereas Croatia was invited into the Membership Action Plan \n     in May 2002 and has made substantial progress toward the \n     achievement of the reforms required for receiving an \n     invitation to start accession talks with NATO;\n       Whereas the United States, Croatia, Albania, and Macedonia \n     are signatories to the United States-Adriatic Charter for \n     Partnership, which promotes Euro-Atlantic integration and \n     commits the signatory nations to the values and principles of \n     NATO and to membership in NATO at the earliest possible time;\n       Whereas Croatia supports regional cooperation as a means of \n     bringing stability to Europe, particularly Southeast Europe, \n     and has cooperated with the countries that neighbor Croatia \n     to promote such stability, including providing technical and \n     other assistance to countries that seek membership in the \n     European Union;\n       Whereas, on October 3, 2005, the European Union decided to \n     open accession negotiations with Croatia based on the \n     assessment of the European Union's Council of Ministers that \n     Croatia met the political and economic criteria for candidacy \n     in the European Union, including that Croatia was fully \n     cooperating with the International Criminal Tribunal for the \n     former Yugoslavia;\n       Whereas the cooperation between the Government of Croatia \n     and the Tribunal improved significantly under Prime Minister \n     Ivo Sanader;\n       Whereas, since November 2003, Croatia has handed over to \n     the Tribunal eleven individuals indicted for war crimes;\n       Whereas the cooperation of the Government of Croatia with \n     the Tribunal assisted in the arrest of Ante Gotovina on \n     December 8, 2005, in Spain and his transfer to the Tribunal \n     on December 10, 2005;\n       Whereas the success of the Government of Croatia in \n     bringing war criminals to justice demonstrates the commitment \n     of the Government to move Croatia toward a brighter future of \n     peace, stability, and prosperity for its people; and\n       Whereas Croatia shares the common interests and values of \n     the free and democratic world: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That--\n       (1) since the Republic of Croatia became an independent \n     country, the Government and people of Croatia have made \n     significant progress in strengthening democratic \n     institutions, respect for human rights, and the rule of law \n     in Croatia;\n       (2) Croatia's membership in the North Atlantic Treaty \n     Organization (``NATO'') would contribute to stability in \n     Southeast Europe;\n       (3) it is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (A) the Government and people of Croatia should be \n     commended for their progress on protecting minority rights in \n     Croatia, progress toward achieving the political, economic, \n     military, and other requirements of NATO's Membership Action \n     Plan, contribution to the International Security Assistance \n     Force and the war against terrorism, and for their \n     constructive participation the Proliferation Security \n     Initiative and in the United States-Adriatic Charter;\n       (B) the Government of Croatia should be commended for its \n     cooperation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the \n     former Yugoslavia which led to the apprehension and transfer \n     of several individuals indicted for war crimes, including \n     Ante Gotovina, to the Tribunal;\n       (C) the Government of Croatia should continue its \n     cooperation with the Tribunal;\n       (D) the Government of Croatia should continue and \n     strengthen its role as a partner on nonproliferation and its \n     support in the war against terrorism and in Iraq;\n       (E) the Government of Croatia should continue its efforts \n     to implement defense reforms; and\n       (F) the Government of the United States should continue and \n     increase its defense and security cooperation with the \n     Government of Croatia, including through education, training, \n     and technical cooperation, to assist Croatia in the reform \n     process and in fulfilling its requirements for membership in \n     NATO; and\n       (4) upon complete satisfaction of the criteria for NATO \n     membership, in accordance with NATO's guidelines, Croatia \n     should be invited to be a full member of NATO at the earliest \n     possible date.\n\n

Mr. President, we have a lot to do in wrapup tonight. As \nwe get those papers ready and bring the year to a close, I want to look \nback over what we have been able to accomplish and then look ahead at \nwhat we can expect.\n  In a letter to John Adams in September 1817, Thomas Jefferson, our \nthird President, wrote:\n\n       A morsel of genuine history is a thing so rare as to be \n     always valuable.\n\n  This past year has presented far more than a morsel. We have been \nwitness to an abundance of extraordinary historic milestones, from the \nIraqi elections and Lebanon's cedar revolution, the selection of a new \nPope in Rome, and a new Chief Justice to lead the Supreme Court to the \noutpouring of generosity for the American people, first for the tsunami \nsurvivors, and then to their fellow citizens on the gulf coast.\n  Mr. President, 2005 has been a year of outsize events.\n  I commend to my colleagues an article that appeared in Sunday's \nWashington Post. It was on the continuing success of the Army in \nreenlisting our GIs. It appeared on A-27 entitled ``GIs in Iraq \nChoosing to Re-up.''\n  Across Iraq, U.S. soldiers on the front lines are reenlisting by the \nthousands. Since 2001, the Army has surpassed its retention targets by \nwider and wider margins each year. Conjuring up vivid scenes of daring \nand service, the Post reports that:\n\n       On palace rooftops and pockmarked streets, GIs are \n     reenlisting in rituals that range from dramatic to harrowing. \n     Soldiers have taken the oath in gaudy former residences of \n     Saddam Hussein and in the spider hole near Tikrit where the \n     gray-bearded fugitive was captured in December of 2003 . . .\n       Despite the risks and long months away from home, many \n     soldiers . . . say serving in Iraq gives them a powerful \n     sense of purpose.\n\n  So during this holiday season, I ask every American to offer their \nprayers, to offer their thanks to these brave young men and women who \nare risking their lives in far away lands to protect us and to provide \nus security.\n  I am gratified by the passage of the Defense appropriations bill \ntonight. This important legislation helps ensure that our armed \nservices will receive the resources and authorities they need to \nprotect America. From delivering advanced technologies to improving \npersonnel protection, this bill delivers crucial support for our \ncourageous men and women in uniform.\n  While our troops are protecting us abroad, the PATRIOT Act is \nprotecting us here at home. Tonight we passed a 6-month extension to \nthis critical legislation. By unanimously and in a bipartisan way \nagreeing to a 6-month extension, the Senate reaffirmed that the PATRIOT \nAct is one of our most important tools in the war on terror both now \nand into the future.\n  Yes, we need to improve that act and, yes, no longer can we tolerate \nobstruction to that improvement of the act, but in a bipartisan way we \ncame together tonight to say that despite a lot of passions and \nstatements that we could rise above it, put forth a 6-month extension, \nand then hopefully be able to address and improve the PATRIOT Act.\n  It has been an intense and productive year for the Senate. We were \nable to meet many of our goals to deliver meaningful solutions to the \nneeds, wants, and desires of the American people. Strength and security \nthroughout were our guiding principles. We rolled up our shirt sleeves \nand tackled a number of fundamental structural issues that were driving \nup gas prices, that were inhibiting and constricting innovation, and \nthat were threatening America's security.\n  To strengthen America's economic security, we passed a sweeping \ndeficit reduction bill today that for the first time in 8 years cuts \nthe growth of mandatory spending. This was a huge victory for the \nAmerican people. It was a huge victory for fiscal responsibility. It \nwas a victory for the American taxpayer. It shows that we are serious \nas a body about fiscal restraint, about cutting out wasteful Washington \nspending. Because of these critical reforms, America will be in a \nstronger position to meet our obligations, especially to the baby \nboomers who, as we all know, are just beginning to retire, especially \nto that doubling of the seniors in our population today, especially to \nthe workforce who will be supporting those seniors in the years to \ncome.\n  This year, we also passed a tax cut extension. We also passed an \nenergy bill, a major highway bill. We addressed free trade through the \nCentral American Free Trade Act. We addressed pensions. Just today, we \npassed SMART grants, which actually give up to $8,000 over 2 years to \ndisadvantaged or low-income students, to Pell-income students, to \nencourage them to major in math, science, and engineering, those fields \nwhich we know are important to job creation in the future.\n  By facing these issues head on, by responding to them, by \nlegislating, we are making America less dependent on foreign oil, more \nprepared to compete with India and China in that global marketplace. We \nhelped rebuild that infrastructure to support and promote our economic \ngrowth.\n  We also addressed a problem that has been hanging over the small \nbusiness community and the courts for years--the litigation lottery \nlawsuit abuse. We all know that frivolous litigation has been driving \nup health care costs. It\n\n[[Page S14397]]\n\nhas been driving up consumer prices for everything from toothpaste to \nblue jeans. It has been clogging our courts. It has been making our \nhealth care more expensive, and that drives people to the ranks of the \nuninsured. It generally wastes our taxpayer dollars, taxpayer dollars \nthat can be spent more productively.\n  For years, Republicans have fought for reform, have talked reform, \nbut in this Congress we have delivered on litigation reform, on lawsuit \nabuse reform. We passed class action reform. We passed bankruptcy \nreform. We passed gun manufacturing liability reform. That is three \nreforms in terms of liability. Tonight, just a few hours ago, we passed \nvery targeted vaccine manufacturing protections in emergency situations \nto make America safer, to help rebuild that manufacturing capacity \nwhich has been decimated over the past 20 years. This brings fairness \nto our system. This brings rationality to the system. This slows down \nthe litigation lottery that injects inequities into our system. As a \nresult, appropriate compensation will go to the people who really need \nit. Those resources which are wasted and which are taken out of the \nsystem are directed to those people who do deserve appropriately to be \ncompensated. These are the economic issues.\n  At the same time we were addressing those economic issues, we also \ncontinued to focus on securing our homeland, focusing on our homeland \nsecurity, strengthening our national security.\n  Earlier this year, I had the opportunity to travel in part as a \nSenator but in larger part probably as a physician to Sri Lanka, where \nI had the chance to witness the devastation that occurred as a result \nof that natural tsunami disaster. In the wake of that particular \ndisaster, in this body we passed a generous relief package that helped \nthe victims recover and rebuild. This critical help paid immediate \ndividends in lives saved and--we cannot dismiss this--it helped improve \nthe way others around the world look at us. They recognize America's \ngood will. They recognize America's compassion. I say this because I \nthink it particularly is important among Muslims in Southeast Asia.\n  Likewise, our outpouring of aid and assistance to Pakistan following \ntheir earthquake disaster has significantly improved our standing in \nthat country.\n  Disaster, as we all know, unfortunately, was a dominant thing \nthroughout 2005, and here at home we were hit through Katrina and Rita \nby the worst natural disaster in the history of this country. Hundreds \nof thousands of residents across Alabama, Louisiana, and Mississippi \nwere flooded from their homes. Katrina devastated 90,000 square miles. \nThat is an area larger than the United Kingdom.\n  A few hours ago, on the Senate floor, Senator Stevens was recounting \nhis experiences having spent several days along that gulf coast. About \n3 to 4 days after the levees broke in New Orleans, I, too, had the \nopportunity to be in the airport as patients were being brought in and \npeople were being evacuated out of New Orleans. I had the opportunity \nto talk to people on stretchers who 3 days before had homes that they \nhad been in for 30, 40, 50 years. Those homes were totally washed away \nand destroyed with all of their belongings. Whole towns were washed \naway.\n\n  We traveled also on the first trip, as well as the second trip, to \nAlabama and to Mississippi, along that entire gulf coast. One can see \nthe utter catastrophe of that coast, inland for miles. The Senate \nimmediately set to work providing aid, relief, and support, and that \ncontinued tonight.\n  We passed numerous measures to help people get up off the ground and \nto get their boots back on the ground and be able to reestablish some \nelement of normalcy and also to support the rebuilding efforts that \nhave begun, that will result in renewal we all know will continue long \ninto the future.\n  Tonight, as part of the Defense appropriations bill, we passed $29 \nbillion in Hurricanes Katrina and Rita relief. We will continue to work \nhard to help the citizens of the gulf coast rebuild, renew, and restore \ntheir communities in the days ahead, in the weeks and months ahead, \nand, indeed, in the years ahead. The American people stand firmly \nbehind their neighbors in the gulf region.\n  We also took action tonight to prepare for another potential disaster \nthat is waiting to happen, and that is the threat of avian flu. We do \nnot know if avian flu is going to become transmissible from one person \nto another person to another, but what we do know is that it is a novel \nvirus. It is a new virus. It is very similar to that virus of 1918 \nwhich we know killed about 50,000 people--actually killed about 30 \nmillion to 40 million people worldwide and half a million people in \nthis country.\n  We know that novel virus we do not have any immunity to. We don't \nhave any natural immunity to it. We know with that novel virus today, \nthat people who have been infected have a 50-percent mortality rate. \nOne out of every two people we know were infected with that virus died. \nWe know that virus has jumped to other species. It jumped from avian or \nbirds that it starts in, to cats, and from cats we know that it has \njumped to humans. We know that 5 million--20 million birds died, and \n100 million, now 200 million birds died, and it started in southeast \nAsia and is now moving across to eastern Europe. We do not know if it \nis going to become a pandemic, but what we do know is we are \nunprepared. We know it is fast moving.\n  The Congressional Budget Office study the other day said if that \nvirus does become transmissible, and if it has the same fatality rate \nand prevalence rate as that virus in 1918, the so-called Spanish flu, \nthe economic impact on this country could be as high as $675 billion.\n  The good news is we know if we become prepared, we can reduce that \nmarkedly, and we can save lives. But we are unprepared today. How do we \nrespond? Again, about 2 hours ago we put in money, additional \nresources, and we put in appropriate targeted liability protections to \nhelp build our manufacturing base, and we added an element of \ncompensation in the event that somebody was inadvertently hurt in some \nway by a vaccine or a countermeasure that was necessary in emergency \nsituations, they could seek and receive compensation.\n  We are going to be better prepared as a product of this. Whether it \nis in the next 5 weeks, 5 months, or 5 years, we will be able to look \nour constituents in the eye and tell them that we did the right thing \non December 21, 2005, and that help, indeed, is on the way.\n  Our Nation is a large nation. It is a diverse and a vibrant nation. \nTo meet all of these challenges before us, we need a sound government, \na strong government, an efficient government that meets its basic \nobligations. Here, too, we have acted this year. We made progress. We \nneed a government that is smart, that is efficient, that is effective; \na government that works for the people and respects the taxpayers' \nhard-earned dollar. To that end, this year we passed a budget \nresolution. What is remarkable--but I am sure doesn't sound remarkable \nto people across America who are viewing tonight--is the fact that we \npassed all 12 appropriations bills, our spending bills, one by one, \nindividually, across the floor of the Senate.\n  It is almost embarrassing that we have to say that is a great \nachievement, but indeed in this body it is a tremendous achievement \nthat has not been achieved in years. We passed the Health and Human \nServices bill a couple of hours ago, the 12th of those bills. These are \nthe bills that ensure that Government is carrying out its most basic \nfunction: to protect and serve the American people and to do so in a \nfiscally responsible way.\n  This year we were also able to overcome partisan obstruction, which \nwas very frustrating, which continued for about 2\\1/2\\, almost 3 years. \nWe were able to overcome the judicial obstruction, this partisan \nobstruction, and indeed successfully confirm eight Federal judges who \nhad previously been obstructed, who had previously been filibustered. \nThese judges now are serving America proudly. They allow our courts to \nbe able to function at full capacity and thus provide the justice that \nhad been lacking because of not being able to fill those seats.\n  Of course, this fall we had the privilege of confirming a new Chief \nJustice to the Supreme Court; a man all of us have gotten to know, the \neminently qualified and highly respected Justice John Roberts.\n  All of this is just a partial accounting of the work that we were \nable to do\n\n[[Page S14398]]\n\nthis year to strengthen America, to move us forward, to strengthen our \neconomic security, to strengthen our national security. In the new \nyear, we are going to have a lot of challenges. We have a lot to \naccomplish over the next year. But I am absolutely confident that by \nkeeping our eye on the ball, by staying focused, by working together in \na bipartisan way we will be able to continue to cut bureaucratic \nredtape, to have more efficient Government, to demonstrate more fiscal \nrestraint, to lower Government spending, to support our troops in the \nfield, and to promote policies that will make America safer and more \nprosperous and healthier and stronger.\n  I extend my warm wishes to my colleagues for a joyous holiday season. \nThe holidays also are an opportunity to gather with loved ones, to \ncherish achievements, and to recommit ourselves to the challenges that \nlay ahead. May we all find strength and renewal in this season, and may \nwe all allow the good will which warms our homes during the holidays to \nbe shared with others--our families, our friends, our neighbors--\nthroughout the year to come.\n  To our colleagues, to our staff, to the pages who are here tonight, \nthe colleagues who hopefully are at home and in bed now, to the press \ncorps who has been so actively covering us up until about 15 or 20 \nminutes ago and are probably writing their stories right now, I wish \nyou all happy holidays, and to all a very Merry Fristmas.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Global Pathogen Surveillance \n     Act of 2005''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS; PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The frequency of the occurrence of biological events \n     that could threaten the national security of the United \n     States has increased and is likely increasing. The threat to \n     the United States from such events includes threats from \n     diseases that infect humans, animals, or plants regardless of \n     if such diseases are introduced naturally, accidentally, or \n     intentionally.\n       (2) The United States lacks an effective and real-time \n     system to detect, identify, contain, and respond to global \n     threats and also lacks an effective mechanism to disseminate \n     information to the national response community if such \n     threats arise.\n       (3) Bioterrorism poses a grave national security threat to \n     the United States. The insidious nature of a bioterrorist \n     attack, the likelihood that the recognition of such an attack \n     would be delayed, and the underpreparedness of the domestic \n     public health infrastructure to respond to such an attack \n     could result in catastrophic consequences following a \n     biological weapons attack against the United States.\n       (4) The ability to recognize that a country or organization \n     is carrying out a covert biological weapons programs is \n     dependent on a number of indications and warnings. A critical \n     component of this recognition is the timely detection of \n     sentinel events such as laboratory accidents and community-\n     level outbreaks that could be the earliest indication of an \n     emerging bioterrorist program in a foreign country. Early \n     detection of such events may enable earlier \n     counterproliferation intervention.\n       (5) A contagious pathogen engineered as a biological weapon \n     and developed, tested, produced, or released in a foreign \n     country could quickly spread to the United States. \n     Considering the realities of international travel, trade, and \n     migration patterns, a dangerous pathogen appearing naturally, \n     accidentally, or intentionally anywhere in the world can \n     spread to the United States in a matter of days, before any \n     effective quarantine or isolation measures could be \n     implemented.\n       (6) To combat bioterrorism effectively and ensure that the \n     United States is fully prepared to prevent, recognize, and \n     contain a biological weapons attack, or emerging infectious \n     disease, measures to strengthen the domestic public health \n     infrastructure and improve domestic event detection, \n     surveillance, and response, while absolutely essential, are \n     not sufficient.\n       (7) The United States should enhance cooperation with the \n     World Health Organization, regional international health \n     organizations, and individual countries, including data \n     sharing with appropriate agencies and departments of the \n     United States, to help detect and quickly contain infectious \n     disease outbreaks or a bioterrorism agent before such a \n     disease or agent is spread.\n       (8) The World Health Organization has done an impressive \n     job in monitoring infectious disease outbreaks around the \n     world, particularly with the establishment in April 2000 of \n     the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network.\n       (9) The capabilities of the World Health Organization \n     depend on the quality of the data and information the \n     Organization receives from the countries that are members of \n     the Organization and is further limited by the narrow list of \n     diseases (such as plague, cholera, and yellow fever) on which \n     such surveillance and monitoring is based and by the \n     consensus process used by the Organization to add new \n     diseases to the list. Developing countries, in particular, \n     often are unable to devote the necessary resources to build \n     and maintain public health infrastructures.\n       (10) In particular, developing countries could benefit \n     from--\n       (A) better trained public health professionals and \n     epidemiologists to recognize disease patterns;\n       (B) appropriate laboratory equipment for diagnosis of \n     pathogens;\n       (C) disease reporting systems that--\n       (i) are based on disease and syndrome surveillance; and\n       (ii) could enable an effective response to a biological \n     event to begin at the earliest possible opportunity;\n       (D) a narrowing of the existing technology gap in disease \n     and syndrome surveillance capabilities, based on reported \n     symptoms, and real-time information dissemination to public \n     health officials; and\n       (E) appropriate communications equipment and information \n     technology to efficiently transmit information and data \n     within national, international regional, and international \n     health networks, including inexpensive, Internet-based \n     Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and relevant telephone-\n     based systems for early recognition and diagnosis of \n     diseases.\n       (11) An effective international capability to detect, \n     monitor, and quickly diagnose infectious disease outbreaks \n     will offer dividends not only in the event of biological \n     weapons development, testing, production, and attack, but \n     also in the more likely cases of naturally occurring \n     infectious disease outbreaks that could threaten the United \n     States. Furthermore, a robust surveillance system will serve \n     to deter, prevent, or contain terrorist use of biological \n     weapons, mitigating the intended effects of such malevolent \n     uses.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are as follows:\n       (1) To provide the United States with an effective and \n     real-time system to detect biological threats that--\n       (A) utilizes classified and unclassified information to \n     detect such threats; and\n       (B) may be utilized by the human or the agricultural \n     domestic disease response community.\n       (2) To enhance the capability of the international \n     community, through the World Health Organization and \n     individual countries, to detect, identify, and contain \n     infectious disease outbreaks, whether the cause of those \n     outbreaks is intentional human action or natural in origin.\n       (3) To enhance the training of public health professionals \n     and epidemiologists from eligible developing countries in \n     advanced Internet-based disease and syndrome surveillance \n     systems, in addition to traditional epidemiology methods, so \n     that such professionals and epidemiologists may better \n     detect, diagnose, and contain infectious disease outbreaks, \n     especially such outbreaks\n\n[[Page S14400]]\n\n     caused by the pathogens that may be likely to be used in a \n     biological weapons attack.\n       (4) To provide assistance to developing countries to \n     purchase appropriate communications equipment and information \n     technology to detect, analyze, and report biological threats, \n     including--\n       (A) relevant computer equipment, Internet connectivity \n     mechanisms, and telephone-based applications to effectively \n     gather, analyze, and transmit public health information for \n     infectious disease surveillance and diagnosis; and\n       (B) appropriate computer equipment and Internet \n     connectivity mechanisms--\n       (i) to facilitate the exchange of Geographic Information \n     Systems-based disease and syndrome surveillance information; \n     and\n       (ii) to effectively gather, analyze, and transmit public \n     health information for infectious disease surveillance and \n     diagnosis.\n       (5) To make available greater numbers of public health \n     professionals who are employed by the Government of the \n     United States to international regional and international \n     health organizations, international regional and \n     international health networks, and United States diplomatic \n     missions, as appropriate.\n       (6) To expand the training and outreach activities of \n     United States laboratories located in foreign countries, \n     including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention or \n     Department of Defense laboratories, to enhance the public \n     health capabilities of developing countries.\n       (7) To provide appropriate technical assistance to existing \n     international regional and international health networks and, \n     as appropriate, seed money for new international regional and \n     international networks.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Res. 342\n\n       Whereas the United States recognized the Republic of \n     Croatia on April 7, 1992, acknowledging the decision of the \n     people of Croatia to live in an independent, democratic, and \n     sovereign country;\n       Whereas since achieving their independence, the people of \n     Croatia have dedicated themselves to building a functioning \n     democratic society, based on the rule of law, respect for \n     human rights, and a free market economy;\n       Whereas Croatia has made progress in judicial reform and \n     has adopted a judicial reform strategy;\n       Whereas Croatia has demonstrated a desire to protect \n     minority rights and promote a viable multiethnic society;\n       Whereas, in 2002, Croatia adopted the Constitutional Law on \n     the Rights of National Minorities, ensuring the \n     representation of minorities in the Parliament of Croatia and \n     the establishment of the councils of national minorities;\n       Whereas the Government of Croatia has concluded specific \n     bilateral agreements on the protection of minority rights \n     with Hungary, Italy, and Serbia and Montenegro and has \n     concluded an agreement on cooperation with representatives of \n     the Independent Democratic Serb Party in the Parliament of \n     Croatia;\n       Whereas three prominent members of the Parliament of \n     Croatia, Ratko Gajica, Milorad Pupovac, and Vojislav \n     Stanimirovic, who represent the Serb minority, sent a letter \n     to the Assistant to the President for National Security \n     Affairs, Stephen Hadley, expressing their support for the \n     Prime Minister of Croatia, Ivo Sanader, and for Croatia's \n     path toward membership in the European Union and in the North \n     Atlantic Treaty Organization (``NATO'');\n       Whereas Croatia has shown dedication to advancing the \n     return, reconstruction, and restitution of property in \n     Croatia;\n       Whereas Croatia has proven to be a reliable partner of the \n     United States in seeking the stabilization of the region;\n       Whereas Croatia participated in the Iraq International \n     Conference held in

forces at the International Training Center in \n     Jordan and has offered to train additional security personnel \n     for Iraq in Croatia;\n       Whereas Croatia has been a partner in the war against \n     terrorism, sent troops to Afghanistan as part of the NATO-led \n     International Security Assistance Force in support of the war \n     against terrorism in 2002, and has provided civilians to \n     staff the Provincial Reconstruction Team under the leadership \n     of NATO in Fayzabad;\n       Whereas, during July 2005, Croatia adopted a decision to \n     triple its

nations \n     across the world to prevent the flow of weapons of mass \n     destruction, missile systems, and related material;\n       Whereas, on June 1, 2005, Croatia was the fourth nation to \n     sign the Proliferation Security Initiative Shipboarding \n     Agreement with the United States to prevent the maritime \n     transfer of dangerous shipments of weapons or other illicit \n     materials to keep such weapons and materials out of the hands \n     of dangerous actors and terrorists;\n       Whereas, since Croatia has become an independent country, \n     the United States has shown support for Croatia in many ways, \n     including by providing Croatia with economic and military \n     assistance that has contributed significantly to the progress \n     and continued success occurring in Croatia;\n       Whereas the United States has encouraged Croatia's \n     transformation and the future membership of Croatia in NATO;\n       Whereas a whole and free Europe cannot be fully achieved \n     without the integration into NATO of all countries that share \n     the common values of democracy, the rule of law, and respect \n     for human rights;\n       Whereas the Membership Action Plan developed for NATO, \n     which was launched in April 1999, is a program of assistance \n     that provides both goals and a roadmap for countries aspiring \n     to membership in NATO;\n       Whereas Croatia was invited into the Membership Action Plan \n     in May 2002 and has made substantial progress toward the \n     achievement of the reforms required for receiving an \n     invitation to start accession talks with NATO;\n       Whereas the United States, Croatia, Albania, and Macedonia \n     are signatories to the United States-Adriatic Charter

time;\n\n[[Page S14403]]\n\n       Whereas Croatia supports regional cooperation as a means of \n     bringing stability to Europe, particularly Southeast Europe, \n     and has cooperated with the countries that neighbor Croatia \n     to promote such stability, including providing technical and \n     other assistance to countries that seek membership in the \n     European Union;\n       Whereas, on October 3, 2005, the European Union decided to \n     open accession negotiations with Croatia based on the \n     assessment of the European Union's Council of Ministers that \n     Croatia met the political and economic criteria for candidacy \n     in the European Union, including that Croatia was fully \n     cooperating with the International Criminal Tribunal for the \n     former Yugoslavia;\n       Whereas the cooperation between the Government of Croatia \n     and the Tribunal improved significantly under Prime Minister \n     Ivo Sanader;\n       Whereas, since November 2003, Croatia has handed over to \n     the Tribunal eleven individuals indicted for war crimes;\n       Whereas the cooperation of the Government of Croatia with \n     the Tribunal assisted in the arrest of Ante Gotovina on \n     December 8, 2005, in Spain and his transfer to the Tribunal \n     on December 10, 2005;\n       Whereas the success of the Government of Croatia in \n     bringing war criminals to justice demonstrates the commitment \n     of the Government to move Croatia toward a brighter future of \n     peace, stability, and prosperity for its people; and\n       Whereas Croatia shares the common interests and values of \n     the free and democratic world: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That--\n       (1) since the Republic of Croatia became an independent \n     country, the Government and people of Croatia have made \n     significant progress in strengthening democratic \n     institutions, respect for human rights, and the rule of law \n     in Croatia;\n       (2) Croatia's membership in the North Atlantic Treaty \n     Organization (``NATO'') would contribute to stability in \n     Southeast Europe;\n       (3) it is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (A) the Government and people of Croatia should be \n     commended for their progress on protecting minority rights in \n     Croatia, progress toward achieving the political, economic, \n     military, and other requirements of NATO's Membership Action \n     Plan, contribution to the International Security Assistance \n     Force and the war against terrorism, and for their \n     constructive participation the Proliferation Security \n     Initiative and in the United States-Adriatic Charter;\n       (B) the Government of Croatia should be commended for its \n     cooperation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the \n     former Yugoslavia which led to the apprehension and transfer \n     of several individuals indicted for war crimes, including \n     Ante Gotovina, to the Tribunal;\n       (C) the Government of Croatia should continue its \n     cooperation with the Tribunal;\n       (D) the Government of Croatia should continue and \n     strengthen its role as a partner on nonproliferation and its \n     support in the war against terrorism and in Iraq;\n       (E) the Government of Croatia should continue its efforts \n     to implement defense reforms; and\n       (F) the Government of the United States should continue and \n     increase its defense and security cooperation with the \n     Government of Croatia, including through education, training, \n     and technical cooperation, to assist Croatia in the reform \n     process and in fulfilling its requirements for membership in \n     NATO; and\n       (4) upon complete satisfaction of the criteria for NATO \n     membership, in accordance with NATO's guidelines, Croatia \n     should be invited to be a full member of NATO at the earliest \n     possible date.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/12/21/senate-section/article/S14403-1", "month":

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of the conference report to \naccompany S. 1281, the NASA authorization bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senate will proceed to the consideration \nof the conference report.\n  (The conference report is printed in the House Proceedings of the \nRecord of December 18, 2005.)\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, last Friday, when I spoke to my \ncolleagues about the NASA authorization bill, the Senate, in the press \nof other business at the end of the session, was unable to take up the \nconference report on S. 1281, the National Aeronautics and Space \nAdministration Authorization Act of 2005. Since then, the House of \nRepresentatives has adopted the report under suspension of the rules, \ndemonstrating wide support for the compromise bill. I am very pleased \nthat the Senate is now poised to approve the conference report as well.\n  I want to thank my ranking member on the Science and Space \nSubcommittee, Senator Nelson of Florida, for all his help. Chairman \nStevens and Senator Inouye were active participants throughout this \nprocess, and I certainly appreciate their efforts. Senator Lott was a \nkey member of the Senate team that has brought us to this point.\n  My subcommittee staff, Jeff Bingham and Tom Cremins, and Senator \nNelson's staff, Jean Toal Eisen and Chan Lieu, work so well together \nand have done so much to bring us to this point, and I want to say \nthank you to them.\n  When President Bush announced a new Vision for Space Exploration in \nJanuary of 2004, he was not simply describing a new mission for NASA; \nhe was describing a pathway to a future for the next generation. The \nlegislation embodied in this conference report represents a statement \nby the Congress that the Vision for Space Exploration is the right \nvision for America in the new age of space. At the same time, the bill \nprovides guidance to help NASA do its part in leading the way along \nthis new path to the future by building effectively on lessons learned \nand by efficiently using its resources, especially the talent and \nexpertise of its workforce.\n  S. 1281, as modified by the conference report, provides authorization \nfor NASA funding at $17.9 billion in fiscal year 2007 and $18.7 billion \nin fiscal year 2008. The conferees believe these levels of funding will \nensure the successful return to flight of the space shuttle and the \ncompletion of the international space station, as well as continuing \nthe important work in exploration, science, aeronautics and education.\n  These funding levels also take into account the recently identified \nshortfall between what the administration had been projecting for \nshuttle flights and the number of flights needed to complete the \ninternational space station, meet our international commitments, and \nprovide an important research capability in space.\n  I am especially pleased that the conference report provides the \ndesignation of the U.S. portion of the space station as national \nlaboratory. This is an important and significant part of the bill. \nFirst, it demonstrates that the Congress understands the great value \nand potential represented by the research that can be done aboard the \nspace station. It underscores the need to ensure that the laboratory is \nas capable, efficient and well equipped as we can make it. Second, it \nprovides a framework for bringing additional, non-NASA resources to \nbear in supporting research aboard the space station. This will enable \nNASA to focus its resources on research needed to support the Vision \nfor Exploration, while continuing to provide space station research \nopportunities in the broader areas of life sciences and fundamental \nsciences.\n\n  In my previous statement, I mentioned briefly a perfect example of \nthe kind of fundamental research that the space station enables, which \nwas described in a recent hearing before the Commerce Committee. Dr. \nSam Ting, of MIT, discussed the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer, scheduled \nto be attached to the space station. This device takes advantage of the \nunique space environment to measure--and help understand--the \ncharacteristics of matter in the universe. The results of this \nexperiment could revolutionize our knowledge about the interactions of \nmatter and potentially lead, for example, to the development of new, \nand virtually unlimited, energy sources.\n  As we move forward with the Vision for Space Exploration, we will \nneed new vehicles and launch capabilities. NASA has made the decision \nto base those new vehicles on much of the existing capabilities and \ndesigns of the space shuttle program. This legislation ratifies that \ndecision and provides the policy foundation to ensure its successful \nimplementation. The evolution of our launch vehicles to a new \ngeneration requires that we be especially careful not to undermine our \nexisting capabilities for human space flight. The legislation ensures a \nsmooth transition between the shuttle and the new crew exploration \nvehicles by providing adequate resources to continue shuttle flights \nand accelerate CEV development so as to minimize any gap between the \ntwo systems. In addition, the legislation specifically directs NASA to \nmake the maximum possible utilization of the personnel, assets, and \ncapabilities of the space shuttle program in developing the next \ngeneration of crew and cargo vehicles. The new CEV will be designed \nwith the flexibility to carry out a variety of missions. It will \nspecifically be designed to provide access to the space station, and \nthus fulfills the role of a crew rescue vehicle, CRV, if needed, to \nensure the safety of our crews aboard the international space station.\n  In order to further facilitate the evolution of current human space \nflight systems into those needed for the Vision for Exploration, the \nbill has provided for the merging of the human space fight activities \ninto a single account. This is intended to provide the closest possible \ninteraction between these activities, in those areas where they can be \nmutually supportive. At the same time, the legislation contains \nlanguage to ensure that both the exploration activities and the human \nspace flight, or space operations activities, retain sufficient \nresources to fulfill their core objectives.\n  Another important and historical NASA research activity is \naeronautical research, a fundamental part of NASA's activities since \nits inception. All of us recognize that the continued health of the \nNation's aerospace industry in a very competitive global marketplace \nmakes it essential that we have solid aeronautical research \ncapabilities. This legislation directs the development of a national \npolicy to guide the Nation's aeronautical research--including that \nconducted by NASA. This policy will enable us to make informed \ndecisions about the future directions for aeronautics research and the \nnecessary resources to support them.\n\n[[Page S14406]]\n\n  One of the more exciting new developments in space exploration is the \nexpanded level of commercial interest in supporting and expanding space \nexploration. This legislation encourages those developments. It \nprovides expanded authority for competitive prizes to promote \ncommercial developments, and it encourages the use of commercial \nservices and capabilities in servicing the space station, to cite just \ntwo examples. This is clearly an important new development in space \nexploration which the bill fully endorses.\n  Finally, let me say something about the broad range of science \nactivities for which NASA has always been known. This conference \nagreement expresses very clearly the need for maintaining a balanced \nscience portfolio throughout all NASA programs and provides the funding \nauthority necessary to ensure the space sciences, earth sciences, and \neducation activities remain vigorous parts of NASA's mission.\n  Mr. President, this legislation provides a comprehensive, forward-\nlooking and responsible approach to the transition of our Nation's \nspace exploration programs into a new era of discovery. I believe that, \ntogether with our colleagues in the House, we have crafted a \ncongressional consensus that will help ensure this Nation's leadership \nin space exploration and provide benefits beyond measure and beyond \nimagination to this Nation and the world.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I urge passage by unanimous consent of the \n2005 NASA Authorization Act and managers' package that has been agreed \nto by conferees from the House and Senate.\n  I express my thanks for the work that my fellow conferees, the \ncommittees, subcommittees, and our staffs have done on this bill. I am \nconfident that it will help Administrator Griffin to lead NASA to \naccomplish its many missions.\n  America is a nation of explorers. NASA explores the frontiers of \naviation by atmospheric flight; the frontiers of space by going where \nothers have never been; and the frontiers of science by conducting \nscientific endeavors that broaden our understanding of life, our home \nplanet, and the heavens. NASA has not been authorized by Congress for \nsome time. In fact, the last two times NASA was authorized was 1993 and \n2000.\n  This is the first authorization of NASA in 6 years. NASA must be held \naccountable to the Congress through the oversight of the agency. With \nan authorization bill passed only once every 5 to 7 years, the role has \ndefaulted to the Appropriations Committee, which has many other items \non its plate. Now with this NASA authorization legislation, hopefully \nthere will be a healthier and more meaningful communication between the \nagency and the Congress.\n  The NASA Authorization Act of 2005 will help the Congress to do a \nbetter job of performing oversight of NASA. The act is a 3-year bill, \nauthorizing NASA from 2006 through 2008.\n  Because appropriators have already funded NASA for fiscal year 2006 \nthe authorizing conferees receded to the appropriations bill for that \nfiscal year. The bill authorizes $17.932 billion for fiscal year 2007 \nand $18.686 billion for fiscal year 2008, and provides more funding \nthan the President's budget projections.\n  Like many of our colleagues, Senator Hutchison and I believe that \nrecent NASA budget requests have been below the levels required for the \nagency to perform its various missions effectively. That was made \napparent recently when Administrator Griffin testified at a committee \nhearing before the U.S. House of Representatives, that the space \nshuttle program will have a $3 billion plus shortfall over the next 5 \nyears. Dr. Griffin's concerns have been echoed by a letter recently \nprovided by several Members of the House to the White House calling for \nthe space shuttle program to be fully funded.\n  This legislation authorizes NASA to return humans to the Moon, to \nexplore it, and to maintain a human presence on the Moon. Consistent \nwith the President's vision, it also requires using what we learn and \ndevelop on the Moon as a stepping-stone to future exploration of Mars.\n  To carry out these missions, this act requires NASA to develop an \nimplementation plan for the transition from shuttle to crew exploration \nvehicle, CEV. The plan will help NASA to make a smooth transition from \nretirement of the space shuttle orbiters to the replacement \nspacecraft systems. The implementation plan will help make sure that we \ncan keep the skills and the focus that are needed to assure that each \nspace shuttle flight is safe through retirement of the orbiters, and to \nretain those personnel needed for the CEV and heavy lift cargo \nspacecraft.\n\n  The bill should be helpful for reducing if not eliminating a gap in \nAmerica's ability to put humans in Earth orbit. The act also directs \nNASA to plan for and consider a Hubble servicing mission after the \nsecond space shuttle return to flight mission has been completed.\n  This NASA authorization bill calls for utilization of the \ninternational space station for basic science as well as exploration \nscience. It is important that we reap the benefits of our multibillion \ndollar investment in the space station. This act ensures that NASA will \nmaintain a focus on the importance of basic science.\n  This legislation directs the Aerospace Safety Advisory Panel to \nmonitor and measure NASA's improvements to their safety culture, \nincluding employees' fear of reprisals for voicing concerns about \nsafety. The bill encourages NASA to more effectively utilize lessons \nlearned and best practices, and to implement cost controls that are \nmore effective for making better use of our taxpayers' money.\n  This authorization bill addresses NASA aeronautics and America's pre-\neminence in aviation, calling for the President of the United States to \npursue a national policy for aeronautics. The Europeans have stated \ntheir intent to dominate the airplane market by 2020. It is not in our \nnational interest to let that occur.\n  The bill includes a limitation on reprogramming funds from space \noperations, includes the space shuttle and international space station, \nto exploration systems, and vice versa. This limitation will ensure \nthat no more than 10 percent of shuttle and station funds can be \ntransferred into the exploration systems program to be used for a \nshortfall in an exploration-related development program. However, it \nwill not limit the exploration systems and space shuttle programs from \nutilizing the same personnel, equipment, and contract vehicles to \ncontinue to safely operate the shuttle while developing the shuttle-\nderived crew exploration vehicle.\n  This act gives America the opportunity for implementing the vision \nfor space exploration; renewing our commitment to U.S. civil aviation \nand NASA aeronautics research; conducting important science activities \nat NASA; and assuring that America has continuous human access to \nspace.\n  By passing this legislation, we will continue to strengthen our \neconomy and inspire the next generation of scientists, engineers, and \nexplorers.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I wish to thank Senators Hutchison, \nNelson, and Stevens, for their leadership in bringing together the \ndifferent bills from the Senate and the House. The final product is the \nresult of hard work and compromise. It provides the National \nAeronantics and Space Administration, NASA, and the country clear \ncongressional direction on how to proceed with human space exploration, \nand it emphasizes NASA's invaluable work in science and education.\n  Human space exploration is a key component of this bill. I am \nconfident that space discovery will continue to excite young minds and, \nhopefully, inspire them to pursue an education in math and science. The \nskills and talents they develop will not only help them reach the \nstars, they will propel American innovation and define our country's \nfuture.\n  At the same time, we must not overlook safety. I applaud Senator \nNelson and the other conferees for keeping safety a top priority in \nthis legislation.\n  In addition, I want to express my appreciation for the conferees' \nwillingness to accommodate my efforts to promote the design and \ndevelopment of new science facilities, such as telescopes through the \nNational Science Foundation, as well as NASA.\n  NASA plays a strong role in astronomy from the Hubble Telescope to \nthe Keck Outrigger Project in Hawaii. I am\n\n[[Page S14407]]\n\npleased to see that the bill affirms NASA's commitment to astronomy by \nensuring that the Hubble will be serviced. It is my hope that Section \n616 will also help NASA work with institutions, such as the Mauna Kea \nAstronomy Education Center, to make the work of world-class scientists \naccessible to their neighbors and children.\n  Finally, I would like to thank Jeff Bingham, Tom Cremins, Jean Toal \nEisen and Chan Lieu of the Commerce Committee staff, and Mike Dodson, a \nfellow in Senator Bill Nelson's office, for their hard work on this \nimportant measure. I understand Mr. Dodson will be leaving at the end \nof the year. We will miss his counsel and expertise.\n  I urge the swift adoption of the conference report.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, my fellow Senators, I am \npleased to join Senators Hutchison, Stevens, Inouye, and Lott today in \npresenting the 2005 NASA Authorization Act and managers' package that \nhas been agreed to by conferees from the House and Senate.\n  I express my thanks for the work that my fellow conferees, the \ncommittees, subcommittees, and our staffs have done on this bill. I am \nconfident that it will help Administrator Griffin to lead NASA to \naccomplish its many missions.\n  America is a nation of explorers. NASA explores the frontiers of \naviation by atmospheric flight, the frontiers of space by going where \nothers have never been; and the frontiers of science by conducting \nscientific endeavors that broaden our understanding of life, our home \nplanet, and the heavens. NASA has not been authorized by Congress for \nsome time. In fact, the last two times NASA was authorized was 1993 and \n2000.\n  Congress needs to authorize NASA more often. When NASA is authorized \ninfrequently, then oversight may become lax. The lack of an \nauthorization bill leaves the authorizing function to the \nAppropriators--and they don't have time and it's not their job. In \nfact, the lack of oversight provided by authorizers over the last \nseveral years may have contributed to the loss of the Space Shuttle \nColumbia.\n  The NASA Authorization Act of 2005 will help the Congress to do a \nbetter job of performing oversight of NASA. The act is a 3-year bill, \nauthorizing NASA from 2006 through 2008. It authorizes NASA \nappropriations for fiscal year 2007 and 2008.\n  Because appropriators have already funded NASA for fiscal year 2006 \nthe authorizing conferees receded to the appropriations bill for that \nfiscal year. The bill authorizes $17.932 billion for fiscal year 2007 \nand $18.686 billion for fiscal year 2008, and provides more funding \nthan the President's budget projections.\n  Like many of our colleagues, Senator Hutchison and I believe that \nrecent NASA budget requests have been below the levels required for the \nagency to perform its various missions effectively.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n\n[[Page S14409]]\n\n       (1) At the United Nations Millennium Summit in 2000, the \n     United States joined more than 180 other countries in \n     committing to work toward goals to improve life for the \n     world's poorest people by 2015.\n       (2) Such goals include reducing the proportion of people \n     living on less than $1 per day by \\1/2\\, reducing child \n     mortality by \\2/3\\, and assuring basic education for all \n     children, while sustaining the environment upon which human \n     life depends.\n       (3) At the 2002 International Conference on Financing for \n     Development, the United States representative reiterated the \n     support of the United States for the Millennium Development \n     Goals and advocated, along with other international \n     participants, for a stronger focus on measurable outcomes \n     derived from a global partnership between developed and \n     developing countries.\n       (4) On March 22, 2002, President Bush stated, ``We fight \n     against poverty because hope is an answer to terror. We fight \n     against poverty because opportunity is a fundamental right to \n     human dignity. We fight against poverty because faith \n     requires it and conscience demands it. We fight against \n     poverty with a growing conviction that major progress is \n     within our reach.''.\n       (5) The 2002 National Security Strategy of the United \n     States notes that ``a world where some live in comfort and \n     plenty, while half of the human race lives on less than $2 \n     per day, is neither just nor stable. Including all of the \n     world's poor in an expanding circle of development and \n     opportunity is a moral imperative and one of the top \n     priorities of U.S. international policy''.\n       (6) The National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the \n     United States concluded that the Government of the United \n     States must offer an example of moral leadership in the world \n     and offer parents and their children a vision of the future \n     that emphasizes individual educational and economic \n     opportunity as essential to the efforts of the United States \n     to defeat global terrorism.\n       [(7) The summit of the Group of Eight scheduled for July \n     2005, the United Nations summit scheduled for September 2005, \n     and the Sixth Ministerial Conference of the World Trade \n     Organization scheduled for December 2005 will provide \n     opportunities to measure and continue to pursue progress on \n     the Millennium Development Goals.]\n       (7) The summit of the Group of Eight held during July 2005, \n     the United Nations summit held during September 2005, and the \n     Sixth Ministerial Conference of the World Trade Organization \n     scheduled to be held during December 2005 have provided and \n     will provide opportunities to measure and continue to pursue \n     progress on the Millennium Development Goals.\n       (8) The summit of the Group of Eight [scheduled for] held \n     July 6 through July 8, 2005, in Gleneagles, Scotland, [will \n     bring] brought together the countries that can make the \n     greatest contribution to alleviating extreme poverty in \n     Africa, the region of the world where extreme poverty is most \n     prevalent.\n       (9) On June 11, 2005, the United States helped secure the \n     agreement of the Group of Eight Finance Ministers to cancel \n     100 percent of the debt obligations owed to the World Bank, \n     African Development Bank, and International Monetary Fund by \n     countries that are eligible for debt relief under the Highly \n     Indebted Poor Countries Initiative, the initiative \n     established in 1996 by the World Bank and the International \n     Monetary Fund for the purpose of reducing the debt burdens of \n     the world's poorest countries, or under the Enhanced HIPC \n     Initiative, as defined in section 1625 of the International \n     Financial Institutions Act (22 U.S.C. 262p-8), which are poor \n     countries that are on the path to reform.\n       (10) The report prepared by the Commission for Africa and \n     issued by Prime Minister Tony Blair on March 11, 2005, \n     entitled ``Our Common Interest'', called for coherence and \n     coordination in the development of an overarching package of \n     actions to be carried out by the countries of Africa and the \n     international community to address the complex interlocking \n     issues that challenge the continent, many of which have \n     already been addressed individually in previous summits and \n     under the Africa Action Plan enacted by the Group of Eight.\n       (11) The United States has recognized the need for \n     strengthened economic and trade opportunities, as well as \n     increased financial and technical assistance to Africa and \n     other countries burdened by extreme poverty, through \n     significant initiatives in recent years, including--\n       (A) the African Growth and Opportunity Act (19 U.S.C. 3701 \n     et seq.) that has opened United States markets to thousands \n     of products from Africa;\n       (B) the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief \n     developed under section 101 of the United States Leadership \n     Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Act of 2003 (22 \n     U.S.C. 7611), the major focus of which has been on African \n     countries;\n       (C) the Millennium Challenge Corporation established under \n     section 604 of the Millennium Challenge Act of 2003 (22 \n     U.S.C. 7703) that is in the process of committing new and \n     significant levels of assistance to countries, including \n     countries in Africa, that are poor but show great promise for \n     boosting economic growth and bettering the lives of their \n     people; and\n       (D) [the United States has canceled] the cancellation by \n     the United States of 100 percent of the bilateral debt owed \n     to the Untied States by countries eligible for debt relief \n     under the Enhanced HIPC Initiative.\n       (12) The report prepared by the Commission for Africa \n     entitled ``Our Common Interest'' includes the following \n     findings:\n       (A) The people of Africa must demonstrate the leadership \n     necessary to address the governance challenges they face, \n     setting priorities that ensure the development of effective \n     civil and police services, independent judiciaries, and \n     strong parliaments, all of which reinforce a stable and \n     predictable economic environment attractive to investment.\n       (B) Many leaders in Africa have pursued personal self-\n     interest rather than national goals, a tendency that has been \n     in some instances exacerbated and abetted by the manipulation \n     of foreign governments pursuing their own agenda in the \n     region to the detriment of the people of Africa.\n       (C) More violent conflict has occurred in Africa during the \n     period between 1965 and 2005 than occurred in any other \n     continent during that period, and the countries of Africa \n     must engage on the individual, national, and regional level \n     to prevent and manage conflict.\n       (D) The capacity to trade is constrained by a derelict or \n     nonexistent infrastructure in most African countries as well \n     as by the double-edged sword of tariff and nontariff barriers \n     to trade that complicate markets and discourage investment \n     both within and beyond the continent.\n       (E) The local resources for investment in people and the \n     institutions necessary for good governance have been \n     squandered, misappropriated, and, to an increasingly \n     devastating effect, spent on servicing debt to the developed \n     world. Such resources should be reoriented to serve the needs \n     of the people through the use of debt forgiveness and support \n     for institutional reform and internal capacity building.\n       (F) Failing to prevent conflict in Africa results in \n     incalculable costs to African development and expense to the \n     international community and the investment in preventing \n     conflict is a fraction of such costs and expenses, in human, \n     security, and financial terms.\n       (G) Despite difficulties, there is optimism and energy \n     reflected in the scope of activities of individuals such as \n     2004 Nobel Peace Prize recipient, Wangari Maathai, as well as \n     those of improved regional organizations such as the African \n     Union and the New Partnership for Economic Development's Peer \n     Review Mechanism, and subregional entities such as the \n     Economic Community of West African States, the Inter-\n     Governmental Authority on Development, and the potential of \n     the Southern African Development Community.\n       (H) Political reform in Africa has produced results. For \n     example, while in 1985 countries of sub-Saharan Africa ruled \n     by dictators were the norm, by 2005 dictatorships are a \n     minority and democracy has new life with governments chosen \n     by the people increasing fourfold since 1991.\n       (13) The report prepared by the Commission for Africa \n     entitled ``Our Common Interest'' includes the following \n     recommendations:\n       (A) At this vital moment when globalization and growth, \n     technology and trade, and mutual security concerns allow, and \n     common humanity demands, a substantial tangible and coherent \n     package of actions should immediately be taken by the \n     international community, led by the most industrialized \n     countries, in partnership with the countries of Africa, to \n     address the poverty and underdevelopment of the African \n     continent.\n       (B) The people of Africa must take responsibility and show \n     courageous leadership in addressing problems and taking \n     ownership of solutions as the means for ensuring sustainable \n     development, while implementing governance reform as an \n     underlying prerequisite for foreign assistance effectiveness.\n       (C) Each developed country has unique strengths and \n     capacity to add value to a comprehensive assistance plan and \n     should join their individual efforts to a coherent whole that \n     is more efficient and responsive to Africa and the people of \n     Africa.\n       (D) The international community must honor existing \n     commitments to strengthen African peacekeeping capacity and \n     go beyond those commitments to invest in more effective \n     prevention and nonmilitary means to resolve conflict through \n     such regional organizations as the African Union and the \n     subregional Economic Community for West African States.\n       (E) A massive investment in physical infrastructure should \n     be made to support commerce, extend governance, and provide \n     opportunities for education, healthcare, investment and \n     growth.\n       (F) Donors and the governments of the countries of Africa \n     should devote substantial investment in the men and women of \n     Africa through the education and health sectors, enabling and \n     extending recent gains made to reach far more broadly into \n     remote regions.\n       (G) The public sector should actively engage the private \n     sector in driving growth through partnerships by reforming \n     the laws, bureaucracy, and infrastructure necessary to \n     maintain a climate that fosters investment by developing \n     public-private centers of excellence to pursue such reforms.\n       (H) The countries of Africa must maximize the participation \n     of women in both business and government, protect the rights \n     of women, and work to increase the number of\n\n[[Page S14410]]\n\n     women in leadership positions so as to capitalize on the \n     ability of women to deliver scarce resources effectively and \n     fairly.\n       (I) The international community must work together to \n     dismantle trade barriers, including the immediate elimination \n     of trade-distorting commodity support.\n       (J) International donors should strengthen multilateral \n     institutions in Africa to respond appropriately to local and \n     regional crises as well as to promote economic development \n     and ensure the people of Africa are granted a stronger voice \n     in international forums.\n       (K) The international community must join in providing \n     creative incentives for commercial firms to research and \n     develop products that improve water, sanitation, health, and \n     the environment in ways that would dramatically reduce \n     suffering and increase productive life-spans in Africa.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of H.R. 972, which was received \nfrom the House.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 972) to authorize appropriations for fiscal \n     years 2006 and 2007 for the Trafficking Victims Protection \n     Act of 2000, and for other purposes.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I support reauthorization of the \nTrafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000. This legislation was \nchampioned by my dear friend Senator Paul Wellstone. I supported him \nthen and when it was reauthorized in 2003, and I continue to support \nthis effort. It is part of his extraordinary legacy. The people of \nMinnesota, the Senate, the Nation and the world suffered a great loss \nwhen we lost Paul Wellstone.\n  The United States has long played a leading role in the international \ncommunity in combating these heinous crimes, and furthered its efforts \nby enacting the Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000 and \nreauthorizing the law in 2003. This reauthorization confirms our \ncommitment to effectively and successfully combating this horrific \nproblem by combining tough law enforcement strategies with important \nsafeguards and services for victims.\n  Information about severe cases of human trafficking will continue to \nbe provided in the annual State Department Country Report for each \nforeign country, in a continued effort to raise awareness about this \nissue. In addition, the Inter-Agency Task Force will continue to \nmonitor trafficking by providing annual and interim reports on \ncountries whose governments do not comply with the minimum standards. \nEfforts to establish initiatives to enhance economic opportunities for \npotential trafficking victims, including training and education \nprograms, will also continue.\n  I am especially pleased that this reauthorization package has been \nimproved significantly. For the first time, the bill focuses not only \non the important goal of preventing international human trafficking, \nbut also on preventing the human trafficking that occurs within our own \nborders. Children here in the United States are at tremendous risk, \nespecially those who are homeless or runaways, and they are \nparticularly susceptible to being domestically trafficked for purposes \nof commercial sexual exploitation. I will not rest until this alarming \ntrend is stopped.\n  Over the last 30 years, I have worked with my colleagues to write and \nenact legislation aimed at protecting children and assisting victims. \nIn the last Congress, Senator Hatch and I joined forces to introduce \nthe PROTECT Act, which provided prosecutors and law enforcement with \ntools necessary to combat child pornography and human trafficking. The \nfinal legislation signed into law included a number of provisions I had \nalso either authored or strongly supported, including: The National \nAMBER Alert Network Act; the Protecting Our Children Comes First Act, \nwhich reauthorized funding for the National Center for Missing and \nExploited Children; and legislation to amend the Violence Against Women \nAct to provide transitional housing assistance grants for child victims \nof domestic violence.\n  As a father and a grandfather, I cannot think of any more important \nresponsibility than our responsibility to protect the most vulnerable \namongst us--our children. I recognize that more needs to be done, and I \nwill continue to explore new ways to combat human\n\n[[Page S14418]]\n\ntrafficking. Although our work is far from finished, the \nreauthorization of the Trafficking Victims Protection Act is another \nimportant step in the right direction.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, when our Nation recently celebrated the \nlife of Rosa Parks, we were reminded that the walk to justice is a long \none. Her life reminded us that justice starts with individuals standing \nup for what is right; but also that the struggle does not quickly end \nuntil we faithfully finish the task. Likewise, while we have made a \ngood start in our efforts to address the global crime of human \ntrafficking, the millions of victims who still suffer in slavery today \nare urgently looking to see if we will finish as well as we have \nstarted.\n  I am pleased to say that the passage of the Trafficking Victims' \nProtection Reauthorization Act is one more step in that direction.\n  Each year, it is estimated that at least 800,000 human beings are \ntrafficked across national borders. They are bought and sold in the sex \nindustry as prostitutes, or forced into domestic servitude. Recent \nestimates on the number of victims trafficked into the United States \nrange from 20,000 to 40,000 per year. Most of these victims are women \nand young children who languish in brothels, being raped and abused by \nthe traffickers and their clients. An estimated 27 million human beings \nworldwide suffer from some form of slavery and forced labor.\n  The late Senator Paul Wellstone and his wife Sheila were passionately \ndevoted to the issue of trafficking and to assisting countless victims. \nI will always remember their courageous fight in addressing modern-day \nslavery.\n  Senator Wellstone and I teamed up in the Senate and were able to see \nthe Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000 signed into law. Some \ncalled us strange bedfellows, but the wide political and religious \nspectrum that supported our efforts were a clear reminder that this is \nnot a partisan issue.\n  While Paul Wellstone is no longer here to carry the torch, I am \npleased that other colleagues from across party lines have worked to \nmake a difference by uniting under the common principle of freedom.\n  ``The Victims of Trafficking Protection Act,'' Public Law 106-386, \nestablished a monitoring system and sanctions for countries that fail \nto take minimal efforts to combat trafficking. ``The PROTECT Act,'' \nPublic Law 108-21, made it a crime for any person traveling abroad or \nentering into the United States to do so for sex tourism involving \nchildren. The Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of \n2003, Public Law 108-193, established a Senior Policy Operating Group \nwithin the executive branch to coordinate sound policies between \ninteragency departments. These measures have brought about both deep \nunderstanding and awareness and much needed laws to protect and combat \nagainst trafficking.\n  I congratulate Congressman Chris Smith and my colleagues in the House \nfor their tireless devotion to this issue and the passage of the 2005 \nreauthorization legislation.\n  The bill reauthorizes ongoing programs of the Department of State, \nU.S. Agency for International Development, Department of Justice, \nDepartment of Homeland Security, Department of Health and Human \nServices, and Department of Labor to combat trafficking in persons for \nfiscal years 2006 and 2007. Additionally, it authorizes new funds to \nthe FBI for domestic and international investigations of acts of severe \nforms of trafficking in persons, as well as grants to State and local \nlaw enforcement for the investigation and prosecution of acts of severe \nforms of trafficking in persons involving domestic victims of \ntrafficking.\n  For the first time, we have authorized new programs to reduce the \ndemand for commercial sex in the United States and prevent trafficking \nof U.S. citizens through the creation of grant programs for States and \nlocal law enforcement.\n  As a result of last year's tsunami, the legislation incorporates \nchild protection and trafficking prevention activities into USAID, \nState, and DOD post-conflict and post-natural disaster relief programs. \nIn addition, given recent sex scandals within peacekeeping missions, \nthis bill aims to strengthen efforts to combat sexual exploitation and \ntrafficking in persons by peacekeepers.\n  Finally, the bill authorizes studies on the linkage between \ntrafficking and terrorism and trafficking and HIV/AIDS, as well as \nrequires a worldwide report on steps taken to prevent and eliminate the \nabduction and enslavement of children for use as soldiers.\n  I would also like to applaud the work of the Trafficking in Persons \nOffice at the State Department. Through their sustained diplomatic \nefforts, countries around the world are signing into law provisions \nthat prevent and punish human trafficking. Even in the United States, \nwe have places like the Kansas Legislature working on legislation to \ncombat human trafficking. It is a true testament to the strides that we \nhave made in ending modern-day slavery and I hope other states and \nnations around the world will also consider taking action against this \ntype of organized crime.\n  I am driven by the conviction that every individual counts. This \nprinciple comprises the heart of the democratic form of government. It \nis based on a belief in the universal nature of human rights and a \ncommitment to the dignity of every human life. Addressing modern-day \nslavery is driven by that very conviction.\n  Rosa Parks' remarkable story tells us that the walk to freedom has to \nbegin somewhere--but also that such a walk is a long one. And for the \njourney we take encouragement from the assurances of a Baptist pastor \nwho went to jail with Rosa Parks. ``The moral arc of the universe is \nlong,'' said Dr. King, ``but it bends toward justice.''\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, in March of this year, I--along with \nSenator Lugar--introduced S. 559, the Protection of Vulnerable \nPopulations During Humanitarian Emergencies Act of 2005, a bill to make \nvulnerable people, especially women and children, a priority of our \nforeign assistance programs. The Committee on Foreign Relations \napproved the bill in March as part of its omnibus authorization bill, \nS. 600. Unfortunately, S. 600 was pulled from floor consideration in \nApril, and remains stalled.\n  In the last few days, I have attempted to add the provisions of S. \n559 as an amendment to H.R. 972, the Trafficking Victims Protection \nAct, which was approved by the other body just last week. I support the \ntrafficking bill, which addresses a serious problem in many parts of \nthe world, including this country. I have been told, however, by my \nfriends on the other side of the aisle that my amendment is not \nacceptable at this time. Several reasons have been given, foremost \namong them that it will unduly delay enactment of the trafficking bill, \nbecause the other body has essentially closed up shop for the year.\n  But as my colleagues know we have another problem--victims of sexual \nexploitation and abuse who are not trafficked--such as those who are \nforced to seek sanctuary in refugee or internally displaced camps. The \ntrafficking bill deals with people who are trafficked from those camps. \nBut it does not address the need to protect those left behind.\n  Last May, I visited a refugee camp in Chad where nearly 30,000 \nrefugees from Darfur had settled. I have seen and heard the problems \nthey are facing first hand.\n  Over the last 2 years, civilians have been targeted by Khartoum in \none of the most horrific genocides the world has ever seen. Villages \nhave been bombed, government-sponsored militia have destroyed crops and \nhave fouled the water supply. They have burned homes, leaving mothers \nno choice but to flee for their lives and their children's lives.\n  Civilians forced to flee during war find their way to camps, but \ninstead of relative safety, what do they find? They find more \nsuffering. The camps become virtual prisons. Women and girls are beaten \nand raped if they venture outside the camps for firewood.\n  Sudan is not the only part of the world where such travesties are \noccurring. A report by a United Nations investigatory team released \nearlier this year states that a number of U.N. peacekeepers--U.N. \npeacekeepers, mind you--deployed to protect civilians from ethnic \nviolence in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo were sexually \nexploiting girls as young as 13 years old. The peacekeepers were asking\n\n[[Page S14419]]\n\nthese children for sex in exchange for small sums of money or food. And \nthe report found that the abuse continued even while UN investigators \nwere on the ground.\n  Reading that report and others reinforced my belief that we cannot \nstand by any longer. More must be done, and S. 559 provides an \nimportant framework to do so.\n  I firmly believe that the objective of my legislation is entirely \nconsistent with the objectives of the trafficking bill--to protect \nvulnerable people, whether they are trafficked from one country to \nanother, or left behind in a refugee camp.\n  It enhances the U.S. Government's ability to see that women and \nchildren are protected before, during, and after a complex humanitarian \nemergency. It directs the Secretary of State to designate a special \ncoordinator for protection issues who will be charged with making sure \nour embassies are made aware of the warning signs that an emergency \nwhich may put the lives and safety of women and children at risk is \nimminent.\n  It directs the coordinator to compile a watch list of such countries \nand regions so that the Agency for International Development can plan \nto meet potential need for protection programs. It prohibits U.S. \nfunding for relief agencies that do not sign a code of conduct that \noutlaws improper exploitative relationships between aid workers and \nrecipients.\n  It calls upon the United States Executive Director of the \nInternational Bank of Reconstruction and Development to try to make \nsure World Bank demobilization, disarmament, and reintegration programs \nextend the same benefits provided to ex-combatants to the women and \nchildren who were associated with them.\n  As it now stands, women and children who were used as cooks and \nporters and so-called ``wives,'' a euphemism for women who were \nkidnaped to serve as sexual slaves, may well not be given benefits \nthrough these programs--nothing with which to rebuild their lives \ndespite the fact that they were not there by choice. Yet the very \npeople who forced them into such conditions receive assistance without \nconditions.\n  Finally, it amends the Foreign Assistance Act to authorize programs \nand activities specifically aimed at making vulnerable people--\nespecially women and children--who are affected by humanitarian \nemergencies safer from further exploitation and abuse.\n  In recent days, some supporters of the trafficking bill have \nsuggested my bill is about abortion. My response is this: my bill has \nnothing to do with abortion, but I am willing to make any changes that \nare necessary to make clear that abortion-related restrictions in \nforeign aid laws are not affected.\n  I sincerely hope that people who have a legitimate sense of moral \noutrage about victims of trafficking will support my objectives and \nwork with me to pass my bill early next year. The Senator from Kansas, \nSenator Brownback, who is one of the chief sponsors in the Senate of \nthe trafficking bill, has pledged to work with me on approval of S. \n559. I am grateful to him for that commitment.\n  In the meantime, I am pleased that today the Senate will approve the \nTrafficking in Persons legislation and it will proceed to the \nPresident. It is a very important bill and I commend the sponsors in \nboth chambers for their good work.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the \nTrafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act approved by the \nHouse on Thursday, December 15. This legislation increases the \nGovernment's ability to combat human trafficking and provides greater \nprotective measures for victims of this deplorable crime. I thank my \ncolleagues in the House for working on this legislation in an expedited \nfashion, and for their leadership in responding to these challenges.\n  The Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act includes \nlanguage from the End Demand for Sex Trafficking Act of 2005, a bill \nthat I introduced earlier this year. That bill is important because it \nexpresses Congress' commitment to reduce U.S. domestic demand for sex \ntrafficking--which disproportionately victimizes women and children. It \nincorporates more stringent provisions to penalize human traffickers, \nand it enhances protective measures for the victims of trafficking \ncrimes.\n  This is accomplished by establishing Federal grants which could be \nused to focus on prosecution efforts. In addition, it strengthens and \nclarifies Federal criminal law, making it easier to prosecute those who \ntransport persons who are then used for prostitution across State \nlines. And it includes an important oversight element: the Attorney \nGeneral will be required to release an annual report on best practices \nfor reducing the demand for unlawful commercial sex.\n  The Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution states: ``Neither \nslavery nor involuntary servitude . . . shall exist within the United \nStates, or any place subject to their jurisdiction.'' This provision is \nunique to our Constitution. Many constitutional amendments protect \nindividual rights against actions by Federal, State, and local \ngovernments. But the Thirteenth Amendment is unique because it provides \nthat slavery and involuntary servitude cannot exist--neither in public \nnor private spheres.\n  Yet, even to this day, men, women, and children are trafficked into \nthe United States and coerced into lives ravaged by forced labor and \nsexual slavery.\n  I join the administration in commending the House International \nRelations and Judiciary Committees who joined me to address this \nimportant issue. Indeed, this bill lays out the terrible facts: as many \nas 800,000 human beings are literally bought and sold worldwide into \nsome form of slavery or involuntary servitude--approximately 80 percent \nare women and girls and up to 50 percent are children. Roughly 16,000 \nof those human beings are brought into the United States each year, \ncoerced into lives of forced labor or sexual servitude which, of \ncourse, is slavery.\n  The fact is the current administration has responded to the call by \ndramatically increasing efforts devoted to providing substantially more \nresources to combat human trafficking. This has been done principally \nunder the auspices of the civil rights division at the Justice \nDepartment. The Department has initiated more than three times the \nnumber of trafficking investigations, filed almost four times as many \nof these cases. and doubled the number of defendants convicted for \nthese heinous crimes than in the prior 4-year period.\n  Mr. President, I am pleased this important piece of legislation has \npassed, and look forward to working with my colleagues on this very \nimportant issue in the future.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise to support passage of the \nTrafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2005.\n  This law will help continue the progress in fighting the insidious \nglobal practice of trafficking in human beings. It is estimated that \nnearly a million people are trafficked across international borders \neach year and pressed into labor or servitude by the use of force, \nfraud, or coercion. Human trafficking represents the commerce in human \nmisery.\n  Today we reauthorize a bill that was passed and signed into law in \nOctober 2000. In doing so, we honor one of the great champions of that \nbill--the late Senator Paul Wellstone. Senator Wellstone's commitment \nto combating human trafficking and other human rights abuses stands as \none of his most enduring legacies. The Senate and the Nation miss his \ncourage, passion, and leadership on this issue and so many others.\n  The passage of today's bill is also a tribute to the tireless \nadvocacy of one of my constituents, Oprah Winfrey. She has helped put a \nspotlight on the tragedy of human trafficking, and she has been a \npowerful and eloquent voice for those who are silenced by oppression.\n  Human trafficking is most prevalent in foreign lands, but the U.S. \nGovernment has estimated that over 10,000 people are trafficked into \nthe United States every year. In my own State of Illinois, for example, \na Russian trafficker was prosecuted in 2002 for forcing several women \nfrom Latvia to work in Chicago-area strip clubs. The State of Illinois \nhas risen to the challenge. This past summer, Illinois Governor\n\n[[Page S14420]]\n\nRod Blagojevich signed a law that provides more legal tools for State \nprosecutors and more protections for trafficking victims.\n  The Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2005 will \nhelp combat human trafficking throughout the Nation and around the \nglobe. It extends the provisions given to Federal law enforcement in \n2000 to prosecute traffickers, protect victims, and prevent future \nabuses.\n  And it will allow our government to continue holding other nations \naccountable for their efforts to combat human trafficking abroad. I \nhave discussed this issue with Ambassador John Miller, a former member \nof Congress who is now the director of the State Department's Office to \nMonitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons. I am pleased that the number \nof countries to whom the State Department has given a failing grade--\nso-called ``Tier 3'' countries--has dropped from 27 in 2001 to 14 in \n2005.\n  Earlier this month, we commemorated the International Day for the \nAbolition of Slavery. On this occasion, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi \nAnnan said:\n\n       The world is now wrestling with a new form of slavery--\n     trafficking in human beings, in which many vulnerable people \n     are virtually abandoned by legal and social systems into a \n     sordid realm of exploitation and abuse. People who \n     perpetrate, condone or facilitate slavery or slavery-like \n     practices must be held accountable by national and, if \n     necessary, international means. The international community \n     must also do more to combat poverty, social exclusion, \n     illiteracy, ignorance and discrimination, which increase \n     vulnerability and are part of the underlying context for this \n     scourge.\n\n  By passing the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of \n2005, we are heeding the advice of Kofi Annan and carrying the torch of \nPaul Wellstone.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. I rise today to speak in support of the reauthorization \nof the Trafficking Victims Protection Act.\n  The scourge of trafficking in women and children was a priority for \nme as First Lady and continues to be a priority for me as a U.S. \nSenator. Since the United Nations Fourth World Conference on Women in \n1995, I have been working to raise awareness of the heinous practice of \nbuying and selling women and children like commodities. I have seen the \ndevastation that it causes, and the lives it ruins. I have met with the \nfamilies from Eastern and Central Europe, who, with tears in their \neyes, pleaded with me to help them find lost ones who had been stolen \nfrom them, and I have met with the victims, including a 12-year-old \ngirl in Thailand who was dying of AIDS after being sold twice by her \nfamily. This barbaric practice has caused far too many to exist in a \nperpetual state of fear and vulnerability, and we must do everything in \nour power to bring the scourge of trafficking out of the shadows and to \nthe attention of the world.\n  I am proud to say that the United States has, for the past decade, \nbeen the leader in trying to persuade the rest of the world to \neradicate this abhorrent practice. As the Clinton administration \nincreased the anti-trafficking activities of our Government through \nprograms at the State Department and the Department of Justice, \nCongress was developing legislation to eradicate trafficking. We worked \nwith the late Senator Wellstone, his Republican cosponsor, Senator \nBrownback, and Congressman Chris Smith and former Congressman Sam \nGejdenson in the House, to introduce the first comprehensive anti-\ntrafficking bill in Congress. This culminated in the passage of the \nVictims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act of 2000. I believed \nthen, and I believe now, that this is one of the Clinton \nadministration's greatest achievements and one of the most important \nparts of Senator Wellstone's legacy. That law has meant the difference \nbetween freedom and enslavement for unknown numbers of potential \ntrafficking victims, and this reauthorization provides us with the \nopportunity to strengthen its ability to help those who have been \ntrafficked, and I would like to thank Senator Brownback and \nRepresentative Smith, my colleagues on the Helsinki Commission, for \ntheir continued commitment to this act since its initial passage.\n  I am proud to see that this reauthorization enhances the 3 P's \nstrategy--prevention of trafficking, prosecution of those that engage \nin these acts, and protection of the vulnerable individuals who have \nbeen trafficked--that we developed in the Clinton administration. It \ngives the Justice Department the authority to pursue extraterritorial \nprosecutions of Federal employees or those accompanying them if they \nengage in trafficking activities. It encourages the prevention of \ntrafficking by requiring organizations or contractors engaged in U.S.-\nsupported peacekeeping efforts to have antitrafficking policies in \nplace. And it will protect those who have been trafficked overseas by \nincreasing funding for programs like residential treatment facilities.\n  But there is still so much work to be done. Although reliable \nstatistics are difficult to find, we know that 800,000 individuals--the \nvast majority of whom are women and children--are trafficked from one \ncountry to another every year, with 15,000 being trafficked to the \nUnited States. The FBI estimates that trafficking generates $9.5 \nbillion annually for organized crime syndicates around the world.\n  I am deeply concerned about the growing domestic commercial sex \ntrade, and I believe that we need to increase funding and target \nefforts to end all forms of exploitation. Any expansion of our focus \nmust not dilute our commitment to eradicating human trafficking in all \nits forms in the United States, nor detract from the progress we have \nmade in increasing prosecutions and working with law enforcement \nagencies. We must ensure that our Government has all the resources it \nneeds to make inroads against these awful acts on our own soil.\n  In the fight against trafficking in persons, patience simply is not \nan option. I look forward to continuing to work with my colleagues to \nend this barbaric practice in both the United States and around the \nworld, because this is not about politics, but about what we all share: \nuniversal freedom and universal human rights.\n  Mr. FRIST.
