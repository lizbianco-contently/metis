Mr. President, growing up in the little town of \nSearchlight, there are a number of things that stand out in my mind. \nOne is I remember so vividly a man by the name of Elwin Kent. Elwin was \na friend of my father's. They grew up together. But Elwin as a little \nboy was stricken with polio. Elwin was very deformed. He walked with a \nvery significant limp, and he had on his back a huge hump. I don't \nknow, but it was at least a foot. It stuck out his back about a foot. \nHe was a very handsome man, but he was terribly handicapped.\n  I came as a boy to realize how he got sick because when I was growing \nup, the scourge was Elwin's disease, polio. Infantile paralysis we \ncalled it. I worried about that as most young people of my age did. In \nSearchlight, as I was growing up we had no cases, but that didn't \nprevent my worrying about the disease.\n  My wife and I a short time ago--a matter of a month or so ago--were \nsurprised when we got in the mail a letter sent to me in Searchlight, \nNV. I opened the letter, and it was from a girl I had heard about from \nmy wife, in our conversations, with whom she had spent her early days. \nThat was maybe in the second grade. Two little girls. My wife used to \ntell me about her red-haired friend Gail and how much she cared about \nher.\n  Gail found out where Landra, my wife, had gone. She learned that I \nwas serving in the Senate, and she heard that I was from Searchlight \nand took a chance and wrote that letter.\n  The reason I mention that letter, which was such a surprise and made \nmy wife feel so good, is that one of the things Landra remembers about \nGail, in addition to her bright red hair, is the fact that as a little \ngirl she had polio and was taken out of school and placed in a \nhospital, as my wife remembers, in an iron lung. So, of course, my wife \ngrowing up worried about that. But Gail was gone, and she didn't really \nknow how her life turned out.\n  Without belaboring the point, these two women who had known each \nother 50 years ago were able to spend time on the telephone. It was as \nif they had never been separated.\n  So Elwin Kent and Gail Randolph growing up contracted infantile \nparalysis. It was there. It was something we worried about, as did all \npeople of our vintage.\n  Today is different. We have been able, through science, to eradicate \npolio in most every place in the world, but I still receive letters in \nmy Senate offices from people who are concerned about other issues. I \nwill read three of these letters addressed to me:\n\n       . . . My son 22 years old was in a diving accident just two \n     weeks after graduating from high school and is now a \n     quadriplegic. So instead of heading off to college on a \n     soccer scholarship that autumn, he found himself being fitted \n     for a wheelchair and a life of total dependency on others. . \n     . .while they [stem cells] may not cure him to the point of \n     walking again, they will certainly provide him with an \n     opportunity to improve the quality of his life. He wants to \n     be able to feed himself, brush his own teeth, wash his hands \n     and face when he wants to . . . I know you support stem cell \n     research, but I just wanted to give you my support and the \n     support of our entire family as you fight the fight for those \n     who can't fight for themselves. . . .\n\n  Mr. President, I want the record to reflect that I will use leader \ntime so I don't take time from Senators on this side of the aisle. So I \nam using leader time.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. It is so noted.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I have another letter from Yerington, NV. \nHere is what it says:\n\n       I am asking you again to do your best for my son and the \n     millions of others who need a cure for diabetes. . . . My son \n     was in the hospital yesterday. . . .I can't tell you how hard \n     and painful it is to see your son like that. . . .my wife and \n     I would give our lives to ensure that our son can beat \n     diabetes. . . .The Senate will soon vote on the stem cell \n     bill that you still support. Please try to change the minds \n     of those that are not for it.\n\n  Then one final letter from a man in Las Vegas:\n\n       I have amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). . . . my family \n     doesn't want me to leave them. At the least, my family wants \n     some hope that science will be allowed to use all means \n     available to them, to try to find some treatment that will \n     extend life until a cure is found. I would like to have those \n     people who are opposed to federal assistance for embryonic \n     stem cell research for therapeutic purposes, explain to my \n     family why they are being denied hope that might be available \n     if the federal government funds all reasonable medical \n     research for my illness and those other illnesses that today \n     provide no hope for the future.\n\n  Mr. President, these families are not asking for anything except \nhope--hope--for a better future for them and their loved ones.\n  Stem cell research holds a promise for medical breakthroughs. As \nformer First Lady Nancy Reagan said so clearly, vividly, and who \nwatched with great courage as her husband's Alzheimer's overtook this \ngood man, she said:\n\n       I just don't see how we can turn our backs on this . . . We \nhave lost so much time already. She gave this statement in 2004:\n\n  I just really can't bear to lose any more time.\n\n  Unfortunately, more than 2 years have passed since Nancy Reagan said \nthis, and this Republican-controlled Congress has been unable and \nunwilling to reach agreement on how to expand the President's \nrestrictive stem cell policy that is hindering scientific progress \ntoward possible cures and treatments for a wide variety of diseases and \nconditions.\n\n  We are rapidly approaching the 1-year anniversary of the date of the \nHouse of Representatives passing H.R. 810, the Stem Cell Research \nEnhancement Act. This act would expand President Bush's 2001 policy for \nFederal funding for stem cell research and permit Federal researchers \nat NIH, the National Institutes of Health, which has the capability of \nthe strongest oversight in the world, to finally explore the many \npossibilities stem cell research holds for America.\n  Over the past year, I have repeatedly asked the majority leader to \nfind time to consider this bill which has a bipartisan majority of the \nSenate supporting it. My request for action has been met by delay and \ninaction. One year may not seem like a lot to people, especially in the \nSenate--we seem to have our days, weeks, months, and years run \ntogether--but 1 year is an eternity if someone you love is suffering \nfrom a condition where stem cell research, according to the experts, \ncan offer help.\n  There are a number of very important issues this body ought to \nconsider this session. I say, Mr. President, none--none--even though we \nhave deficit problems, problems with our environment, education, health \ncare, the war in Iraq--I say nothing is more important to the American \npeople than legislation that could provide medical breakthroughs that \nwould benefit millions--millions--of Americans. We can certainly do \nbetter than what we have done. We can do better for the Nevadans whose \nletters I have read.\n  I can see in my mind a man who was the chief executive officer of \nNevada Power, the largest power company in Nevada, who contracted Lou \nGehrig's disease. This young man lived 18 months--very difficult \nmonths. People are counting on the promise of this groundbreaking \nresearch. The passage of the House stem cell bill on May 24 of last \nyear was a rare victory for bipartisanship here. It is my hope that we \nwill embrace the same spirit of bipartisanship in the Senate and pass \nthis legislation.\n  Immediately after the House passed its stem cell bill, I spoke with \nthe majority leader about the need to take up\n\n[[Page S3999]]\n\nthis crucial legislation as soon as possible. At that time, Dr. Frist \nassured me that we would consider the stem cell bill in the Senate by \nJuly of last year. By the end of July of last year, the majority leader \nstill hadn't scheduled debate on the stem cell bill. So I moved to take \nup and pass the House bill by unanimous consent. Dr. Frist objected to \nthis request but delivered a courageous speech the next day in which he \nexpressed support for Federal funding for expanded embryonic stem cell \nresearch.\n  In that statement, the majority leader said, ``The potential of stem \ncell research to save lives and human suffering deserves our increased \nenergy and focus.'' Yet when we returned after the August recess of \nlast year, the majority leader still could not find time to debate this \nimportant legislation. He found time for the Republicans, as the \nleaders of American churches have said, for a moral budget, he found \ntime for drilling in the Arctic Wildlife Refuge and more deficit \nspending, but still no time for keeping hope alive with the promise of \nstem cell research.\n  In December, just 5 months ago, the majority leader asked consent to \ntake up and pass the House cord blood bill. Well, these were supposed \nto be joined together. We reluctantly said OK. We said we will do this \nand then we will move to the bill that we want, the one that passed the \nHouse. Well, at that time he expressed--he meaning Senator Frist--again \nhis commitment to the stem cell bill. Once again, we were not allowed \nto move to that bill. Instead, we passed the cord blood bill in \nexchange for a commitment to consider the stem cell bill early in this \nsession.\n  Three months after he made that commitment, I raised the issue again, \nand I asked that he schedule time for the Senate to consider this issue \nprior to the 1-year anniversary passage of the House bill. \nUnfortunately, this request met the same fate as my previous requests.\n  Two months have passed since my last exchange with Senator Frist, and \nhe has yet to provide the Senate with an opportunity to pass this \nimportant legislation. Even as he announced his plans for a Health Week \nin the Senate sometime this month, he made it clear that stem cell \nresearch would not be part of his plan. Today is May 4, and we are fast \napproaching the 1-year anniversary of the House passing H.R. 810 and \nthe start of Health Week. Still, no stem cell legislation.\n  For all of these reasons and many more, I am sending the majority \nleader a letter signed by 40 Democrats asking the majority leader to \nmake H.R. 810 a priority during this Health Week. I ask unanimous \nconsent that this letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                      Washington, DC, May 2, 2006.\n     Hon. William Frist, M.D.,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Dr. Frist: Nearly a year ago, the House of \n     Representatives approved important legislation to end the \n     restrictions that have kept stem cell research from \n     fulfilling its potential to save lives and alleviate \n     suffering. We understand that you are planning a week of \n     Senate debate on legislation related to health, We urge you \n     to bring the Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act of 2005 (H.R. \n     810) to the Senate floor for consideration during this \n     ``Health Week''.\n       Stem cell research has vast potential for curing diseases \n     and saving lives. We know you recognize the enormous \n     potential of this research for discovering new cures and \n     therapies for diseases such as diabetes, Parkinson's disease \n     and spinal cord injuries, and commend the strong support you \n     have expressed for approval of the House-passed bill. By \n     allowing H.R. 810 to be brought to a vote, you can bring hope \n     and help to millions of American patients and families \n     suffering from these and other serious illnesses.\n       The House passed H.R. 810 in May 2005--yet the Senate has \n     failed to take action for nearly a year. Further delay will \n     mean more lost opportunities for new cures and new \n     treatments. The Senate should mark the anniversary of the \n     House vote with action, not more inaction, We therefore urge \n     you to bring H.R. 810 to the Senate floor for debate and a \n     vote during ``Health Week''. Millions of patients and their \n     families across the nation cannot afford to wait any longer \n     for enactment of this urgently needed legislation.\n       Sincerely,\n         Harry Reid, Dianne Feinstein, Tom Harkin, Ted Kennedy, \n           Joe Lieberman, Barack Obama, Daniel Inouye, Jack Reed, \n           Tom Carper, Russ Feingold, Herb Kohl, Paul Sarbanes, \n           Frank R.

Mr. President, if we are truly committed to lowering the \ncost of health care in our country, we need to invest in medical \nresearch that has the potential to combat life-threatening and chronic \ndiseases. Stem cell research shows tremendous promise. Federal funding \nof embryonic stem cell research will allow our Nation to lead the world \nin this research and ensure that stem cell research is conducted with \nthe strongest oversight in the world. When it comes to the possibility \nof finding cures, we cannot leave our best and brightest researchers \nwith their hands tied, and we cannot deny Americans the hope of \neventually finding a cure for a wide range of illnesses.\n  The House dealt with this issue, and we should do the same. I hope \nthe majority leader will find this legislation important enough to \nconsider as part of Health Week, and I will work with him in any way \npossible to schedule this to move forward before May 24, the 1-year \nanniversary of the passage by the House of this most important bill, a \nbill which gives hope to millions of Americans who, as indicated in \nthese letters, are losing hope.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. There is 30 minutes under the control of \nthe minority leader or his designee.\n  The Senator from Illinois is recognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I thank the Democratic leader, Senator \nReid, for bringing this issue to the floor. This is something we have \ntalked about a lot in our private meetings: stem cell research. It is a \nmatter of great frustration, frustration because we understand there \nare literally millions of Americans who are counting on us, the Senate, \nto assume our responsibility and take up a bill that was passed by the \nHouse of Representatives almost 1 year ago.\n  Senator Reid came to the Senate floor and for the last few moments \ntold us of his own personal commitment to this issue, and I share it. \nHe read letters from his constituents and talked about his life \nexperience. He then presented a letter that we have sent to Senator \nFrist asking him to use his power to bring this issue to the floor.\n  This morning across America, people got up, started their day, many \nof them as healthy as can be but some suffering from illness and others \nwith members of their families suffering from serious illness. Many of \nthe people keep going because there is the hope, just the hope, that \nsomething might come along--a treatment, a medicine--something that \nmight give them a chance to have a full life. That is what stem cell \nresearch is all about.\n  When President Bush decided to announce that it would be the policy \nof the United States of America to restrict scientific research \ninvolving stem cells, he ended up closing off opportunities for people \nto live without fear, without disease, without the shortcomings of the \nillnesses from which they suffer. It was a Government-mandated decision \nwhich would stop that medical research here in the United States. \nAcross the country, some States have said: We are going to lead if the \nGovernment won't. The State of California, my State of Illinois, and \nothers have stepped up and said: We will fund stem cell research \nbecause we believe it is so critically important. Sadly, this \nadministration refuses. Now it will take congressional action. The \nHouse has done its job. It has passed this bill and sent it to the \nSenate. We have waited.\n  It has been 346 days since the House of Representatives passed this \nimportant stem cell legislation. In just short of 2 weeks, it will be 1 \nyear--1 year--since they sent us this bill. Sadly, in that period of \ntime, despite his promises, as Senator Reid has told us, Senator Frist \nwill not call up the stem cell research bill.\n  I was so encouraged--and many others were as well--when Senator Frist \ncame to the Chamber and said publicly\n\n[[Page S4000]]\n\nthat he was going to support this bill. It gave hope to people, that \nfinally we would have a bipartisan effort that would grow here in the \nSenate to the point where a majority would pass this legislation. But \nfor reasons I can't explain, so many other things are of greater \nimportance when it comes to the Senate agenda.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, would the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I would be happy to yield for a question.\n  Mr. REID. The Senator from Illinois and I are about the same age. Do \nyou remember as a boy being worried about polio?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Absolutely.\n  Mr. REID. And do you remember the relief that was given to us as \nboys, young boys, when a cure was found? They could give us a shot. We \nknew we wouldn't go into an iron lung or have a hump on our back like \nmy friend Elwin, whom I love almost like an uncle--not almost, like an \nuncle.\n  Does the Senator acknowledge that all these people who suffer from \nLou Gehrig's disease and Parkinson's and diabetes and all of these \nother diseases, that they have been told by the foremost scientists \naround the world that there is hope for them, that they would have the \nsame relief we had when we learned there was a cure for polio?\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I would say in response to the Senator \nfrom Nevada the name Jonas Salk, a name no one ever heard of until this \ngreat researcher came up with a vaccine for polio. When we were in \ngrade school as children and saw our fellow students crippled by polio, \nin fear that it could strike us, Jonas Salk, this researcher, came \nforward with that vaccine and he changed our lives. He took a burden \noff of our lives and the lives of our parents who worried about whether \ntheir kids would contract polio.\n  Why can't we give the same hope and same promise to a new generation \nof Americans with stem cell research? Why is our Government, why is \nthis administration, why is the President blocking this research, and \nwhy won't the Senate Republican leadership bring this bill to the \nfloor?\n  If this is about National Health Care Week, shouldn't we be talking \nabout medical research? Shouldn't we be talking about new cures and new \nopportunities so people can have a better life? Unfortunately, we are \nnot.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for another question?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. REID. Does the Senator acknowledge that Jonas Salk and others \ndoing this research had the full support of the Federal Government \nevery step of the way on this very delicate, deliberate, tough path \nthey followed to find a cure?\n  Mr. DURBIN. That is exactly the point we should remember when it \ncomes to stem cell research. How much better would our research be if \nthis Government stood behind efforts to find cures instead of creating \nthese obstacles?\n  When President Bush made his announcement--and I believe it was in \nAugust of 2001--about stem cell research, he did not take an absolute \nposition saying he was opposed to stem cell research because it was \nimmoral or for some other reason; he said he would allow stem cell \nresearch to continue along certain stem cell lines that currently \nexist. But in making that announcement, he restricted the opportunity \nto expand that research in our country. It was a Government decision to \nrestrict the research into stem cells that could save lives and change \nlives dramatically. So I would say that what we face in the Senate is a \nmoral imperative. Will we step forward now, 1 year after the House has \npassed this legislation? Will we put the bill on the floor and vote it \nup or down?\n  I can tell you, in the city of Chicago and in the State of Illinois, \nI have traveled around and met with many people who are counting on us.\n  I had a little gathering in Chicago at the Chicago Rehab Institute, \none of the best in America, and we had people come in who were \ninterested in this issue. We had folks from the American Diabetes \nAssociation who believe stem cell research may offer the opportunity \nfor a cure for some forms of diabetes. As more and more people are \nstricken with this disease, as their lives are compromised and changed, \ncan we deny them this opportunity?\n  Others came in suffering from Parkinson's. Parkinson's is a disease \nwhich I know a little bit about personally because of one of my closest \nfriends in Congress, Lane Evans, the Congressman from Rock Island, IL. \nHe and I came to the Congress in the same year of 1982. In 1996, I was \nout campaigning with Lane in a parade in Galesburg, IL. I didn't \nrealize it at the time, but Lane felt that day that something was wrong \nwith him. He wasn't sure what it was. He said he had lost the feeling \nin his hand. He didn't say anything that day, and it wasn't until \nseveral years later that the diagnosis was made that he suffers from \nParkinson's. He has been a real profile in courage. He has stood up and \nrepresented the people of his district, and he has been very honest \nabout his disease and how it has limited his life.\n  We were all saddened just a few weeks ago when Lane made the public \nannouncement that he couldn't continue, that he would have to withdraw \nhis name from the ballot this year. This young man--this young man--is \ngoing to have his life changed dramatically because of Parkinson's. Can \nwe do anything less than push for medical research for those who may be \nsuffering from Parkinson's or threatened by it? Does it make us a \nbetter or more moral people to withhold this research that can hold \nsuch promise for these people?\n\n  The same thing is true with Alzheimer's. As more and more Americans \nadvance in age, Alzheimer's is more prevalent. We find more instances \nof people in nursing homes who need special care. There is a chance, \nthere is a good chance, that stem cell research may open some doors and \nsome avenues to at least ameliorating the negative aspects of this \nAlzheimer's disease and maybe someday find a cure. How long can we \nwait? How long can we wait for the political leaders in the Senate to \nwake up to reality? The American people are counting on us.\n  If we wonder why the American voters are cynical, whether they \nquestion if this Congress has any value in their lives, take a look at \nthis issue. For a year we have been sitting on a bill the majority \nleader in the Senate says he supports. He won't call up the stem cell \nresearch bill. I could go through a long list of other bills he has \ncalled, some that I consider just plain wrong, and others \ninsignificant. They have taken the place of stem cell research. Why? \nNext week we are going to deal with Health Care Week. I salute Senator \nEnzi, the Senator from Wyoming. He wants to talk about health \ninsurance. I don't agree with his approach. I have an alternative. I \nsalute him for coming to the Senate floor and pushing this forward. Why \ncan't we get the same leadership from the Republican leader of the \nSenate when it comes to stem cell research? How can we have a National \nHealth Care Week and not deal with medical research after we promised \nover a year to do so?\n  I take a look at the people who came to that meeting in Chicago and \nremember so well a young man, a very young man in a wheelchair \nsuffering from Lou Gehrig's disease, a handsome fellow with a beautiful \nyoung wife. He broke down in tears because he could barely speak. He \nwas losing control of his body even as he sat there, telling me how \ncritically important medical research was. Anyone who has seen a victim \nof Lou Gehrig's disease, whether it was the late Senator Jacob Javits \nof New York or, of course, the late Lou Gehrig himself, as we saw his \nbaseball career come to an end, understands how devastating this can \nbe. The only thing that keeps many going is the hope, the chance that a \ncure will be found. Where is that hope? Where is that cure? It is \nburied in the calendar of the Senate. It is buried in the calendar of \nthe Senate because the leadership will not call up stem cell research \nfor a vote.\n  Instead, Senator Frist is going to bring the issue of medical \nmalpractice to the floor again next week. It has been brought over and \nover again. After days have been devoted to debate, it has been stopped \nbecause many believe this is an issue of State responsibility and not \nan issue for the Federal Government. Yet he wants to take up several \ndays on the Senate calendar, several days which may ultimately lead to \nno conclusion on the issue of medical malpractice. Wouldn't it be \nbetter to devote those days, 3 of those days, to stem cell research?\n\n[[Page S4001]]\n\n  Think about it. As we avoid our responsibility in stem cell research, \nthe medical challenges are still there. All across the United States, \nloving couples who were unable to conceive a child have turned to in \nvitro fertilization. Beautiful young babies have resulted, children who \nare loved and cherished because of the advances of science.\n  But during the course of this in vitro fertilization, spare \nfertilized eggs are produced. What will happen to those eggs? In many \ninstances they will be thrown away, destroyed on the spot. Instead of \ndestroying them, wouldn't it be better to take the embryonic stem cells \nfrom those same eggs and use them to find a cure for Alzheimer's, for \nParkinson's, for diabetes, for Lou Gehrig's disease, to see if we can \nregenerate spinal cord injuries and give people who are crippled and \nparalyzed a chance?\n  Let me tell you the story of one of those people right now. He is \nfrom Germantown, IL, which I know pretty well, down around my home area \nof East St. Louis. His name is Matt Langenhorst. Matt was 31 years old. \nHe was a picture of health, a 6-foot-4-inch police officer. In the year \n2001, he and his wife were hit by a car. Matt is now paralyzed from the \nneck down. His wife is his full-time caregiver.\n  Today, Matt moves his wheelchair by blowing into a tube. Simple \nthings that we take for granted take Matt minutes and hours to \naccomplish. Almost everything in his life requires assistance.\n  When he was injured, Matt and his family were certain that research \nwas promising that he would walk again. They were counting on medical \nresearch. That was 5 years ago--5 years paralyzed.\n  His family was in my office this week asking why we have not done \nmore. They wanted to know what we were doing about stem cell research. \nThis bill passed the House of Representatives with Democrats and \nRepublicans. What are we waiting for?\n  I can't answer that question. I don't know what could be more \nimportant from the Republican majority point of view than to move \nforward with this critical stem cell research. I think the Senate \nshould pass H.R. 810 as quickly as possible. Perhaps we should set \naside some of the other pets and favorites for a few moments and \naddress this issue of medical research. So many people are counting on \nus.\n  When we look at the budget that the President has just sent us, sadly \nI am afraid medical research is not the priority it once was. I was \nhere when, on a bipartisan basis, Congressman John Porter, Republican \nfrom Illinois; Senator Arlen Specter, Republican from Pennsylvania; \nSenator Tom Harkin, Democrat from Iowa, all agreed we would double the \nbudget for the National Institutes of Health so that they could find \nmore cures, there would be more money to be invested in research.\n  What happened last year? We froze the budget. We decided not to \nincrease it. In this year's budget, sadly, the President did the same \nthing. This year's budget from President Bush to Capitol Hill cuts \nfunding for 18 of the 19 institutes at the National Institutes of \nHealth.\n\n  What does that mean? It means 642 fewer research projects will be \nundertaken, 642 projects trying to find cures for cancer, heart \ndisease, stroke, muscular dystrophy, and so many other terrible \ndisorders. What greater priority is there for this country than medical \nresearch? What can we possibly think is more important than advancing \nresearch?\n  I met recently with some scientific investigators who said: You know, \nI am worried, worried if we don't invest in research the young people \nwho should be developing the expertise will not have the incentive to \ndo it. They will be afraid the NIH won't be able to fund the important \nprojects they can devote their lives to.\n  The President has decided first to stop stem cell research, to limit \nit to a very small number of stem cell lines that are inadequate to the \ntask of developing cures for disease, and then to cut the budget for \nmedical research at the National Institutes of Health. The President \ndoes this at the same time that he is calling for tax cuts for the most \nwealthy people in America, people who have not even asked for a tax \ncut. Why in the world would we build up the debt of America and cut \nback on essentials such as medical research and education and health \ncare to provide a tax cut for the wealthiest people in America? The \npriorities are just wrong. The Bush policies, when it comes to medical \nresearch, are wrong. They are moving America in a wrong direction. They \nare moving us away from finding cures and bringing hope to those who \nare afflicted with disease.\n  Sadly, we have to change that direction. We have to say to the \nPresident we don't accept this Bush policy. It is wrong when it comes \nto medical research, and that decision and that statement has to be \nmade right here on the Senate floor with 100 men and women elected from \nacross the United States to speak for the people who are waiting in \nhope, people like those I have described--people like that couple in \nGermantown, IL, the Langenhorsts, Matt and Erika. I don't know if they \nare following this debate. I hope they are. More important, I hope this \ndebate leads to something positive.\n  Next week, when Senator Frist wants to bring up national health care, \nwe are going to make an effort on the floor of the Senate to bring up \nstem cell research. It is about time he faces the reality. We can't put \nthis off any longer. He has promised time to deal with so many issues--\nimmigration and so many other things. He said he wants to set aside a \ncertain piece of our schedule and devote it to a debate on gay \nmarriage, a constitutional amendment on gay marriage. We want to spend \na week or so talking about gay marriage.\n  What is more important? Stem cell research and medical research to \nfind cures, that we spend the time to get that done, or 4 or 5 days on \ngay marriage? Honest to goodness, when it comes down to the priorities \nand values of the Republican leadership, I don't understand it.\n  They also want to consider a constitutional amendment on flag \nburning. You know, I have not noticed an epidemic of flag burning \nacross America. I love our flag like every other American, but we are \ngoing to devote 3 or 4 or 5 days to talk about another constitutional \namendment to ban flag burning? I would much rather see us put as a \nfirst priority medical research and stem cell research.\n  We are prepared to challenge Senator Frist. Every time he comes up \nwith a clearly political issue designed strictly for votes in November \nrather than for the needs of this Nation, we are going to challenge \nhim. We are going to challenge him to bring up the issues that count, \nissues like stem cell research, issues like the energy costs across \nAmerica that have to be addressed here and now, issues like the cost of \nhealth insurance, which not only threatens families but threatens the \nfuture of many businesses, particularly small businesses. Those are the \nreal issues. Those are the things that people care about.\n  Instead, we fritter away our time, we waste our time on virtually \ninsignificant issues such as this political posturing for the next \nelection. This stem cell research issue is a bipartisan issue. There \nare Republican and Democratic Senators who support it. It is a chance \nfor us to stand up once as an institution and be proud that we have a \nbipartisan solution to advance medical research in America. But, \nunfortunately, we have not been able to prevail. Unfortunately, for 346 \ndays now we have waited for Senator Frist to call the bill on stem cell \nresearch.\n  That is his responsibility. That is the responsibility of the \nRepublican majority. I hope they accept that responsibility. Senator \nFrist, more than any other Member of the Senate, understands the \nimportance of medical research. He is an honored cardio surgeon, a \ntransplant surgeon who brings his special expertise to the floor of the \nSenate. When he announced he was for stem cell research, it was a \nbreakthrough. It was a breakthrough that on the Republican side, a man \nof his stature would say that he supports it. Now that he has made that \ncommitment almost a year ago, it is time for us to act, and act now. We \nneed to make sure we restore the budget for the National Institutes of \nHealth. We need to move this bill forward.\n  If we start cutting the NIH budget, advances that have saved lives in \nheart disease and Leukemia, cystic fibrosis, and so many other areas, \nthose advances will slow down. It is just that simple. Medical research \nis slow. It takes time, and it costs money. But it\n\n[[Page S4002]]\n\nsaves lives. It means a mom or dad with an incurable disease can live \nlong enough so their kids will remember them.\n  Between the prohibition on stem cell research and the cuts to NIH \nfunding, lifesaving medical research under the Bush administration in \nthis country is sadly on the ropes. We can do something about it. We \ncan pass H.R. 810. We can tell President Bush that his budget \npriorities are wrong, that we are going to put the money into stem cell \nresearch.\n  There are unused embryonic stem cells in eggs donated voluntarily by \ncouples who no longer need them, which can be used for this valuable \nresearch. Otherwise they will be discarded, thrown way. Estimates \nsuggest there are 400,000 of these unused embryonic stem cells \ncurrently available for research. What is stopping those cells from \nmoving from storage in these frozen environments to laboratories where \nthey may find cures? The decision of the President of the United States \nto stop the research. When we lift this restriction on Federal research \ndollars, it will provide stem cells that medical science tells us have \nthe ability to change lives and save lives and to transform into almost \nevery type of cell and tissue. Research will show us how to harness \nthat ability to heal and repair damage done by disease.\n  We owe it to the families of those who are affected by disease and \ndisability. The stem cell issue will not go away. I urge Senator Frist \nto show the same leadership today that he showed last year when he \nannounced his support for stem cell research by announcing when he will \nschedule this for a vote, give us a time certain, do not leave the \nfloor of the Senate today without a time certain on a vote on stem cell \nresearch. We owe it to the millions of families across America who are \ncounting on us.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Isakson). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, today I come to the Senate floor to speak \nbriefly about stem cell research and the hope it holds for millions of \nAmericans in the years ahead.\n  Hope is one of the qualities of spirit that make us human. Hope \nallows us to dream of a better life for our children, our community, \nand our world, especially for loved ones now suffering or in pain.\n  Hope is what stem cell research holds for the parents of children \nwith diabetes, who dream of a day when their constant fears for their \nchildren's well-being are things of the past.\n  Hope is what stem cell research brings to those with Parkinson's \ndisease, who think of the time when the tremors of that disease are \nbanished forever.\n  Hope is what stem cell research brings to millions of Americans who \nseek better treatments and better drugs for cancer, diabetes, spinal \ninjury, and many other serious conditions.\n  Hope cannot be extinguished or destroyed but it can be frozen. And it \nhas now been frozen for 5 long years, ever since President Bush shut \ndown the stem cell research program begun in the Clinton \nadministration, and imposed arbitrary and unwarranted restrictions on \nthis lifesaving research, based on ideology, instead of science.\n  For 5 years, we have watched as America has abdicated its global \nleadership in this important new field, by keeping our best scientists \non the sidelines.\n  In those 5 years, we have squandered the opportunity to set strong \nethical guidelines for this research through the oversight that NIH \nfunding can bring. Through NIH, we have made progress consistent with \nour values in new fields of in as recombinant DNA research, which once \nalso seemed strange and controversial. We can do the same for stem cell \nresearch but only if NIH is allowed to become a leader in this new \nfield.\n  Hope soared anew a year ago, when the House of Representatives set \naside partisan differences and courageously approved legislation to end \nthose restrictions, and give our scientists the tools they need to make \nprogress in the fight against disease.\n  The same strong bipartisan support exists in the Senate for ending \nthe unwarranted restrictions on stem cell research.\n  There is no one in the Senate with stronger pro-life credentials than \nSenator Hatch, but he knows that supporting stem cell research is the \npro-life position to take.\n  There is no greater supporter of medical research in the Senate than \nSenator Specter, and he feels strongly that stem cell research is one \nof the great breakthroughs of modern medicine.\n  There is no one with a greater depth of conscience than Senator \nSmith, and he has searched his heart and prayerfully decided that \nsupport for stem cell research is the moral choice.\n  Bipartisan legislation was passed by a vote of 238 to 194 in the \nHouse of Representatives on May 24, 2005, a year ago this month. It was \nordered placed on the Senate Calendar on June 6, where it has remained \nstalled ever since. If the House bill was put to a Senate vote today or \ntomorrow or next week, it would pass by a solid bipartisan majority in \nthe Senate too.\n  Why? Because the Republican Senate leadership stands in the way. \nSummer came and went with no action in the Senate, then the winter, \nthen the spring, and now we are about to reach an anniversary none of \nus ever wanted to see. On May 24, it will be 1 year since the House \nacted, and the Senate still refuses to act.\n  Let us vow that we will not mark this anniversary with yet more \ninaction and indifference.\n  The Senate has had a busy schedule, but in that schedule we have \nfound time for all manner of giveaways to those who already have much \nin the way of wealth and power.\n  Now, it is time to turn our attention to those who need our help the \nmost. And that includes the millions of Americans who have seen their \nhopes blocked by the administration's cruel policies and the Senate's \nshameful inaction.\n  The Senate leadership has scheduled a Health Week for later this \nmonth. Will we use this opportunity to debate the flawed Medicare drug \nprogram? Or the soaring number of the uninsured? Will we do what we \nneed to do to unlock the vast potential of stem cell research? Sadly, \nthe answer to each of these questions is probably no. These and many \nother major priorities for the Nation will remain unaddressed.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in asking the Senate leadership to \nschedule a vote on House Resolution 810, the House-passed stem cell \nresearch bill, during the coming Health Week and to do so before May \n24, the first year anniversary of its approval by the House of \nRepresentatives.\n  Millions of patients and their families look with hope to stem cell \nresearch, and they should not have to tolerate any greater delay or any \nfurther failures.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority time is 19 minutes 10 seconds.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/04/senate-section/article/S4002-1", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4002-S4005]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         NORTH KOREAN REFUGEES\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I will draw attention to two topics \ntoday. I will address the comments made about stem cell research \nbecause we have exciting things happening in that field that I will \nreport to my colleagues.\n  First though, there is breaking news, with Reuters, the Associated \nPress, and several other outlets reporting that shortly we may have a \ngroup of North Korean refugees formally accepted by the United States \nfor the first time since the Korean peninsula was divided by war over \nhalf a century ago. This is being reported by a couple of news outlets. \nI ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the news report \nand a related article.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Associated Press, May 3, 2006]\n\n               Officials: U.S. Assists N. Korean Refugees\n\n                            (By Foster Klug)\n\n       Washington.--The Bush administration is working to bring a \n     group of North Korean\n\n[[Page S4003]]\n\n     refugees to the United States and could have them in the \n     country within two weeks, a State Department official said \n     Wednesday.\n       The group would be the first from North Korea given \n     official refugee status since passage of the North Korean \n     Human Rights Act in 2004, officials say.\n       The State Department official, who spoke on condition of \n     anonymity because of the issue's sensitivity, said the \n     refugees are in a Southeast Asian nation, and if bureaucratic \n     hurdles can be cleared, they could be in the United States \n     soon.\n       A separate U.S. government source said the six refugees \n     include several women who were sold into sexual slavery or \n     forced marriages. The source, who also spoke on condition of \n     anonymity, has been in contact with a person who helped \n     shepherd the refugees into the Southeast Asian nation and who \n     has had regular contact with them.\n       Both officials would not identify the nation, saying they \n     were worried the refugees or their families could be harmed \n     by North Korean agents. Officials also worry that publicity \n     could slow down or scuttle the painstaking bureaucratic \n     process that must be completed before the refugees can leave \n     the Southeast Asian nation for the United States.\n       The issue of North Korean human rights has gained attention \n     in Washington as international diplomatic efforts to rid the \n     North of its nuclear weapons programs have stalled.\n       Lawmakers and human rights activists have expressed \n     frustration at the State Department's slow pace in helping \n     North Korean refugees settle in the United States; part of \n     the North Korean Human Rights Act specifies that the \n     department make it easier for North Koreans to apply for \n     refugee status.\n       The U.S. special envoy on North Korean human rights, Jay \n     Lefkowitz, told a congressional hearing last week: ``We need \n     to do more--and we can and will do more--for the North Korean \n     refugees.''\n       ``We will press to make it clear to our friends and allies \n     in the region that we are prepared to accept North Korean \n     refugees for resettlement here,'' he said.\n       President Bush appointed Lefkowitz last year.\n       North Korea long has been accused of torture, public \n     executions and other atrocities against its people. Between \n     150,000 and 200,000 people are believed to be held in prison \n     camps for political reasons, the State Department said in a \n     report last year.\n       Human rights activists have said that U.S. Embassy workers \n     in Asian countries have refused to help North Korean \n     refugees.\n       Last year, Timothy Peters, founder of Helping Hands Korea, \n     told lawmakers at a hearing that embassy officials in Beijing \n     rebuffed him when he tried to arrange help for a 17-year-old \n     North Korean refugee.\n       ``I thought to myself, `Is this the State Department's \n     implementation of the North Korean Human Rights Act?' '' he \n     said.\n                                  ____\n\n\n           North Korea: Policy Changes May Foster New Hunger\n\n       Seoul, May 4, 2006.--Recent decisions by the North Korean \n     government to suspend the operation of the World Food \n     Programme, ban the private sale of grain, and fully reinstate \n     the discredited Public Distribution System could lead to \n     renewed hunger for North Korea's already poor and destitute \n     people, Human Rights Watch said in a new report released \n     today.\n       The 34-page report, ``A Matter of Survival: The North \n     Korean Government's Control of Food and the Risk of Hunger,'' \n     examines recent worrisome developments in North Korea's food \n     policies, its marginalization of the World Food Programme \n     (WFP), its refusal to allow adequate monitoring of food aid, \n     and the implications of the government's new policies. Human \n     Rights Watch noted that only a decade ago, similar policies \n     led to the famine that killed anywhere from 580,000 to more \n     than 3 million, according to independent researchers and \n     nongovernmental organizations (NGOs).\n       ``While most international discussion of North Korea is \n     about nuclear weapons, hunger remains a serious problem,'' \n     said Brad Adams, Asia director at Human Rights Watch. \n     ``Regressive policies from a government that doesn't allow \n     free expression or independent observers to monitor the \n     situation could someday lead to a repeat of the food crisis \n     of the 1990s.''\n       In October 2005, North Korea reversed some of its most \n     applauded economic reforms by banning the private buying and \n     selling of grain, the main source of nutrition for most North \n     Koreans. The government asked the WFP, which had been feeding \n     millions of the nation's most vulnerable people for a decade, \n     to end emergency food aid. The agency believes the request is \n     premature, and proposed a new, considerably smaller aid \n     package. The North Korean government had not formally \n     accepted the offer as of the end of April.\n       The government also announced in October that it was fully \n     reinstating the Public Distribution System (PDS), which \n     provided coupons for food and consumer goods to North Koreans \n     through their places of work or study. During the food crisis \n     of the 1990s, millions of people who depended on their PDS \n     rations died from starvation. Many more suffered severe \n     malnutrition and hunger as the system broke down. The crisis \n     ended by massive amounts of international food aid and the \n     tolerance of private markets, helped in recent years by \n     improved harvests.\n       ``Forcing the World Food Programme to radically reduce its \n     food shipments and monitoring, and making it illegal for \n     ordinary North Koreans to buy and sell grain, is a recipe for \n     disaster,'' said Adams.\n       Recent news reports suggest that North Koreans in many \n     parts of the country were not receiving rations, six months \n     after the authorities announced they were fully reinstating \n     the PDS. A Chinese man of Korean descent who recently visited \n     his relatives in the northeastern part of North Korea told \n     Human Rights Watch that none of the five homes he visited had \n     received any rations since November 2005. ``They received \n     half a month's worth of corn for the months of October and \n     November, but that was it,'' he said. ``And that, I heard, \n     was only for working men, and nobody else in the families.''\n       The South Korean NGO Good Friends also reported in the \n     April edition of its monthly newsletter, North Korea Today, \n     that residents of Pyongyang received only 10 days of food \n     rations in April. Citing an unnamed official at Pyongyang's \n     food management administration, the report said that in May \n     there would be no rations at all.\n       North Korea has a long history of providing food on a \n     priority basis, feeding the preferred class, such as Workers' \n     Party members and high-ranking military, intelligence and \n     police officers, while discriminating against the so-called \n     hostile class. If past patterns hold true this year, the \n     government will first send food to ``war-preparation \n     storage'' and preferred citizens, and only then to the \n     general public through the PDS, leaving many North Koreans \n     hungry.\n       Until the famine in the 1990s, food rationing was perhaps \n     the single most important way of controlling the population \n     in North Korea. As people could receive rations only from \n     their place of work or study, the system largely kept the \n     population immobile and obedient, so that they wouldn't risk \n     losing their only source of food.\n       ``The government is apparently trying to turn back the \n     clock to regain some of the control lost when it allowed \n     people greater freedom to move around and buy grain,'' said \n     Adams. ``The government should reverse its new policies, \n     which make it harder for hungry people to find the food they \n     need to survive and stay healthy.''\n       The government should prioritize assisting the vulnerable \n     population by providing aid to those who can't obtain food \n     through their work. North Korea should allow international \n     monitors unfettered access to beneficiaries. Major food \n     donors, including China and South Korea, should monitor \n     distribution of their aid in a way that meets international \n     standards as employed by the WFP.\n       Human Rights Watch urged the North Korean government to:\n       Allow international humanitarian agencies, including the \n     WFP, to resume necessary food supply operations and to \n     properly monitor aid according to normal international \n     protocols for transparency and accountability;\n       Ensure its distribution system is both fair and adequately \n     supplied, or permit citizens to obtain food in alternative \n     ways, through direct access to markets or humanitarian aid; \n     and\n       End discrimination in the distribution of food in favor of \n     high-ranking Workers' Party officials, military, intelligence \n     and police officers, and against the ``hostile'' class deemed \n     politically disloyal to the government and Party.\n       Human Rights Watch takes no position on whether countries \n     should have market or command economies. But it is clear from \n     the devastating famine and pervasive hunger of the past--well \n     documented by the United Nations and NGOs--that the PDS and \n     the country's official food industry have miserably failed \n     North Korean.\n       ``Millions of North Koreans died painful deaths from \n     starvation while the rationing system was in place,'' said \n     Adams. ``There is little reason to believe the North Korean \n     government is now capable of providing enough food to all its \n     citizens.''\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I certainly hope and pray the reports are true. I hope \nthat the six to eight refugees being referred to in the articles will \nsoon have a chance to be welcomed by thousands of Americans who have \nworked hard for their freedom, especially those of Korean heritage in \nthis country.\n  I particularly recognize the Korean Church Coalition and a number of \npeople who risked their own lives to form an underground railroad of \nsorts--reminiscent of what happened in my State and many other places \nacross this country years ago--along the Korean-Chinese border. We have \na fairly open border between Korea and China. You can get from North \nKorea into China, but you cannot get out of China. The Chinese have, to \ndate, not been very cooperative in allowing North Korean refugees to \npass. They have even captured North Korean refugees and sent them back \nto North Korea to an uncertain future and possible death, and in many \ncases, as well as a lot of persecution and mistreatment in a North \nKorean gulag, of which we have satellite photographs. I have held \nhearings on gulags containing, we believe, around 200,000 North \nKoreans. We also\n\n[[Page S4004]]\n\nbelieve, over the last 15 years, approximately 10 percent of the North \nKorean population has died, primarily of starvation, although also from \nthe gulags and at political prisoner camps.\n  The people are walking out of North Korea. They are walking into \nChina. We do not know how many, but the estimates have been as many as \n100,000 to 300,000. They are now living off the land there in an \nillegal status, in great difficulty, and in harm's way in China.\n  If we get these refugees coming into the United States, they will be \nthe first refugees coming into the United States. It is built on the \nNorth Korean Human Rights Act, which this Senate and this Nation passed \na year and a half ago, allowing these refugees from North Korea to \nenter into the United States.\n  The act basically builds on what took place toward the Soviet Union \nbefore it had collapsed where we were in negotiations on nuclear talks, \nwe were not getting anywhere, and we raised human rights issues of what \ntook place regarding two Soviet dissidents in the Soviet Union.\n  We said it was not fair how they are treating their own people. The \nsame thing is happening in North Korea in how North Korea is treating \ntheir own people, to the point this oppressive regime of Kim John is \ntrying to build weapons of mass destruction; they are a weapon of mass \ndestruction on their own people, killing, as I noted, we believe around \n2 million North Koreans through starvation. This is abhorrent.\n  If the refugees do come to the United States, this is a moment of \ncelebration, even though it is only a few. It is a statement by this \ncountry that we will not tolerate the mistreatment of people taking \nplace in North Korea. I applaud this effort.\n  I applaud the administration for working on this particular topic, \nand particularly Jay Lefkowitz, the special envoy from the \nadministration on human rights in North Korea.\n  If reports this morning from Reuters and the Associated Press as well \nas various other news outlets prove to be accurate, we may shortly have \na group of North Korean refugees formally accepted by the United States \nfor the first time since the Korean peninsula was divided by war over \nhalf a century ago.\n  I hope and pray that these reports are true, and I hope that the six \nto eight refugees referred to in the articles will soon have a chance \nto be welcomed by the thousands of Americans who have worked so hard \nfor their freedom, especially by those of Korean heritage.\n  A year and a half ago, Congress passed and President Bush signed into \nlaw the North Korean Human Rights Act. It was the first significant \npiece of legislation dealing with that nation's dictatorial regime \nsince the cessation of hostilities in July 1953. The act called for a \nU.S. policy on North Korea based on a commitment and respect for human \nrights and human dignity, and fundamental freedoms, including the \nfreedom of thought, conscience religion or belief. By referring in the \nact to core Helsinki principles adopted in 1975 that informed and \nanimated our dealings with then Soviet Union and its eventual \ndissolution and the resulting freedom for millions without a single \nshot being fired, the act similarly commits the United States to pursue \nin North Korea the same devotion to human dignity and human rights.\n  Yet since the passage of the North Korean Human Rights Act, the \nnegotiating approach has been to subordinate the human rights and human \ndignity of the North Korean people. Instead, what we have done is to \npin our hopes on the possibility of another framework agreement in \nwhich the parties would be coerced yet again into tossing more \nlifelines to a fragile but oppressive regime in Pyongyang in exchange \nfor the possible exchange of yet another promise not to use weapons of \nmass destruction.\n  In none of these negotiations have we been able to engage in talks--\neither in the multiparty context or even unofficial bilateral \ndiscussions--on issues that promote and do justice to both American and \nuniversal ideals. Rather than focusing the debate on the regime's \npolicies of persecution and starvation and to the massive failure of \nits economic policies that in the mid-90s directly resulted in the \ndeaths of millions of North Koreans, the parties have done little to \nstrengthen democracy and promote human rights in North Korea.\n  I appreciate that there are strong political pressures especially \nfrom our allies to negotiate over the North Korean regime's so-called \n``peace for security'' demand. And in the interest of searching for a \ndiplomatic solution, the President and Secretary Rice have done \nprecisely that. In fact, the recent rounds of six party talks were the \nmost sustained effort by the United States.\n  But the President himself has also done much more, in both word and \ndeed. In the past 2 months, the President released two of the most \nremarkable statements of his presidency. Last month, the President \ncalled to attention China's treatment of a North Korean refugee named \nKim Chun Hee. Missing since December, when Miss Kim was arrested in \nChina and deported back to North Korea, it isn't known whether she is \ndead or alive. As the President's envoy for North Korean Human Rights \nJay Lefkowitz said of Miss Chun in a Wall Street Journal editorial, \n``Every movement needs heroes. . . . Either she will be a living figure \nin a jail somewhere or, God forbid, she'll be a martyr.'' As far as I \nknow, we have no word from the Chinese Government and certainly not \nfrom the North Koreans on the fate of Miss Chun.\n  The President also issued a statement after a meeting that he himself \ncalled one of the most moving of his presidency. He spoke of a grieving \nmother and brother who yearned to be united with her daughter and his \nsister, Megumi, who was only 13 when she was abducted by the North \nKorean regime more than 30 years ago; he met with a young child of 6 \nnamed Han Mee Lee who with her family were at the center of an \ninternational controversy created by vivid video footage of their \nvaliant struggle for freedom at the gates of an embassy in China; and \nhe met with a former North Korean soldier who defected to South Korea \nin pursuit of what his conscience and his heart told him were his \ninalienable and God-given right to liberty and freedom.\n  I ask unanimous consent at this time that this statement by the \nPresident be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n Statement on China's Treatment of Kim Chun-Hee by the Press Secretary\n\n       The United States is gravely concerned about China's \n     treatment of Kim Chun-Hee. Despite U.S., South Korean, and \n     UNHCR attempts to raise this case with the Chinese, Ms. Kim, \n     an asylum seeker in her thirties, was deported to North Korea \n     after being arrested in December for seeking refuge at two \n     Korean schools in China. We are deeply concerned about Ms. \n     Kim's well-being. The United States notes China's obligations \n     as a party to the U.N. Convention relating to the Status of \n     Refugees and its 1967 Protocol, and believes that China must \n     take those obligations seriously. We also call upon the \n     Government of China not to return North Korean asylum seekers \n     without allowing UNHCR access to these vulnerable \n     individuals.\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Last July, the President also met with Kang Chol Hwan, \nwhose book the Aquariams of Pyongyang, chronicled Mr. Kang's life as a \n9-year-old gulag inmate to his eventual freedom. Just as Natan \nScharansky was Reagan's symbol of what freedom from the Soviet \ncommunist system meant to free people everywhere, Kang is Bush's symbol \nof what freedom means to North Koreans.\n  History will record these acts by President Bush to unilaterally \nbroaden the narrow agenda of the Six-Party Talks as among the wisest \nand humane--acts that trump and negate the false perception that the \nPresident is indifferent to concerns about human rights in North Korea. \nThese bold and compassionate acts will figuratively place on the \nbargaining table--if the Six Party Talks are to ever resume--the faces \nand names of North Koreans who have suffered and continue to do so.\n  By so publicly raising human rights issues to the highest level, the \nOval Office of the President no less, President Bush is merely \nfollowing the examples set by President Reagan and Pope John Paul \nduring their struggles with a much larger and more threatening nuclear \npower.\n  We may now have an opportunity--if the press reports are accurate--to \ntake an additional but necessary step to demonstrate not just by words \nbut by\n\n[[Page S4005]]\n\naction what human rights mean. We need to accept North Korean refugees \ninto the United States as provided by the North Korean Human Rights \nAct.\n  That it appears to have taken more than a year and half for the \npossibility of officially accepting North Korea refugees has been \ntroubling to Members of Congress on both sides of the aisle. In a \nbipartisan letter to Secretary Rice, Congressman Frank Wolf and others \ncalled on the administration to do more. And last year, both \nCongressman Wolf and I wrote to Secretary General Kofi Annan to \npressure China into allowing UNHCR, the U.N. agency for refugees, into \nYanji Province near the North Korean border and other affected areas to \nassess the situation with respect to the North Korean refugees.\n  I was disappointed to learn that the first report required under the \nNorth Korean Human Rights Act was issued with the statement that no \nprogress had been made on accepting refugees. As the act makes clear, \nadmission would be conditioned upon a thorough vetting process by DHS \nand other appropriate agencies. But without any action by us, it is \ndifficult for us to demand that the Chinese should also change its \npolicies, and it presents a problem for us in asking other countries to \ndo the right thing if we have not been able to do the same. If the U.S. \ncannot admit what may be less than 10 refugees in total if the press \nreports are correct, then the whole premise of the act itself is \nunsustainable.\n  I am hopeful that this may be changing and I hope it is changing. The \nhopes and prayers of thousands in the faith community and among Korean \nAmerican communities are vested in this possibility of the first \nadmission of North Korean refugees into the United States.\n  If and when these people come, it will offer hope to millions and put \nAmerican on the right side of history. Such an act is consistent with \nthe bold steps that Ronald Reagan took and Pope John Paul urged during \nthe years of the cold war, and in the process made the world a better \nplace.\n  If ever there were huddled masses yearning to be free, it's the North \nKoreans, whether hiding out in the forests of China or working as \ntrafficked victims in brothels or as orphans prowling marketplaces for \ncrumbs.\n  If these refugees are granted refuge in the United States, it would \nconstitute one of the great acts of compassion by this nation.\n  And I hope we take this opportunity to lift our lamps and show a way \nout of the darkness for the North Korean refugees.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/04/senate-section/article/S4005-1", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4005-S4006]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               STEM CELLS\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK.

Mr. President, noting for the record the actual \nspending in 2005 on embryonic stem cell research, the U.S. Federal \nGovernment spent nearly $40 million on human embryonic stem cell \nresearch. We spent $97 million on nonhuman embryonic stem cell \nresearch, for a total of $136 million the Federal Government spent on \nembryonic stem cell research.\n  That is a fair investment. We also spent $472 million in \nnonembryonic. What did we get for $136 million in embryonic stem cell \nresearch? Here is the folder that contains the human clinical trials of \nembryonic stem cell research in humans, treating and healing humans. \nThis is the list of research results we have from a nearly $40 million \nFederal investment last year of human clinical trials with embryonic \nstem cell research. This is research where a young, embryonic human \nlife is destroyed and stem cells harvested and taken out and applied.\n  I note that this folder is empty. This is the list of research \nresults we have from embryonic stem cell research on humans.\n  We also invested in adult and cord blood stem cell research.

What did we get for our research investment in adult \nand cord blood in human clinical trials?

We are seeing a lot of cancer cells growing out \nof the embryonic stem cell areas and treatments.\n  Let's go for what is real. And let's do what is real. I further note, \nas I close, there is no prohibition in this country on embryonic stem \ncell research. None. No prohibitions. Yet why do the private companies \nnot go into funding more embryonic stem cell research? It is because \nthey are getting no results with embryonic stem cells. Nothing is \nhappening results wise. Let's invest our money in adult stem cell \nresearch where we can actually treat people. That is important.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/04/senate-section/article/S4006-1", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4006-S4007]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                GASOLINE\n\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, there has been a lot of concern around the \ncountry about the escalating fuel prices. Americans get concerned \nwhenever we see spikes in energy costs. No one is more concerned than \nwe are in agriculture. We have a unique situation in agriculture. We \nsell wholesale, buy retail, and pay the freight both ways. Every one of \nthose stages involves energy, drives energy and drives prices.\n  It seems to me we are concerned about the traffic around Washington, \nDC, trying to get into work. I could take care of the gas prices and \nthe traffic all in one fell swoop. All we have to do is pass a law that \nyou cannot cross the 14th Street bridge with a car that is not paid \nfor. That would help a lot. There would be a lot of folks finding other \nmeans.\n  This has been a wakeup call to all in this country. We are dealing \nwith a worldwide commodity that is driven by emerging economies as well \nas our own demand for transportation fuels. The demand has outstripped \nour ability to move crude, natural gas or coal to the processing plants \nand refineries.\n  I tell my colleagues that in Montana we are producing more oil than \nin the history of our State. Yet we cannot get it on a pipeline because \nwe have not built a pipeline for quite a while. We have also not built \na new refinery in this country for over 30 years. There are a variety \nof reasons, the majority of which is the ability to permit and to site \na plant. So we find ourselves not being able to produce enough product \nfor the market. Anybody who took economics 101 will tell you, when \ndemand outstrips production, then you are going to have the price go \nup.\n\n  Now, I would imagine this will drive us in another direction. It will \ndrive us in the direction of alternative fuels and, of course, \nrenewable energy. No other administration in our Government's history \nhas spent more money on research as far as alternatives and renewables. \nWe are on the cusp of cellulosic ethanol, which helps my State. Also in \nthis business of alternative fuels is biodiesel, which will be one of \nthe great renewables. Coal to liquids or coal to diesel will also be \none of our great fuels. This technology is as old as World War II. \nSince then it has been refined and affords another source for \ndeveloping resources where we have great deposits of coal. In Montana \nwe are the ``Saudi Arabia'' of coal and we have the process and \ntechnology to easily get this done.\n  Now, if we can do that, and we can also increase farm income, and \nsolve the problem of being dependent on foreign oil, who can oppose \nthat?\n  Does that give us relief in the near term? No, it does not. There is \nnothing the Government or anybody else can do in the near term to \nprevent these kinds of spikes in a time of high demand.\n  So we will say that necessity is the mother of invention. We will be \nforced to drive less, to drive slower. We will not jump in our car and \ngo down and buy a loaf of bread. The trip has to be necessary. And you \nwill probably have a little sticker in the middle of your steering \nwheel saying: Is this trip necessary? The necessity will also drive us \nto alternatives and other ways of powering our car.\n  The demand for oil seems little affected by high prices. If it \ndoesn't\n\n[[Page S4007]]\n\nchange our behaviors, then it is wrong to say prices are too high. \nMaybe we do not like it, but we all like to sell our product for as \nmuch as we can get for it. And that is how the market actually works \nand sometimes it becomes very painful.\n  No, it is not good. It is not good for my agriculture because that \naffects the price you are going to pay for food in the grocery store. \nThere is no part of our economy that is not affected by what we are \nexperiencing in this country right now.\n  But Americans have imagination. They have great ingenuity. And I am \nsatisfied we will take this little spike in the market and make good \nuse of it and start using our brains to power America.\n  If anybody thinks if you beat up on the companies--beat up all you \nwant to--but part of the problem lies within this body because we have \nsaid ``no''--resoundingly no--to a multitude of programs and projects \nthat could have partly prevented this.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COCHRAN.

Under the previous order, the Senate will \nresume consideration of H.R. 4939, which the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 4939) making emergency supplemental \n     appropriations for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2006, \n     and for other purposes.\n\n  Pending:\n\n       Thune amendment No. 3704, to provide, with an offset, \n     $20,000,000 for the Department of Veterans Affairs for \n     Medical Facilities.\n       Vitter/Landrieu modified amendment No. 3728, to provide for \n     flood prevention in the State of Louisiana, with an offset.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Ensign). Under the previous order, the \nSenator from Mississippi, Mr. Cochran, and the Senator from West \nVirginia, Mr. Byrd, will be recognized for up to 10 minutes each.\n  The Chair recognizes the Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the Chair.\n  I thank the distinguished and very able chairman of the Senate \nAppropriations Committee, Mr. Cochran, for all of his hard work on this \nbill. He has worked hard. He has again proved himself to be a very able \nchairman, very knowledgeable of the contents of the bill.\n  The President has asked the Congress to approve over $92 billion of \nemergency spending--man, that is a lot of money; $92 billion of \nemergency spending--including $72.5 billion for the wars in Iraq and \nAfghanistan and $19.8 billion for the Federal response to the terrible \nhurricanes that struck the Gulf States in August and September of 2005.\n  The Appropriations Committee held several hearings on the request, \nand we have now debated the bill for nearly 2 weeks. It is a good bill. \nIt is a good bill. I am proud to recommend it to the Senate.\n  But, regrettably, the President has threatened to veto the bill based \non his assertion that it is too expensive. In a Statement of \nAdministration Policy that has been made a part of the Record, the \nadministration threatens that the President will veto the bill if it \nexceeds $94.5 billion. OK. Have at it. Have at it, Mr. President. \nCurrently, the bill totals $108.9 billion. The President complains that \nthe Senate has added funding for purposes other than the wars in Iraq \nand Afghanistan and for assisting the victims of Hurricanes Katrina and \nRita.\n  Nowhere--nowhere--is it written in stone, nowhere is it etched in \nbrass, on golden pillars, that this supplemental--which is likely to be \nthe only supplemental considered for this fiscal year--has to be \nlimited to the costs of the war and Hurricane Katrina. Nor is it etched \nin stone that the Congress must approve a bill that is below $94.5 \nbillion.\n  The Senate has added funding for a number of critical programs. \nDespite the administration's rhetoric about securing our borders and \nproviding a layered defense of our ports, the President did not request \na dime--not one thin dime--for border security or port security. He did \nnot request a dime for making the coal mines safer for our coal miners. \nHe did not request a dime for our farmers who have been hit with \ndrought and hurricanes, despite the fact that 78 percent of all U.S. \ncounties were designated as primary or contiguous disaster areas by the \nSecretary of Agriculture or the President in 2005. He did not request a \ndime for compensating potential victims of pandemic influenza vaccines. \nThe President's request for Katrina victims is inadequate and leaves \ncritical gaps in housing and education.\n  The Senate recognized the weaknesses of the President's request in \nthese areas and judiciously added funds. When the bill is in \nconference, I will urge the conferees to approve these items. You bet.\n  The conferees should send to the President a bill that meets the \nneeds of this country. That is our duty. If the President wants to veto \na bill that funds the troops, if he wants to veto a bill that funds \nvictims of Hurricane Katrina, if he wants to veto a bill that provides \ncritical resources for combating a potential avian flu, if he wants to \nveto a bill that secures our borders and our ports and helps our \nfarmers to recover from disaster and makes our coal mines safer, have \nat it, have at it. That is his right under the Constitution. But the \nCongress should not be bullied by the President into neglecting its \nresponsibility, our responsibility, to provide required funds to meet \npriority national needs.\n  Because my State of West Virginia is often hit by floods and other \ndamaging disasters, such as the recent accidents in our coal mines, I \nam quite sensitive to the ability of our Federal Government to prepare \nfor--and respond to--disasters promptly and with competence, which is \nwhat our citizens need and what our citizens deserve. Sadly, many of \nour Federal agencies are no longer up to these fundamental tasks. But \nthis bill includes resources to help Federal agencies restore their \ncapabilities.\n  I am especially grateful to and I especially thank the chairman for \nincluding, at my request and the request of others, an amount of $35.6 \nmillion for improved mine safety and health programs. In the wake of 18 \ncoal-mining deaths in the State of West Virginia this year--18 coal-\nmining deaths in the State of West Virginia this year--and another 16 \nmining deaths in other States, it is imperative that the Congress act \nimmediately to ensure that an adequate number of safety inspectors will \nbe provided for our Nation's mines and to expedite the introduction of \ncritical safety equipment.\n  This week, we have heard testimony from the families of those killed \nin the Sago explosion in January. We have heard from the coal \noperators. We have heard from experts. In all of this testimony, one \ntruth is clear: Lives can be saved when the Federal Mine Safety and \nHealth Administration places miners' safety and health at the very top \nof its priority list. We must have more inspectors on the job, yes. We \nmust have better rescue teams trained and\n\n[[Page S4008]]\n\nequipped and ready to go at a moment's notice. We must have pre-\npositioned oxygen and emergency supplies in our coal mines. And we must \nhave ways to communicate with trapped miners. It just has to be. We \nhave to do these things. It is simply inexcusable that our miners have \noxygen canisters that last only 1 hour, only 60 minutes, when miners \nmay be trapped under the ground for several days, or that the miners \nmay not have emergency communications equipment that can reach the \nsurface in the event of an extended rescue effort. The chairman has my \ngenuine appreciation for including these funds in the committee-\nreported bill. I also thank Senator Specter, Senator Harkin, and \nSenator Jay Rockefeller for their support of the initiative.\n  The bill before the Senate also includes a provision to extend the \nAbandoned Mine Land authority through fiscal year 2007. The AML Program \nand combined benefits fund are very important programs that are needed \nby retired coal miners and their families and coalfield communities \nthroughout this country. I thank Chairman Cochran and I thank Senator \nSpecter and I thank Senator Domenici for supporting me in this effort.\n  Finally, the Senate, by a vote of 94 to 0, approved my amendment \nencouraging the President to budget for the cost of the wars in Iraq \nand Afghanistan. You can't fund these wars on the cheap. Upon passage \nof this supplemental bill, the total amount appropriated for the war in \nIraq, including the cost of reconstruction, will be approximately $320 \nbillion--that is $3.20 for every minute since Jesus Christ was born; \nthink of it, that is a staggering figure--virtually all of it funded \nthrough ad hoc emergency supplemental appropriations. And the costs \ncontinue to grow and grow.\n  The President refuses to include a realistic estimate of the cost of \nthe wars in his annual budget request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. BYRD. Would the Chair repeat?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. BYRD. I ask unanimous consent to proceed for not to exceed 3 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. He continues to rely on ad hoc, poorly justified emergency \nsupplemental requests that he expects the Congress to rubberstamp. As a \nresult, there is virtually no debate about how our country is going to \npay for these massive bills. Nobody seems to be minding the store when \nit comes to controlling the escalating costs of the wars in Iraq and \nAfghanistan. The failure of the President to heed the repeated calls by \nthe Senate to budget for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan has resulted \nin more unnecessary spending that is hidden from public view. Until the \nPresident begins to include a real estimate of the cost of the wars in \nhis annual budget, American taxpayers will continue to see billions of \ndollars spent without any true measure of accountability.\n  The Senate has given its strong support to this amendment five times, \nand the President continues to disregard this direction by the Senate. \nI hope the 94-to-0 vote on an amendment that encourages the President \nto include the full cost of the wars in the budget finally, finally, \nfinally gets his attention.\n  I urge adoption of the bill, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I first thank very sincerely the \ndistinguished Senator from West Virginia for his good help and \nassistance, his guidance and his leadership in the development and \npassage of this bill. We have been called upon, as he points out, to \nprovide emergency supplemental funding for war costs, providing the \nDepartment of Defense and the Department of State with funding in \naccounts that have been devoted to that cause and that effort. It is \nvery important to the protection of the security interests of the \npeople of the United States. So this is an important measure we are \ntaking up today and moving to final passage.\n  Under the order that was entered last evening, there would be 10 \nminutes allocated to the Senator from West Virginia and to this \nSenator, and then there would be consecutive votes on or in relation to \ntwo amendments, one which is being offered by the Senator from South \nDakota, Mr. Thune, the other by the Senator from Louisiana, Mr. Vitter, \nas modified, without intervening action or debate, and that following \nthose votes, the bill be read a third time and the Senate proceed to a \nvote on passage of the bill without intervening action or debate. So \nthe order provides for no debate today but just votes on the final two \namendments that have been held for votes now.\n  There have been several other amendments which have been cleared, but \nI am going to ask unanimous consent that each Senator who has an \namendment that has not been considered--Senator Thune and Senator \nVitter--be given 2 minutes each to describe their amendments and that \nthe managers of the bill likewise be given 2 minutes each on each \namendment, if comments are needed, by the managers of the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, if I \nunderstand the chairman's request, it is to get 4 minutes of additional \ntime on their side.

Con. Res. 95 (109th \n     Congress).\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, two important lessons we learned from \nHurricane Katrina are that our Nation's infrastructure to protect \nAmericans from flooding and hurricanes is inadequate and upfront \ninvestment in this infrastructure can save lives and is a sound \ninvestment of taxpayers' money in order to prevent costly \nreconstruction.\n  The Fox Point Hurricane Barrier in Providence, RI protects the city \nand adjoining communities from the catastrophic effects of hurricane \nstorm surge in Narragansett Bay and torrential rains with the \nProvidence River basin. Built in the 1960s, as a joint\n\n[[Page S4010]]\n\nflood control project by the city and the Army Corps of Engineers, the \nbarrier employs three 35-foot high gates, an electrically driven \npumping station, and dikes to protect tens of thousands of people and \napproximately $5 billion worth of property. The hurricane barrier is a \none-half mile long structure that extends from Allens Avenue to India \nPoint Park. It was the first structure of its type in the United States \nto be approved for construction.\n  The Hurricane of 1938 and Hurricane Carol in 1954 devastated \ncommunities in Rhode Island. The Hurricane of 1938 generated a storm \nsurge of 16 feet that traveled up Narragansett Bay and flooded downtown \nProvidence under 10 feet of water. Two hundred and seven Rhode \nIslanders were killed, and damage totaled $125 million--more than $1 \nbillion in today's dollars. Hurricane Carol in 1954 flooded Providence, \nleaving the city under 8 feet of water and destroying 4,000 houses.\n  The Corps and city built the Fox Point Hurricane Barrier to keep a \nstorm surge from flowing into downtown Providence. Since its \nconstruction, sea levels have risen 9 to 10 inches. In addition, Rhode \nIsland has lost wetlands and tidal flats that could help mitigate a \nstorm surge. According to Jon Boothroyd, a geologist at the University \nof Rhode Island, the filled land will force water into a narrower area, \ncausing a higher storm surge. The loss of marshes and fields behind the \nbarrier will further exacerbate the problem as water could also move \nfaster downstream to the barrier. For these reasons, it is imperative \nthat the barrier and pumps work if and when they are needed.\n  In recent years, the Army Corps of Engineers and the city of \nProvidence have evaluated the barrier and determined that the \nelectromechanical control system for the barrier's pumps must be \nreplaced. The Corps has reported that during several inspections, the \npump motors have occasionally failed to start because of faulty relays \nor other related electrical problems. In a letter dated December 7, \n2003, Richard C. Carlson with the New England Director of the Army \nCorps of Engineers stated that ``During the past several inspections \nthe pump motors have occasionally failed to start because of faulty \nrelays or other electrically related problems. This is symptomatic of \nthe age and condition of the electrical components, most of which are \noriginal.'' The electromechanical control system has been in service \nfor 40 years, and due to its age repair parts are nearly impossible to \nobtain.\n  We have been lucky as New England has not had a strong hurricane in \n50 years, but that could mean that our luck is running out. The city \nand I are concerned that failure of the system during an actual storm \ncould result in the flooding of Providence's downtown business district \nand thousands of residences. The Fox Point Hurricane Barrier is a \nproject authorized by the Water Resources Development Act, and the \nFederal Government should fulfill its obligation to provide a safe, \nstructural sound barrier that operates when necessary. For this reason, \nI filed an amendment to the supplemental appropriations bill, H.R. \n4939, to provide $1,055,000 to complete upgrades to the Fox Point \nHurricane Barrier. I am pleased that the Senate accepted my amendment \nfor this funding. Senator Chafee and I also sponsored an amendment to \nthe bill to turn over responsibility for the annual operations and \nmaintenance of the hurricane barrier to the Army Corps of Engineers. I \nam glad that the Senate also decided to accept this amendment. I will \nwork with my colleagues to maintain these amendments as this bill moves \nthrough conference.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 3592, as Modified\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN.

Con. Res. 95 (109th Congress), \n     the concurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal year 2006.\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, this amendment has been worked on quite a \nbit. An agreement has been reached with all relevant Members, \nparticularly the chairs and ranking members of all of the relevant \ncommittees. It doesn't increase the cost of the bill. It addresses a \nnumber of urgent flood protection needs in Louisiana and, again, \nrepresents a very solid compromise which I am proud to sponsor.\n  With that, I ask that Members agree to the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate?\n  If not, the question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 3728), as further modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I thank the Chair for yielding time on this \namendment.\n  This amendment would provide an additional $20 million for veterans \nhealth care, offset by striking $20 million that would be appropriated \nunder this supplemental for the Americorps program. The Americorps \nprogram has already received $900 million in appropriations for fiscal \nyear 2006, according to the committee report on this bill.\n  In 2005, the VA transferred $452 million from its Medical Facilities \naccount to its Medical Services account. I would like to replenish the \nVA Medical Facilities account a little, if it's possible to do in a \nfiscally responsible way. This amendment provides the opportunity to do \nso, by taking money from an ineffective and mismanaged program--the \nAmericorps National Civilian Community Service Corps program--and \nproviding it for veterans health care.\n  Mr. President, my amendment would make some resources available to \ncarry out the Secretary's Capital Asset Realignment for Enhancement \nServices, or CARES, decision, which mandated that 156 priority \ncommunity-based clinics be established by 2012.\n  As I said, talking about AmeriCorps, Senator Mikulski has described \nthe overall AmeriCorps Program as ``like Enron's nonprofit.''\n  What has been said by GAO--they described it as they have been living \non the edge, with tracking based on projections instead of real \naccounts.\n  My amendment simply helps us understand that the budget process is \nabout making choices, about setting priorities, and that providing \nassistance for this program under the VA health care and using as an \noffset to pay for it this AmeriCorps Program, which has already been \nfunded at $900 million this year, and, as I have described, has been \ndescribed by many, including those on the other side of the aisle, as a \nprogram that has serious management problems, serious financial \naccounting and tracking problems.\n  So I urge the adoption of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, the Thune amendment will reduce the \nfunding for the National Civilian Community Corps by $20 million. These \nfunds are needed to pay the expenses of training and subsistence for \nthose who have volunteered to provide emergency assistance in the gulf \ncoast region, to help disaster victims recover from the destruction \ncaused by Hurricanes Rita and Katrina.\n  There have been over 1,600 National Civilian Community Corps members \nin my State of Mississippi since August 30, the day after Hurricane \nKatrina struck our coast. They continue to provide essential \nassistance. The State of Mississippi put our State office of the \nNational Civilian Community Corps in charge of the emergency 24-hour \ncall center, as well as supply distribution centers. To date, the \nNational Civilian Community Corps has assisted 1,140,000 people; \ncleaned out 1,500 homes; contributed nearly 2,000 tons of food and \n2,790 tons of clothing; served 1 million meals; refurbished 732 homes; \nsupported 654 emergency response centers; and completed 1,730 damage \nassessments.\n  The volunteers of the National Civilian Community Corps receive about \n$4,000 for college expenses. They are modestly housed, fed, and \nprovided with health care and uniforms. They remain available at a \nmoment's notice for deployment to any emergency in the country. The \nFederal Emergency Management Agency, the Red Cross, and others depend \nupon this group of professionally trained volunteers for assistance and \nsupport.\n  The thousands of volunteers who are helping care for children and \nhelping the gulf coast recover and rebuild are the backbone of the \nprogress being made in the hurricane-damaged region of our country. \nThey give hope to our families, and I urge the Senate to reject the \nThune amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington is recognized.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, as we gather this morning, our troops in \nIraq and Afghanistan need our support, families on the gulf coast need \nhelp rebuilding their lives, and communities all across this country \nneed help moving forward. And now it is down to us. Will we provide \nthat support? Will we provide that critical help? Or will we leave our \ntroops unfunded, our gulf coast in ruins, and our communities stalled? \nThis is the bill that determines whether we move forward as a country \nor whether we make it harder for our troops, for hurricane victims, and \nfor American families to make progress. That is the choice before us.\n  I am on the floor this morning--as I have been all week--saying we \nneed to move our country forward by passing this emergency supplemental \nbill. I do want to address some of the concerns that have been raised \nabout this bill.\n  For years, this White House has been playing games to hide the cost \nof war. We know we have tremendous expenses in Iraq and Afghanistan. \nEveryone knows that. But when it's time to write the budget--suddenly \nthis White House develops amnesia. It somehow ``forgets'' to include \nthe cost of war in the regular budget process. On the day the \nadministration sends us its budget--the ongoing cost of war is somehow \nunknowable. But a few weeks later--when it sends up an emergency \nsupplemental--suddenly we have got this huge document that lists the \ncosts of war. It is a fiction, a sham, a game. And for too long--this \nCongress has been going along with it. We don't include the war in the \nbudget. We don't fund the war through the Defense Appropriations bill, \nwe just expect to pay for it through emergency supplementals, and that \nis not honest. Moreover, it means that real emergencies--unanticipated \nnatural disasters and our own homeland security needs--are pushed aside \nand rendered ``less important'' than ongoing war costs.\n  All year I have been on the floor saying that if we are not realistic \nwith our budgets, we are going to have to make up the difference in \nemergency spending--and that is where we find ourselves today.\n  Mr. President, I want to walk through how the size of the \nsupplemental has changed to remind my colleagues that it didn't just \ngrow mysteriously. Members of both parties added critical priorities to \nthe supplemental, and members have stood up for those critical \ninvestments.\n  When the Senate Appropriations Committee gathered in early April to \nmark up this bill, several amendments were adopted that added to the \ncost of the bill. They included bipartisan amendments to address the \nagricultural disasters that we have witnessed across the country. That \namendment was championed by Senator Dorgan and Senator Burns.\n  Senator Harkin added an amendment to make sure that there will be \nadequate funds to finance the administration's preparations to deal \nwith a pandemic flu outbreak.\n  With the support of Senator Bond, I added an amendment to address the \nbacklog of claims for highway emergency relief that still haven't been \npaid for recent declared disasters across the country; including: \nHurricane Ivan, Hurricane Dennis, the San Simeon Earthquake, Hurricane \nOphelia, Tropical Storm Gaston, and the tragic\n\n[[Page S4014]]\n\nfloods in Hawaii that we debated yesterday evening.\n  The gulf coast Senators on the committee, including Senators \nHutchison, Shelby, Landrieu, and, of course, Chairman Cochran, also \npresented amendments to better address the needs of the gulf coast \nregion in its efforts to recover from Hurricane Katrina and the other \ngulf coast hurricanes.\n  These amendments were all offered to address the real needs of our \ncommunities here at home.\n  The Appropriations Committee reported this bill to the Senate Floor \nby a vote of 27 to 1. When we brought the bill to the floor, we \nreceived a statement of administration policy from the Bush white \nhouse. That statement said that the President would veto any bill that \nexceeded the level of $94.5 billion. Soon after, the Senate was given \nan opportunity to vote on the President's position.\n  My friend, Senator Thomas of Wyoming, offered an amendment to delete \nall of the provisions that were not in the administration's original \nrequest--thus bringing the size of the bill down to the level \nacceptable to the President. That amendment failed overwhelmingly, by a \nveto-proof margin of 72 to 26.\n  Just hours later, my friend from Nevada, Senator Ensign, made a \nmotion to recommit the bill back to the Appropriations Committee with \ninstructions that it be cut back to the level President Bush said he \nwould support. That amendment also failed by a veto-proof margin of 68 \nto 28.\n  Why did those amendments fail, even in the face of the President's \nveto threat? Because Senators from across the country on both sides of \nthe aisle recognized that the investments that this bill makes here in \nAmerica are needed.\n  Indeed, in the face of those embarrassing votes, the Senate \nRepublican leaders frantically scurried around to get enough signatures \non a letter to the President saying they would uphold the President's \nveto. They were desperate to get that letter out to the media because \nit was clear from the votes on the Senate floor that the Members of the \nSenate--Republican and Democrat alike--were not prepared to ignore our \nneeds here at home, even if President Bush is prepared to do so.\n  That is how this supplemental developed--one amendment at a time--\nSenators from both parties voted to address critical needs. Senators \nhave stood by those investments, and now it is time to pass this bill.\n  Mr. President, we have critical needs in our war effort and here at \nhome that we must address. Those needs have not been addressed through \nthe regular budget, so we must address them through this bill. Let's \npass this supplemental and make sure our troops and our communities \nhave the support they need. And as we move forward--let's get real \nabout the budget process--let's get real about the cost of war--or we \nare going to find ourselves back here time and again passing emergency \nspending.\n  We have heard a lot about the size of the bill, and I want to address \nthat. This supplemental is big because the budgets we have passed over \nthe years have been unrealistically small.\n  Let me say that again: This bill is big because the budgets we have \npassed have been unrealistically small. Time and again, the White House \nhas proposed budgets that do not come close to meeting our domestic \nneeds--and that completely ignore the costs of war. Those budgets have \nbeen works of fiction. And if we are not going to be realistic in the \nregular budget process--if we are not going to include the cost of war \nin the regular budget, we are going to have to face reality during this \nsupplemental.\n  That is where we find ourselves today. So any Member who is troubled \nby the size of this bill should tell the White House it is time to get \nreal and send us budgets that include the cost of war and that address \nour domestic needs--or we are going to find ourselves dealing with \nemergency spending time and time again.\n  But we can't miss the big picture--either we pass this bill and help \nour troops an our country, or we make it harder for America to move \nforward. Let's have the wisdom to make the right choice.\n  Before I go any further, I want to acknowledge the tremendous \nleadership that Senator Byrd has provided throughput this process. He \nknows this body better than anyone. And, more importantly, he brings \nwith him a deep commitment to doing the right things not only for the \nSenate, but for the country, and for the families we all represent.\n  I also want to thank Chairman Cochran for his leadership and hard \nwork on this bill. He has shown extraordinary patience throughout this \ndebate, and I appreciate how he has worked with all of us to keep this \nbill on track.\n  Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Is there objection?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, we have no objections on this side.\n\n[[Page S4015]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Iowa [Mr. Grassley], for himself and Mr. \n     Baucus, proposes an amendment numbered 3732.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To transfer funds from the Disaster Relief fund to the Social \n Security Administration for necessary expenses and direct or indirect \n   losses related to the consequences of Hurricane Katrina and other \n                     hurricanes of the 2005 season)\n\n       On page 186, after line 22, add the following:\n       Sec. 2704. Of the funds made available under the heading \n     ``Disaster Relief'' under the heading ``Federal Emergency \n     Management Agency'' in chapter 5 of this title, $38,000,000 \n     is hereby transferred to the Social Security Administration \n     for necessary expenses and direct or indirect losses related \n     to the consequences of Hurricane Katrina and other hurricanes \n     of the 2005 season: Provided, That the amount transferred by \n     this section is designated as an emergency requirement \n     pursuant to section 402 of H. Con. Res. 95 (109th Congress), \n     the concurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal year 2006.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, the supplemental appropriations bill \nincludes $27 billion for disaster-related expenses. But, no money, \nother than a nominal amount for the Inspector General, was provided for \nthe Social Security Administration. This amendment would correct this \nomission.\n  This amendment would provide $38 million to the Social Security \nAdministration, SSA, to reimburse costs incurred as a result of \nHurricane Katrina and other hurricanes of the 2005 season.\n  The Social Security Administration performed a remarkable job in \nresponse to these recent disasters.\n  They assisted more than 528,000 persons in FEMA Disaster Recovery \nCenters and shelters and helped many others who came to SSA field \noffices. Altogether these activities cost the agency $38 million: $6 \nmillion to acquire and outfit temporary space and renovate offices \ndamaged by the storm, including costs for computers, furniture and \nsupplies; $12 million for processing immediate payments, changing \naddresses, confirming Social Security numbers, and taking new claims \nthat resulted from the hurricanes; $7 million to pay for the travel and \nper diem expenses for employees; $12 million for costs related to \nunprocessed workloads--claims, hearings, etc.--due to the storms' \ndisruptions; $1 million for salaries of those SSA workers who \nvolunteered to work for FEMA in the affected areas.\n  SSA cannot easily absorb this $38 million because its budget is \nalready $300 million below the President's request for fiscal year \n2006. SSA is already experiencing reductions and delays in service. \nThis $38 million would allow an increase in overtime hours to begin to \naddress these backlogs.\n  Finally, the cost of this amendment is offset by a $38 million \nreduction in the FEMA disaster relief fund. This reduction in FEMA \nwould come from the $2.4 billion that is designated for ``other \nneeds.'' This designation refers to money that has been made available \nfor unspecified, potential future activities. It would not affect any \nspecific project or activity in this bill.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise to speak in favor of the bipartisan \namendment that Finance Committee Chairman Grassley has just offered. As \nranking Democrat on the Finance Committee, I have worked with Chairman \nGrassley to develop this amendment. The amendment provides $38 million \nto the Social Security Administration, SSA--fully paid for--to \nreimburse the costs SSA incurred as a result of Hurricane Katrina and \nother hurricanes of the 2005 season.\n  The supplemental appropriations bill, as reported by the Senate \nAppropriations Committee, would appropriate $106.5 billion, including $ \n67.7 billion for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, $4.5 billion for \nforeign assistance programs, and $27.1 billion for relief needed \nbecause of last season's hurricanes. In contrast, no funding for SSA to \nmake up for its costs from Katrina and the other hurricanes is \ncurrently provided in the supplemental.\n  The Social Security Administration performed superbly in the \naftermath of these hurricanes. SSA assisted more than 528,000 persons \nin FEMA Disaster Recovery Centers and shelters and helped many others \nwho came to its field offices. To provide such assistance, SSA urgently \ninvoked emergency procedures and issued approximately 85,000 immediate \npayments for displaced beneficiaries and those who could not access \ntheir bank or other financial accounts. In addition, SSA changed the \naddresses of displaced beneficiaries, provided individuals who had lost \ntheir identification documents with confirmation of their Social \nSecurity numbers, and took applications from many people from the \naffected areas who had become newly eligible for Social Security \ndisability or survivors benefits or benefits from the Supplemental \nSecurity Income program. SSA even passed along messages to \nbeneficiaries from worried family members. Finally, some SSA employees \ndrove hours to provide relief to overstretched field offices, sometimes \nsleeping on air mattresses set up in the offices because there were no \nother places to stay.\n  Together, these activities caused SSA to redirect $38 million from \nfunding for its normal tasks and obligations. There were costs to SSA \nof $6 million to acquire and outfit temporary space and renovate \noffices damaged by the storm, including costs for computers, furniture \nand supplies. SSA estimates that there were $12 million in costs for \nnew workloads, including processing immediate payments, changing \naddresses, confirming Social Security numbers, and taking new claims \nthat resulted from the hurricanes. It cost SSA $7 million to pay for \nthe travel and per diem expenses for employees who came to the affected \nareas from other regions to help, as well as for employees who were \nforced to relocate because of damaged or destroyed homes and offices \nand who continued to work in other offices. Costs related to \nunprocessed work include $12 million for SSA workloads, such as claims, \nhearings, that were not processed as a result of the storms' \ndisruptions. Nearly $1 million was spent to pay the salaries of those \nSSA workers who volunteered to work for FEMA in the affected areas, and \nthus were not doing their regular SSA work.\n\n  Unfortunately for SSA, it had already had its funding cut by a total \nof $300 million below the President's request for fiscal year 2006. \nRather than being able to absorb the $38 million caused by the \nhurricanes, SSA found its $300 million shortfall being exacerbated by \nthese additional $38 million of costs.\n  The Social Security Administration could make very good use of an \nadditional $38 million of funding for fiscal year 2006 at this time by \nincreasing overtime hours. This would allow SSA to make up for a small \npiece of the reductions and delays of service to its normal applicants \nand beneficiaries.\n  In the Senate-passed supplemental, many Federal agencies are \nreimbursed for costs arising from these hurricanes. Surprisingly, that \nis not the case for the Social Security Administration. This is \nespecially ironic in view of the efforts of the Social Security \nAdministration and its employees to help the gulf coast and its \ncitizens, including some efforts that were above and beyond the call of \nduty.\n  This bipartisan amendment will address this funding shortfall for the \nSocial Security Administration by providing it with an additional $38 \nmillion for the current fiscal year. The amendment is fully paid for. \nAs reported by the Appropriations Committee, the supplemental \nappropriations bill provides $10.6 billion to FEMA for disaster relief \nfrom Hurricane Katrina and other hurricanes of the 2005 season. Of this \namount, according to the committee report, $2.4 billion is provided for \n``other needs.'' Although the report provides some examples of such \n``other needs,'' there is no list of specific projects and activities \nwhose costs total $2.4 billion. This amendment increases SSA's funding \nfor fiscal year 2006 by $38 million and reduces the $10.6 billion \nappropriated for the FEMA Disaster Relief account in this bill. The \n$2.4 billion provided by this bill for ``other needs'' is part of the \n$10.6 billion appropriated for the FEMA Disaster Relief account in the \nbill. This amendment will not result in the loss of any specific \nproject or activity provided for by this bill. Nor will it cause\n\n[[Page S4016]]\n\nthis bill to result in any additional costs to the Federal Government.\n  This amendment will restore the loss of resources for the Social \nSecurity Administration that has resulted from the 2005 season's \nhurricanes. I believe this is the right thing to do. I urge my \ncolleagues to support this bipartisan amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment? If \nnot, the question is on agreeing to amendment No. 3732.\n  The amendment (No. 3732) was agreed to.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 3704\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I rise today in opposition to the amendment \nfrom the Senator from South Dakota. This is not an amendment designed \nto help our veterans. It is an amendment designed to cut funding for \nthe National Civilian Community Corps, NCCC, that the sponsor of the \namendment apparently thought would be more likely to pass if the funds \nwere allocated to veterans health care facilities.\n  The Senator is proposing to strike from the bill the entire $20 \nmillion allocated to support the NCCC effort to help Katrina victims. \nNCCC members deployed to the gulf within 24 hours of Katrina making \nlandfall and have been there ever since. In total, nearly 1,600 NCCC \nmembers have provided 320,000 hours of volunteer service. These young \npeople are 18 to 24 years old. They muck out homes, remove debris, \nrebuild schools and community centers, coordinate the work of episodic \nvolunteers, help families and senior citizens rebuild their homes and \nlives, and support other needs.\n  The $20 million in the supplemental will support 800 NCCC members who \nwill provide more than 1.2 million hours of service in the gulf coast \nhurricane recovery effort. Among NCCC's gulf coast accomplishments so \nfar: assisted 1,063,000 people, mucked out 1,500 homes, distributed \n1,714 tons of food, distributed 2,790 tons of clothing, served \n1,000,000 meals, refurbished 732 homes, supported 542 emergency \nresponse centers, leveraged 7,715 volunteers, and completed 1,325 \ndamage assessments.\n  It is important to fund health care for our veterans. That is why I \nvoted for the Akaka amendment to add $430 million to the bill for that \npurpose. I am pleased that it passed, and I hope the President requests \nthe funds.\n  Veterans deserve every penny of the $430 million added to this bill, \nbut those who have had their lives turned upside down by Hurricane \nKatrina also deserve the support of the young men and women of the \nnational Civilian Conservation Corps. We should not rob Peter to pay \nPaul. Therefore, I will vote against this amendment.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to Senator Thune's \namendment and to set the record straight on my ongoing and passionate \nsupport for AmeriCorps and the National Civilian Community Corps, NCCC. \nThe Senator from South Dakota said that I described the overall \nAmeriCorps program as, ``It's like Enron's gone nonprofit.'' Senator \nThune was absolutely wrong to say that is the way I describe \nAmeriCorps. I love AmeriCorps. I love what they do for communities. I \nlove what they do for America.\n  Senator Thune took that quote totally out of context. I made that \nstatement back in 2002 when a bureaucratic boondoggle led to the \noverenrollment of 20,000 volunteers. When that happened, I led the \nefforts to organize the national service groups and to strengthen \nAmeriCorps. Along with Senator Bond, I introduced and passed the \n``Strengthen AmeriCorps Program Act of 2003'' which established new \naccounting procedures for AmeriCorps. I urged the President to appoint \na new CEO for the Corporation of National Service--a CEO with the \nmanagement skills necessary to restore confidence in the Corporation's \nabilities to make a real difference to our volunteers--and in our \ncommunities. I also asked for a reinvigorated Board of Directors that \nwould take greater oversight and responsibility and I have consistently \ncalled for increased funding so that AmeriCorps could support 75,000 \nvolunteers each year.\n  AmeriCorps is stronger than ever. Since its creation, over 300,000 \nvolunteers have served in communities and earned education awards to go \nto college or to pay off student debt. To date, 7,500 Maryland \nresidents have earned education awards. The NCCC program, which has a \ncampus in Perry Point, MD, is a full-time residential program for 18 to \n24 year olds designed to strengthen communities and develop leaders \nthrough team-based service projects. Each year, approximately 1,100 \nparticipants reside in its five campuses nationwide. The Perry Point \ncampus houses 200 AmeriCorps members every year, and since 1994 its \nresidents have logged more than 350,000 service hours. Most recently, \nNCCC members have provided more than 250,000 service hours valued at \n$3.8 million to projects in the Gulf Coast region, which reflects their \ncritical service during every American natural disaster since the \nprogram started.\n  The funds that Senator Thune wants to cut are specifically dedicated \nto support volunteer recovery activities in the gulf and would pay for \n800 NCCC members who will provide more than 1.2 million hours of \nservice in the gulf coast hurricane recovery effort. These teams will \nrebuild schools and community centers, remove debris, and help senior \ncitizens rebuild their homes and lives. This funding demonstrates the \nSenate's commitment to keeping this valuable program alive, despite \nPresident Bush's efforts to cut the Federal funds it needs to survive.\n  I fought to create AmeriCorps, I fought to strengthen AmeriCorps, and \nI will fight to save AmeriCorps. Today's Federal investment, like these \nfine volunteers, are needed now more than ever. I strongly encourage my \nSenate colleagues to make sure this money is included as a part of this \nemergency spending package, and I urge them to oppose Senator Thune's \namendment which would divert these critical funds away from NCCC.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, last week I proposed an amendment to the \nsupplemental appropriations bill that would provide relief to \nindividuals facing an unfolding economic crisis along the Oregon and \nCalifornia coast.\n  For the third consecutive year, the number of naturally spawning \nKlamath River Chinook salmon is expected to fall below the conservation \nfloor called for in the fishery management plan. As a result, the \nPacific Fishery Management Council undertook a careful review of the \nstock status as well as the economic needs of local communities.\n  After conducting its review, the Council voted to recommend to the \nSecretary of Commerce the use of an emergency rule to allow for a \nseverely restricted salmon season along 700 miles of the Oregon and \nCalifornia coast.\n  Last week, Secretary Gutierrez approved the council's recommendation \nfor an emergency rule. While this limited season is helpful, it will \nnot be enough to sustain Oregon's rural, fishery-dependent economies. \nIt is estimated that the impact to Oregon and California coastal \ncommunities could exceed $100 million. Many of the communities affected \nby these fishery restrictions are still recovering from the devastation \ncaused by the collapse of the timber economy in 1990s.\n  The funding provided in my amendment would help fishermen and \nsupporting businesses in Oregon weather what will certainly be a very \ntrying year. However, because this crisis is the result of a regulatory \naction rather than a natural disaster, I have been told that my \namendment is not germane to the bill that is before us now. This \nparliamentary hair-splitting is lost on my constituents.\n  I would like to engage the Chairman of the Appropriations Committee \nin a brief colloquy. I realize that we are facing tight budgetary times \nand numerous disasters, many of which receive assistance under the \ncurrent bill. Will you agree to work with me to secure funding or \nreprogram funds to address the pending crisis on the Oregon coast?\n  Mr. COCHRAN. The Senator is certainly right that these are very \ndifficult budgetary times. Funds for nondefense discretionary programs \nare particularly constrained, while the demand for those funds has not \nslackened one bit. Having said that, I appreciate the Senator \nacquainting me with the challenges facing fishing communities on the \nOregon coast, and I will work with him and the subcommittee Chairman \nShelby and try to identify an appropriate federal response for affected \ncommunities.\n  Mr. SMITH. I thank the Chairman. I yield the floor.\n\n\n                               avian flu\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I thank my distinguished colleagues \nfrom North Carolina and Kansas, Senators Burr and Brownback, for their \ncommitment to avian flu preparedness and to putting in place an \neffective system for the surveillance of wild birds, which is \ninstrumental to our capacity to prepare for the outbreak of an avian \nflu pandemic. I am happy to support the amendment of my distinguished \ncolleague from North Carolina.\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, my amendment builds upon work Senator \nLieberman and Senator Brownback undertook last year in the fiscal year \n2006 Defense appropriations bill, which also included the first avian \nflu supplemental. It enhances our domestic capacity to undertake wild \nbird surveillance coming into and across the United States by utilizing \nthe expertise of the Smithsonian Institute to support our Federal \nagencies.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, indeed, there is growing concern that \nwild birds can carry the avian flu virus, which has now spread from \nSoutheast Asia to China, Europe, Africa, and to the Middle East. Wild \nbirds are one of the key vectors for spreading the virus to domestic \nanimal populations or carry it to wild bird markets, where the virus is \nfurther propagated. At this time, the virus does not spread easily from \nbirds to humans and there are limited reports of human to human \ntransfer. Importantly, the virus has not yet entered the United States \nto our knowledge. We must understand how this virus moves to prepare \ncommunities in its path.\n  At the same time we work to develop a vaccine and procure antivirals, \nwe can also track the movement of the virus in wild birds. GAINS can \ntrack wild birds in the same way the National Hurricane Center tracks \nhurricanes. By analyzing, storing, and reporting using a real time \ncomputerized data mapping system and interface, we can see the viral \nstrains wild birds carry, where they are carrying the virus along \nmigratory routes, and how the virus is genetically evolving. This will \nmake it possible for us to develop vaccines more quickly using the most \nrecent strain available and will help us warn vulnerable populations in \nwild bird flight paths should the avian flu strain turn deadly.\n  Mr. BURR. I agree that avian flu surveillance is critical to our \nability to protect public health. Mr. President, I ask Senator \nLieberman, is the global program he supported in the fiscal year 2006 \nappropriations process for international surveillance currently up and \nrunning? The Smithsonian Institute and the domestic surveillance \nprogram they are working on and his international surveillance program \nwill be important partners. We urge all parties to begin their \nactivities immediately.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. It is. USAID and CDC have partnered with the Wildlife \nConservation Society to establish the Wild Bird Global Avian Influenza \nNetwork for Surveillance or GAINS. GAINS is a smart and targeted \ninvestment in the U.S. Government's fight against avian flu. CDC and \nUSAID are investing $6 million from fiscal year\n\n[[Page S4018]]\n\n2006 avian flu supplemental appropriations to establish GAINS. GAINS \ncomprises 5 million conservation, wild bird, poultry, health, and \nvaccine experts and builds upon the robust international network of the \nWildlife Conservation Society, or WCS, which through partnerships has \npresence in virtually every key country related to Avian Influenza--56 \nin all. The Wildlife Conservation Society, founded in 1895 and \nheadquartered at the Bronx Zoo has a long history in the wild bird \nsurveillance field around the world. They were the organization that \nfirst diagnosed West Nile virus when it arrived on U.S. shores, and the \nhuman avian flu vaccine we are currently working on is partially \nderived from wild migratory bird samples, WCS wild bird samples \ncollected in Mongolia.\n  Of course, the GAINS relates to robust sampling of wild birds--alive \nand dead--in the wild and in captivity, and even in markets, but most \nimportantly GAINS will display the results of sampling on a user-\nfriendly real time computerized data mapping system so that wherever \nyou are in the world, public officials will be able to warn populations \nat risk and scientists will have a powerful tool to fight this virus.\n  I am confident that the Smithsonian's domestic efforts will be fully \ncompatible with GAINS.\n  Mr. BURR. The Smithsonian has agreed to provide the samples and the \ndata it collects to United States agency partners without delay. In \nturn, we will count on the DOI, USDA, HHS, and any other agencies to \nnegotiate the full coordination and integration of the Smithsonian \ndomestic component, the GAINS network, and any other ongoing effort \ninto a public database. This way we know samples will be stored and \nshared between governmental and nongovernmental organizations and that \ndata will work with additional efforts in the future.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I am glad we agree that we should all work together. \nWe cannot have efforts that are not collaborative and coordinated \ndomestically and internationally. We will build on the GAINS \ninfrastructure by boosting our domestic capacity through the \nSmithsonian Institute and ensuring all partners work together and share \ndata in a compatible manner using the GAINS system.\n  Mr. BURR. I understand that Senator Lieberman has an amendment \nrelated to GAINS.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Yes I do. The current GAINS program is underfunded by \n$4,000,000 in year one and year two will require an additional \n$10,000,000 to be fully functional. Our amendment specifies GAINS as a \nparticular program for CDC to fund in its domestic and global \nsurveillance efforts, which in general is receiving robust funding \nthanks to your foresight and that of your health subcommittee. Such an \neffort as we have discussed must include animal surveillance because of \nits relation to human health.\n  Mr. BURR. An international avian flu surveillance component is an \nimportant investment and I hope HHS and CDC recognize the need to \nenhance our surveillance capabilities. I encourage the Appropriations \nCommittee and Chairman Cochran to give it full consideration.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Senator Brownback and I thank the Senator from North \nCarolina for this. I personally thank you Senator Burr for working with \nus on this important issue, which I always say is the big bird in the \nroom that few people are looking at. It always feels better to wrap our \narms around problems on a bipartisan basis. The leadership of the \nSenator from North Carolina on this issue and in general is noticed and \nlaudable.\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I thank my colleagues.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank my colleagues for their commitment to these \nactivities.\n\n\n                     customs and border protection\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. I would like to enter into a colloquy with my friend from \nNew Hampshire, Senator Gregg, and my friend from North Dakota, Senator \nConrad, regarding funds that have been included in this bill for \ncustoms and border protection, CBP, air and marine interdiction, \noperations, maintenance, and procurement.\n  The Northern Border Air Wing, NBAW, initiative was launched by the \nDepartment of Homeland Security, DHS, in 2004 to provide air and marine \ninterdiction and enforcement capabilities along the Northern Border. \nOriginal plans called for DHS to open five NBAW sites in New York, \nWashington, North Dakota, Montana, and Michigan.\n  The New York and Washington NBAW sites have been operational since \n2004. Unfortunately, none of the other three sites have yet been stood \nup, leaving large portions of our Northern Border unpatrolled from the \nair. In the conference report accompanying the fiscal year 2006 DHS \nappropriations bill, the conferees noted that these remaining gaps in \nour air patrol coverage of the northern border should be closed as \nquickly as possible.\n  Given that the threat from terrorists, drug traffickers, and others \nwho seek to enter our country illegally has not diminished, I believe \nan adequate portion of the funds included in this bill for air and \nmarine interdiction, operations, maintenance, and procurement should be \nused by customs and border protection to complete the remaining \nassessments, evaluations, and other activities necessary to prepare and \nequip the Michigan, North Dakota, and Montana NBAW sites with \nappropriate CBP air and marine assets.\n  This bill requires that DHS submit an expenditure plan to the \nappropriations committee before any of the funds may be obligated. I \nurge DHS to include in their plan the funds necessary to stand up, \nequip, and begin operations at the three remaining northern border air \nwing sites in Michigan, North Dakota, and Montana.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I agree with my friend from Michigan. The fiscal year \n2006 DHS appropriations bill included a small amount of funds to begin \ninitial preparations for a NBAW site in my home state of North Dakota, \nbut more funds are needed for the site to become operational. Secretary \nChertoff has told us that the establishment of the three additional \nnorthern border air wings will be complete in fiscal year 2007.\n  A small portion of the air and marine interdiction funds in this bill \nwould go a long way toward meeting this deadline and the goal of \nsecuring our long and currently porous northern border. I join Senator \nLevin in encouraging the DHS to include funds sufficient to stand up \nand equip the North Dakota, Michigan, and Montana sites.\n  Mr. GREGG. My friends from Michigan and North Dakota raise important \npoints. I agree the establishment and equipping of the three remaining \nnorthern border air wings is a priority. The northern border has long \nbeen neglected compared to the southern border. As my colleagues are \naware, funds were appropriated in the fiscal year 2006 Department of \nHomeland Security Appropriations Act to initiate funding of the third \nnorthern border air wing in North Dakota. I am committed to seeing that \nthe establishment of the remaining northern border air wings is \naccomplished as expeditiously as possible.\n\n\n                           Emerald Ash Borer\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask if the chairman of the Appropriations \nSubcommittee on Agriculture is aware of my amendment regarding the \nurgent need for additional funding for combating the Emerald Ash Borer, \nand if he is open to accepting the amendment by unanimous consent.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I would say to the Senator from Michigan that I am aware \nof his amendment, but unfortunately cannot support any amendment to the \nagriculture title of the supplemental appropriations bill which does \nnot have an adequate offset. It is my understanding the amendment \nSenator Levin has introduced with Senators Stabenow, DeWine, Voinovich \nand Durbin does not contain any offset for the $15 million requested.\n  Mr. LEVIN. The Senator from Utah is correct in that I was not able to \noffset the costs of the amendment as the funding in that title is very \ntight. I would ask my friend though if he is aware that there is a need \nin my State alone of over $30 million to combat and contain this \ninvasive species that has destroyed virtually all of Southeast \nMichigan's ash stock?\n  Mr. BENNETT. I have been advised of the urgent need for funds in the \nMidwest.\n  Mr. LEVIN. During consideration of the fiscal year 2006 Agriculture \nAppropriations Act, Senators Stabenow,\n\n[[Page S4019]]\n\nDeWine and I had a similar amendment seeking additional funds for the \nAnimal and Plant Health Inspection Service at the USDA. We decided not \nto offer the amendment as we received assurances that the chairman and \nranking member of the subcommittee would push for the House approved \nlevel of funding of $14 million. Unfortunately the final bill contained \nonly $10 million to deal with the Emerald Ash Borer epidemic.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I say to my friend that we did indeed work with our \nHouse counterparts in crafting the final 2006 appropriation, but \nunfortunately were only able to allocate $10 million in the end.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank the Senator from Utah for all of his help over the \nyears in seeking funding for this problem. I hope that he and the \nranking member would be mindful of the urgent need of Ohio, Indiana and \nMichigan for funding for Emerald Ash Borer eradication efforts when \ncrafting the fiscal year 2007 Agriculture Appropriations Act over the \ncoming months.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I tell my friend from Michigan that I will do all I can, \nin consultation with Members from the affected states and the \nDepartment of Agriculture, to craft an appropriations bill which \ncontains adequate funding to combat the Emerald Ash Borer.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank the chairman and know that my colleagues \nappreciate his support as well.\n  Ms. STABENOW. I thank my colleague, Senator Bennett, for his \ncontinued work to help Michigan, Ohio, and Indiana battle this invasive \npest that has devastated our states. Senator Bennett worked closely \nwith us last year during consideration of the Agriculture \nAppropriations bill, and I appreciate his commitment to working with us \nduring the fiscal year 2007 appropriations bill.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I would like to associate myself with the \ncomments of my friends from Michigan. Ohio is home to more than 3.8 \nbillion ash trees and the Emerald Ash Borer is causing destruction to \ntrees in northwest Ohio and the Columbus area. I would appreciate your \nhelp in the future to prevent the spread of the Emerald Ash Borer to \nsouthern Ohio.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues and the chairman \nof the Appropriations Subcommittee on Agriculture for providing this \ncolloquy. As my colleagues know, the Emerald Ash Borer poses an \nenormous threat, and I wish to be associated with their remarks. This \nis important for this Senator from Ohio because nearly 4 billion ash \ntrees are threatened in my State alone. The Ohio Department of \nAgriculture and the Ohio Department of Natural Resources call the \nEmerald Ash Borer the most serious forest health issue facing Ohio's \nforests today. They remain highly concerned and vigilant, but we must \nprovide them with sufficient resources to eradicate this problem. \nAccording to the Ohio Department of Natural Resources, the potential \neconomic impact of EAB to Ohio citizens over the next 10 years could \npossibly reach $3 billion. Again, I thank my friend from Michigan for \nhis leadership on this issue, as well as the Senator from Utah, Senator \nBennett, for his indulgence in entering into this colloquy.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, in the past week, the Senate has voted to \nreduce the overall cost of H.R. 4939, the Emergency Supplemental \nAppropriations Act for Defense, the Global War on Terror, and Hurricane \nRecovery, 2006, now totaling nearly $110 billion by a mere $15 million. \nI am delighted that President Bush has pledged to veto this bill \nbecause Congress has, once again, been unable to resist the temptation \nto load up a must-pass bill with pork.\n  I offered several amendments to eliminate nonemergency items in this \nbill. I appreciate the patience of my colleagues. I am very pleased and \nencouraged that this body is increasingly willing to depart from our \nbusiness-as-usual practices.\n  That is good because the American people are paying attention to this \nprocess. In a recent Wall Street Journal/NBC poll, the American people \nsaid that ending earmarks should be the No. 1 priority for Congress \nthis session. Thirty-nine percent said that members should be \nprohibited from ``directing federal funds to specific projects \nbenefiting only certain constituents.'' It is interesting to note that \nending earmarks was ranked ahead of immigration reform, which was cited \nas the No. 1 priority by 32 percent of Americans.\n  I hope that these results, combined with polls showing a 22-percent \napproval rating for Congress, will encourage conferees to avoid a \nconfrontation with President Bush over spending. I would hope that when \nconferees look for items to remove from this bill they take a close \nlook at my amendments that lost by a narrow margin as well as those I \nwithdrew.\n  I believe that in this time of war and disaster recovery the American \npeople expect us to make hard choices about spending. Taxpayers want us \nto be serving in a spirit of service and sacrifice, not searching for \nnew ways to raid the public Treasury.\n  Congress is raiding the Treasury in two ways with this bill. First, \nmany of the items in this bill should be considered in the regular \nappropriations process and through the regular order. The war on terror \nis no longer a surprise. We are entering our fifth year of this war. It \nshouldn't come as a surprise to Congress that we have needs related to \nthis effort. We have also developed a good understanding about many of \nthe priorities in the gulf coast that could have been addressed in the \nregular budget process.\n  Congress has also added billions of dollars for items that have no \nconnection to the war on terror and the gulf coast recovery. Again, few \nof these items are true emergencies. The American people deserve to \nunderstand what defines a true emergency. According to the budget \nresolution for fiscal year 2006 all of the following five criteria must \nbe met to be considered an emergency: necessary, essential, or vital; \nsudden, quickly coming into being, and not building up over time; an \nurgent, pressing, and compelling need requiring immediate action; \nunforeseen, unpredictable, and unanticipated; and not permanent, \ntemporary in nature.\n  Designating a project as an ``emergency'' excuses Congress from \npaying for a project. The result of abusing the ``emergency'' \ndesignation is an even greater emergency. Our Nation's debt is nearly \n$8.4 trillion. Each American's share of this debt is $27,964.86. Our \nnational debt is increasing by an average of $1.95 billion per day. \nSocial Security, Medicare and the standard of living of future \ngenerations of Americans are in jeopardy as a result of decades of \nfiscal irresponsibility and rationalizations for spending more money \ntoday without considering the consequences tomorrow.\n  The Social Security trustees reported this week the program will \nexhaust its trust fund and begin running annual cash deficits in 2040. \nA year ago, that prediction was 2041, effectively meaning 2 years have \nbeen lost by a refusal to act. The trustees reported Social Security's \nunfunded liability is $13.4 trillion.\n  Of course, the real problem with Social Security and Medicare is much \nworse because the Federal Government uses an Enron-style accounting \nscheme. We habitually borrow or, more accurately, steal money from \nthese trust funds to pay for more spending today.\n  When the 77 million baby boomers begin to retire in 2011, our Nation \nwill be faced with the greatest economic challenge in our history. If \nwe continue to indulge in earmarks, the gateway drug to spending \naddictions, we will never address these complex challenges, \nparticularly if we can't resist the urge to abuse the earmark process \non a bill designed to address the emergency needs of our troops and \ndisplaced people in the gulf coast.\n  Another reason we must act today to rein in wasteful spending is \nbecause our ability to influence world events is diminished by our debt \nto other nations. We now have the distinction of being the world's \nlargest debtor nation, and this bill will add to that debt. Many \nserious economists are warning that our excessive borrowing from \nforeign sources could cause the value of the dollar to collapse, which \nwould lead to a disaster for our economy. It is incredibly shortsighted \nfor this body to sell Treasury bills to countries such as China so we \ncan finance economic development programs and other pet projects while, \nat the same time, we hope to encourage China to be more aggressive in \nterms of discouraging Iran from developing nuclear weapons. This is not \njust a numbers game. The future\n\n[[Page S4020]]\n\nvitality of our nation is at stake. We are slowly but surely whittling \naway our national power and ability to leverage other nations away by \nour refusal to make hard choices about spending.\n  Many of the items in this bill are obviously not emergencies, which \nis why this bill will be vetoed by President Bush if it is sent to him \nin its current form. Again, I hope conferees do not force the President \nto take this step. I am confident the President will veto this bill. He \nunderstands that it is more important to secure the next generation \nrather than the next election.\n  Past Presidents and Congresses have made hard choices during \ndifficult times. Between 1939 and 1942, Congress and FDR cut spending \nfor nondefense programs by 22 percent. In 1950, President Truman and \nCongress cut nonmilitary spending by 28 percent. I suggest to my \ncolleagues that if we want to be here past 2006, we better do the same.\n  Still, I agree with my colleagues who say that the President's \npriorities don't come down from heaven. I suggest, however, that we are \nall subject to the judgment that comes down from the taxpayers. If we \nflippantly disregard the President's insistence that we make hard \nchoices, the judgment of the taxpayers will not be kind to any of us.\n  Families across this country are faced with hard choices every day in \norder to live within their budget. They have elected us to make hard \nchoices. Our refusal to do this only reinforces the perception that we \nare disconnected from the priority-setting reality that governs the \nrest of the country.\n  It is wrong, for example, for this body to fund pork projects such as \ngrape research in the State of California force the taxpayers in my \nState and every other State to pay for a so-called emergency project \nthat has been ongoing for the last 46 years and has already received \nmore than $130 million from the American taxpayer. Where this body sees \nan emergency the taxpayers often see a series of misplaced priorities.\n  The State of California received 549 Federal earmarks this year \ntotaling $733 million. That included $10 million in Federal resources \nalone for museums. Is it more important to protect the residents at \nrisk from flooding by the Sacramento River or to fund grape research? \nCongress is spending over $3.6 million on a grape research center in \nCalifornia this year. We are spending another $1 million on a \npedestrian walkway project in Calimesa and a half million on \npedestrian/bike improvements on Tower Bridge in Sacramento? What is \nmore important for Sacramento? Why can't we prioritize today so future \ngenerations are not forced to make even tougher choices between massive \ntax hikes, drastic cuts to Medicare and Social Security, or the defense \nof our Nation?\n  Martin Luther King Jr. once said, ``Cowardice asks the question--is \nit safe? Expediency asks the question--is it popular? Vanity asks the \nquestion--is it popular? But conscience asks the question--is it \nright?''\n  I plead with my colleagues. Do what is right. Our Nation is on an \nunsustainable course, and that course correction must begin today, not \nwhen it is too late.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I support our troops and their families. \nI am behind them 100 percent. They deserve our gratitude, not just with \nwords but with deeds. We must do right by our troops and their \nfamilies. This strong emergency supplemental appropriations bill helps \nus do just that. This supplemental also provides needed funds to the \nvictims of the devastating hurricanes that hit our gulf coast last \nsummer.\n  In this bill we have provided $15.6 billion to fix or replace \nequipment that has been damaged during combat operations and to buy \nadditional force protection equipment desperately needed by our brave \nmen and women on the battlefield.\n  To help protect our troops from deadly improvised explosive devices, \nIEDs, this bill creates the joint improvised explosive device defeat \nfund and provides the fund with nearly $2 billion to develop and field \nthe necessary tactics, equipment, and training to defeat these deadly \nweapons.\n  Another way we can support our troops is to make our intentions in \nIraq clear to the Iraqis and the international community. To this end, \nI supported the amendment introduced by Senator Biden that prohibits \nthe building of any permanent military bases in Iraq. This will send a \nclear message to the Iraqi people--we are committed to withdrawing our \ntroops once their mission is accomplished.\n  To ensure that we do all we can to care for soldiers when they are \ninjured, this bill includes an additional $1.15 billion for the defense \nhealth program. This money ensures that we can continue to provide \nworld-class services including rapid aero-medical evacuation to our \nmost severely wounded soldiers.\n  The veterans health care system is stretched to the limit at a time \nwhen more and more veterans are turning to VA. That is why I \ncosponsored an amendment by Senator Akaka to increase veterans funding \nby $430 million to meet the health care needs of soldiers returning \nfrom Iraq and Afghanistan and other war veterans.\n  The rank-and-file employees of the Federal Government are the unsung \nheroes of this country. Unfortunately, they are often required to work \nin substandard or often hazardous conditions. It was recently reported \nthat employees within this very building are forced to enter tunnels \nfull of asbestos and on the verge of collapse. That is why I \ncosponsored an amendment by Senator Allard that provides over $27 \nmillion for critical emergency structural repairs to the Capitol \nComplex utilities tunnels. I will continue to fight for our Federal \nworkforce to ensure they have safe working environments and proper \nsafety equipment.\n  We know that nearly 40 percent of the soldiers deployed today in Iraq \nand Afghanistan are citizen soldiers who come from the National Guard \nand Reserves. More than half of these will suffer a loss of income when \nthey are mobilized, because their military pay is less than the pay \nfrom their civilian job.\n  Many patriotic employers and State governments eliminate this pay gap \nby continuing to pay them the difference between their civilian and \nmilitary pay. The reservist pay security amendment, which I worked on \nwith Senator Durbin, will ensure that the U.S. Government also makes up \nfor this pay gap for Federal employees who are activated in the Guard \nand Reserves.\n  Mr. President, last year, we provided emergency relief for the \nvictims of the horrible tsunami in Asia. Today with this bill, we are \nproviding over $27 billion in support to our own citizens so badly hurt \nby the devastating hurricanes that hit the gulf coast last year. This \nmoney will not only help with the rebuilding of New Orleans, but will \nprovide a host of economic incentives and subsidies to help the people \nof Louisiana, Mississippi, Texas, and Alabama get back to work and \nrebuild their lives following the destruction of Hurricanes Katrina and \nRita. Additionally, this bill provides emergency funding to help \nimmediately rebuild the levees and install flood control equipment that \nwill help prevent another terrible tragedy from occurring when this \nyear's hurricane season arrives in less than 4 weeks.\n  After 9/11 we realized that our borders were not secure. Since then, \nwe have waged the war on terror and made great strides at protecting \nour homeland. We have made significant investments in law enforcement \nand security; however, the infrastructure that supports our border \nsecurity has been allowed to crumble. To counter this, I supported an \namendment proposed by Senator Gregg which adds $2 billion for border \nsecurity initiatives to include buying additional vehicles, airplanes, \nhelicopters, and ships. It also builds state of the art facilities for \nuse in ensuring the security of our borders.\n  We have all seen the devastating effects of natural disasters and \nterrorism and are working hard to prevent future occurrences from \naffecting our Nation and the world. We have recently learned of another \npotential threat: a worldwide flu epidemic that could cost millions of \nlives if we are unprepared. In response to this threat, this bill \nprovides $2.3 billion to prepare for and respond to an influenza \npandemic. Making this money available now will help expand the domestic \nproduction capacity of influenza vaccine, and will help develop and \nstockpile the right vaccines, antivirals, and other medical supplies \nnecessary to protect and preserve lives in the event of an outbreak.\n\n[[Page S4021]]\n\n  Because it is just as important to support our communities at home as \nit is to support our troops in the field, I will continue to fight for \nresponsible military budgets. For that reason, I joined Senator Byrd's \ncall for the President to fund our operations in Iraq and Afghanistan \nthrough the regular budget and appropriations process. After 4 years in \nAfghanistan and 3 years in Iraq, we should not be funding these \noperations as if they were surprise emergencies.\n  Mr. President, this bill is a Federal investment in supporting our \ntroops and their families and providing relief for those impacted by \nthe devastating hurricanes.\n  We support our troops by getting them the best equipment and the best \nprotection we can provide. We support them by making it easier for our \ncitizen soldiers in the National Guard and Reserves to serve their \ncountry. And we support them by ensuring they are cared for with the \nbest possible medical system when they are injured or ill.\n  With this bill, we are also helping our neighbors rebuild their \nhomes, their communities, and their lives, and I am proud to give it my \nsupport.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, today I will cast my vote in favor of H.R. \n4939, the fiscal year 2006 supplemental appropriations bill. This bill \ntakes the important step of supporting disaster relief efforts and \nhelps fund our ongoing military and intelligence operations in Iraq and \nAfghanistan. I support the intent of this bill, but I have some \nsignificant reservations regarding the growing cost of the war and how \nit is being funded.\n  In supporting our troops, I believe we must do what is necessary to \nensure that the men and women risking their lives for our country have \neverything they need to carry out their mission. I do not support the \nadministration's policy of funding the war in Iraq through emergency \nsupplemental bills. According to a Congressional Budget Office report, \nin 2005 the Department of Defense obligated $83.6 billion--nearly $7 \nbillion per month--for the global war on terror, much of which was \nappropriated through emergency supplemental funding. This is a fiscally \nirresponsible approach that masks the true magnitude of the war's \ncosts. Therefore, I voted in favor of an amendment offered by my \ncolleagues, Senators Byrd and Carper, which expresses the sense of the \nSenate that any request for funds after fiscal year 2007 for military \noperations in Iraq and Afghanistan should be included in the \nPresident's annual budget. I was encouraged that the amendment passed \nwith a vote of 94 to 0. I urge the administration to heed the Senate's \nresolution and commit to making the costs of the Iraq war more \ntransparent.\n  I also believe that the administration must be held accountable for \nprogress in the Iraq war. As a member of the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee and ranking minority member of the Readiness Subcommittee, I \nam committed to finding a way to bring our soldiers home as soon as \npossible. I do not believe that we should leave before the Iraqi people \nare equipped with the tools necessary to support a stable democratic \nsociety, but we must ensure that progress is being made. Toward that \nend, I support the plan outlined in the amendment submitted by my \ncolleague Senator Carl Levin, ranking member of the Senate Committee on \nArmed Services, which establishes clear reporting requirements \nregarding the political situation in Iraq. According to this plan, the \nPresident is required to submit a report to Congress every 30 days \noutlining Iraq's progress toward the formation of a national unity \ngovernment. The plan also requires the administration to inform Iraqi \npolitical, religious and tribal leaders that meeting their own \ndeadlines with regards to amending the Iraqi Constitution is a \ncondition for the continued presence of a U.S. military force in Iraq. \nWhile the Senate did not consider Senator Levin's amendment due to \ngermaneness, this is an important issue that Congress must address.\n  Notwithstanding my concerns regarding the continued use of emergency \nsupplementals to fund the conflict in Iraq, there are a number of \nprovisions in this bill that I wholeheartedly support. In particular, I \nwas pleased to see that we did not forget our Nation's veterans during \nconsideration of the emergency supplemental. Our returning soldiers and \nsailors have earned the right to the best health care that this Nation \ncan provide, and I believe we should strive to carry out this \nobligation to our servicemembers. With the backing of my Senate \ncolleagues, I successfully passed an amendment to the emergency \nsupplemental adding $430 million to the Department of Veterans Affairs, \nVA. These funds will be specifically used to supplement direct health \ncare, mental health care, and prosthetics services at VA. As the \nranking member on the Veterans Affairs Committee, I am pleased that the \nSenate took this important step of supporting our Nation's veterans.\n  Another appropriate use of the emergency supplemental was \nappropriations for disaster relief. Our Nation has been hit hard by \nmany significant natural disasters that could not have been planned for \nin advance. I believe that we, as Government leaders, should continue \nto provide assistance to help those devastated by natural disasters \nincluding the severe flooding that deluged Hawaii earlier this year.\n  On May 2, 2006, President George W. Bush declared that a major \ndisaster exists in the State of Hawaii that Federal funds to help the \npeople and communities recover. I am pleased that the Senate \nAppropriations Committee included $33.5 million in the emergency \nsupplemental for disaster assistance in Kauai and Windward Oahu, and $6 \nmillion for sugarcane growers in the State whose crops were destroyed \nby the floods earlier this spring.\n  In March, I introduced S. 2444, the Dam Rehabilitation and Repair Act \nof 2006. This bill would amend the National Dam Safety Program Act to \nestablish a program to provide grant assistance to States for the \nrehabilitation and repair of deficient dams. I also supported Senator \nInouye's efforts to include an amendment to H.R. 3499 to provide $1.4 \nmillion to assess the security and safety of critical reservoirs and \ndams in Hawaii, including monitoring dam structures. I am extremely \ndisappointed that this amendment did not pass because the failure of \nKaloko Dam on Kauai led to the severe flooding and loss of life. I am \nhopeful that my colleagues will recognize the importance of addressing \nthe dam problem for the sake of Hawaii and our Nation and that my bill \nwill receive floor consideration.\n  Senator Inouye also introduced a timely amendment that provides $1 \nmillion for environmental monitoring of waters in and around Hawaii. In \nMarch of this year, I had the opportunity to visit the hardest hit \nareas of our State and meet victims, emergency responders, and State \nofficials. To date, the situation for many of our residents remains \nvery grave. With hundreds of homes and businesses damaged or destroyed, \ncritical infrastructure crippled, and many hours spent engaged in \nsearch and rescue activities, the resources of our State have been \nseverely strained. I supported this amendment, and I am encouraged that \nthis amendment passed. It is clear that Hawaii will not be able to \nfully recover without substantial Federal assistance.\n  Mr. President, I wish to reiterate that a clear distinction needs to \nbe made for true emergencies and natural disasters such as Hurricane \nKatrina and the floods in Hawaii, which could not have been \nanticipated.\n  It is fiscally irresponsible for the current administration to \ncontinue to treat this war as an emergency in order to hide the true \ncost of the war and circumvent the normal budgeting and oversight \nprocess. If the current administration continues to refuse to make hard \nchoices and insist on a policy of funding the war through emergency \nappropriations, succeeding generations of Americans will face even more \ndifficult choices.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I had intended to offer an amendment, No. \n3755, to this Emergency Supplemental Appropriations bill to provide for \nfull funding of the Help America Vote Act. However, once cloture was \ninvoked, my amendment would have been ruled non-germane and \nconsequently, I will not call it up.\n  But the parliamentary circumstances of this bill do not change the \nfact that we have reached a critical juncture in the ability of States \nto be prepared for Federal elections this November.\n  The amendment I intended to offer would have ensured that States have\n\n[[Page S4022]]\n\nthe resources necessary to conduct fair and accurate elections this \nfall. It would have fulfilled the promise made by Congress to be a full \npartner in the funding of Federal election reform by providing full \nfunding for payments to State governments to meet the election reform \nrequirements mandated by Congress over 3 years ago under the Help \nAmerica Vote Act, HAVA.\n  HAVA was overwhelmingly enacted by Congress and signed into law by \nPresident Bush on October 29, 2002.\n  HAVA mandates that by the Federal elections this year, States must \nimplement certain minimum requirements for the administration of \nFederal elections. These requirements were phased in over roughly a 2-\nyear period with the final requirements mandated to be in place by this \nyear.\n  To ensure that the States could meet these requirements, Congress \nauthorized nearly $4 billion to pay for 95 percent of the costs of HAVA \nimplementation. In order to receive Federal funding, States had to \nprovide 5 percent matching funds.\n  All 50 States, the District of Columbia, and the territories have \nraised their 5 percent matching funds under this Federal-State \npartnership.\n  Only the Federal Government is coming up short on its end of the \ndeal. To date, Congress has appropriated only $3.1 billion of the \nnearly $4 billion it promised the States in funding. That means the \nStates are short nearly $800 million in promised Federal funds needed \nto implement these reforms.\n  With 2 Federal primary elections already over and with 10 upcoming \nprimaries scheduled in May, there is precious little time left to get \nthese needed funds to the States in time to ensure that the Federal \nelections this year are conducted in compliance with Federal law.\n  This amendment would provide full funding for HAVA. Arguably, this is \nthe last opportunity we may have to ensure that the States have the \npromised funds in time to meet the 2006 deadlines for reform.\n  The amendment would fund the balance of the requirement payments to \nStates under section 251 of HAVA in the amount of $724 million. It \nwould also make up the shortfall of $74 million in funding to date for \ndisability access grants and protection and advocacy payments to serve \nthe voting needs of persons with disabilities.\n  It is simply unconscionable that Congress has not kept up its end of \nthis funding bargain. As Thomas Paine observed, the right to vote for \nrepresentatives is the primary right by which other rights are \nprotected. That statement is still true today. The right to vote in a \ndemocracy is the fundamental right on which all others are based.\n  As we witnessed in the Presidential election debacle of 2000, the \nconfidence of the American public in our system of elections was \nshattered after witnessing hanging chads, confusing ballots, missing \nnames on voter lists, malfunctioning machines, and different standards \nto recount ballots.\n  Congress responded with the first ever comprehensive requirements for \nthe administration of Federal elections.\n  The HAVA requirements effective for the 2004 Federal elections \nprovided that all States offer provisional ballots to any voter \nchallenged, for any reason, at the polls as ineligible to vote. Because \nof the HAVA requirement, 2 million more ballots were counted in the \n2004 elections than would have otherwise been counted.\n  In 2004, States also had to have in place measures designed to ensure \nthe identity of certain first-time voters who registered by mail. \nStates had to ensure voter education by posting certain voter \ninformation in the polling place.\n  But the most far-reaching, and arguably most expensive reforms, must \nbe in place for the Federal elections this year. Effective January 1, \n2006, all voting systems used in Federal elections must meet the \nfollowing minimum voting system standards:\n\n       Provide all voters with the right to verify their ballot, \n     before it is cast and counted, to ensure that it accurately \n     reflects his or her choices;\n       Provide a permanent paper record with a manual audit \n     capacity, which can be used as an official record in the case \n     of a recount;\n       Provide full accessibility to persons with disabilities, \n     including the blind and visually impaired, allowing for the \n     same privacy and independence as other voters;\n       Provide alternative language accessibility to language \n     minorities, consistent with the requirements under the Voting \n     Rights Act;\n       Meet current machine error rates; and\n       Establish a standard for defining what constitutes a vote \n     and what will be counted as a vote.\n\n  In the aftermath of the November 2000 election, there were \nallegations that voter registration lists contained numerous \nirregularities and errors, including multiple registrations and the \nnames of deceased individuals. Registration lists were also subject to \nquestionable purges by State and local governments, conducted in a \nmanner inconsistent with the National Voter Registration Act.\n  HAVA addressed those concerns with a balanced response by requiring \neach State to implement a computerized voter registration list for use \nas the official list of registered voters. For many, this requirement \nis the single most important reform for ensuring the accuracy and \nintegrity of elections.\n  But it is a significant, and expensive, task when you consider there \nwere more than 142 million registered voters in the United States in \n2004.\n  Depending upon the data used, that number represents between 65 \npercent to 85 percent of the total eligible voters. With more than 15 \npercent of Americans moving every year, it is crucial that State \nregistration lists remain current and accurate in order to ensure the \npublic's confidence in the outcome of Federal elections.\n  The 2006 reforms are absolutely critical to the successful \nimplementation of HAVA nationwide and to achieving our twin goals of \nmaking it easier to vote and harder to defraud the system.\n  This amendment that I filed to this bill is supported by a broad \ncoalition of organizations, lead by the Leadership Conference on Civil \nRights and the National Association of Secretaries of State, \nrepresenting the civil rights and voting rights communities, \ndisabilities groups, State and local governments and election \nofficials.\n  The LCCR/NASS letter, dated April 20, 2006, notes, and I quote:\n\n       Without the full federal funding, state and local \n     governments will encounter serious fiscal shortfalls and will \n     not be able to afford complete implementation of important \n     HAVA mandates.\n\n  I will ask that this letter appear in the record following my \nremarks.\n  I am grateful to the LCCR and NASS for their continuing leadership on \nthis issue and for their support of full funding of the HAVA \nrequirements. It would have been my preference that 100 percent of the \nHAVA costs be covered by the Federal Government, but I agreed to a 95 \nto 5 split to ensure that the States became vested in reform. All of \nthe States and the District of Columbia and the territories are \nvested--they have met their required 5-percent match. Only the Federal \nGovernment appears to be less than committed to reform.\n  Unless and until we can assure the American public that we have done \nall that we can to ensure the accuracy and access to the ballot box for \nall eligible voters, there will be a cloud hanging over the final \nresults of any given Federal election. That is not productive for \ndemocracy and undermines the very authority of our system of elected \ngovernment.\n  Congress enacted HAVA in response to the crisis in confidence of the \nAmerican electorate following the 2000 Presidential elections. We \npromised the States we would be a full partner in funding those \nreforms.\n  To help restore the public's confidence in the results of our Federal \nelections, Congress intended that HAVA ensure that every eligible \nAmerican voter has an equal opportunity to cast a vote and have that \nvote counted.\n  Without the promised funding, Congress has created an unfunded \nmandate and State governments have indicated they will not be able to \nfully implement the requirements on time. This amendment would have \nensured that the minimum Federal requirements would be implemented on \ntime nationwide.\n  Since Congress mandated that these requirements be effective by \nJanuary 1, 2006, it is critical that Congress now provide these funds \nno later than fiscal year 2006 in order to ensure that the statutory \nrequirements are met.\n  It is past time to live up to our promise. While my amendment may not \nbe in order to this bill, I am serving notice that I will continue to \nlook for ways to ensure that Congress makes\n\n[[Page S4023]]\n\ngood on its promise to be a full partner in funding election reform.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the before-mentioned letter be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                   April 20, 2006.\n\nMake Election Reform a Reality--Support Implementation and Full Funding \n                                for HAVA\n\n       Dear Senators: We, the undersigned organizations, urge you \n     to support full funding for the Help America Vote Act of 2002 \n     (HAVA) and include the remaining $798 million of authorized \n     funding in the upcoming Emergency Supplemental legislation. \n     Of that amount, $724 million is for the federally-mandated \n     processes and equipment that state and local governments must \n     have in place for federal elections in 2006 and $74 million \n     is for assisting state and local governments in making all \n     polling places accessible. It is imperative that the states \n     and localities receive all of the funding they were promised \n     so they can fully implement these important requirements of \n     HAVA.\n       State and local governments have worked hard on these \n     reforms such as improving disability access to polling \n     places, updating voting equipment, implementing new \n     provisional balloting procedures, developing and implementing \n     a new statewide voter registration database, training poll \n     workers and educating voters on new procedures and new \n     equipment. State and local election officials have always had \n     a difficult struggle when competing for the funding necessary \n     to effectively administer elections and they were counting on \n     the funding promised by Congress to ensure that all the new \n     federal mandates were implemented effectively.\n       To help state and local governments pay for these reforms, \n     HAVA authorized $3.9 billion over three fiscal years. Between \n     FY03 and FY04, it was clear that Congress saw the importance \n     of fully funding HAVA and provided $3 billion of the $3.9 \n     billion for HAVA implementation. Unfortunately, in FY 05 and \n     FY 06 no federal funds were appropriated for states to \n     implement the HAVA requirements.\n       State officials incorporated the federal amounts Congress \n     promised when developing their required HAVA budgets and \n     plans. Without the full federal funding, state and local \n     governments will encounter serious fiscal shortfalls and will \n     not be able to afford complete implementation of important \n     HAVA mandates. According to a state survey, lack of federal \n     funding for HAVA implementation will result in many states \n     scaling back their voter and poll worker education \n     initiatives and on voting equipment purchase plans, all of \n     which are vital components to making every vote count in \n     America.\n       We are thankful that you have seen the importance of \n     funding the work of the Election Assistance Commission. \n     States, localities and civic organizations can utilize the \n     work products of the EAC to effectively implement the \n     requirements of HAVA i.e., the voting system standards, the \n     statewide database guidance, and the studies on provisional \n     voting, voter education, poll worker training, and voter \n     fraud and voter intimidation.\n       We thank you for your support of funding for the Help \n     America Vote Act, and we look forward to working with you on \n     this critical issue. Should you have any questions, please \n     contact Leslie Reynolds of the National Association of \n     Secretaries of State or Rob Randhava of the Leadership \n     Conference on Civil Rights, or any of the individual \n     organizations listed below.\n           Sincerely,\n\n\n     organizations representing state and local election officials\n\n       International Association of Clerks, Recorders, Election \n     Officials and Treasurers.\n       National Association of Counties.\n       National Association of Election Officials.\n       National Association of Secretaries of State.\n       National Association of State Election Directors.\n       National Conference of State Legislatures.\n\n\n               civil and disability rights organizations\n\n       Alliance for Retired Americans.\n       American Association of People with Disabilities.\n       Asian American Legal Defense and Education Fund.\n       Asian Pacific American Labor Alliance.\n       Brennan Center for Justice.\n       Common Cause.\n       Demos: A Network for Ideas & Action.\n       FairVote.\n       Leadership Conference on Civil Rights.\n       League of Women Voters of the United States.\n       Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund \n     (MALDEF).\n       National Association for the Advancement of Colored People \n     (NAACP).\n       National Disability Rights Network.\n       Paralyzed Veterans of America.\n       People For the America Way.\n       The Arc of the United States.\n       United Auto Workers.\n       United Cerebral Palsy.\n       U.S.\n       PIRG.\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, first, let me acknowledge the work of \nChairman Cochran, Senator Shelby, and the Appropriations Committee in \ncrafting this bill.\n  I would also like to commend Dr. Coburn, Senator McCain, Senator \nEnsign, and so many a number of my colleagues who have been out on the \nfloor discussing the need for fiscal restraint.\n  As much good as there is in this bill, and it is mostly good, I will \nbe voting against it.\n  We must stop the practice of using emergency spending designations to \nmeet needs that can be met in the normal budget process.\n  This supplemental has some important provisions in it related to the \nwar on terror and the Hurricane Katrina recovery.\n  For example, in relation to the war on terror, $10.2 billion is \nallocated for the Department of Defense's military personnel; $39 \nbillion is allocated for operation and maintenance accounts in support \nof Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom; $15 billion \nfor procurement for various accounts; and $8 billion for various other \ndefense-related expenses.\n  Other war related expenditures: $82 million for the FBI operations in \nIraq and Afghanistan, $5 million for the DEA's Intelligence Program, \nand $4 million for ATF's costs in Iraq.\n  These are all important programs that should be funded to help fight \nterrorists abroad.\n  The bill provides needed funds for Hurricane Katrina.\n  It provides $2 billion for border security, fully offset, which was \nincluded in Senator Gregg's amendment.\n  That being said, there are a number of items in this bill that do not \nbelong in an emergency supplemental appropriations bill.\n  Many of these are very important projects that have merit.\n  Many of these programs are worthy of Federal funding, and, when the \nregular appropriations season gets underway, I will work to see if \nthere is a way we can fund them.\n  But the question before us today is not whether they have merit \nbecause undoubtably most do.\n  The question is not even whether they should receive Federal funding.\n  Here is the question we must ask with respect to each of the needs \nthat are being funded in this bill: Are they emergencies?\n  The Senate version of the appropriations supplemental bill is $106.49 \nbillion, over $14 billion more than the President's request of $92.22 \nbillion.\n  Because these are designated as ``emergency funds,'' they are not \nfactored into the budget.\n  As far as Washington is concerned, they ``don't count.''\n  But they do count.\n  There is no magic pot of money that can be tapped for emergency \nneeds.\n  This is straight deficit spending.\n  There are times when emergency spending is justified, but if we abuse \nit, we might as well not even have a budget.\n  What is emergency spending?\n  The emergency appropriations process is set up to be an exception to \nthe normal appropriations cycle so that money can be spent for \nunexpected occurrences that come up throughout the year, such as \nadditional war costs or unexpected disasters.\n  This money is not factored into the regular budget.\n  The other body exercised fiscal restraint when they took up the \nsupplemental bill and actually managed to bring the bill's top line \nnumber down from the Presidents's request to $91.95 billion.\n  However, during the Senate markup, the bill expanded rapidly.\n  According to the National Journal, money was added at a rate of more \nthan $80 million per minute during the 2-hour markup.\n  Of course, it is not important how fast the money was added or how \nmuch is in the bill.\n  The only things that matter are:\n  Are these meritorious programs?\n  Are they Federal responsibilities?\n  Are they emergencies?\n  Senator Gregg, a distinguished member of the Appropriations Committee \nand my chairman on the Budget Committee, wrote a piece in the Wall \nStreet Journal on April 18 entitled ``The Safety Valve Has Become a \nFire Hose.''\n  The piece gives an excellent explanation of the problem with abusing \nthe emergency spending process.\n\n[[Page S4024]]\n\n  While Senator Gregg and I disagree with regard to 2-year budgeting, \nwe have no disagreement on the proposal he outlines in his article, \nwhich is 1-year budgeting, which means, let's live under the budget we \nhave now and have a sequester if we exceed it.\n  In the piece, Senator Gregg states:\n\n       there are two sets of books, and [only] one is subject to \n     the budget controls.\n\n  Adding superfluous spending to the emergency supplemental is a way to \ncheat the system and get around having to actually pay for the money we \nspend.\n  Here are a few of the most egregious provisions in the bill:\n  First, some of the funds in this bill are spent as far out as fiscal \nyear 2010 and beyond.\n  Money being spent 5 years from now is not an emergency, and can be \nallocated and paid for through the regular budget process each year.\n  If we need money to start these projects, we can give money for the \nfirst year. But all other money should be subject to the oversight of \nan authorizing committee and the regular budget process.\n  Secondly, $594 million allocated for the Federal Highway \nAdministration to go to projects on ``the current FHWA ER backlog \ntable,'' which lists storms back to 1999.\n  Our budget specifically outlines the criteria for emergency spending. \nIt is as follows:\n\n       (A) necessary, essential, or vital (not merely useful or \n     beneficial);\n       (B) sudden, quickly coming into being, and not building up \n     over time;\n       (C) an urgent, pressing, and compelling need requiring \n     immediate action;\n       (D) subject to paragraph (2), unforeseen, unpredictable, \n     and unanticipated; and\n       (E) not permanent, temporary in nature.\n\n  If funds are in fact needed to meet needs from a hurricane in 1999 or \nan ice storm in 2001, that should have been reasonably foreseen in \n2005, when we were drawing up this year's budget.\n  The backlogged highway repairs for these storms could have been paid \nfor through the regular appropriations process or the $286 billion \ntransportation bill that passed last year.\n  Emergency supplementals are for unanticipated costs, not costs \nanticipated 5 years ago.\n  Emergency spending should be an exception to the appropriations \nprocess--not the rule.\n  There are ways to pay for emergencies, and there are ways to pay for \npast emergencies.\n  The items on this chart that predate the last fiscal year are not \nemergencies and should not be treated as such in the appropriations \nprocess.\n  They should be paid for, just like the relief efforts on all other \npast emergencies.\n  According to National Taxpayers Union President John Berthoud, since \n1996 the Federal Government has spent over $450 billion under the \n``emergency'' designation--an extra $1,500 for every person in America.\n  Nearly all of our 50 States maintain emergency, contingency, reserve, \nor ``rainy day'' funds to help cover unanticipated spending needs. This \nwould not only help to smooth out spikes in deficit spending but also \nhelp to prevent politicians from taking advantage of urgent situations \nto grow other Government programs.\n  We need to better prepare for these type expenses, like our States \ndo.\n  The President in the Statement of Administration Policy on this bill \ndrew a clear line in the sand. Let me read from the SAP:\n\n       However, the Senate reported bill substantially exceeds the \n     President's request, primarily for items that are unrelated \n     to the GWOT and hurricane response. The Administration is \n     seriously concerned with the overall funding level and the \n     numerous unrequested items included in the Senate bill that \n     are unrelated to the war or emergency hurricane relief needs. \n     The final version of the legislation must remain focused on \n     addressing urgent national priorities while maintaining \n     fiscal discipline.\n       Accordingly, if the President is ultimately presented a \n     bill that provides more than $92.2 billion, exclusive of \n     funding for the President's plan to address pandemic \n     influenza, he will veto the bill.\n\n  The statement could not be clearer.\n  The day after he sent up the SAP, I sent a letter to the President, \nwhich was signed by 35 other Senators, committing to sustain any veto \nof this bill which violates the principles outlined in the SAP.\n  I have every confidence that our congressional leadership and our \nPresident, and their ability, working with the distinguished chairman \nof the Appropriations Committee, can find a way to make a good bill fit \nwithin the numbers outlined by the President.\n  This supplemental debate highlights a larger issue.\n  We need budget process reform.\n  We need a line-item veto. Senator Frist's bill, S. 2381, Provides \nthat rescissions packages submitted by the President shall be treated \nwith fast-track authority. But this bill is just the beginning.\n  We need to reform Congressional Budget Office scoring in the \nfollowing ways:\n  Dynamic scoring. Senator Ensign's bill, S. 287, addresses this issue. \nChanges in tax law will be scored to take into account real-life \neffects on the economy.\n  Tax/spending parity. CBO scores should treat tax expirations and \nspending expirations the same.\n  Long-term scoring. We should require CBO scores to have more detailed \nestimates for long-term costs of authorizations and direct spending.\n  Database of authorizations. We should require CBO to produce a \ndatabase with a comprehensive catalog of all authorized spending, user-\nfriendly, searchable and sortable by expiration date and category, and \ntotal authorized amounts, appropriated amounts. Database should be \navailable online, searchable, sortable, and provide overall total \namounts.\n  We also ought to move to a 2-year budget.\n  Senator Domenici has been spearheading this issue. His bill, S. 877, \nis an excellent bill. Under his bill, all budgeting and appropriating \noccurs in first year of a Congress. The second session focuses on \noversight.\n  Database for Federal grantees. We should require the creation of a \ndatabase of Federal grantees so taxpayers can log on and find out who \nis spending their money and how.\n  Government shutdown protection. This provision would provide that if \nappropriations bills are not enacted by the beginning of the fiscal \nyear, programs continue at previous year's level.\n  Spending firewall. We should create four firewalled categories of \nFederal spending: defense, international, domestic, and homeland, which \nwould be binding and in the budget. This would ensure that security \nneeds would be met and could not be raided during the appropriations \nprocess to pay for social spending.\n  Pay-go for emergency spending. Automatic across-the-board reduction \nin spending for emergencies. Provide that emergency spending \nautomatically triggers an across-the-board rescission in all spending. \nSenator Gregg mentioned a program like this in his Wall Street Journal \npiece.\n  Mutiyear caps. We should provide that 302(a) discretionary caps carry \nover for the life of a budget resolution, including the ability for the \nAppropriations Committee to issue 302(b) suballocations. Currently, if \nwe have no budget, we have a top-line discretionary cap but no way to \nenforce it. We should provide a mechanism for the Appropriations \nchairman to issue suballocations in the event that a budget is not \npassed.\n  Commission on Accountability and Review of Federal Agencies. Senator \nBrownback's bill, S. 1155, takes the concept of BRAC and applies it to \nwasteful domestic spending programs.\n  Efficencies. We should allow up to 2 percent of any Department to be \ntransferred to pay down the national debt if efficiencies are found. \nThe current system requires bureaucrats to be inefficient. We give them \na big pot of money and say: You must spend this. We should encourage, \nnot discourage, frugality.\n  Entitlement commission. We should provide for a commission to review \nentitlements, provide recommendations for reform, and provide fast-\ntrack consideration for reform proposals.\n  Earmark reform. Finally, we need to finish the process we started on \nthe lobbying reform package, which is earmark reform. Senators McCain \nand Lott have led on this important issue.\n  I look forward to consideration of budget process reform later this \nyear.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am extremely disappointed that the \nSenate did not get the chance to vote on my amendment to strengthen the \noversight and monitoring of over $1.6 billion included in this \nsupplemental for\n\n[[Page S4025]]\n\nIraq reconstruction. This amendment, designed to extend the oversight \nof the Special Inspector General for Iraq, SIGIR, over reconstruction \nfunding in the supplemental, would have helped the SIGIR continue its \nvaluable work in ensuring that U.S. taxpayer dollars are being used \nefficiently and effectively.\n  We should not be spending money on Iraqi reconstruction without \nensuring there is appropriate oversight and auditing. My amendment \nwould have strengthened the capabilities of the Special IG to monitor, \naudit, and inspect funds made available for assistance for Iraq in both \nthe Iraq Relief and Reconstruction Fund, IRRF, and in other important \naccounts. It is frankly baffling to me that anyone would oppose this \namendment being included in the supplemental.\n  As we continue to pour tens of billions of dollars in to Iraq, I \nbelieve that we must not lose oversight of U.S. taxpayer dollars. \nAmerican taxpayers deserve to know where their money is going in this \ncostly war and that it is being used effectively and efficiently and \nending up in the right hands.\n  The Iraq IG's work to date has been extremely valuable to the U.S. \nGovernment and to Congress. The Iraq IG has now completed 55 audit \nreports, issued 165 recommendations for program improvement, and has \nseized $13 million in assets. In its latest report, released over the \nweekend, the Iraq IG indicated that it has completed 29 audits and \nreleased 58 recommendations for program improvement in this quarter \nalone. Overall, the SIGIR estimates that its operations have resulted \nin saving $24 million. Throughout 2005, the Iraq IG provided aggressive \noversight to prevent waste, fraud, and abuse in the at-times lethal \noperating environment in Iraq. Its emphasis on real-time auditing--\nwhere guidance is provided immediately to management authorities upon \nthe discovery of a need for change--provides for independent \nassessments while effecting rapid improvements.\n  In its January report to Congress, the SIGIR concluded that massive \nunforeseen security costs, administrative overhead, and waste have \ncrippled original reconstruction strategies and have prevented the \ncompletion of up to half of the work originally called for in critical \nsectors such as water, power, and electricity. The Iraq IG's work has \nresulted in the arrest of five individuals who were defrauding the U.S. \nGovernment, and it has shed light on millions of dollars of waste. It \nis this kind of investigation and reporting that helps shape the \ndirection of reconstruction funding and ensures that the money is being \nused and allocated as transparently and effectively as possible.\n  Mr. President, I originally drafted legislation to create the Special \nInspector General for Iraq, known as SIGIR, in order to ensure that \nthere is critical oversight of the Iraq Relief and Reconstruction Fund, \nIRRF, allocated for Iraq reconstruction projects. I believed then, and \nI believe now, that it is crucial that we have an effective oversight \ncapability over American taxpayer dollars spent in Iraq. Last year, I \nfought to extend the life of this office, which has been recognized by \nthe Department of State and Defense as a valuable and necessary office. \nI do not intend to let this week's setback prevent me from pushing for \ncontinued transparency and accountability in the administration's \npolicies in Iraq.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, over the March recess, I joined the \nleaders of the Senate Armed Services Committee, Senator John Warner of \nVirginia and Senator Carl Levin of Michigan, on a trip to Iraq to hear \nthe on-the-ground perspective of our military leaders, our troops in \nthe field, and Iraqi officials. I returned to the United States as \nalways overwhelmed by my pride and admiration for our service men and \nwomen, who continue to work with commitment and professionalism even in \nthe most difficult circumstances. I cast my vote in support of this \nsupplemental package before us because I am completely committed to \nproviding our men and women in uniform with the support they need to \ncontinue their excellent work. Toward that end, I am very pleased that \nan amendment I authored calling for regular reports on the Pentagon's \nefforts to train our troops in methods of detecting and defeating \nimprovised explosive devices has been added to this bill.\n  I also cast this vote today because when it comes to funding our \nservice men and women, right now this supplemental is the only game in \ntown. And because the administration refuses, year after year, to \nincorporate the costs of ongoing operations in Iraq into the regular \nbudget, we have no choice but to fund these efforts through these \nemergency supplementals--essentially putting hundreds of billions on \nour national tab. The Senate voted overwhelmingly in support of Senator \nByrd's amendment urging the administration to stop these irresponsible \nbudget games. I hope the President heeds that message.\n  In addition to reaffirming my admiration for our military, my recent \ntrip to Iraq also gave me a deeper understanding of the importance of \nsuccess in Iraq and the truly daunting nature of the challenges ahead.\n  In addition to the extremely serious fiscal issues confronting us, we \nhave the even more serious policy issue to consider--how should U.S. \npolicy proceed in Iraq?\n  A failed Iraqi state would threaten our national interests, \ndestabilizing an already volatile region and creating a lasting haven \nfor terrorists. Our national security imperatives mandate our \ncommitment to Iraq's success.\n  Success in Iraq is dependent on several factors: controlling \nviolence, creating a stable government of national unity, delivering \nbasic services and the promise of economic development to the Iraqi \npeople, and establishing strong and supportive relations between Iraq \nand its neighbors in the region. If any of these pillars are missing, \nIraq's future becomes uncertain and unstable.\n  America can help, but ultimately the Iraqis must achieve these goals \non their own. The Iraqi people and Iraqi security forces have made \nsignificant strides, but much more remains before Iraq can govern and \nprotect Iraqis. And Iraq's neighbors, who know the region best and will \nsuffer most from a failed state in their midst, must step up to the \nplate to help end the political deadlock in Iraq.\n  We all recognize that U.S. forces cannot and should not remain in \nIraq indefinitely. The U.S. military presence in Iraq should depend \nupon Iraqi leaders promptly making the compromises necessary to achieve \nthe broad-based, sustainable, political settlement necessary to form a \ngovernment of national unity and defeat the insurgency. We need \npartners within Iraq and outside its borders who are committed to \nstability and sharing power in order to achieve the mission of a truly \ndemocratic Iraq, and to share in that success with Iraq's people.\n  We also need to ensure that the magnitude of the challenge before us \nin Iraq does not distract all our attention from the vitally important, \nongoing mission in Afghanistan. This bill also provides much needed \nsupport for that mission. We have made tremendous progress, working \nwith the Afghan people, in helping to turn Afghanistan from a state \nsponsor of terrorism to a stable, responsible member of the \ninternational community. But our work is by no means complete, and the \nAmerican troops and Afghani leaders I met with in Kabul just weeks ago \nunderscored how important it is that we continue our strong support for \nthe stabilizing mission.\n  This bill also provides support for the communities devastated by \nlast year's hurricane season. I am afraid that, thus far, the story of \nthe Government's response to Katrina has been a story of failure not \nonly in the preparations for the storm and in the midst of the crisis \nbut also in the recovery effort. Too many promises have not been kept, \nand too many American families continue to live in an atmosphere of \nuncertainty. The provisions in this bill will help, but our commitment \ndoes not end here. Congress needs to make sure that the gulf region has \nthe necessary resources to recover from last year's hurricanes and \nrespond to future storms, but it must also make sure that the \nadministration has fixed the incompetence at FEMA and DHS which \ndisturbed so many Americans. I look forward to continuing to work on \nthese important issues in the upcoming months.\n  Over the past 6 years, Colorado has suffered from ongoing natural \ndisasters including drought. Unfortunately,\n\n[[Page S4026]]\n\nmany areas in Colorado continue to suffer from ongoing extreme weather \nconditions including drought, hail, and frost. In particular, Colorado \nwheat producers are estimating that this will be the fifth below-\naverage wheat crop in 6 years.\n  In addition, many Colorado farmers and ranchers are suffering from \neconomic losses due to continually rising gas prices. And what is true \nin Colorado is true in many other States across the country. That is \nwhy I am an original cosponsor of Senator Conrad's emergency \nagriculture disaster assistance package, and I am so pleased that it \nwas included as part of this supplemental bill. Toward that end, I \nespecially thank Senators Conrad and Cochran, who worked very hard on \nthese important provisions. I am so pleased that the Senate has voted \nto provide immediate assistance to producers across the country who \nhave been devastated by a variety of natural disasters.\n  While, overall, we are lucky in Colorado that this has been a better \nyear for many of our farmers and ranchers who have suffered from \ncontinuing natural disasters over the past several years, many \nproducers in southern and eastern Colorado have been hit by drought \nconditions once again.\n  It has been downhill for the 2005 Colorado winter wheat crop since \nlast May. In fact, estimates show that it will be the fifth below-\naverage winter wheat crop in 6 years--with potential losses to \nproducers of over $60 million.\n  In addition, increasing gas prices have hit our rural communities \nhard, making it virtually impossible for many producers to cover the \nunexpected additional costs. During harvest, agricultural producers are \nsome of the largest fuel consumers in the United States and producers \nare facing enormous fuel costs. Farm fuel has increased by 79 percent \nfrom $1.40 per gallon in September of 2004 to around $2.60 per gallon \nin September 2005. Colorado wheat producers have told me that it would \ntake a 40-bushel average yield per acre and an average price of $4.00 \nper bushel to cover all of these additional costs and break even. \nUnfortunately, the average yield in 2005 was 24 bushels per acre, and \nthe average price is projected at $3.34 per bushel.\n  Finally, Mr. President, I wish to express again how pleased I am that \nthe Senate adopted my amendment to provide an additional $30 million to \nreduce the risk of catastrophic fires and mitigate the effects of \nwidespread insect infestations throughout the entire National Forest \nSystem. In the West, the seasonal wildfire potential outlook map shows \nabove-normal fire danger across the Western United States and several \nSouthern States, too, have increased fire dangers. One of the most \nalarming factors in the wildfire outlook this year is insect \ninfestation. For example, my State of Colorado has over 1.5 million \nacres that have been infested by bark beetles. After these infestations \ncome through a forest, they leave behind entire stands of trees--\nsometimes thousands of acres--that are more susceptible to fire due to \nthe dried-out conditions and increased fuel loads in those forests. \nJust today, I learned from the U.S. Forest Service that Colorado has \n280,000 acres of approved hazardous fuel reduction projects that are \nawaiting treatment, with Forest Service funding only sufficient to \nconduct about a quarter of those projects under the best circumstances. \nThis situation represents a true emergency, and I am relieved that we \nwere able to address it in this bill.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am voting for this legislation because \nit provides important funding for our troops and for the people \nrecovering from the devastation caused by last year's hurricanes. \nUnfortunately, I do so with great reluctance because of two fundamental \nproblems with this measure.\n  First, this bill continues the administration's fiscally \nirresponsible practice of funding our Iraq and Afghanistan operations \noutside of the regular budget process. That problem is compounded by \nthe administration's failure to enunciate a clear policy for how we \nwill conclude our military mission in Iraq. Our country needs a new \nvision for strengthening our national security, and it starts by \nredeploying U.S. forces from Iraq and refocusing our attention on the \nglobal terrorist threats that face us. As I noted earlier in the week, \nwhen I was prevented from offering an amendment that would have \nrequired redeploying the bulk of our troops in Iraq by the end of the \nyear, we should not be appropriating billions of dollars for Iraq \nwithout debating--and demanding--a strategy to complete our military \nmission there. Not when the lives of our soldiers and the safety of our \ncountry are at risk.\n  Second, this bill has become the most recent vehicle for the \nexplosion of unauthorized spending that is finding its way onto \nappropriations bills. In addition to providing funding for military \noperations in Iraq and Afghanistan, this bill was supposed to be \nlimited to addressing the very real needs arising from Hurricane \nKatrina and other disasters.\n  Unfortunately, there seems to be an attitude in Congress that is \nreflected in the comments of one former Member of the other body, who \nwas especially skilled at advancing spending items: ``I never saw a \ndisaster that wasn't also an opportunity.''\n  Regrettably, this bill has provided just such an opportunity to \ninterests seeking to circumvent the scrutiny of the authorizing \ncommittees or of a competitive grant process. As a result, this measure \nis larded up with spending for unauthorized programs. Worse, none of \nthis spending is paid for. It is all added to the already massive tab \nwe are leaving our children and grandchildren.\n  I supported efforts on the floor to strip some of the funding that \ndoes not belong in the bill. I opposed efforts to table an amendment by \nSenator Thomas and a motion by Senator Ensign that would have forced \nthe Senate to consider a bill with a smaller, and more reasonable price \ntag. I also supported several amendments offered by Senator Coburn and \nSenator McCain to eliminate funding in the bill for projects that, \nwhile they might have some merit, do not necessarily warrant emergency \nspending. If we are going to pass emergency appropriations bills that \naren't offset, we should be sure that the spending in those bills is \nfully justified.\n  A portion of the floor debate on this legislation was devoted to \nskyrocketing energy prices. While significant increases in fuel costs \nhave affected all Americans, they have put the American farmer in an \nespecially tough situation. Unfortunately, I have serious concerns with \nhow this problem has been addressed in this bill.\n  Under this bill, growers of program crops--rice, feed grains, \noilseeds, wheat, cotton and peanuts--who are only about a quarter of \nfarm income receive $1.5 billion or 90 percent of assistance, while \nonly $74.5 million is provided for specialty crops, dairy and livestock \nproducers through a block grant to States. Moreover, only the producers \nof program crops will receive assistance directly. The remaining 75 \npercent of farmers will not receive direct assistance, nor will they be \nassured that any funds will find their way to them since those funds \ncan also be used for nutrition programs or marketing. Clearly there is \na disconnect between the avowed purpose of this farm assistance and the \ndetails of how the program will operate, which is why I supported \nSenator McCain's amendment to strike a portion of this program.\n  I urge my colleagues in conference to take a close look at the \ndetails of this program. If the program's intent is to help all farmers \nwith their spiraling fuel-related costs, the proposal falls seriously \nshort. Even the modest step of placing a payment limit on the $1.5 \nbillion for direct payments could provide hundreds of millions of \ndollars for both a more equitable program and savings for taxpayers.\n  I am pleased that a compromise was reached among my colleagues \nregarding the K-12 educational funding for schools that have taken in \ndisplaced students. Schools across the country, including some in \nWisconsin, have opened their doors to the hundreds of thousands of \nstudents who were displaced by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. I strongly \nsupport continued efforts to assist the schools that are educating \nthese students. I am glad that this funding will be provided through \ntitle V of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, which allows \nlocal school districts to provide specific educational services to the \nschools, rather\n\n[[Page S4027]]\n\nthan direct funding to private schools. This agreement will best serve \nour educators and students as they continue to recover and heal from \nthe devastation wrought by the hurricanes.\n  This legislation also includes significant funding to address \ncritical foreign policy concerns. An amendment introduced by Senator \nBiden sets aside funding for a special envoy for Sudan. A special envoy \nis desperately needed to help bring peace to Darfur and to help ensure \nthat the peace agreement between the north and south is adhered to. \nThis bill also includes key funding needed for strengthening a \npeacekeeping mission in Darfur to help bring an end to what has become \none of the world's greatest tragedies.\n  This bill also includes funding for Liberia's fragile postelection \nperiod, and support for Haiti's tentative transition to a democracy and \nfor the Democratic Republic of the Congo's upcoming elections. This \nfunding is needed urgently to help these countries make the much-needed \ntransition to peace and democratic rule.\n  I have noted some of the important measures funded in this emergency \nsupplemental and there are many more. Emergency supplemental spending \nmeasures are needed at times to deal with true emergencies. However, to \nborrow a line from the President, this Congress is addicted to \nsupplementals. I am glad that the Senate adopted Senator Byrd's sense-\nof-the-Senate amendment insisting that future war costs be included in \nthe regular budget. With this bill, total war-related funding paid for \nthrough supplementals will reach approximately $440 billion. That is an \nenormous sum of money and that does not even include the nearly half \ntrillion dollar annual defense budget. I hope the Senate will stand \nfirm on this issue and insist that any future spending for the Iraq war \ngoes through the regular budget process.\n  Mr. President, I will vote for this measure with the hope that the \nadministration will work with conferees to eliminate the unjustified \nspending slipped into this bill, and with a renewed determination to \nmake sure that this body fully debates and votes on my proposal to \nredeploy our troops out of Iraq by the end of the year, and refocus our \nresources on the fight against terrorism.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today to speak in support of the \nprovisions in the supplemental spending bill to assist agricultural \nproducers suffering from Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, drought, \nwildfires, and other natural disasters. I would like to thank Chairman \nCochran and Senator Byrd for their work on this bill, as well as my \ncolleagues who have worked with me on this matter since last summer's \nMidwest drought.\n  This has not been an easy year for our Nation's farmers and ranchers. \nHurricanes Katrina and Rita wreaked havoc on producers throughout the \ngulf coast. Losses to livestock and crop production in the gulf coast \ntotal in the hundreds of millions of dollars. Many farmers in that part \nof the country will not even have the opportunity to plant their crops \nthis season due to saltwater intrusion on their lands.\n  In addition, for farmers outside the gulf coast, the hurricane \nbrought about higher fuel prices and increased the cost of shipping as \nthe Port of New Orleans was temporarily closed. In my home State of \nIllinois, producers have suffered one of the worst droughts since 1895. \nThe period from March 2005 to February 2006 was the third driest March \nto February period since 1895. Even with some very fortunate late \nrains, these drought conditions significantly lowered both yields and \nthe value of the year's harvest.\n  According to the USDA's National Agricultural Statistics Service, \nNASS, the value of Illinois' corn crop decreased by more than $1.1 \nbillion, or about 25 percent, from 2004 to 2005 even as corn acreage \nincreased. At least 10 counties in northeast and western Illinois \nsustained greater than 20 percent losses in corn yields. Unfortunately, \nfarmers and ranchers are not expecting this crop year to reverse last \nyear's trend. USDA's Economic Research Service, ERS, expects net farm \nincome to drop 23.2 percent this year, from $72.7 billion to $56.2 \nbillion, due in large part to stagnant crop prices and rising energy \ncosts.\n  To make matters more difficult, the price of diesel fuel has doubled \nsince the summer of 2004. Fertilizer prices have taken off as well, \nincreasing by more than 30 percent per acre since 2001. Even with \nincreased efficiency, these rising prices are hurting our Nation's \nfarming families.\n  Because farmers use so much energy running their tractors and \ncombines, applying fertilizers, and hauling their products by truck to \nbuyers and markets, these prices are squeezing the already thin profit \nmargins of our Nation's producers. Especially when we keep in mind that \ncommodity prices have stayed fairly level over the past 2 years we can \nsee why these natural disasters and high energy costs may be putting \nour farmers at risk of losing their farms.\n  The provisions that some of my colleagues and the Bush administration \nseek to strike would provide assistance to producers who suffered crop \nlosses due to natural disasters such as the drought in the Corn Belt \nand flooding in various parts of the country, and to those who lost \nlivestock, such as Texas ranchers in this year's wildfires. The \nmeasures that are under attack here would also provide a direct payment \nto producers who are struggling to keep their heads above water due to \nthe rapidly increasing cost of fuel and other inputs.\n  This is what surprises me most--at this trying time for our Nation's \nfarmers and ranchers, Members of Congress are actively working to \nprevent this much needed assistance from reaching our farmers and \nranchers. The Bush administration has even gone so far as to say that \nthere has been no disaster at all, even though the Secretary of \nAgriculture designated 101 of 102 counties in Illinois as disaster \nareas. Well, the Bush administration budget crunchers aren't talking to \ntheir own disaster experts, let alone farmers in western Illinois or \nranchers in Texas or anyone who is trying to pay rising energy costs \nwhile growing the wheat, corn, and soybeans that keep our people fed.\n  Now is not the time to turn away from the thousands of farmers who \nwill depend on this assistance to purchase equipment and stay in \nbusiness this season. I ask my colleagues to join me in expressing \ntheir support for these important provisions that will provide some \nmuch needed relief for our nation's agricultural producers. I hope the \nSenate will insist that agricultural assistance be included in the \nfinal supplemental spending bill, notwithstanding the misguided \npositions of the White House and House on this important matter.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, yesterday I spoke on the floor about \namendment 3662 filed by Senator Feingold and cosponsored by myself and \nSenators Byrd, Salazar, Lieberman and Collins, concerning the Special \nInspector General for Iraq.\n  In that statement I pointed out that because of the administration's \ndecision to request funds for Iraq reconstruction under traditional \nForeign Operations accounts even though the funds would be used to \ncontinue many of the same activities previously funded under the Iraq \nRelief and Reconstruction Fund, it would end the Special IG's oversight \nof these funds.\n  The Feingold amendment would have ensured that the Special IG's \noversight continued, but the Majority opposed his amendment.\n  As a result, we now have only the State Department Inspector General \nto oversee these funds, even though that office has no people in Iraq \nand no capacity to undertake a job of this size and complexity any time \nsoon.\n  I understand that my friend from Wisconsin went to the floor prior to \nthe vote on cloture and waited for an opportunity to offer his \namendment, but he was unable to obtain floor time. After cloture was \ninvoked his amendment was ruled nongermane, and he was out of luck as \nfar as getting a vote on his amendment.\n  The Special IG has uncovered widespread waste, fraud and abuse. \nShocking sums have been wasted by unqualified contractors who spent the \ntaxpayer's money as if it grew on trees, with little to show for it. \nMany projects that have absorbed millions or tens of millions of \ndollars will never be completed.\n  The Special IG has not won any popularity contests with the agencies \nwhose performance he is responsible for overseeing, nor with some in \nthe majority in Congress. However, they have\n\n[[Page S4028]]\n\nnever offered a substantive explanation for ending his oversight of the \nIraq reconstruction funds.\n  I do want to correct one of my statements yesterday, when I said that \nmembers of the majority party, in opposing the Feingold amendment, were \n``acting on behalf of some in the Pentagon and the White House who want \nto shut down the office of the Special IG.''\n  I am informed that members of the majority party were not acting on \nbehalf of the Pentagon and the White House. It was not my intention to \nimpugn the integrity or character of my friends in the majority who I \nrespect and have worked closely with for years, but rather to convey my \nstrong disagreement and disappointment with their opposition to the \nFeingold amendment and to the continued oversight of these funds by the \nSpecial IG.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, today I wish to speak about the emergency \nsupplemental bill and about the amendments related to the ongoing \nconflict in Iraq and other pressing issues of the day.\n  For example, I am deeply disappointed that Senator Levin and others \nwho had Iraq-related amendments were not allowed to offer them \npostcloture. I would have supported the Levin amendment, just as I \nsupported the underlying emergency supplemental earlier today.\n  Having said that, I think there is something very wrong with a \nprocess that doesn't allow for full and open debate on the emergency \nfunding for Iraq and Afghanistan just passed by this body. That is why \nI voted against cloture on the underlying bill earlier this week.\n  Indeed, the Senate just approved more than $67 billion in emergency \nsupplemental funding for our combined military engagements in Iraq and \nAfghanistan. But because of the special rules of the Senate related to \nthe consideration of appropriations matters, most amendments which \nwould have spoken to United States policy in Iraq or Afghanistan were \nruled out of order and never received an up-or-down vote, or even an \nopportunity for full debate. This fact has done a real disservice to \nthe American people and, I believe, left the false impression that \nCongress is fully on board with our current policies.\n  By limiting debate on this bill, I'm afraid this body has also missed \nan important opportunity to address other issues of serious concern to \nthe American people, including, importantly, the high prices Americans \nare paying at the pump for gas. The energy issue, I would add, is \ncentral in our efforts not only to promote a strong economy and \nsupplies for Americans at home, but to our global efforts to secure \nU.S. national security interests.\n  Since 2000, the price of a gallon of gas has more than doubled, even \nwhen adjusted for inflation. In my home state of Connecticut, the \naverage price for a gallon of gas hit $3.04 last weekend. In some parts \nof the country, prices are even higher. And this winter, only mild \nweather kept people in colder parts of the country like New England \nfrom seeing record increases in their heating bills.\n  Anyone who drives a car, buys or sells anything shipped by truck or \nplane, or turns on the heat when it's cold, is paying record prices for \nenergy and enduring serious financial hardship.\n  At current prices, the average driver can expect to spend about \n$1,440 more on transportation this year than they did just a year ago. \nThat's a big chunk of money coming out of consumers' wallets and \nbusinesses' bottom line. It's also a real cause for concern for the \noverall economy--it has the potential to create inflation and act as a \ndrag on economic growth.\n  Meanwhile, while consumers are paying more, a few large oil companies \ncontinue to reap record profits. Let me be clear that I do not begrudge \na company--any company--from making a profit. The ability to earn a \nprofit is central to our capitalist system and the American spirit of \nentrepreneurship. But there is a big difference between profits and \nprofiteering. And in the opinion of many, the big oil companies--who \ncontrol the market for their products--have been engaging in \nprofiteering on the backs of the American consumer.\n  Regrettably, by invoking cloture on this bill, this body chose not to \nconsider measures that would have provided timely relief to American \nconsumers and would have strengthened our ability to prevent \nprofiteering at the expense of American families and businesses.\n  I was ready to offer one such measure with my colleague, the junior \nsenator from North Dakota. Many of my other colleagues were planning to \noffer measures of their own that also deserved consideration by this \nbody. The senior senator from Oregon, for one, held the floor for \nseveral hours last Thursday asking for a vote on his amendment, only to \nbe refused by the majority.\n  America has an energy policy that is rooted in the 19th century. We \ndepend on fossil fuels that are increasing in cost and limited in \nsupply; that contaminate our air, water, and food supplies; and that \nare found predominantly in parts of the world that are politically \nunstable. Meanwhile, global demand is growing as countries like China \nrequire greater fuel supplies to power their increasingly modern \neconomies.\n  This antiquated policy is having many adverse effects on our national \nsecurity. Frankly, if the industrialized world had a secure alternative \nsupply of energy, we would likely better be able to address any number \nof major international security crises--including the genocide in Sudan \nand Iranian nuclear ambitions. Serious action to address either issue \nis being stymied by nations reliant on other nations' oil exports.\n  We cannot keep running away from this problem. By failing to act on--\nor even consider--any of the measures that were ready to be offered \nthis week and last week, this body missed an important opportunity to \nprovide tangible energy policy solutions for the American public, and \nan important opportunity to strengthen U.S. national security. And the \nend result, in my view, is a great disservice to the American people \nand to U.S. national security.\n  I will vote for the emergency supplemental bill because while our \ntroops are in harm's way, I believe that we need to provide them with \nevery necessary resource so they can come home safely. But I frankly \nthink that having more time to debate these issues and amendments would \nhave done much to ensure the safety and security of our troops and all \nAmericans in the years to come.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, as Chair of the Senate Committee on Small \nBusiness and Entrepreneurship, I rise today to address the impact of \namendment No. 3810 proposed by the distinguished Senator from Illinois, \nMr. Obama. Strengthening competition in the Hurricanes Katrina and Rita \nreconstruction contracts is a worthy goal. Along with my Senate \ncolleagues from both sides of the aisle, I have watched with \ndisappointment the rush of Federal agencies such as the Department of \nHomeland Security, DHS, and the Federal Emergency Management Agency, \nFEMA, to award hundreds of millions in no-bid contracts. Since last \nfall, my Committee held three oversight hearings on the Gulf Coast \nhurricane response and reconstruction efforts. Testimony at these \nhearings clearly established that small businesses have often been the \nvictims of no-bid reconstruction contracting. We received strong \ncommitments from the Army Corps of Engineers, the Department of \nHomeland Security, and the Small Business Administration to work hard \nto remedy this problem.\n  In response to the efforts of my committee and our counterpart \ncommittee in the House, positive results are already starting to show \nfor small contractors. As recently as March 31, 2006, the SBA and FEMA \njointly announced 36 contracts valued at $3.6 billion which will be set \naside for small and small disadvantaged businesses, aimed at \nmaintenance and deactivation of roughly 150,000 housing units. Priority \nfor award of these contracts would go to local businesses. Federal \nagencies are also beginning to award disaster relief contracts to small \nbusinesses located in Historically Underutilized Business Zones, \nHUBZones, as called for by the Office of Management and Budget \nGuidelines for Using Emergency Procurement Flexibilities. The Senate \nfully supported these efforts by unanimously passing amendment No. 3627 \ncosponsored by myself and Senators Vitter, Kerry, Landrieu, and\n\n[[Page S4029]]\n\nLott to make the gulf coast area a HUBZone and to waive a law \nprohibiting small business set-asides in certain industries. All these \nacquisition strategies enlarge the Federal Government's supplier base, \nand are mandated by the Federal Acquisition Regulation when qualified \nsmall businesses are available. It is my understanding that amendment \nNo. 3810 was not intended to prohibit spending on these and similar \nefforts. I ask whether my distinguished colleague, the sponsor of the \namendment, Senator Obama, had the same understanding?\n  Mr. OBAMA. I thank the distinguished Chair of the Senate Committee on \nSmall Business and Entrepreneurship for the opportunity to discuss this \nissue. I believe small businesses are the heart of the American economy \nand I am committed to expanding opportunities for small businesses to \ncompete for Federal contracts.\n  One of the reasons I offered the amendment was my concern that \nnoncompetitive contracts have shut out small, local and disadvantaged \nbusinesses from contracting opportunities in the gulf coast. If we are \nserious about restoring the gulf coast, we must ensure that small and \ndisadvantaged businesses have the tools and opportunities necessary to \ncreate the local jobs and provide the local services that are essential \nto a quick and sustainable recovery. The SBA has an important role to \nplay and should be actively using its authority to promote small \nbusiness growth and competitiveness.\n  I want to be clear that it was not the intent of the amendment to \ninterfere with small business set-aside programs that use appropriate \ncompetitive procedures in the awarding of contracts. I have been \ntroubled by reports of outrageous overhead charges going to large firms \nthat just end up subcontracting the work anyway to small businesses. It \nis important to preserve Federal Acquisition Regulations that require \ncontracts to be directed to small businesses where responsible small \nfirms are available to provide the government with quality products and \nservices at fair prices.\n  My amendment is directed at large Government contracts and seeks to \nprevent no-bid deals that deprive all of us of the benefits of fair \ncompetition. My amendment should not limit Federal funds for contracts \nlegitimately set aside for competition among small business concerns. \nSmall businesses help competition and competition helps small \nbusinesses. When a conference committee gets appointed on this bill, I \nwill communicate this understanding to the conferees.\n  Again, I thank the distinguished leader of the Senate Committee on \nSmall Business and Entrepreneurship, and I look forward to continuing \nto work with her to strengthen small businesses and to expand \nopportunity throughout the American economy.\n  Ms. SNOWE. I thank the distinguished Senator from Illinois for his \nclarification and his support of small business contracting.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the question is on \nthe engrossment of the amendments and third reading of the bill.\n  The amendments were ordered to be engrossed and the bill to be read a \nthird time.\n  The bill was read the third time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill having been read the third time, the \nquestion is, Shall the bill pass?\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Have the yeas and nays been ordered, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. They have not.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. The following Senator was necessarily absent: the \nSenator from Utah (Mr. Hatch).\n  Further, if present and voting, the Senator from Utah (Mr. Hatch) \nwould have voted ``yea.''\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The foregoing tally has been changed to reflect the above order.)\n  The Presiding Officer appointed Mr. Cochran, Mr. Stevens, Mr. \nSpecter, Mr. Domenici, Mr. Bond, Mr. McConnell, Mr. Burns, Mr. Shelby, \nMr. Gregg, Mr. Bennett, Mr. Craig, Mrs. Hutchison, Mr. DeWine, Mr. \nBrownback, Mr. Allard, Mr. Byrd, Mr. Inouye, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Harkin, Ms. \nMikulski, Mr. Reid, Mr. Kohl, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Dorgan, Mrs. Feinstein, \nMr. Durbin, Mr. Johnson, and Ms. Landrieu conferees on the part of the \nSenate.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I wanted to take a minute to express my \ndeep gratitude to Chairman Cochran who, as I stated earlier, has \ndemonstrated extraordinary patience over the past 2 weeks we have been \ndebating this supplemental bill.\n  I also want to express my thanks to the ranking member, Senator Byrd, \nwho has continued to demonstrate his strong and resolute leadership on \nthis bill.\n  I also want to thank the many members of our Appropriations Committee \nstaff who have worked very hard.\n  First and foremost, I thank our staff director and deputy staff \ndirector on our side, Terry Sauvain and Chuck Kieffer.\n  I also thank the majority staff director, Keith Kennedy, and his \nstaff, Clayton Heil and Les Spivey.\n  I want to make special mention of the extraordinary hard work of B.G. \nWright, Kate Fitzpatrick, and Rachael Taylor. They have been keeping us \nall on track on this side as to which of the hundreds of filed \namendments have been cleared and which have not.\n  Finally, I thank Peter Rogoff who has dedicated his life on the \nSenate floor for the last 2 weeks above and beyond the call.\n  I thank all our staff and floor staff for being here many long hours \nfor the completion of this bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nWashington for her kind remarks and for her leadership and assistance \nin getting this bill prepared by our committee, and for handling the \nduties of managing the bill on the floor of the Senate.\n  Senator Byrd, of course, the senior Democrat on the committee, has \nbeen an inspiration to me and a true leader in every sense of the word \nin our committee and in the Senate for a long\n\n[[Page S4030]]\n\ntime. He continues to be a very important friend to me. I am very \ngrateful for that friendship. I join Senator Murray in commending our \nstaff. But, first of all, I think I should mention my appreciation for \nthe majority leader, Bill Frist; and Harry Reid, the Democratic leader, \nfor giving us the latitude and the authority to manage this bill on the \nfloor of the Senate for the Committee on Appropriations to help ensure \nthat every Senator had an opportunity to speak and offer amendments, to \nbe a part of the passage of this bill in every sense of the word. We \nappreciate the leaders giving us that authority and for not trying to \nmanage the bill from their offices. I really appreciate that.\n  Also, I have to commend the staff members on our side: Keith Kennedy, \nstaff director, who has been working in the Senate for the \nAppropriations Committee for a good many years. He has a lot of \nexperience. He is a person of great integrity, and I am very fortunate \nthat he has agreed to serve as staff director of this committee and \ncontinue to provide guidance and supervision for all of the members of \nthe staff of the Committee on Appropriations.\n  We are very proud of all of the staff. Those who have been \nparticularly helpful to me during the handling of this bill, in \naddition to Keith, include Clayton Heil, our counsel for the committee, \nwho has been on the floor of the Senate for much of the handling of the \nbill; Les Spivey, who is also a member of the full committee staff, he \ndoes a good job as well. I guess you could say he is our token \nMississippian who is on the first team of the committee staff.\n  Terry Sauvain has been someone with whom I have enjoyed working for a \nnumber of years. He has worked closely with Senator Byrd for a good \nmany years. We appreciate Terry's continued good assistance, \nparticularly in the handling of this bill.\n  Chuck Keiffer and Peter Rogoff--Peter works for Senator Murray on the \ncommittee staff and has a lot of experience. He has been very helpful \nto us as we have managed this bill in the Senate.\n  I thank David Schiappa, Laura Dove, and Jodie Hernandez. They have \nbeen at the desk keeping up with all of the amendments, colloquies, and \norder of business, and keeping people advised through cloakroom \ntelephones and answering Member's questions when they come onto the \nSenate floor. They go to that spot and ask for the pending business or \nwhat the order of amendments may be. They have been absolutely \nprofessional and diligent and helpful in every way.\n  On the Democratic side, I thank Marty Paone and Lula Davis for \nhelping to keep up with things for the Democrats and helping to provide \nadvice and counsel to all of us who have been involved in the handling \nof this bill. We are deeply grateful for their assistance.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/04/senate-section/article/S4030-1", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4030]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             UNANIMOUS CONSENT AGREEMENT EXECUTIVE CALENDAR\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER.

Mr. President, I am here today because I may have \nmisunderstood the actions on the other side of the aisle. Something \nrather surprising has occurred. It would appear from their actions that \nmy colleagues in the Democratic Party seem to believe that we ought to \nsing the national anthem, say the Pledge of Allegiance, and take the \noath of citizenship in this country in something other than our common \nlanguage, English.\n  Here is why I say that. On Monday, along with several other Senators, \nI introduced a very simple resolution, a resolution affirming that \nstatements of national unity, especially the Pledge of Allegiance and \nthe national anthem, ought to be recited or sung in our common \nlanguage, English. That is all it says.\n  Let me read the relevant part of the resolution. It says:\n\n       Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, that the Senate affirms that statements or songs \n     that symbolize the unity of the Nation, including the \n     National Anthem, the Oath of Allegiance sworn by new United \n     States citizens, and the Pledge of Allegiance to the Flag of \n     the United States, should be recited or sung in English, the \n     common language of the United States.\n\n  This is not a resolution about what we are free to do in the United \nStates; this is about what we ought to do in the United States. It is \nvery straightforward. It does not infringe on anyone's right to free \nspeech, or prohibit translation. It does not say Americans should not \nlearn a second language. In fact, I encourage our children to learn a \nsecond language or even a third language to better compete in this \nglobal economy.\n  The resolution does say that we believe that we Americans ought to \nrecite the pledge and sing ``The Star-Spangled Banner'' and other \nstatements and songs that unite us as a Nation in the language that \nunites us as a Nation, English.\n  Last Monday, every Senate office received a request for the \nresolution to be passed by unanimous consent. I would not expect this \nresolution to just be bipartisan, I would expect it to easily be \nunanimous. That request was agreed to by every Republican, but on the \nother side someone objected.\n  Should I assume that the Democratic side objected because they \nbelieve we Americans should, at least some of the time, sing our \nnational anthem in Spanish or some other foreign language? Do they \nbelieve we should recite the Pledge of Allegiance in Chinese, which is \nthe second most spoken foreign language in the United States?\n  This is important. It is important enough that we inscribed in this \nChamber, above the Presiding Officer, our original motto for this \ncountry: ``One from many.'' It is not ``Many from one.'' Our greatest \naccomplishment as a country is not our diversity, which is a \nmagnificent achievement; our greatest accomplishment is we have taken \nall of this diversity and made it into one country. And we have a few \nthings that unite us: our common history, the principles of our \nfounding documents, and our common language. If we should lose that, we \nwould be a United Nations, not the United States of America.\n  This is important because this is the emotion which underlies most of \nthe immigration debate we are having. The concern among many Americans, \nother than the rule of law which has to do with securing the border, is \nto make sure that those who come to our country become Americans. And \nwe do not do that by race, we do not do that by ethnicity, we do not do \nthat by what country an immigrant comes from, we do it by a few simple \nuniting ideas: our founding documents, our common history, and our \ncommon language.\n  This has been true for a long time in our country. When a legal \nimmigrant comes to the United States--and this has been the law for 100 \nyears--and he or she applies to become a citizen, he\n\n[[Page S4031]]\n\nor she must, by law, demonstrate an eighth grade level of understanding \nof the English language.\n  It was 150 years ago we founded common schools. We call them public \nschools today. Albert Shanker, the former head of the American \nFederation of Teachers, said the reason for the common school was so we \ncould teach mostly immigrant children to read and write in English, to \ndo math, and what it means to become an American, with the hope they \nwould go home and teach their parents.\n  We have always known it is important as Americans to have a common \nlanguage because that is how we can communicate with one another. \nImmigrants to our country understand this. That is why they come here. \nThey want to be part of our country that shares the values of liberty \nand equal opportunity. They want to contribute to our history of \nstriving toward those values. They want to learn our common language, \nand usually do, as evidenced by long waiting lists for a number of \nEnglish as a second language adult education courses across our \ncountry. That is why this Senate, just a few weeks ago, passed an \namendment to the immigration bill by a vote of 91 to 1 to help legal \nimmigrants learn English and to allow those who become fluent in \nEnglish to become American citizens 1 year faster.\n  We value our common language. It isn't an argument that is hard to \nunderstand. In fact, when I first announced this resolution, the first \nsupportive e-mail I received in my office came from Mr. Ramon L. \nCisneros, the publisher of La Campana, a Spanish-language newspaper in \nNashville with 18,000 subscribers.\n\n  He wrote:\n\n       . . . Thank you for this resolution. We are Hispanic \n     Americans and sometimes we write in Spanish for the benefit \n     of those newcomers who are in the process of learning \n     English. However, our common language as Americans is and \n     will always be English. And our national symbols should \n     always be said and sung in English.\n\n  I didn't ask Mr. Cisneros to write to me, but I am glad he did. He is \nproud of his Hispanic heritage. He performs an important service for \nHispanics in the Nashville area, which is a growing part of our State, \nbut he is also a proud, patriotic American. Our country is enriched by \ncitizens like Mr. Cisneros.\n  I am puzzled by the reaction from some of my colleagues in the \nDemocratic Party who seem to want to endorse the idea that we should \nsing the national anthem in some other language and recite the Pledge \nof Allegiance in some other language. We salute the American flag. We \npledge allegiance to the United States, and we speak in our common \nlanguage. That is how we unite ourselves.\n  Also, we might do a little bit better if we taught more U.S. history \nand civics in our public schools, which is another subject I have been \nworking on with strong support on the Democratic side from Senator \nKennedy, from Senator Reid, and especially from Senator Byrd.\n  I might note that in the House of Representatives, some Democrats \nhave already chosen to cosponsor this same identical resolution. It has \nbeen offered by Congressman Ryun of Kansas. I have a hard time \nunderstanding why Democrats in the Senate are not supportive. Maybe I \njust made a mistake. Maybe I misunderstood what has happened. So let me \ntry once again.\n  I ask unanimous consent that S. Res. 458 be discharged from the \nJudiciary Committee; further, that the Senate proceed to its \nconsideration. I further ask that the resolution and preamble be agreed \nto and the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, on behalf of other Democratic Members, I \nwill object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The objection is heard.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I think that makes my point. Apparently, I did not \nmisunderstand. Apparently, the Democratic Party in the Senate does not \nagree that we should say the Pledge of Allegiance, sing the national \nanthem, and take the oath of citizenship in our common language, \nEnglish. That is a grave misunderstanding of our country's greatest \naccomplishment. Our diversity is a magnificent achievement, but our \ngreater achievement is that we have taken all of this diversity and \nformed it into one country so that we are the United States of America. \nIt is a central part of becoming American.\n  I am extremely disappointed by this objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/04/senate-section/article/S4031-1", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4031]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ENGLISH IN AMERICA\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, let me say that Democrats and Republicans \nare perhaps not all of one mind on the question the Senator just \nraised.\n  I personally believe it is absolutely essential to the strength of \nAmerica that we encourage and insist that people who come to this \ncountry speak in English. A common language is absolutely essential to \nthe unity of a nation. I look to our neighbors to the north and see the \nincredible traumas they have been through because they are speaking in \ntwo different languages.\n  My own strong belief is we ought to say the pledge in English, we \nought to sing the national anthem in English. That doesn't prevent \nsomeone else from singing it in another language. That does not offend \nme. But I do think that it is absolutely essential for the strength and \nthe unity of our Nation that those who come here, those who become \ncitizens, are able to speak English.\n  I come from a proud tradition of immigrants. We are sort of the North \nDakota melting pot. I am part Danish, I am part Swedish, I am part \nNorwegian, I am part German, I am part Scots-Irish, I am part French. \nSo many of the people of my State came here from Scandinavian and \nGerman countries. They are intensely proud of their traditions. Many of \nthem continue to speak the languages they came to this country with, \nbut almost without exception they made a priority of learning English, \nspeaking in English. I believe that is essential to our common \nheritage, that we have a common language.\n  I personally certainly believe that in any official setting, we ought \nto sing the anthem in English, we ought to say the pledge in English. \nIf someone wants to, at some other setting, sing in some other \nlanguage, that does not offend me, but in any official setting and in \nterms of what we ask and insist people do who are going to be part of \nour country, it is absolutely imperative they learn English. That is \nnot just for the good of the country, although it is certainly that, it \nis also for their own good.\n  My wife's family came here from Italy. My wife told me many times \nabout growing up in that family. Her grandfather for a time came and \nlived with them. There was an insistence in their family on speaking \nEnglish even though the grandfather who lived with them spoke no \nEnglish.\n  I find many who come from an immigrant background--as did I, as did \nmy wife and her family--in our families, there was an understanding \nthat the first order of business was to learn English, to speak English \nif we were going to be part of this country of which we are so proud.\n  I hope very much this is not presented as a partisan matter. I don't \nthink it is. As one person on this side of the aisle, I believe it is \nimperative that we take the pledge in English, that we sing the anthem \nin English, that we insist that people who come to be part of this \ncountry learn English. I believe it is absolutely essential that \nEnglish clearly be the official language of our Nation. That is \nabsolutely imperative for us as a country.\n  I also believe it is absolutely in the interest of the people who \ncome here. That is certainly the lesson learned in my family, of people \ncoming from all over the globe. My relatives who came from Denmark, my \nrelatives who came from Sweden, my relatives who came from Norway, and \nmy relatives who came from Germany were so proud to be part of this \ncountry. And they recognized that it was in their interest and it was \ntheir responsibility as a first order of business to learn English.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/04/senate-section/article/S4031-2", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4031-S4033]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    SUPPLEMENTAL APPROPRIATIONS AND AGRICULTURE DISASTER ASSISTANCE\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I rise to talk about the legislation we \nhave just passed and to say to my colleagues there are provisions in \nthe legislation for agriculture disaster that have been ridiculed in \nsome circles. I would say\n\n[[Page S4032]]\n\nthat those who have ridiculed the notion of disaster assistance for our \nNation's farmers are way off base, and they really do not know what \nthey are talking about.\n  I was extremely disappointed in the Secretary of Agriculture, who has \nsuggested the only problem that farmers have is in the gulf of this \ncountry. Look, we recognize that no part of the country was harder hit \nby Hurricanes Katrina and Rita than the gulf region. And these \nlegislative proposals that are in this bill will first and foremost \nhelp them because these are national provisions, these are not \nprovisions just for one section of our country.\n  But to suggest that nobody else in the country has had serious \nproblems, that reflects an ignorance that ill becomes the Secretary of \nAgriculture, ill becomes a man who is supposed to be the spokesman for \nthis Nation's farmers and ranchers.\n  Yes, Hurricanes Rita and Katrina devastated the gulf, and they \ndeserve first-priority consideration. But they were not the only ones \nhurt. Here are the headlines out of North Dakota: ``Rain Halts \nHarvest;'' ``North Dakota Receives Major Disaster Declaration;'' \n``Heavy Rain Leads To Crop Diseases;'' ``Beef Crop Could Be The \nSmallest In 10 Years;'' ``Crops, Hay Lost To Flooding;'' ``Rain Takes \nIts Toll On North Dakota Crops;'' ``Area Farmers Battle Flooding, \nDisease.''\n  Those were the headlines all across my State last year.\n  Shown on this chart are the number of counties in my State--they are \nthe counties in yellow--that were given disaster designations by the \nPresident--by the President--last year. They are the counties in \nyellow. I say to the Presiding Officer, you will notice every single \ncounty was designated a disaster. Why? Because we had rainfall 250 \npercent of normal. I do not know what is happening. Some say it is \nglobal climate change. Some say it is a weather cycle. I do not know. \nBut I do know the result.\n  The result is this, as shown in this picture: The result is farms all \nacross North Dakota that looked like they were in the middle of lakes \nlast year. This is what eastern North Dakota looked like last year, \nwhen we had a million acres of land that was even prevented from being \nplanted--a million acres.\n  The Secretary of Agriculture said there is no problem outside the \ngulf. Where has he been? Who is he listening to? Does he not do even \nthe least amount of homework before he makes these statements? We need \na new Secretary of Agriculture, if that is what he reports to the \nPresident.\n  These are the acres prevented from being planted in North Dakota last \nyear--over a million acres that could not even be planted--and this \nSecretary of Agriculture says there is no problem outside the Gulf \nStates?\n  Mr. Secretary, you ought to get with it. You ought to inform yourself \nbefore making such ridiculous statements.\n  As shown in this picture, this is North Dakota last year. These are \ntractors stuck in the mud. They could not plant. And in hundreds of \nthousands of additional acres where they were able to plant, they got \ndramatically reduced production. In those places they got production, \nwhen they went to the elevator, they got dramatically discounted \nprices. Why? Because of a disaster of enormous consequence--no, not as \nsevere as Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, where there was loss of life, \nwhich we mourn along with those who lost loved ones. We absolutely \nrespect that they had, by far, the biggest catastrophe. And this \nlegislation will primarily help them.\n  I am the author of this legislation. I had 27 cosponsors, on a \nbipartisan basis, in the Senate. When it was offered in the \nAppropriations Committee, it passed on a unanimous vote. When there was \nan attempt to take out this assistance on the floor of the Senate, 72 \nSenators said: No, we are not going to take out disaster assistance for \nour Nation's farmers and ranchers. That was the right decision. And, \nyes, this should be national in scope because everyone who is an \nAmerican who suffered a natural disaster deserves some assistance.\n  Not only did farmers and ranchers suffer egregiously in different \nparts of the country from different types of natural disasters, but \nthey were also hit with a second blow, and that was a dramatic runup in \nagricultural energy inputs. Every part of agriculture is dependent on \ninputs that are based on petroleum--whether it is fuel, with the cost \nup $3 billion; fertilizer, with the cost up $1.4 billion; marketing, \nstorage, and transportation, with the cost up $400 million; \nelectricity, with the cost up $200 million--with total energy-related \ncosts up $5 billion in one year in agriculture.\n  That had a devastating effect in my State. I just had a series of \nfarm meetings in which farmers brought to me their operating \nstatements--the difference between last year and this year--and income \nwas cut in half--cut in half--in 1 year because of natural disasters, \nbecause of discounted prices, because of a failure to even be able to \nplant, and, on top of that, because of dramatically escalating energy \nprices.\n  And we have a Secretary of Agriculture who says there is no problem \noutside the Gulf States? Excuse me, Mr. Secretary, where have you been? \nShame on you for providing that kind of false statement to the American \npeople.\n  Here, shown on this chart, are the agricultural groups that endorsed \nthe legislation, the disaster assistance that we passed--22 groups--the \nbroad spectrum of American agriculture saying: Yes, disaster assistance \nis essential.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have this material printed \nin the Record listing the 22 groups.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                   April 25, 2006.\n     Hon. Saxby Chambliss,\n     Chairman, Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry Committee, U.S. \n         Senate, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Thad Cochran,\n     Chairman, Appropriations Committee, U.S. Senate, Washington, \n         DC.\n     Hon. Tom Harkin,\n     Ranking Member, Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry \n         Committee, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Robert C. Byrd,\n     Ranking Member, Appropriations Committee, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Chambliss and Chairman Cochran, Senator \n     Harkin and Senator Byrd: On behalf of the below signed \n     organizations, we are writing to urge you to oppose any \n     efforts to delete the agricultural disaster assistance \n     provisions from the FY06 Emergency Supplemental \n     Appropriations bill when it is considered by the full Senate.\n       Virtually every state in the nation has been impacted by \n     significant weather related and disaster losses. About 80 \n     percent of U.S. counties were declared disaster or contiguous \n     disaster counties last year due to devastating hurricanes, \n     fires, floods, excessive moisture and severe drought. Besides \n     heavy crop and livestock losses and increased production \n     costs associated with rapidly escalating input costs, many \n     producers also face contaminated fields and infrastructure \n     losses that pose serious, long-term challenges to economic \n     recovery.\n       We appreciate recent supplemental assistance offered to \n     help some of the victims of the 2005 hurricane season. \n     Unfortunately, this assistance is not available to all \n     farmers and ranchers who suffered devastating losses due to \n     hurricanes. Furthermore, none of the supplemental assistance \n     is available to producers who suffered significant economic \n     losses to crop and livestock operations as a result of fires, \n     flooding, drought, excessive moisture and the record-high \n     energy costs brought on by natural disasters.\n       Because of the urgent need for disaster assistance and the \n     widespread losses which span the country, we believe the \n     provisions in the supplemental appropriations measure are \n     crafted in a manner that offers producers the combination of \n     supplemental direct assistance and production loss assistance \n     that is both timely and tailored to meet all disaster-related \n     losses. Many producers need assistance within weeks to repay \n     loans and secure new financing in time for spring planting, \n     so prompt action on this measure is vitally important given \n     that traditional production loss assistance can take up to \n     six months.\n       Thank you for your consideration of our views.\n           Sincerely,\n       Agricultural Retailers Association.\n       Alabama Peanut Producers Association.\n       American Beekeeping Federation.\n       American Farm Bureau Federation.\n       American Sheep Industry Association.\n       American Soybean Association.\n       American Sugar Alliance.\n       Farm Credit Council.\n       Florida Peanut Producers Association.\n       Georgia Peanut Commission.\n       Independent Community Bankers of America.\n       National Association of Wheat Growers.\n       National Barley Growers Association.\n       National Corn Growers Association.\n       National Cotton Council.\n       National Council of Farmer Cooperatives.\n       National Farmers Union.\n       National Sorghum Producers.\n       National Sunflower Association.\n       Southern Peanut Farmers Federation.\n       USA Dry Pea and Lentil Council.\n       USA Rice Federation.\n\n[[Page S4033]]\n\n       US Canola Association.\n       US Rice Producers Association.\n       Western Peanut Growers.\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Maybe the Secretary of Agriculture might want to inform \nhimself of what has been said.\n  Finally, I have a letter from the State agriculture commissioners \ntelling us, unanimously, disaster assistance was necessary and needed.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the letter be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                       The National Association of\n\n\n                             State Departments of Agriculture,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 20, 2006.\n     Members of the U.S. Senate.\n       Dear Senator:  I am writing on behalf of the state \n     commissioners, secretaries and directors of agriculture to \n     express our strong support for emergency disaster assistance \n     for farmers and ranchers as agreed to by the Senate \n     Appropriations Committee in H.R. 4939, the FY 2006 Emergency \n     Supplemental Appropriations Act for Defense, the Global War \n     on Terror and Hurricane Recovery (report 109-230) Assistance \n     is necessary to help farmers, ranchers and their communities \n     recoup from financial losses due to-hurricanes, drought, \n     fires, tornadoes, floods, and other natural disasters.\n       Nearly all states have been affected by natural disasters \n     and in turn many farms and ranches across this country have \n     suffered losses and damages. About 80 percent of U.S. \n     counties were declared disaster or contiguous disaster \n     counties in the last year. While there are risk management \n     programs, such as crop insurance, disaster loans, and \n     emergency grazing; the relief needed greatly exceeds the \n     levels these programs can provide. Supplemental assistance is \n     being offered to farmers and ranchers harmed by the 2005 \n     hurricane season, however, not all producers will be able to \n     attain the necessary levels of assistance to return to viable \n     production levels.\n       In addition, the weather-related damages and losses in \n     agriculture have significantly affected specialty crop \n     producers and nursery businesses. States appreciate the \n     provision that also provides grants to states that can be \n     used to provide economic assistance to agricultural \n     producers, and gives priority to the support of specialty \n     crops and livestock. This section demonstrates how the \n     federal government and states can partner with one another in \n     directing assistance to those who need it most.\n       We understand that the Senate will consider this \n     legislation when they return from the Easter Recess NASDA \n     strongly urges your prompt action and support of this \n     emergency assistance. We look forward to working with you and \n     your staff on this issue so important to agriculture.\n           Sincerely,\n                                          J. Carlton Courter, III,\n                                    Commissioner, NASDA President.\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I hope the Secretary of Agriculture gets \nthe message--gets the message--disaster assistance is needed in this \ncountry.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I would like to speak in morning business \nand ask unanimous consent to speak for up to 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/04/senate-section/article/S4033-1", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4033-S4034]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   MEDICAL CARE ACCESS PROTECTION ACT\n\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, yesterday, I introduced the Medical Care \nAccess Protection Act to address our Nation's medical liability crisis.\n  High medical liability insurance premiums are threatening the \nstability of our Nation's health care delivery system. These rates are \nforcing many doctors, hospitals, and other health care providers to \nmove out of high-liability States, limit the scope of their practices, \nand even close their doors permanently.\n  The crisis is affecting more and more patients and is threatening \naccess to reliable quality health care services in many States across \nour country.\n  Because of unaffordable medical liability insurance premiums, it is \nnow common for obstetricians to no longer deliver babies, and for other \nspecialists to no longer provide emergency calls or provide certain \nhigh-risk procedures.\n  Ask yourself this question: What if you were in need of an emergency \nprocedure? What if you were the woman who had a high-risk pregnancy and \ncould not find a specialist to provide you with the care you needed? \nThe medical liability crisis is threatening access to reliable quality \nhealth care services this is happening to patients all over America.\n  Additionally, some emergency departments have been forced to \ntemporarily shut down in recent years. In my home State of Nevada, our \nlevel I trauma center closed for 10 days in 2002. This closure left \nevery patient within a 10,000 square mile area unserved by a level I \ntrauma center.\n  Jim Lawson, unfortunately, was one of those in need of the trauma \nunit at that time. Jim lived in Las Vegas, and was just one month shy \nof his 60th birthday. He had recently returned from visiting his \ndaughter in California. When he returned, he was injured in a severe \ncar accident.\n  Jim should have been taken to University Medical Center's level I \ntrauma center, but it was closed. Instead, Jim was taken to another \nemergency room, where he was to be stabilized and then transferred to \nSalt Lake City's trauma center. Tragically, Jim never made it that far. \nHe died that day due to cardiac arrest caused by blunt force from \nphysical trauma.\n  Why was Nevada's only level I trauma center closed? A simple fact: \nMedical liability premiums could not be afforded by the doctors, and \nthere were not enough doctors to provide care. The State had to \nactually step in and take over the liability to reopen the trauma \ncenter.\n  More than 35 percent of neurosurgeons have altered their emergency or \ntrauma call coverage because of the medical liability crisis. This \nmeans that patients with head injuries or in need of neurosurgical \nservices must be transferred to other facilities, delaying much needed \ncare.\n  An example of this problem was brought to my attention by Dr. Alamo \nof Henderson, Nevada. Dr. Alamo was presented with a teenager suffering \nfrom myasthenia gravis. She was in a crisis and in need of immediate \nmedical treatment. Because of the medical liability situation, there \nwas no emergency neurologist on call to assist this young woman. Dr. \nAlamo called several in the area, and none of them wanted to take her \ncase because of the medical liability situation. So Dr. Alamo had the \nyoung woman transported to California by helicopter to receive the \nmedical care she needed.\n  These kinds of situations should not happen and should not be forced \nto happen because of the medical liability crisis we have in America \ntoday. Stories such as these are becoming all too common across our \ncountry.\n  I recently heard of seven patients who died in Chester County, \nPennsylvania, because they did not have access to neurosurgical care. \nThese patients were transported to neighboring counties instead of \nbeing treated locally where there was no available neurosurgeon. Some \nof these patients died during transport, and others died while on the \noperating table. This is unacceptable.\n  Women's health care is also in serious jeopardy. In Pennsylvania, the \nlegal climate caused nine maternity wards to close over the past \nseveral years. And hundreds of OB/GYNs have left the State, retired, or \nlimited their services. This story is being repeated all over America.\n  The bottom line is that patients cannot get the health care they need \nwhen they need it most. By definition, I believe this is a medical \ncrisis. This crisis is affecting more and more patients, and it is \nthreatening access to care.\n  To address the growing medical liability crisis in my State of \nNevada, legislation was enacted that includes a cap on noneconomic \ndamages and a cap on total damages for trauma care.\n  In order to control health care costs and make health care more \nreadily available, we must extend similar protections to other States.\n  Our entire Nation needs serious medical liability reform now.\n  Without Federal legislation, the exodus of these providers from the \npractice of medicine will continue, and patients will find it \nincreasingly difficult to obtain needed care. This is not a Republican \nor Democratic issue; this is a patient issue. Simply put, patients \ncannot find access to care when they need it most in many areas.\n  I introduced the Medical Care Access Protection Act to address the \nnational crisis our doctors, hospitals, and those needing health care \nface today. My legislation is a comprehensive medical liability reform \nmeasure. The bill sets reasonable limits on noneconomic damages, while \nalso providing for unlimited economic damages.\n  The Medical Care Access Protection Act is a responsible reform \nmeasure that includes joint liability and collateral source \nimprovements, and limits\n\n[[Page S4034]]\n\non attorney fees according to a sliding award scale.\n  My legislation also includes an expert witness provision to ensure \nthat relevant medical experts serve as trial witnesses instead of so-\ncalled ``professional witnesses'' who are used to further abuse the \nsystem and further drive up medical costs.\n  My bill also preserves States' rights by keeping the State medical \nliability statutes in place and by allowing States that enact medical \nliability reform bills in the future to supersede the Federal limits on \ndamages.\n  The Medical Care Access Protection Act uses the Texas style of caps \non noneconomic damages which has brought real reform to the Texas \nliability system. This provides a cap of $250,000 for a judgment \nagainst a physician or a health care professional. In addition, the \npatient can be awarded up to $250,000 for a judgment against one health \ncare institution. Judgments against two or more health care \ninstitutions cannot exceed $500,000, with each institution liable for \nnot more than $250,000. Thus the noneconomic damages can total \n$750,000.\n  The Texas style of caps on noneconomic damages is working. Patients \nare experiencing better access to health care, and Texas communities \nare finding it easier to recruit new doctors. At least 3,000 new \ndoctors have established practices in Texas since the law's passage in \n2003. Many of these doctors are serving in medically underserved areas \nof the State. Some counties, such as Cameron County along the Texas-\nMexico border, are experiencing unprecedented success in physician \nrecruitment--the opposite of what is happening in Pennsylvania.\n  The number of medical specialists in Texas is also growing. Patients \nhave access to more specialists and emergency room physicians. Since \n2003, Texas has gained a total of 93 orthopedic surgeons and more than \n80 OB/GYNs.\n  Insurance costs have decreased significantly for doctors and \nhospitals. Medical liability rates, which had been out of control, have \nbeen going down. Physicians' insurance rates had risen by as much as 54 \npercent in the last few years. But with medical liability reform, \nphysicians in Texas have seen their rates drop by a significant amount. \nMore than 4,000 Texas physicians have opened new professional liability \npolicies. Some of these doctors are new to the State.\n  The medical liability structure in Texas is working. These types of \noutcomes should be shared by every State and ultimately every patient \nin America. The American Medical Association has removed Texas from its \nlist of States experiencing a medical liability crisis. It should be \nour goal that every State in America be removed from the crisis list.\n  Let's put an end to this crisis once and for all. Let's enact \nmeaningful medical liability reform today.\n  The Medical Care Access Protection Act is not a battle of right \nversus left; it is a battle of right versus wrong. This bill is the \nright prescription for patients. We need to secure patient access to \nquality health care services when they need it most.\n  Let's make sure expectant mothers have access to OB/GYNs and trauma \ncare victims have access to necessary services in their hour of most \ncritical need. And let's make sure we continue to provide patients with \nthe opportunity to receive affordable, accessible, and available health \ncare for years to come.\n  The Medical Care Access Protection Act is substantially different \nfrom legislation we have brought to the Senate floor in previous years, \nand it warrants serious consideration.\n  We are going to have a vote on whether to even debate this bill next \nweek. The American people need to contact their Senators. They need to \nsay: Let's bring the bill to the floor and have an open and honest \ndebate on this measure. Are you going to stand with the trial lawyers, \nor are you going to stand with the patients in America? That is the \nquestion we have to ask ourselves. It is time for us to stand with the \npatients. If the people of America want change, they will have to \ncontact their legislators. This has to be a grassroots effort that \nrises up from across the country.\n  I believe the time for action is now. As we consider this bill, I \nhope Senators will put aside partisan differences and political \nalliances and will put the patients of America first.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Vitter). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I endorse the nomination of Brian Mark \nCogan for the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York. \nMr. Cogan graduated from the University of Illinois in 1976, and \nreceived a law degree from Cornell in 1979. He is admitted to the bar \nin both New York and Florida. From 1979 to 1980, he was a law clerk for \nJudge Aronovitz in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of \nFlorida, and he was an associate and later a partner and general \ncounsel for the law firm of Stroock & Stroock & Lavan.\n  Mr. Cogan possesses the qualifications to be an outstanding Federal \njudge. He had a hearing before the Judiciary Committee, which I chair, \nand we voted him out unanimously.\n  Based on his record, I urge my colleagues to support his confirmation \ntoday.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, this afternoon the Senate will confirm two \nmore lifetime appointments to the Federal judiciary, Thomas Golden of \nPennsylvania and Brian Cogan of New York. These confirmations will \nbring the total number of Senate-confirmed judicial appointments since \nJanuary 2001 to 240, including the confirmations of two Supreme Court \nJustices and 43 circuit court judges.\n  Democrats in the Senate have been cooperative in considering and \nconfirming consensus nominees. In fact, 100 judges were confirmed \nduring the 17 months when there was a Democratic majority in the Senate \ncompared to only 140 judges in the other 45 months under Republican \ncontrol.\n  This morning, the Senate Judiciary Committee reported out another \nfive judicial nominees unanimously. When they are considered and \nconfirmed by the Senate, we will not only reach 245 judicial \nconfirmations, but we will equal the number of judicial nominations \nconsidered in the entire session in the election year of 1996 when a \nRepublican Senate controlled consideration of President Clinton's \nnominations. In session not a single nomination to the court of appeals \nwas considered, not one. Of course this year we have already joined in \nconfirming Judge Michael Chagares to the Third Circuit and I expect \nDemocratic Senators to join in confirming the nomination of Milan Smith \nto the Ninth Circuit when that nomination is scheduled by the majority \nleader.\n  Unfortunately, the Senate Republican leadership is again bent on \nseeking to use nominations to score partisan points. Our job is to \nfulfill our duty under the Constitution for the American people so that \nwe can assure them that the judges confirmed to lifetime appointments \nto the highest courts in this country are fair to those who enter their \ncourtrooms and to the law, rather than to advance a partisan agenda. \nRegrettably, this is not the first time the Republican leadership in\n\n[[Page S4035]]\n\nthe Senate has chosen to pursue a partisan agenda using judicial \nnominees. Sadly, published reports during the last couple of weeks \nindicate that the Senate Republican leadership is, instead, preparing \nto cater to the extreme rightwing faction that is agitating for fights \nover judicial nominations. We will see that when they insist on \nconfrontation over such controversial nominations as Judge Terrence \nBoyle, Norman Randy Smith or Brett Kavanaugh. Despite Democratic \ncooperation in the confirmation of scores of nominees and the \nundeniable fact that we have treated this President's nominees more \nfairly than Republicans treated those of President Clinton, they seem \nintent on using controversial judicial nominations to stir up their \npartisan political base.\n  Rather than address the priorities of Americans by focusing on \nproposals to end the subsidies to big oil and rein in gas prices, \nrather than devote our time to passing comprehensive immigration reform \nlegislation, rather than completing a budget, the Republican leader \ncame to the floor last week to signal a fight over controversial \njudicial nominations. One of the nominations that the Republicans want \nto rubberstamp is that of Judge Terrence Boyle to the U.S. Court of \nAppeals for the Fourth Circuit. We have learned from recent news \nreports that, as a sitting U.S. district judge and while a circuit \ncourt nominee, Judge Boyle ruled on multiple cases involving \ncorporations in which he held investments. In at least one instance, he \nis alleged to have bought General Electric stock while presiding over a \nlawsuit in which General Electric was accused of illegally denying \ndisability benefits to a long-time employee. Two months later, he ruled \nin favor of GE and denied the employee's claim for long-term and \npension disability benefits. Whether or not it turns out that Judge \nBoyle broke Federal law or canons of judicial ethics, these types of \nconflicts of interest have no place on the Federal bench. Certainly, \nthey should not be rewarded with a promotion. They should be \ninvestigated.\n  The Republican leadership would rather have the Senate be a \nrubberstamp for rewarding this administration's cronies with lifetime \nappointments to high Federal courts. They have tried before. If the \nWhite House had its way, we would already have confirmed Claude Allen \nto the Fourth Circuit. He is the former Bush administration official \nwho recently resigned his position as a top domestic policy adviser to \nthe President. Last month we learned why he resigned when he was \narrested for fraudulent conduct over an extended period of time. Had \nDemocrats not objected to the White House attempt to shift a circuit \njudgeship from Maryland to Virginia, someone now the subject of a \ncriminal prosecution for the equivalent of stealing from retail stores \nwould be a sitting judge on the Fourth Circuit confirmed with a \nRepublican rubberstamp.\n  A look at the Federal judiciary in Pennsylvania demonstrates yet \nagain that President Bush's nominees have been treated far better than \nPresident Clinton's and shows dramatically how Democrats have worked in \na bipartisan way to fill vacancies, despite the fact that Republicans \nblocked more than 60 of President Clinton's judicial nominees. With \ntoday's confirmation of Thomas Golden to be a district court judge in \nPennsylvania, 21 of President Bush's nominees to the Federal courts in \nPennsylvania will have been confirmed, more than for any other State \nexcept California.\n  With this confirmation, President Bush's nominees will make up 21 of \nthe 43 active Federal circuit and district court judges for \nPennsylvania--that is more than 49 percent of the Pennsylvania Federal \nbench. On the Pennsylvania district courts alone, President Bush's will \nnow sit in 18 of the 36 judgeships.\n  This is in sharp contrast to the way vacancies in Pennsylvania were \nleft unfilled during Republican control of the Senate when President \nClinton was in the White House. Republicans denied votes to nine \ndistrict and one circuit court nominees of President Clinton in \nPennsylvania alone. Despite the efforts and diligence of the senior \nSenator from Pennsylvania, Senator Specter, to secure the confirmation \nof all of the judicial nominees from every part of his home State, \nthere were 10 nominees by President Clinton to Pennsylvania vacancies \nwho never got a vote. Despite records that showed these to be well-\nqualified nominees, these nominations were blocked from Senate \nconsideration.\n  So while I congratulate Thomas Golden and his family on his \nconfirmation, I remember those who were not treated so fairly by Senate \nRepublicans.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is, Will the Senate advise and \nconsent to the nomination of Brian M. Cogan, of New York, to be United \nStates District Judge for the Eastern District of New York?\n  On this question, the yeas and nays have been ordered, and the clerk \nwill call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

GOLDEN TO BE U.S. DISTRICT JUDGE FOR THE \n                    EASTERN DISTRICT OF PENNSYLVANIA\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the next nomination.\n  The legislative clerk read the nomination of Thomas M. Golden, of \nPennsylvania, to be United States District Judge for the Eastern \nDistrict of Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to recommend to \nmy colleagues the confirmation of Thomas M. Golden to the U.S. District \nCourt for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. Golden graduated from Penn State University in 1969, and received \na law degree from Dickinson School of Law in 1972. Thereafter, he has \nbeen in the practice of law with Stevens & Lee, first as an associate \nand then as a partner. And from 1979 to the present, he has owned his \nown firm, Golden Masano Bradley and serves as managing partner in that \ncapacity.\n  Mr. Golden enjoys an excellent reputation for academic achievement, \nfor lawyerly skills, for integrity, and for community service. Alvernia \nCollege awarded Mr. Golden a doctorate of human letters for service to \nthe community and legal profession in 2003. He is past president of the \nPennsylvania Bar Association and the Berks County Bar Association.\n  Holding those positions is demonstrative of active community service, \ntaking on responsibilities to promote the public welfare beyond his \nwork as a private practicing attorney.\n\n[[Page S4036]]\n\n  The American Bar Association gave Mr. Golden a unanimous ``well-\nqualified'' rating. In my years on the Judiciary Committee and now as \nchairman of the committee, I have seen many nominees, and I believe Tom \nGolden has outstanding potential for the Federal district court. I urge \nmy colleagues to support him.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, it is a pleasure for me to come to the \nfloor of the Senate to give good words of encouragement to my \ncolleagues to support Tom Golden for the Eastern District of \nPennsylvania judgeship. This is a vacancy that the Office of \nAdministration at the U.S. Courts has determined is a judicial \nemergency, so it is high time that we get this vacancy filled. Tom \nGolden has proven to be just the right medicine for us to be able to \nmove this process very quickly in the Senate.\n  On April 27 he was moved out of committee by a voice vote, so I \nguess, from all reports at least, unanimously. Certainly there were no \nvocal objections. He now comes to the floor for confirmation. I \ncongratulate him in anticipation of a strong positive vote today on his \nsuccessfully negotiated, what can be tough shoals in the Senate when it \ncomes to judicial nomination.\n  The record speaks for itself. This is a man of great legal ability, \nas well as someone who is a fine member of his community and citizen of \nthis country. He started out with great potential. He graduated from \nPenn State University, which happens to be my alma mater, and also \ngraduated from the Dickinson School of Law, which happens to be my alma \nmater. He has a fine background and education, and he has come forward \nfrom that education to work at a law firm in Reading, PA. He is from \nBerks County. Berks County is one of the larger counties in our State. \nIt has not had a judge there for some time, even though there is a \ncourthouse in Reading. We are quite excited. Folks in the Eastern \nDistrict are rather exited about the opportunity of having their cases \nheard and their filings be filed before judges and motions be heard in \nReading as opposed to having to travel all the way to Philadelphia to \nhave their cases proceed.\n  This is not just a good moment for Tom Golden, but it is a good \nmoment for all of the litigants in the western part of the Eastern \nDistrict, to be able to have their cases heard in a much more \nconvenient fashion.\n  Aside from a variety of involvements in charitable organizations and \nspecific organizations, I want to mention the fact that Tom was very \nactive in the bar association. In fact, not only is he in the House of \nDelegates at the ABA, and has been since 2002, he was the president of \nthe Pennsylvania Bar Association from 2003 to 2004 and served, as you \ncan imagine, often as chair leading up to his election to the \npresidency in 2006. He has been active in the Berks County Bar \nAssociation and a whole lot of other legal areas.\n  He was rated ``well-qualified,'' not surprisingly, by the bar \nassociation. He is coming here with the highest recommendations from \nthe legal community, as well as the community at large in Berks County.\n  It is a pleasure to come here with a noncontroversial nomination, \nsomeone who has the highest character, as well as great legal ability, \nand someone who, I am confident, will do a fine new job as judge on the \nEastern District of Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is, Will the Senate advise and consent to the nomination \nof Thomas M. Golden, of Pennsylvania, to be U.S. District Judge for the \nEastern District of Pennsylvania. On this question, the yeas and nays \nhave been ordered, and the clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. The following Senators were necessarily absent: the \nSenator from Kentucky (Mr. Bunning) and the Senator from Utah (Mr. \nHatch).\n  Further, if present and voting, the Senator from Kentucky (Mr. \nBunning) would have voted ``yea.''\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from California (Mrs. Boxer) \nand the Senator from West Virginia (Mr. Rockefeller) are necessarily \nabsent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, next week this Senate is going to consider \none of the most important issues that we will consider as a Congress \nand as a nation, and that issue is health care. All of us know that the \ncost of health care, the cost of health insurance, and, in many cases, \naccess to doctors around the country is becoming a serious problem. \nMany are uninsured. It is an issue we talk about a lot in the Senate, \nbut it is an issue we haven't done a lot about.\n  This is like some other issues, I am afraid, where our tongue doesn't \nexactly match our action. We heard a lot of talk on the Senate floor \nabout jobs and jobs going overseas, but when the proposals come up to \nmake America the best place in the world to do business, to lower the \ncost of doing business in this country, to continue investment tax \ncredits, to put some caps on frivolous lawsuits, to reduce the costly \nand unnecessary regulations, and even to do things that make energy \nless expensive so we can manufacture in this country, I am afraid my \ncolleagues, particularly my Democratic colleagues, block those actions \nand, again, unfortunately, pit business against people and profits \nagainst jobs. What we know and most Americans know is that people have \njobs with businesses, and businesses that don't have profits don't \ncreate jobs.\n  Our rhetoric needs to match our action. We need to stop blocking \nlegislation that needs to be done and blaming other folks when it \ndoesn't get done.\n  We have seen the same thing happen with energy, unfortunately. For \nthe\n\n[[Page S4037]]\n\nlast several decades, my Democratic colleagues have blocked the \ndevelopment of America's energy supplies, blocked our own energy \nindependence, even back in the seventies, when President Carter stopped \nthe development of nuclear power generation and our European allies \nmoved on to where now 80 percent of their electricity comes from clean \nand efficient nuclear power. Even the founder of Greenpeace has come \nback and said it was a mistake to stop that. Yet today we make \nelectricity with natural gas, which is increasing the demand for \nnatural gas and has raised the prices so that many of our manufacturers \ncan no longer compete because of the high cost of energy in this \ncountry. And the price keeps going up.\n  We have seen the same thing happen with oil and gas where for years \nwe blocked the development of our own energy supplies, our own oil \nsupplies, and now we are down here trying to blame the President and \nothers for the high cost of gasoline.\n  If we track what happens on many of the votes--I know I have heard on \nthis floor that the oil reserves in Alaska wouldn't make that big a \ndifference. But we know that only a 2- or 3-percent increase in our \nsupply at this time would dramatically reduce the cost of gasoline. Yet \non all of these dates over the years, going back to 1991, consistently \nour Democratic colleagues have voted to block the development of oil \nreserves in ANWR, and we see the price of gasoline going up consistent \nwith those votes.\n  I have heard on this floor for a number of years that the 5-percent \nadditional supply that would be provided by ANWR would make no \ndifference in the cost of gasoline. Yet we saw during Katrina, when we \nlost 5 percent of our supply, what it did to the cost of gasoline and \nwhat it is doing today.\n  We can't continue to block what needs to be done and then blame other \npeople when we have problems because it doesn't get done.\n  Today I wish to talk particularly about health care because we have \ngotten word from our Democratic colleagues that they are going to block \nseveral important provisions that we are going to try to get on the \nfloor for debate next week.\n  One of those is medical malpractice. A very important component in \nthe cost of health care is the fact that we are suing doctors out of \nbusiness. We have 20 States now that are considered in crisis because \nof medical liability. We have another 24 that show warning signs, which \nmeans the loss of doctors, the loss of access to care, and less \ninsurance available. South Carolina is in that group.\n  Let me share some statistics that should get folks' attention: 59 \npercent of physicians believe that the fear of liability discourages \ndiscussion and thinking about ways to reduce health care costs. The \ncosts of defensive medicine are estimated to be between $70 billion and \n$126 billion a year. I think I need to say that again. The cost of \ndefensive medicine is up to $126 billion a year to try to cover doctors \nfrom liability because of unlimited lawsuits against doctors. Blue \nCross, a major insurer, when surveyed said it is already a serious \nproblem as far as adding to the cost of health insurance premiums.\n  There are many things we can do to fix that, but folks need to \nunderstand the real costs because I know my Democratic colleagues will \nsay that it is not a factor.\n  The only people getting rich from medical malpractice are the \npersonal injury lawyers. Keep these things in mind during our debate \nnext week: More than 70 percent of the claims against doctors or \nhospitals are dropped or dismissed before they reach a verdict, but \neven if they are dismissed, the claims costs are $18,000 in legal \nexpenses. In 2004, medical liability costs that were settled--when \ncases are settled--the legal costs were $60,000. In the cases where \nthey actually went to trial but the doctor or hospital won, the average \ncost jumped to $94,000.\n\n  The Wall Street Journal points out a number of facts like these, but \none of them should really hit home. They were using Texas as an example \nbecause Texas has made some reforms that we will be considering for our \ncountry that have made a big difference.\n  Hospital premiums to protect against lawsuits more than doubled in \nTexas between 2000 and 2003. But I think probably the most \ndisheartening statistic I have seen is that between 1999 and 2002, the \nannual per-bed cost for litigation protection for nursing homes went \nfrom $250 to $5,000. That is what nursing homes have to pay just for \nliability coverage for malpractice lawsuits. That is at a time when we \nhave a new and large wave of retirees whom we need help when it comes \nto nursing homes. Yet we are suing them out of their hospital beds.\n  We know we can fix this. Part of the problem, I am afraid, is right \nhere in Congress. As I said before, the only people really getting rich \nfrom the system we have now are personal injury lawyers. One statistic \nto remember is between 2003 and 2004, personal injury lawyers gave $102 \nmillion to House and Senate candidates. They got a good payback. In \nfact, it was a 10,000-percent rate of return because during that same \nperiod, over $18 billion in malpractice awards were given during 1 \nyear--over $18 billion. We cannot continue to allow this to be a part \nof our health care system and then come down here and complain about \nthe cost of health care.\n  We know that many doctors are leaving rural areas and no longer \ndelivering babies. This is a fact. This is not political rhetoric. We \nknow that in many places around the country, if someone is injured \nbadly with a head injury in a car accident and they go to an emergency \nroom, there are no neurologists there because they won't take calls \nbecause they are likely to get paid very little from Medicaid or \nanother insurance company, but they could lose millions of dollars \nbecause of lawsuits.\n  There are some commonsense things we can do, and we have seen this \nhappen in Texas with their reforms that we will be looking at next \nweek. I implore my colleagues to consider what Texas did, and before we \nget into all the misrepresentations, the malpractice bills we are going \nto talk about next week do not put any limits on economic damages and \nallow up to $750,000 for pain and suffering. So a person who is injured \ncould get their salary for life, all their health care paid for, and up \nto $750,000 additional money for pain and suffering in Texas. What that \nhas done in just 1 year is cut their lawsuits in half. The cost of \nliability insurance has been reduced almost 20 percent in just a short \nperiod of time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 2 more \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. LEAHY. I won't object assuming there will be 2 additional minutes \non this side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Time is equally divided.\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I will conclude again with the hope and \nthe request that we can debate this honestly. Certainly we do not want \npatients being hurt and not being compensated, but we also don't want \nmany more patients not finding a doctor, not being able to afford their \nhealth care or to get health insurance. These are things we can fix if \nwe work together.\n  If you notice on my chart, I don't accuse this of being Republican or \nDemocrat. It is just an issue we need to address. We need to do \nsomething commonsense with medical malpractice. Please, let us put the \nbill on the floor next week for debate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, is the Senator from Massachusetts seeking \nrecognition for a unanimous consent request?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I am. I was going to make comments for 2 or 3 minutes \nand then make a consent request.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I was going to proceed for about 5 minutes, but if the \nSenator from Massachusetts wishes to go first, that is fine.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I will wait.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/04/senate-section/article/S4037-1", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4037-S4039]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          MEDICAL MALPRACTICE\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, it is interesting to hear the statistics \nbeing tossed around. I am sure the distinguished Senator did not mean \nby his chart to suggest somehow bribes have been offered to people in \nhow they vote.\n\n[[Page S4038]]\n\n  Mr. President, we have States without caps on medical malpractice \nrecoveries. They have 14 percent more practicing physicians than those \nwith caps. We hear about the increasingly burdensome medical \nmalpractice premiums and, indeed, they are. Health care providers pay \nonerous amounts to be insured. That is why I have introduced a bill \ndirected specifically toward medical malpractice insurance reform \nbecause, after all, there is no correlation between malpractice claims \nand rising insurance premiums. Between 2000 and 2004, insurers \nincreased premiums 134 percent, even though payments remained flat.\n  They say this legislation drastically reduces insurance rates. Of \ncourse, the American Insurance Association has said we have not \npromised price reductions for tort reform. They have been quoted as \nsaying: We wouldn't tell you or anyone the reason to pass tort reform \nwould be to reduce insurance rates. In fact, a majority of States that \nhave enacted caps have seen no reductions. In fact, on average, doctors \nin States with caps pay more for insurance than they do in States \nwithout caps.\n  The fact is, there is one place that makes money. Claims go down and \ninsurance premiums go up. It is like the rising gas prices and the \nrecord oil company profits. Maybe we ought to be asking medical \nmalpractice insurers exactly why their premiums are so exorbitant? If \nit is not because they are paying an increasing amount of claims. They \nare not doing that. Rates are going up much faster than any claims. It \ncould be a soft stock market, bad investments, or greed. That is what \nwe ought to ask about. In my State, without caps, we increased the \nnumber of doctors. So don't use this argument that somehow in rural \nareas, in rural States, we are going to lose doctors. We are gaining \ndoctors. We should ask the insurance companies why their rates go up, \neven though the payments are flat.\n\n  We should also remember that America's courts belong to the American \npeople, not to the special interests of the insurance companies. These \nbills are bad public policy. They are ill-timed.\n  We ought to be debating the priorities of the American people, not \ndebating ways to make greater profits for the insurance companies. We \nought to talk about energy policy and skyrocketing gas prices. Wouldn't \nit be good to have a real debate on the fiasco in Iraq today, a real \ndebate about what has gone wrong in the war in Iraq? That could take a \ncouple of months just to list them. A lot has gone wrong since the \nPresident announced: ``Mission Accomplished.''\n  We ought to be talking about the comprehensive immigration bill or \nstem cell research. What about the horrific genocide in Darfur?\n  So I am disappointed that the majority leader has decided instead \nthat the Senate's and the public's valuable time should be taken up \nwith these bills. I am also disappointed that he has decided to bypass \nany consideration of these bills. Instead, the insurance companies, and \nprobably some of the large medical companies, have a special interest \nbill that benefits the insurance companies at the expense of patients \nwith legitimate injuries coming straight to the floor.\n  These are real people. I will give you one example in my own State of \nVermont. On April 7, 2000, Diana Levine had a severe migraine headache. \nShe went to a health center. Ms. Levine was a musician. She received a \npainkiller, along with an injection of another sedative. That caused \ncomplications and she had two amputation surgeries of her left arm. A \nmusician. She sued the corporate giant, Wyeth, for improper guidelines \non the sedative because it didn't warn about these dangerous \ncombinations. They knew about it, but they didn't warn anybody. She \nsaid:\n\n       I never expected to sue anyone in my life. . . . Sometimes \n     it takes something like this to make it known when a drug is \n     not being used right.\n\n  After a full trial, knowing that her career as a musician was gone, \nthe jury said she deserved $2.4 million for past and future medical \nexpenses and, of course, $5 million for the daily pain she is \nsuffering. Most of that would have been cut out under this bill. That \nmakes me think this bill is political and doesn't go to the root cause \nof medical malpractice.\n  Let's not forget that medical errors happen to 100,000 people each \nyear. One out of over 100 hospitalized patients suffers negligent care. \nJust turn on the news every night and we hear about it. More people die \nas a result of medical errors than automobile and workplace accidents \ncombined. More die from that than automobile accidents and workplace \naccidents combined, but only 3 percent of them even file a claim. These \nstatistics tell us there is not so much a malpractice lawsuit problem \nas a medical safety problem.\n  I fail to see how arbitrarily limiting the rights of citizens \naddresses this serious problem, particularly because in many cases the \njudicial system is the only forum in which such an error is brought to \nlight. Rather than looking for ways to limit our citizens' access to \njustice, we should look for ways in which we can encourage the medical \ncommunity to strive for the highest standards in the delivery of its \nservices. It is in our interest as citizens, and it is certainly in the \ninterest of all the dedicated and caring people in the medical \nprofession whose oath commands them to do no harm. My wife Marcelle \ndedicated her career to the care of others through nursing, and I know \nhow seriously those in the medical profession take their solemn \nresponsibilities. The best place for positive change to occur is from \nwithin the medical profession, not from within our courtrooms.\n  The bills on the floor today favor the interests of insurance \ncompanies over patients, the interests of profit over sound health \ncare, and they provide illusory promises of lower insurance rates for \ndoctors, while addressing none of the underlying causes of medical \nmalpractice. This is not the fix that is needed.\n\n  We hear numerous complaints from politicians about the harm \nmalpractice lawsuits cause to patient access and the medical \nprofession. We hear claims about doctors practicing defensive medicine \nat the expense of innovation and aggressive treatment. We hear claims \nabout doctors fleeing communities. We hear claims about the reluctance \nof our young people to enter the medical profession. We hear claims \nabout pregnant women who cannot find obstetricians to provide care \nthroughout pregnancy and birth. There might be some merit to this \nlegislation if these claims we routinely hear were true. They are not.\n  The myths associated with medical malpractice lawsuits have virtually \nall been discredited. Two of the primary arguments in favor of capping \nnoneconomic damages are lowering insurance premiums and preventing \ndoctors from leaving their State or their profession. The available \ndata suggests that these arguments are unfounded.\n  In my home State of Vermont, the most recent data show that the \nnumber of physicians practicing in the State has risen steadily from \n1,918 doctors in 1996, to 2,589 doctors in 2004. The number of OB-GYNs \nin Vermont is also higher today than it was in 2000. Today Vermont \nresidents benefit from 113 OB-GYNs, compared with 91 in 2000.\n  This trend exists nationally as well: The number of physicians \nnationally has risen between 1996 and 2004. We also now have more \nphysicians under the age of 35 today than we did in 1996. The number of \ndoctors per capita in this country has been steadily increasing since \n1965. It is hard to understand how these trends can be characterized as \nthe loss of people from the medical profession. There is also no \ncorrelation between a State damages cap and the number of doctors \npracticing in the State. Nationally, States without caps have 14 \npercent more practicing physicians.\n  As we consider the majority leader's bills, I urge other Senators to \nhelp expose the myths associated with the legislation we address today. \nIn fairness to the American people, we should be debating the facts, \nnot the myths. If we acknowledge that the real problem is medical \nmalpractice and the injuries and deaths that result, and not the \nlawsuits that seek to remedy these harms, I know we can go a long way \nto helping the medical profession work from within to assure that \ndoctors meet the highest possible standards and strive to prevent \nmedical errors. After all, those in the medical profession are in the \nbest position to understand what changes must occur, and\n\n[[Page S4039]]\n\nhow best to make sure that needed changes occur. As an example of this \nI want to highlight the efforts of anesthesiologists, who accomplished \na nearly sevenfold reduction in anesthesia-related errors through \ncooperative changes to their systems and practices. Not surprisingly, \nwhen anesthesia-related errors decreased, so did insurance premiums. \nThis should be our model of how to effectively address medical \nmalpractice. If we work together, between needed reforms in the \ninsurance industry, and by supporting medical professionals in \nimproving the critical work they do, I know we can tackle this problem \neffectively.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, first of all, I thank my colleague and \nfriend from Vermont for his excellent statement and comments. I look \nforward to joining with him on the debate of that issue when we have a \nchance on Monday and Tuesday next. I share the disappointment of the \nSenator from Vermont that we will not have an opportunity to address \nthe stem cell issue on the floor of the Senate, which can offer such \nextraordinary hope to so many families in this country.\n  We are in the life science century. We have seen this enormous \nprogress that has been made with the mapping of the human genome, with \nimaging, nanotechnology--breathtaking advances--and stem cell research \noffers a very similar kind of opportunity. We have legislation that is \non the calendar that was approved in a bipartisan way in the House of \nRepresentatives, and it has been on the calendar now for about a year. \nI think most of us were heartened when we heard our majority leader \nindicate his general support--a change in position--his general support \nfor the items which are in the House bill that is on the calendar now \nbefore the Senate. Evidently, though, we will not have an opportunity \nnext week to consider that stem cell bill.\n  When I think of the stem cell legislation, I think of the \npossibilities of hope for families who are facing Alzheimer's disease \nor cancer, Parkinson's disease, diabetes because the possibilities in \nresearch are virtually unlimited. There are no assurances of the \noutcome, no absolute assurance that we are going to come up with cures, \nbut for those who are on the cutting edge of basic and applied research \nin the science area or in the health area believe that this stem cell \nresearch offers enormous possibilities. I wish that had been included \nin the agenda for next week's discussion about health care, but it has \nnot been.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/04/senate-section/article/S4039-1", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4039]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              HATE CRIMES\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I share the disappointment of many that \nthe Republican leadership has delayed calling up the sex offender \nregistration bill. The House passed its version last September and the \nSenate Judiciary Committee reported a much improved version to the full \nSenate last October.\n  When the House passed its bill, it approved an amendment to improve \nthe Federal hate crimes laws as well. The Senate bill does not include \nthat provision, but many of us had hoped to add it as an amendment. I \nurge my colleagues to support it.\n  The inclusion of the Federal hate crimes law is not inconsistent with \nthe goals of the legislation to stop crimes against children. We can \nclearly do more to protect our communities and encourage them to do so. \nHate crimes are a violation of everything our country stands for. These \nare crimes against entire communities, against the whole Nation, and \nagainst the fundamental ideals on which America was founded, and they \nhave a major impact on children. The vast majority of Congress agrees.\n  Last year, Senator Smith and I offered our hate crimes bill as an \namendment to the Defense Authorization Act, and it passed by a \nbipartisan vote of 65 to 33. The House passed a nearly identical hate \ncrimes amendment by a vote of 223 to 199, which made it part of its sex \noffender registration bill. The substantial majority of both Houses of \nCongress have now voted in favor of the hate crimes proposal, and the \ntime is long overdue to pass these protections into law.\n  The hate crimes bill is supported by a broad coalition. Over 200 law \nenforcement and civil rights groups, including the National District \nAttorneys Association, the National Sheriff's Association, and the \nNational Association of Chiefs of Police, the Anti-Defamation League, \nand the U.S. Council of Mayors.\n  A strong Federal role in prosecuting hate crimes is essential for \nboth practical and symbolic reasons. In practical terms, the bill will \nhave a real world impact on the actual criminal investigations and \nprosecution. The symbolic value of the bill is equally important. Hate \ncrimes target whole communities, not just individuals. Attacking people \nbecause they are gay, African American, Arab or Muslim or Jewish, or \nany other criteria is bigotry at its worst. We must say loudly and \nclearly to those inclined to commit them that they will go to prison if \nthey do.\n  The vast majority of us in Congress recognize the importance of \npassing a hate crimes bill. This year we can make the statement even \nclearer by turning it into law.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/04/senate-section/article/S4039-2", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4039]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST--S. 1086\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY.

Mr. President, next week should be a week of looking at \nour health care system and debating on the direction that I think the \npolicy should go in that area. Not only do we have tort reform that has \nbeen suggested by the leader, but also the ability of small business to \nband together across States to lower the cost of insurance, especially \nsmall business owners who have less than 10 employees, and sole \nproprietors, and even individuals, to band together and do something \nabout lowering their costs of insurance.\n  Today, I want to open minds and start setting the framework of what \nthis debate is all about that will occur next week.\n  It is about the unrestrained escalation of jury awards that are \ndriving\n\n[[Page S4040]]\n\nup the cost of many medical procedures. Consequently, many of our best \nand brightest in the medical field are limiting services, retiring \nearly, or move to States where liability premiums are stable in order \nto carry out their Hippocratic Oath. The true victims of this \ndisturbing trend are the vulnerable and sick among us whose access to \nquality care becomes more restricted with each day that this crisis is \nnot addressed. It is time for responsible legislators to do what is \nright for our health care system and the medical community and pass S. \n22, the Medical Care Access Protection Act of 2006 and S. 23, the \nHealthy Mothers and Healthy Babies Act.\n  The consequences of this trend fall hardest on women and children. \nContrary to what the other side may say, the exploding cost of \nliability insurance has limited access to OB/GYNs. It has caused women \nto receive less prenatal and preventive health care, and many low-\nincome women to lose critical access to community clinic services.\n  This is not happening because of a sudden increase in physician \nnegligence. It is happening because of the ever increasing number of \nlawsuits filed against health care providers each day. By and large, \nthese are meritless suits filed by trial lawyers who seek to take \nadvantage of the justice system in order to enrich themselves. I urge \nmembers of the Senate not to fall prey to the influence of these trial \nlawyers, and we know they have it. Every time this issue has come \nbefore this body, the trial lawyer lobby has flexed its muscle to put a \nstop to its progress. If we work together we can come to a plan to \naddress this situation.\n  Who is it that these trial lawyers are opposing? It is not only the \npleas for help from doctors, who overwhelmingly support reform, it's \nalso the will of the American people, who support medical liability \nreform at a rate of 75 percent. And the reason they support it is not \nbecause they think those who have been harmed by a doctor's negligence \nshouldn't be compensated, it's because they know how these trial \nlawyers are hurting them, their families and neighbors. They see the \ncommercials from these so called law firms on late-night television \noffering to sue any doctor over anything and everything possible. Or \nthey or someone they know has had difficulty finding an OB/GYN to \ndeliver a baby.\n  In fact, to give this issue even more of a human face, my daughter \nhad to give up delivering babies because she could no longer afford the \ncrushing burden of inflated insurance costs imposed upon her by these \ntrial lawyers bringing frivolous lawsuit after frivolous lawsuit \nagainst OB/GYNs.\n  Of course, insurance companies--we have heard they make all kinds of \nmoney. I tell you, in my State of Montana I think only a very few \ncompanies offer any kind of medical liability. While the trial lawyers' \nbank accounts have continued to grow, the number of doctors able to \nperform one of the most important acts a doctor can perform has gone \ndown and patients are the ones being hurt.\n  Given the choice between siding with doctors and patients or the \nlegal community, I think I will take the side of the doctors and the \npatients every time.\n  That is not to say if a person has been wronged or harmed by \nnegligence, they shouldn't be able to recover their economic loss. It \nis time for us to step up to the plate and set the policy and finally \ndo something to ease this cost of not only insurance but our total \nhealth care system.\n  Those who would oppose medical liability reform will say there is no \nproblem, there are no frivolous lawsuits, and these reforms only harm \nthose who have been hurt by doctors' negligence. Those assertions are \nsimply false. No two ways about it. Let's look at the facts. On any \ngiven day there are nearly 125,000 lawsuits pending against health care \nproviders, and 75 percent of these will close with no payment.\n  Some would say that is not bad, there is no harm, 75 percent will \nclose with no payment--so what? The cost comes to the medical community \nwhen you have to pay for and provide a defense. Statistics show that of \ncases that do go to trial, 86 percent of the doctors will be found not \nliable. Still, the cost of defending the case is very costly. \nConsequently, the doctors who are targeted by these lawsuits will spend \nan average of $90,000 to defend themselves. That is added into the cost \nof our health care, not only for providers but also into our insurance \npremiums.\n  More striking is the impact these suits have on American access to \nquality medical care. One in seven obstetricians no longer delivers \nbabies due to the fear of being sued; 30 percent to 50 percent of high-\nrisk specialists are sued every year. That is a high number. How would \nyou want to spend all this time in medical school, all this time and \nmoney, and then fall into a category that, once you go into practice, \nyou have a 30- to 50-percent chance of being sued every year while you \nare in practice?\n  Mr. President, 79 percent of physicians practice defensive medicine. \nWhat is that? It is ordering costly and unnecessary tests due to the \nfear of being sued, of not covering all the bases--not only covering \nall the bases but maybe covering them twice. This adds between $83 \nbillion and $151 billion per year in added costs to patients and their \nphysicians.\n  The impact on my State of Montana and other rural States has been \neven more disturbing. Today there are only 104 obstetricians practicing \nin Montana. The population of Montana is 900,000. Over the past decade, \nliability premiums for many hospitals, including many nonprofit \ncritical access hospitals in Montana, have risen nearly 1,000 percent.\n  I am a big proponent of rural health in order to maintain smaller \nhospitals, critical access hospitals, and delivery of health care \nservices closer to the people. I think I have 12 or 13 counties that \nhave no doctors at all--none, zip. That concerns me. People who live in \nthose counties should have access to health care providers. Right now \nthose of us in rural America simply cannot afford this. Right now, in \nMontana, we are very thin in those low populated counties that are \nremote from a bigger city that may have a larger medical corridor. As a \nresult, many in my State travel hundreds of miles to see a doctor, \nsometimes all the way to cities such as Seattle and Minneapolis, Salt \nLake City, or Denver, CO, for specialized care. I fear this situation \nwill only worsen if we do not act now.\n  We can't continue to sit back and allow this to go on, and allow this \nsituation to damage our health care system. Our doctors cannot afford \nit and, more importantly, our loved ones who rely on access to \naffordable health care cannot afford it, either.\n  I urge my colleagues to pass both of these bills, S. 22 and S. 23. \nThese bills bring a fair and reasonable reform to medical liability \nsystems, the system that will work. In fact, the model we are sort of \npatterning this one after is working in Texas. Since the enactment of \nsimilar laws in the State of Texas, the largest liability carrier has \ndropped its premium by 22 percent, competition in the health care \nliability market is increasing, premiums are stable or down, and access \nto health care is up. I think that is what we want to see happen.\n  Clearly this approach is working to the benefit of doctors and \npatients and, more importantly, I want to put the emphasis on patients. \nThe only people hurt by these commonsense reforms are the folks who \nmake a living in frivolous lawsuits. So I call upon this body to reject \ntheir money, their influence, and do what is right for the American \npeople, especially young mothers, and for healthy babies.\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chafee). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, some in this institution suggest that there \nis no liability crisis in health care in America. I am here today to \nsay that I don't think anyone in America believes that. They may \nbelieve it in this institution. As a Senator from North Carolina, I can \nstate no one from North Carolina believes it.\n\n[[Page S4041]]\n\n  Not only has the out-of-control litigation in health care over the \nlast decade inflated the cost for every American, it has now begun to \naffect the access we have to health care services.\n  Doctors across the State in North Carolina report they have been \nforced to reduce the coverage of critical medical services, especially \nin obstetrics, neurosurgery, orthopedics, plastic surgery, and primary \ncare because of the sharp increase in the cost of medical malpractice \ninsurance coverage. It has gotten so high they cannot afford the \ncoverage.\n  Hospitals are concerned about the potential reduction in their \nservices to their communities in the future as a result of the current \ncrisis in medical liability insurance where premium increases and \ndeclining reimbursements continue. Hospitals report that the insurance \ncrisis is making it increasingly more difficult for their medical staff \nto obtain adequate insurance coverage, and more importantly, at \naffordable prices.\n  The crisis is real. We can no longer in this institution act like an \nostrich, put our head in a hole in the ground, and believe because we \ncannot see it, it does not exist.\n  Some nursing homes in North Carolina this year have no choice but to \noperate without liability insurance in order to stay open. The oldest \nand the frail in this country would not have the facilities to live in \nbut for the brave decision of some owners that forego the insurance \nthey can't afford.\n  Other long-term care facilities, faced with the huge increase in \npremiums, have been forced to reduce staff hours, freeze wages and \nreduce residents' activities. Those are things we do not want to see \nhappen to that population.\n  North Carolina faces a medical liability insurance crisis. I had a \nfriend who graduated from Wake Forest with me and was lucky enough to \ngo to medical school. Today he is a nephrologist. I don't even know \nwhat a nephrologist is. I am not sure that too many people in America \nknow what a nephrologist is. But I can tell you that he tells me \nnephrologists rarely get sued. In the last 3 years, his liability \ninsurance has increased 300 percent. He has had a 300-percent increase \nin his cost to continue to practice medicine in a specialty that rarely \nsees lawsuits.\n  North Carolina hospitals have experienced medical liability insurance \npremiums increasing from 400 to 500 percent for the past 3 years, with \nsmall rural hospitals experiencing the greatest increases.\n  According to two recent studies, North Carolina's nursing homes are \nexperiencing a tremendous increase in their medical liability premiums. \nPremiums for some nursing homes in North Carolina have skyrocketed by \nas much as 1,800 percent since 1995. But some in this institution \nsuggest there is not a liability crisis in health care in America.\n  The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has concluded that \nthe leading cause of the national liability insurance crisis is the \nrecent explosion in multimillion dollar litigation awards and the \nresulting instability this creates in the medical liability insurance \nmarket.\n  The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services cited that North \nCarolina is tied with Nevada for the most mega malpractice awards in \nrecent years. But some in this institution suggest that there is not a \nmedical liability crisis in America.\n  Not only is it a crisis, health care services are out of the realm of \nthe average American. It is driving doctors out of the profession of \ndelivering medical services. In medical schools across the country this \nyear, just as last year and the year before, many students will make a \ndecision as to the specialties they choose for their entire medical \nprofession based upon the likelihood of being sued in a court versus \nwhere their interests and their love might exist in health care. But \nsome suggest there is not a liability crisis in America.\n  In North Carolina today we have a shortage of OB/GYNs, we have a \nshortage of neurosurgeons, we have a shortage of thoracic surgeons. \nWhen you look at the demographic shift that is happening in America, \nthe Census Bureau projects that in North Carolina alone we will have a \n53-percent increase in the State's population over the next 20 years. \nWe will be the seventh most populated State. The OB/GYNs better move \nthere because without OB/GYNs we are not going to deliver new babies. \nIf they move there for retirement, which is probably our largest growth \narea, they may find out that they are moving to a State that has a \ntremendous health care infrastructure but the state does not have the \nspecialists in neurology, in neurosurgery, and thoracic surgery \navailable for their age group, and then they will have not made the \nwisest decision. But some suggest there is no crisis.\n  Lawsuits today are the leading cause of liability insurance \nincreases. Changes are needed to protect patient access to health care. \nStates that have enacted comprehensive common sense liability reforms \nhave experienced much lower increases in medical liability insurance \npremiums compared to States such as North Carolina and Nevada because \nwe have yet to adopt such reforms.\n  It is imperative this institution accept the national responsibility \nto end this crisis in health care, to make sure that the next students \nin our medical schools make decisions based upon where they want to \npractice and who, in fact, they want to help and not based upon where \ntheir fear exists of where the trial bar is most likely to target for \nthe next lawsuit.\n\n  Over the years, I have heard from a lot of folks in North Carolina. I \nreceived this letter from a doctor in Greensboro, NC, in the month of \nApril. It says:\n\n       As an orthopaedic trauma surgeon, I urge you to pass \n     medical liability reform this year. Each year, reform \n     legislation passes the House of Representatives, but stalls \n     in the Senate. Special interests are standing in the way of \n     reform.\n\n  I can say that special interests are not the patients across this \ncountry, it is not the patient who is looking for the specialist in \nNorth Carolina.\n  The letter goes on to say:\n\n       I can tell you from the point of view of someone on the \n     front line of medicine that America's (and North Carolina's) \n     medical liability crisis has to be solved. Medical lawsuit \n     abuse and unpredictable and huge verdicts are forcing good \n     doctors out of practice. Fewer young doctors are entering \n     important, but high risk specialties, including orthopedics, \n     obstetrics, and emergency medicine. Others are cutting back \n     on critical, but risky procedures, leaving patients to wonder \n     where they will get care when they most need it.\n\n  The cost of defensive medicine alone is staggering. I see it all the \ntime: doctors ordering tests and referring patients to specialists more \nout of fear of lawsuits than because doctors believe the tests or extra \nvisits are medically indicated. These costs are dragging down our \nhealth care system and our economy, and they ultimately increase out-\nof-pocket patient costs. It is time we fix this broken system.\n  I am not sure that anyone summed up the crisis in America in a one-\npage letter better than this doctor, this doctor who said that he is on \nthe front line of medicine in America and in North Carolina. He put his \nfinger on the point that if we don't solve it today, fewer young \ndoctors will be entering the profession. That means less choice. Fewer \ndoctors doing high-risk procedures in trauma care, something that \ndoctors perform because they are trying to save a life.\n  Others are cutting back on critical but risky procedures, leaving \npatients to wonder who will be there to do these procedures.\n  In this institution, we fight cost and access. In America, we fight \ncost and access. Many times the decisions we make as Americans, such as \nchoosing to move to a particular area because the schools are good, \nalso includes the big component that there is a major medical facility \navailable for us and our family.\n  The realities are, as this goes on, those major medical areas are \ngoing to be more and more important because in rural America there will \nnot be doctors. And if there are no doctors, we know today, based upon \nwhat doctors tell us, there won't be OB/GYNs. We will have to tell \npregnant women, let us know when you think you are going to go in labor \nbecause it is a 2-hour drive to the nearest facility that delivers \nbabies. Or, as we have seen in some places, no natural child births, \nonly Caesarian, because there is a risk of litigation to natural \ndelivery that does not exist with the procedure of Caesarian birth. But \nsome suggest in this institution that the liability crisis does not \nexist in America.\n\n[[Page S4042]]\n\n  We come to the Senate to debate how we change health care policy so \nthat health care is accessible and affordable for all Americans. We \nunderstand today how many Americans, or we think we do, go without \ninsurance, without coverage, without the security at night of knowing \nthat whatever happens to them, they have a policy to take care of.\n  If we did not solve this problem, it does not matter what the policy \nsays. If the doctor is not there, where is our level of security? Where \nis the level of security of an American today that lives in a rural \nmarket where their hospital is closed? Not just their doctor left, but \nbecause of an 1,800-percent increase in the cost of liability \ninsurance, they have decided to close the doors.\n\n  The burden falls on the payer--us--on insurance companies to try to \nraise the reimbursements big enough to make the payments for liability \ncoverage. Why? Because of mega-awards, because of the influence those \nmega-awards have, in fact, had on the insurance product itself.\n  Dr. Handy was not the only one who wrote me. I had an interesting \nnote from a doctor in Fayetteville, a member of a four-person neurology \npractice that cannot attract physicians to join the practice because of \nthe inhospitable liability environment that exists. She and her husband \nare both neurosurgeons. They want to stay in North Carolina, but they \nmay need to move and are actively looking elsewhere because they cannot \neven attract a neurologist to come into an existing practice.\n  They realize, as two neurosurgeons, if your practice cannot grow \nbased on today's reimbursement structure, there is no way they can \nsurvive. Increases in their costs of insurance have limited their \nability to deliver charity care. They have also decreased their \nparticipation in workers' comp. Their practice writes off more than $1 \nmillion a year in uncollectible accounts. There are currently only four \nneurosurgeons in Fayetteville, NC--the pentagon of the Army, Fort \nBragg, NC, where over 55,000 men and women in the U.S. Army call home.\n  But some still suggest there is not a crisis. You see, it is easy to \nsuggest that something does not exist because I think there is a \ntendency in our system that until it directly affects us, it really \ndoes not exist.\n  The reality is that every day we meet in this incredible, historic \ninstitution, there are people across this country who do not have \naccess to a doctor, who cannot afford the services, who have been \naffected by the fact that the liability crisis in America is, in fact, \nreal and has affected them.\n  Well, the challenge for this Senate, as we move forward, is to make \nsure our voices are louder than those who suggest there is not a \ncrisis, to make sure the human face of those around America--who are \naffected directly and indirectly by the liability crisis that exists in \nmedicine today--to make sure their voice is heard, their face is seen, \nthat in this institution, as we talk about solutions, we look around \nthe country and say: What have others done?\n  Well, that is what we are getting ready to do next week. We have \nlooked around the country and seen who has been successful. And we are \ngoing to adopt a model that exists in Texas. It is not one that \ntightens as much as California. California, usually not necessarily the \none that looks at Washington and says: Limit something for us--\nCalifornia woke up and said: There may not be a liabilities crisis in \nAmerica, but there is a liability crisis in California, and we are \ngoing to put caps in, we are going to bring some sanity to the system, \nwe are going to bring in the parameters that drive price's down and \nencourage doctors to practice here in, yes, obstetrics, in neurology, \nin neurosurgery, and thoracic surgery.\n  California thrives today. What was California's comment about what we \nmight do in Washington? It was: My gosh, don't make us raise our caps \nto what you are going to establish in all the States. We are below that \ntoday. I never thought I would say: California does something right. \nLet's mirror it. But that day has come in the Senate but at a time \nwhere some still suggest there is not a crisis.\n  What do we want to do? Replicate what, in fact, States have \nreplicated to address the high cost of health care, the lack of access, \nthe flight of doctors, the need for specialists. We want to adopt that \nnationally. It is as simple as that.\n  Next week, people will come to the floor of the Senate and they will, \nin an incredible way, suggest there is not a crisis in America. I want \nthose in the Chamber today to remember next week not just the doctors \nwho say there is a crisis, and it is real, but to remember the patients \nout there who are directly affected by our inability to solve this \nproblem. They are the ones for which the safety net is supposed to be \nthere to protect them. But the safety net only works if the \ninfrastructure is there. This is not about cost by itself today. This \nis about access. And when access goes away, our ability to address it \nwith a safety net is gone.\n  I urge my colleagues to stay engaged. I look forward to next week's \ndebate.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer for the time, and I yield back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burr). The time of the majority has \nexpired.\n  The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for up to \n20 minutes in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/04/senate-section/article/S4042-1", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4042-S4044]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MEDICAL LIABILITY REFORM\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I come to the floor to add a few words to \nthe eloquent words spoken by the Senator from North Carolina about a \nnational crisis in access to good quality health care.\n  Some have said we do not so much have a health care system in America \ntoday as a sick care system. We know there is a lot we can do to change \nthat and improve that. But we, at bottom, need to make sure everyone in \nthis country has access to good quality health care.\n  One of the ways we do that is by making it less onerous for health \ncare providers--doctors and hospital workers--to practice their chosen \nprofession. But right now--because of soaring costs of medical \nliability insurance, because of our unpredictable, some might say, \nlitigation lottery system in this country--we need to come up with some \npractical ways to solve that problem, to help bring down those costs, \nto make it possible for doctors and health care providers to practice \ntheir profession. In the end, that is the only way we are going to be \nable to follow through on this promise of universal access to good \nquality health care in this country.\n  Now, we, fortunately--as Louis Brandeis described the States, he \ncalled them laboratories of democracy. And we know, as Americans, not \nall good ideas come from Washington, DC. Indeed, an awful lot of bad \nideas come out of Washington, DC. What we need to do is to look for \ngood models and good examples of success stories and to try to emulate \nthose on a national basis.\n  Now, three times in the 108th Congress we brought to the floor \nlegislation designed to modestly limit runaway damages--not for \neconomic damages; that is, lost wages, medical bills, and the like--\nbut, rather, to provide some reasonable caps on what are called \nnoneconomic damages, things such as pain and suffering, punitive damage \nawards, and the like.\n  Three times we brought proposals to this floor to provide modest \ncaps, to try to emulate the success stories in States across this \nNation, to try to lower health care costs and increase access to health \ncare, but we were denied an opportunity to have an up-or-down vote on \nthose reforms.\n  We brought forward a bill limited to obstetricians and gynecologists \nbecause of the lack of doctors to deliver babies for pregnant women. We \nwere told no. We then brought forward a bill limited to emergency room \nphysicians, again, to try to deal with the crisis and the lack of \naccess to well-trained emergency room physicians. Again, we were told \nno by the other side of the aisle.\n  But I have learned one thing in the short time I have been in the \nU.S. Congress; and that is, perseverance pays off. So if at first you \ndo not succeed, try, try again, because, hopefully--hopefully--\ncircumstances will have changed, people will reconsider. Hopefully, \nconstituents, whom Members of the Senate represent, are talking to\n\n[[Page S4043]]\n\ntheir Senators and saying: We need reform. We need change. And so here \nwe are again to make another try.\n  Just 2\\1/2\\ years ago, the voters in my State, the voters in Texas, \npassed proposition 12, a referendum that paved the way for medical \nliability reform and helped to stem the tide of frivolous and expensive \nlitigation that had for so long plagued our civil justice system.\n  The result: Decreased costs and increased numbers of physicians. And \nwith it, better access to good quality health care for the people of my \nState.\n  Consider the following: All major physician liability carriers in \nTexas have cut their rates since the passage of the reforms, most by \ndouble digits. Texas physicians have seen their liability rates cut, on \naverage, 13.5 percent. Roughly half of Texas doctors have seen their \nrates slashed a quarter, producing roughly $49 million in annualized \npremium savings for Texas physicians.\n  Let me make clear, this is not just about saving doctors money. That \nis not what this is about. This is about patient access because when \nthe costs of doing business go so high, doctors who have practiced a \nlong time, who are nearing retirement, say: Do you know what. I think I \nam going to retire early. Or when young, smart men and women are \ndeciding what careers to pursue--if they look at a career where the \noverhead costs of practicing their chosen profession are so high that \nthe rate of return on this investment they have made will be so low--\nthey will decide to do something else.\n  That is why we have had a lack of access to health care in my State \nand in this country and why this issue of liability insurance rates \ncoming down is so important to the ultimate goal of increased access to \ngood quality health care.\n  In my State, since the reforms were passed, five carriers have \nannounced double-digit rate cuts, and recently Medical Protective, a \ncompany that writes medical liability insurance coverage, announced a \n13-percent rate cut in February--their third announced rate cut within \na span of 11 months.\n  The largest underwriter, Texas Medical Liability Trust, has cut \npremiums almost 21 percent, resulting in $86 million in savings, plus a \n$10 million dividend for its policyholders.\n  Competition is also increasing. With the passage of these reforms, \nTexas has added three new regulated carriers, 20 unregulated carriers, \nand now Texas physicians can competitively shop for their medical \nliability insurance policies.\n  But that is not the only good news. By far, the most encouraging \nresults of these reforms has been a flood of new physicians coming to \nTexas. So there are more people to treat my constituents, the patients \nof Texas.\n  Since proposition 12 passed, this medical liability reform, Texas has \nadded somewhere in the order of between 3,000 and 4,000 new physicians. \nThe Texas medical board is anticipating a record 4,000 applications for \nnew physician licenses just this year, which is twice last year's \ntotal, and 30 percent more than the State's single greatest growth \nyear.\n  After a net loss of 14 obstetricians between the years 2001 and 2003, \nTexas has now seen a net gain of 146 obstetricians. Texas experienced a \nnet loss of nine orthopedic surgeons from 2000 to 2003. Since these \nreforms were passed, the State has experienced a net gain of 127 \northopedic surgeons. And those who need it most are the ones who are \nbenefiting, as physicians move to jurisdictions where there has been a \nwoeful lack of available health care.\n  Sadly, in my State, the parts of the State that need access to health \ncare the most are the ones that have been the least hospitable and, \nindeed, the most hostile to the health care providers because they have \nbeen the areas where medical liability lawsuits have run amok. This, in \nfact, has helped rein that in and bring some common sense to the \nsystem.\n\n  For example, Cameron County, along the Texas-Mexico border, is \nexperiencing the greatest ever increase in numbers of physicians. \nJefferson County, which is Beaumont, Nueces County, which is Corpus \nChristi, and Victoria County, which is Victoria, saw a net loss of \nphysicians in the 18 months before these reforms were passed, but \ncurrently all three counties are producing impressive gains, adding \nmuch needed specialists and emergency room physicians. As a result, the \npeople of those areas have benefited enormously. Each of the medically \nunderserved communities of Corpus Christi and Beaumont now has a \nneurosurgeon that they did not have before the passage of the reforms.\n  Sometimes lost in the numbers are the real benefits that are \nrealized, the day-to-day improvements in the lives of the people who \nare affected. After the passage of these reforms, two obstetricians in \nthe small town of Fredericksburg, TX, announced their return with an \nadvertisement in the local newspaper that said: ``We're Back.'' One of \nthese obstetricians, a Dr. David Cantu, had been working for more than \n10 years with no claims, but he and his partner had to quit practicing \ntheir profession of obstetrics and gynecology because of the cost of \ninsurance. Dr. Cantu's overhead was hitting 100 percent. In other \nwords, everything he was earning was going to overhead, and he had a 3-\nmonth stretch of time when he could not draw down any pay whatsoever.\n  As soon as Dr. Cantu stopped delivering babies, the practice saw an \nimmediate decrease in their insurance costs, but the patients were \nnegatively impacted because they then had to travel miles away to have \ntheir babies delivered. This was doubly difficult for them considering \nthat a full 70 percent of Dr. Cantu's patients were Medicaid patients \nand 40 percent were Spanish-speaking patients.\n  With this reform, Dr. Cantu and his partner are now able to deliver \nbabies once again. When asked why proposition 12 in Texas helped him, \nDr. Cantu said:\n\n       Because now I come out ahead instead of paying to be an \n     obstetrician. Prop. 12 made the practice of obstetrics \n     affordable.\n\n  After 4 years of searching for a neurosurgeon in Corpus Christi, the \ncommunity successfully recruited Dr. Matthew Alexander from a Wisconsin \nresidency program. Dr. Alexander told the Corpus Christi Caller-Times \nhe would not have come to Texas had the reforms not passed. As a \nresult, patients are now getting procedures previously unavailable to \nthem.\n  Consider, for example, high school principal and triathlete Travis \nLonganecker, who was a recipient of an artificial disc in his back, the \nfirst procedure of its kind in south Texas. The surgery has alleviated \nhis pain and allowed him to return to a normal life--again, a procedure \nthat could not have previously been performed because Corpus Christi \nwas having a difficult time recruiting a neurosurgeon to actually come \npractice there. Or consider George Rodriguez, who had a spinal abscess \nand arrived at the hospital paralyzed from the waist down. He had been \nin a paralyzed state for roughly 24 hours. Dr. Alexander again \nsuccessfully performed the necessary procedure. But had the surgery \nbeen delayed for as little as 1 hour, George Rodriguez would have been \nparalyzed for life.\n  These stories are not about theory. This is not about actuaries and \nabout insurance policies and premiums. These stories are not the stuff \nof academic journals, and these stories at bottom boil down to basic \nissues of life and death and quality of life. These are real-life \nexamples. These are real people whose lives are much better as a direct \nresult of the relief provided after the people of Texas took to the \npolls, took action, and passed these reforms.\n  While I am very proud of the reforms passed by Texas and the great \nstrides we have been able to make in that State of 23 million people \ntoward a better health care system, the fact is, we now have an \nopportunity to extend those benefits to all of the people in this \ncountry by passing nationwide legislation which would build on that \nTexas model and accomplish these reforms. I hope our colleagues who \npreviously have blocked our ability to have an up-or-down vote on this \nimportant legislation will reconsider. The proof is as plain as the \nnose on your face. It is there for anyone and everyone to look at and \nto learn from. I hope those who have previously blocked our ability to \naddress this important issue will have learned and will reconsider.\n  Obviously, health care is so important to all of our families and all \nof our lives. I am pleased that we will also be bringing to the floor \nthe Health Insurance Marketplace Modernization and Affordability Act of \n2005. That is a long title, but basically it is about giving\n\n[[Page S4044]]\n\nsmall businesses and other individuals an opportunity to pool together \nto try to make health insurance coverage more affordable and accessible \nso more people can have health insurance. We can use this to build on \nsome of the great reforms we passed as recently as 2003 which allow \npeople to create such things as health savings accounts, which has \ngiven rise to the whole notion of consumer-driven health care.\n  Someone pointed out to me not too long ago that we know more about \nthe used cars we buy than we do about the health care services we \npurchase because we can find out about quality, we can find out about \nprice, and we can compare. The fact is, the American consumer is \nlargely denied that opportunity, and we need to provide that sort of \ntransparency so that patients can compare and make the best decision \nfor their needs and their family, and which, not coincidentally, will \nhelp bring down the price of health care services because people will \nbe able to then pay out of their health savings account. Obviously, \nthat will have an impact on utilization rates as well.\n  I thank the Chair for his patience and willingness to assume that \nposition so I could say these few words both out of pride for my State \nand for the successful experiment we have conducted in Texas which has \nnow served as a wonderful model for the United States going forward to \ntry to address a true crisis. But not only a crisis, it is something \nthat, once we address this and hopefully pass this medical liability \nlegislation, Senator Enzi's health care bill which will provide greater \naccess to health insurance and provide people with a better life, that \nwe will ultimately have done something good that the American people \ncan say: I know my Senator and my Congressman are up in Washington, and \nthey are actually listening to what we are saying. They are actually \ndealing with the great issues that affect the quality of my life and my \nfamily's life, and that we will have done something of which we can be \nvery proud.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/04/senate-section/article/S4044-1", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4044]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ENHANCEMENT ACT OF 2005\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the need for \nhate crimes legislation. Each Congress, Senator Kennedy and I introduce \nhate crimes legislation that would add new categories to current hate \ncrimes law, sending a signal that violence of any kind is unacceptable \nin our society. Likewise, each Congress I have come to the floor to \nhighlight a separate hate crime that has occurred in our country.\n  In December, 2004, a 30-year-old man was beaten outside a restaurant \nin downtown Seattle, WA. The man received a concussion, split lip, \nloose teeth, a black eye, and bruises from being kicked while on the \nground. The victim believed his assailants beat him up because they \nthought that he was gay.\n  I believe that the Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, \nto defend them against the harms that come out of hate.

I \nbelieve that by passing this legislation and changing current law, we \ncan change hearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/04/senate-section/article/S4044-2", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4044]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       35TH ANNIVERSARY OF AMTRAK\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise today to commemorate the 35th \nanniversary of Amtrak. When the first Amtrak Clocker train left New \nYork, bound for New Jersey and Philadelphia, on May 1, 1971, it ushered \nin a new era of passenger rail travel in the United States. Millions of \npassengers from every corner of America can attest to the fact that \nAmtrak remains a vital part of our nationwide transportation network, \nand I firmly believe it's imperative that we not just preserve our \nnation's passenger rail system, but also develop it.\n  Amtrak's transformation from a tiny initiative with only 25 workers \nand widespread expectations of failure, to a successful national \ncorporation with 19,700 employees in nearly every state, is one of the \ngreat success stories I've witnessed during my many years in the \nSenate. Every day approximately 68,000 travelers rely on Amtrak as an \neffective alternative to the hassles and delays of air travel, and the \nincreasingly prohibitive gas costs and traffic congestion associated \nwith highway travel.\n  Amtrak remains enormously important to my home State of New Jersey. \nLast year, for instance, over 3.4 million people boarded or exited an \nAmtrak train at the six rail stations in New Jersey, and nearly 1,700 \nNew Jersey residents worked for Amtrak during this same time period. \nApproximately 110 Amtrak trains travel through my home State every day; \nthis service, combined with the many rail lines that New Jersey \nTransit, SEPTA, PATH, and PATCO operate, truly makes New Jersey a \nnational leader in passenger rail. I am immensely proud of this \ndistinction--as all New Jerseyans are--and it would not be possible \nwithout Amtrak. The benefits of such a system are immense; without \nrails, our State would suffocate under extreme highway and airport \ntraffic congestion. On Amtrak's Northeast Corridor service between \nWashington, DC, and Boston, MA, which stops at several points in New \nJersey, the trains carry as many people as 75,000 fully loaded Boeing \n757 jets each year. By contrast, there are only 102 flights between \ndowntown Washington, DC, and the three New York City-area airports on \nan average weekday.\n  On December 11, 2000, the first Acela Express service began on the \nNortheast Corridor. As one of the leading proponents of high-speed rail \nin the Congress, it has been a marvel to see the success of this train \nand its example of how high-speed rail can be successful in our \ncountry. I am a frequent rider of the Acela Express between New Jersey \nand Washington, and I appreciate the service for the same reasons that \nmany others do: it is efficient, it is comfortable, it is cost-\neffective, and it is convenient. Most tellingly, the Acela Express's \noperations do not require a subsidy, and I expect its ridership to \ncontinue to grow as others discover the advantages of this remarkable \ntrain.\n  Mr. President, it is unfortunate that despite the great successes of \nAmtrak, it is necessary for the many defenders of the system myself \nincluded to fight for its survival at every turn. There are many within \nthe Bush administration--and within the House and Senate--who would \nlike nothing better than to see Amtrak wither and die, stranding \nmillions of travelers in the process. We cannot let this happen, and as \nlong as I am a member of the Senate, I will not let this happen. I will \ncontinue to work with a diverse set of colleagues on both sides of the \naisle who realize the advantages of providing options for travelers and \nhaving a balanced national transportation system.\n  In short, Mr. President, I salute Amtrak for its achievements, and I \nextend the railroad and its employees, who are the backbone of the \nrailroad's operation, warmest wishes for continued success through the \nnext 35 years.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/04/senate-section/article/S4044-3", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4044-S4045]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            VOTE EXPLANATION\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, due to the untimely loss of my beloved \nsister, Marilyn ``Nubs'' Hatch Kuch, I have been necessarily absent for \na portion of the debate and votes on Wednesday, May 3 and Thursday, May \n4, 2006.\n  Concerning the votes I missed, if I were present I would have voted \nas follows: nay for amendment No. 3616, striking funding to States \nbased on their production of certain types of crops, livestock and/or \ndairy products; nay for amendment No. 3673, providing funds for \nassessments of critical reservoirs and dams in the State of Hawaii; nay \nfor amendment No. 3601, allocating $1,000,000 for the monitoring of \nwaters off the coast of the State of Hawaii; yea for amendment No. \n3704, allocating $20,000,000 from the AmeriCorps program to the \nVeterans Health Administration for medical facilities; yea for final \npassage of H.R. 4939, the Fiscal Year 2006 Emergency Supplemental \nAppropriations Act for Defense, the Global War on Terror, and Hurricane \nRecovery; yea for Executive Calendar No. 617, the nomination of Brian \nM.

Golden of Pennsylvania to be the U.S. District \nJudge for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. None of these votes \nwould have changed the final outcome.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, yesterday I was pleased to introduce,\n\n[[Page S4045]]\n\nalong with 21 of my Senate colleagues from diverse political, \ngeographic, and ethnic backgrounds, a bipartisan and bicameral bill to \nreauthorize the Voting Rights Act of 1965.\n  The Senate Judiciary Committee has had a very busy year. Last Fall, \nwhile the House was beginning its hearings on the Voting Rights Act, we \nwere just finishing our hearings and final vote on the nomination of \nJohn G. Roberts, Jr. to be Chief Justice of the Supreme Court. Soon \nafter that, we began preparing for hearings on the nomination of \nHarriet Miers to replace Justice O'Connor on the Supreme Court. When \nthat nomination was withdrawn, we had to start over with a new nominee, \nSamuel Alito. We held hearings for Justice Alito in January, and since \nthen, we've had a very full schedule which has included several \nhearings on the legality of the President's domestic spying program \nand, of course, countless hours marking up comprehensive immigration \nlegislation.\n  So, we are just now beginning our work on the Voting Rights Act. But \nour relatively late start here in the Senate should not be interpreted \nto suggest that the Voting Rights Act is not a priority compared to the \nother matters we have had to address. To the contrary, the actions we \ntake with respect to the Voting Rights Act--like the actions we took \nduring the Supreme Court confirmation hearings--will dramatically \nimpact the rights and lives of American citizens for generations to \ncome.\n  The Voting Rights Act has been hailed as the single most effective \npiece of civil rights legislation that we have ever passed. The Act \ndoes not simply guarantee the right to vote, but it ensures the \neffective exercise of that fundamental right. In 1965, when President \nJohnson signed the bill into law, there were only 300 minorities \nelected to State, local, or federal office. Today, just 4 decades \nlater, there are some 10,000 minorities serving as elected public \nofficials.\n  Leaders from both parties, including President Bush and Attorney \nGeneral Gonzales, have said they support reauthorization. Today, \nleaders from both parties of both houses of Congress have come together \nto introduce this reauthorization bill.\n  The magic of the Voting Rights Act is apparent in my own hometown, \nNew York City. New York City is one of the most diverse cities in the \ncountry, and the Voting Rights Act has been extremely effective in \nensuring that all of our citizens are able to participate equally in \nthe political process. But many of the Act's successes in New York have \ncome only since the last time we renewed its major provisions.\n  For example, the first African American mayor of New York City wasn't \nelected until 1989, and the first African American wasn't elected to \nstatewide office until 1994. In 2002, the first Asian American was \nelected to the New York City Council. And finally, just last year, a \nmayoral candidate became the first Latino to win his party's \nnomination.\n  These strides are important, but they are too few and too recent to \nsay for certain that the goals of the Voting Rights Act have been met. \nThere is still a lot of work to do, and as a member of the Judiciary \nCommittee, I look forward to reviewing the evidence and testimony that \nis going to be presented at our hearings in the weeks to come, and to \nworking with my colleagues from both Houses and on both sides of the \naisle to ensure that this bill is passed well before the deadline.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/04/senate-section/article/S4045-1", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4045]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        SMALL PUBLIC HOUSING AUTHORITIES PAPERWORK REDUCTION ACT\n\n  Mr. SUNUNU. Mr. President, I rise to speak on legislation I \nintroduced yesterday, the Small Public Housing Authorities Paperwork \nReduction Act. This legislation is an important step toward alleviating \nsome of the burden placed on our Nation's smallest public housing \nauthorities. PHAs play an important role in meeting the housing needs \nof the Nation's low-income individuals, families, seniors, and the \ndisabled. Unfortunately, they face a challenge when balancing the \nhousing needs of those they serve with the, oftentimes, consuming and \nduplicative reporting requirements placed upon them. The legislation I \nam introducing today seeks to address just one annual report that will \nfree up a significant amount of time and resources, allowing housing \nauthorities to focus more attention on the individuals they serve.\n  Specifically, this legislation would exempt PHAs with 500 or fewer \npublic housing units and any number of section 8 vouchers from the \nrequirement of submitting an annual plan to the Department of Housing \nand Urban Development. The 1992 Public Housing Reform Act required PHAs \nto submit separate 5-year and annual plans to HUD. The redundancy of \nthe annual plan process creates an undue burden for small PHAs by \nrequiring them to provide identical information to HUD every 12 months. \nFor example, an annual plan outlines a PHA's goals, policies, \neligibility guidelines, and other information that is unlikely to \nchange from year to year. Under this bill, small PHAs would only be \nrequired to submit their 5-year plan--a more appropriate timeline for \nreevaluating their goals and policies--to better allow them to use \nscarce human and financial resources to directly serve the needs of \ntheir communities. Additionally, this bill would only exempt those PHAs \nthat have demonstrated compliance with HUD regulations. PHAs that have \nbeen designated by HUD as troubled would not be exempted from the \nannual plan.\n  It is also important to note that PHAs would still be required to \nconduct an annual meeting in which residents and community members are \nincluded in the planning and development of a housing authority's \nobjectives and priorities. My legislation makes certain that residents \nhave an opportunity to comment on any changes to the goals, objectives, \nand policies of the agency. Housing authorities are also required to \nnotify tenants of any proposed changes at least 45 days before the \npublic hearing occurs. The annual public meeting, in combination with \nState and local public meeting requirements, will continue to ensure \nthat any changes made to a PHA's policies are well vetted, with \nparticular attention paid to resident concerns.\n  PHA directors in my State and across the country contend that this \nlegislation is a significant step toward reducing the excessive \npaperwork and reporting requirements that burden their agencies. I \nagree, that by mitigating some of this burden, we will allow PHAs to \nfocus more time and energy for their mission-driven service to their \nhousing residents. Not all PHAs have the time, staff, or resources \navailable to complete these annual plans. Some PHAs have had to hire \noutside consultants to complete the plans, a costly expense for these \nagencies. Given the fiscal constraints PHAs are facing, it is more \nimportant now than ever to give housing authorities the flexibility \nneeded to work within these budget constraints. This legislation is one \nsimple way Congress can assist in providing needed relief to PHAs.\n  My colleague, Congressman Randy Neugebauer, has introduced similar \nlegislation which passed in the House of Representatives on December \n13, 2005, by a vote of 387 to 2. The overwhelming support in the House \nfor such an initiative makes very clear the need for this type of \nrelief. I am hopeful my colleagues in the Senate will also see the \nvalue of providing paperwork reduction for those agencies that have \ndemonstrated their ability to comply with current regulations.\n  Finally, I am pleased to have the support of the New Hampshire \nHousing Finance Authority and local agencies across my State in this \neffort. New Hampshire's PHAs continue to do an exceptional job of \nproviding for the housing needs of those who need it most. State and \nlocal housing agencies perform an invaluable community function by \nsecuring housing for families and individuals in need. I remain \ncommitted to working further with them throughout this legislative \nprocess and to reducing unnecessary federal regulatory burdens for \nhousing.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/04/senate-section/article/S4045-2", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4045-S4046]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        COVER THE UNINSURED WEEK\n\n  Mr KOHL. Mr. President, this week has been designated Cover the \nUninsured Week. It is week that we mark every year to spur our Nation \nto act to address the growing number of Americans who lack health \ninsurance. Sadly, that this has become an annual event shows that we \nhave made little\n\n[[Page S4046]]\n\nprogress. I hope this year will be different, and that the \nadministration and the congressional leadership will finally make \nhealth care a priority.\n  The U.S. Census Bureau estimates that more than 45 million Americans \nlack health insurance--that is one out of every six people. Wisconsin \nfares slightly better with 11 percent of our population without health \ncoverage.\n  These numbers have increased every year since 1999. All across the \ncountry, families and businesses are struggling to afford basic health \ncare, and too many are losing the battle.\n  Government joined the fray, with some success, in the past. In 1997, \nCongress created the State Children's Health Insurance Program, which \nled to the BadgerCare program in Wisconsin. Since SCHIP's inception, \nthe program has provided medical coverage and care to millions of \nchildren throughout the Nation who otherwise would have gone without. \nIn addition, States have stepped in to provide a safety net for the \npoorest of the poor through Medicaid and high-risk insurance pools.\n  Despite these gains, many working families still need help. According \nto a report by the nonpartisan Commonwealth Fund, 41 percent of \nworking-age Americans with incomes between $20,000 and $40,000 a year \nwere uninsured for at least part of 2005. This is a dramatic increase \nfrom 2001, when just 28 percent of those with moderate incomes were \nuninsured.\n  This is an alarming statistic but not surprising. Skyrocketing health \ncare costs have rendered insurance unaffordable to most families and \nbusinesses. In 1996, annual premiums for employers grew by 0.8 percent; \nby 2003, that growth averaged 13.9 percent. Last year, the average \npremium jumped 9.2 percent, and some areas of Wisconsin saw increases \nof as much as 24 percent.\n  All employers struggle with the costs of health care, but none more \nthan the small employer. Many have stopped offering health insurance \naltogether, swelling the number of uninsured full-time workers.\n  Congress could help employers to continue providing health insurance \nby passing the Small Employers Health Benefits Program Act, which I \ncosponsored. The legislation, modeled after the health insurance system \navailable to Federal workers, allows small employers to band together \nto purchase health insurance for their employees and negotiate better \nprices. It also gives employers a refundable tax credit to help with \nthe costs of providing insurance for low-income employees.\n  Helping employers afford health care premiums is only part of the \nanswer; we also must tackle the problem of escalating health care costs \ndriven largely by the rising cost of prescription drugs. Americans pay \nthe highest prices in the world for medicines sold in other countries \nfor a fraction of the cost. I support reforms such as allowing \nAmericans to purchase less expensive prescription drugs from Canada and \nother countries with strong protections to ensure the safety of those \nmedicines. I have also cosponsored legislation to speed to market \ngeneric drugs, which cost much less than their brand-name counterparts. \nAnd I believe we must allow Medicare to negotiate directly with drug \ncompanies for lower prices for seniors participating in the new \nMedicare drug benefit.\n  America is the leader of the world in health care innovation. We have \nthe highest per-capita spending on health care of any developed nation, \nbut we rank at the bottom when it comes to health insurance coverage.\n  That is inexcusable. For too long we have said the right things, but \nfailed to take concrete action. Let's make the next year different. \nNext year, we should spend this week celebrating real progress rather \nthan lamenting another year of inaction. Another year of empty rhetoric \nand pointing fingers will get us no closer to the goal of ensuring all \nAmericans reliable, affordable health coverage. I stand ready to work \nwith those on both sides of the aisle who are interested in making a \nreal difference in the coming year.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/04/senate-section/article/S4046-1", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4046]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                      RECOGNIZING TAFT HIGH SCHOOL\n\n Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I would like to take the \nopportunity to congratulate the students of the Taft High School \nAcademic Decathlon Team on becoming this year's 2006 National \nChampions.\n  Each year, the U.S. Academic Decathlon tests our Nation's best and \nbrightest in a host of subjects including calculus, writing, impromptu \nspeaking, music, and art history. The competition is consistently among \nthe most rigorous in the country.\n  Amassing an outstanding 51,659 points out of a possible 60,000, Taft \nHigh School earned one of the most sweeping and significant victories \nin recent decathlon history. As one decathlon official noted, ``I've \nnever seen anything like this.''\n  These students could not have achieved this memorable accomplishment \nwithout the tremendous support and encouragement from their dedicated \nteachers and parents.\n  I commend the team coach Dr. Arthur Berchin and Taft High School \nfaculty and administrators for their invaluable guidance, and I applaud \nthe participants' parents for their unwavering dedication and \ncommitment to helping these students reach their full potential.\n  I would also like to recognize team members Zachary Ellington, \nMichael Farrell, Farhan Khan, David Lopez, David Novgorodsky, Julia \nRebrova, Atish Sawant, Dean Schaffer, and Monica Schettler for their \ntremendous poise and determination. I encourage them to continue the \nhard work and perseverance that have brought them this victory. They \nare wonderful examples of true scholarship, and have made Taft High \nSchool, the county of Los Angeles, and the State of California very \nproud.\n  What is more extraordinary is that each Taft High School team member \nplaced first, second, or third in all ten of their individual events, \ntotaling 43 medals and capturing 7 of the top 9 awards for individual \nperformance.\n  Equally important, the Taft High School Academic Decathlon Team is \none strengthened by diversity, including students from Russia and \nBangladesh. Good schools, like good societies and good families, \ncelebrate and cherish diversity.\n  Many of these students have decided to take their scholastic \nsuccesses to the next level, and will attend a myriad of prestigious \ncolleges and universities in the fall. All participants have already \ntaken undergraduate-level courses, and their passionate pursuit of \nacademic excellence is indeed noteworthy.\n  Once again, I would like to honor the entire Taft High School \nAcademic Decathlon Team on a well-deserved victory. Each of these \nstudents holds wonderful promise and I applaud them for their many \nachievements. Their futures are bright and their performance will \ncontinue to serve as an inspiration to us all.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/04/senate-section/article/S4046-2", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4046-S4047]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 HAL DAVID CELEBRATES HIS 85TH BIRTHDAY\n\n Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, May 25th marks the 85th birthday \nof an extraordinary American artist--Hal David. Hal is one of America's \nmost prolific and beloved lyricists, and I congratulate him as he \ncelebrates this birthday and a lifetime of memorable songs.\n  Hal David's music has been entertaining millions for generations. His \ncollaborations with Burt Bacharach on songs performed by Dionne Warwick \nare legendary. He has won the hearts of music lovers of all ages, and \nhas earned 20 gold records, several Grammys, and an Academy Award.\n  Over the years he has also earned the immense respect of his \ncolleagues nationally and internationally. He was elected to the \nSongwriter's Hall of Fame and awarded their prestigious Johnny Mercer \nAward. He received the Grammy Trustee Award from the Academy of \nRecording Arts and Sciences, and the Ivor Novello Award from the \nBritish Performing Rights Society.\n  He has written film scores including ``The April Fools'' and ``A \nHouse is Not a Home.'' His brilliant works for the theater include \n``Promises, Promises,'' which received a Grammy Award and a Tony Award \nnomination.\n  Hal has been an inspiring advocate for young songwriters as well. He \nis a member of the board of directors of ASCAP and formerly served as \nits\n\n[[Page S4047]]\n\nPresident. He is also chairman of the board of the National Academy of \nPopular Music.\n  It is worth pointing out, as we debate immigration reform, that Hal \nwrote the song, ``America Is,'' which was the official song of the \nLiberty Centennial campaign for the restoration of the Statue of \nLiberty and Ellis Island.\n  Many of us are privileged to know Hal personally. He is a remarkable \nartist and an outstanding humanitarian. Hal wrote the famous ``What the \nWorld Needs Now is Love,'' and in so many ways, Hal has always expanded \nthat love with his magnificent songs that have enriched all of our \nlives. I congratulate him on this special birthday, and I wish him many \nmore beautiful years. As my mother would have said, ``Tell that nice \nyoung Hal David not to worry about turning 85--he won't slow down for \nanother 10 or 15 years.'' May the raindrops keep falling on your head, \nHal, and keep nourishing your special genius.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/04/senate-section/article/S4047-1", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4047]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        RECOGNITION OF AN OUTSTANDING MASSACHUSETTS CORPORATION\n\n Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I am honored to recognize iRobot \nCorporation, an outstanding Massachusetts company that develops cutting \nedge technology, and to congratulate the board, management team and \nstaff on the quality products they provide to our armed services.\n  Minimizing troop casualties is an endless task for both our civilian \nand military leaders, and I am proud to represent a State that hosts \nsome of the country's leading thinkers in addressing that challenge. I \nhad the pleasure of visiting such a company recently and I was deeply \nimpressed by the commitment and perseverance of the people at iRobot.\n  Founded in 1990 by three roboticists from the Massachusetts Institute \nof Technology--Helen Greiner, Colin Angle and Rodney Brooks--iRobot \ndesigns behavior-based, artificially intelligent robots. These robots \nare built to perform dangerous duties that would otherwise risk the \nlives of our soldiers in Afghanistan and Iraq. Their economic impact on \nour state is considerable. As a homegrown Massachusetts business, \niRobot brings in millions of dollars in revenue to the State's economy, \nand it is the only publicly traded company dedicated solely to this \nemerging industry.\n  I recently had the opportunity to see firsthand an extraordinary \npiece of equipment developed by iRobot--the PackBot Tactical Mobile \nRobot. The PackBot is a lightweight robot designed to disarm IEDs. \nThere are currently more than 300 PackBot robots deployed in Iraq, \nAfghanistan, and around the world. Since mobilization, PackBot robots \nhave performed thousands of missions and in the process saved countless \nsoldiers' lives.\n  I applaud iRobot's efforts to develop 21st century technology to help \nour troops accomplish their missions, and I am very proud that such an \nexemplary company calls Massachusetts home.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/04/senate-section/article/S4047-2", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4047]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       CONGRATULATING THE STUDENTS OF EAST BRUNSWICK HIGH SCHOOL\n\n Mr. LAUTENBERG.

The \nstudents spent months researching different constitutional topics, \nranging from the philosophical underpinnings of the Constitution to \nissues currently being debated on the Senate floor. Participants then \nparticipated in mock congressional hearings where they were questioned \nby state judges, professors, lawyers, and journalists.\n  East Brunswick first won the New Jersey state competition to earn the \nright to participate in the national finals here in Washington, DC. In \nthree days of intense competition, the students competed against more \nthan 1,500 other students from every State and the District of \nColumbia. This is East Brunswick's third consecutive win in this \nprestigious competition.\n  I would like to congratulate each member of the East Brunswick High \nSchool team: Brian Boyarksy, David Chu, Nelson Chu, Dana Covit, Megan \nDeMarco, Ben DeMarzo, Craig Distel, Deborah Elson, Dana Feuchtbaum, \nMunira Gunja, Melinda Guo, Shelby Highstein, Evan Hoffman, Jayasree \nIyer, Ryan Korn, Michael Martelo, Carol Ann Moccio, Jeffrey Myers, Ari \nNe'eman, Daniel Nowicki, Aditya Panda, Sherwin Salar, Gil Shefer, Aaron \nSin, Lauren Slater, Eric Smith, Merichelle Villapando, Amy Wang, and \nJason Yang.

JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n      By Mr. ENSIGN:\n  S. 2718. A bill to require full disclosure by entities receiving \nFederal funds, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Homeland \nSecurity and Governmental Affairs.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, the American taxpayers are fed up. They \nare tired of the pork projects and the billions of dollars being spent \non unaccountable, unnecessary, and wasteful Federal spending. Whether \nspending is a result of earmarks, or the often unsupervised process of \nFederal agencies awarding grants, spending is out of control.\n  Americans work hard every day, and they struggle to meet the heavy \ntax burden that Washington imposes on them. Despite their struggle and \nsacrifice, Washington has failed to ensure that Americans' tax dollars \nare being spent wisely. The American public believes, and they are \nright, that Congress has lost sight of the fact that every dollar we \nspend here in Washington belongs to them. These are dollars that could \nhave been spent by the people who earned them to care for their own \nfamilies.\n  The American taxpayers have had enough. They are frustrated and \ndisgusted. And I join them in their frustration and disgust. Congress \nhas not done a very good job of oversight. It is time for Congress to \nempower the American people so that government is more accountable to \nthem. That is why I am introducing new legislation--the Website for \nAmerican Taxpayers to Check and Help Deter Out-of-control Government \nSpending--or the WATCHDOG Act.\n  This bill will give our constituents the tools they need to become \ncitizen watchdogs. Americans will be able to see for themselves how \ntheir tax dollars are being spent. This bill will greatly improve \ntransparency and help eliminate wasteful, fraudulent, duplicative, and \nunnecessary spending. It will give the American people the tools to \nmonitor how Congress uses the earmarks process and how the bureaucrats, \nwho spend billions of dollars a year in unsupervised grants, spend \ntheir tax dollars.\n  Americans are aggravated because too often when they learn about \nwasteful spending it is too late for them to do anything about it. They \nlearn about spending by reading their morning papers after the \nlegislation has been signed into law or the grant money has been \nawarded. Sometimes that is how members of Congress learn about them as \nwell. It's time to remove the cloak of secrecy that surrounds the \nearmarking and grantmaking processes. We need to shine a very bright \nlight on how spending decisions are made.\n  In this case, that bright light will be a publicly searchable online \ndatabase that provides information on every organization receiving \nFederal funds. The Office of Management and Budget would be required to \nmake all Federal grant and loan recipient data available to the public.\n  The data must include information on Federal grant awards, including \nan itemized breakdown by agency and program. The database must also \nlist all subgrantees of an organization that receives Federal funds. \nThis bill also reforms and streamlines the grant process by requiring \norganizations that apply for Federal funding to use a single source \napplication number, which they would use for requesting funding from \nany Federal agency.\n  Those projects that are using Federal funds efficiently and with \npositive results will become obvious, and those programs that are \nduplicative, fail to show results, squander their funding, or act \nfraudulently will also become obvious.\n  Here in Washington we have done a dismal job when it comes to cutting \nout unnecessary spending. By shining a light on this process, the \nAmerican public will have a chance to help us eliminate billions of \ndollars in wasteful\n\n[[Page S4054]]\n\nFederal funding. We owe it to the taxpayers and to future generations \nto clean up our act. This legislation gives taxpayers an important tool \nto hold Congress' feet to the fire.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. NELSON of Florida:\n  S. 2719.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \nincentives to improve America's research competitiveness, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, on October 4, 1957, an object the size of \na basketball shot into space. And history changed.\n  The Soviet Union had launched Sputnik. And Americans reacted with \nfear. That fear quickly turned to determination to win the race to \nspace.\n  Just one month later, the Russians launched Sputnik II with one \nprecious passenger: a Russian mutt named Laika. Laika became the first \nliving being to orbit earth. Today, a dog in space might seem like a \ngood start for a Disney film. But in 1957, American scientists worried \nthat these events foreshadowed Soviet military and strategic advantage.\n  By the following summer, Congress had created NASA. Sputnik's launch \nhad provided the catalyst. For years before, scientific organizations \nand even the White House had declared the exploration of space as a \npriority. It took Sputnik to move us to action.\n  Half a century later, we find ourselves waiting for the next Sputnik. \nReport after report has outlined the risk that America runs by not \ndoing more in research and education. A recent report entitled \n``Waiting for Sputnik'' cautions that our workforce must include a \ngreater percentage of ``knowledge workers''--including scientists and \nengineers--if we are to maintain our technological lead in defense \ncapabilities. And another recent report, ``Rising Above the Gathering \nStorm,'' expresses fear that America's lead in science and technology \ncan be abruptly lost and difficult or impossible to regain.\n  What these reports and others are telling us is one thing: We cannot \nwait for the next Sputnik. We must recognize that our advantage is \nfleeting. We must begin today with more science, more education, and \nmore commitment to research to prepare for the future.\n  Asia has recognized this. Asia is plowing more funding into science \nand education. China, in particular, understands that technological \nadvancement means security, independence, and economic growth. Spending \non research and development has increased by 140 percent in China, \nKorea and Taiwan. In America, it has increased by only 34 percent.\n  Asia's commitment is already paying off. More than a hundred Fortune \n500 companies have opened research centers in India and China. I have \nvisited some of them. I was impressed with the level of skill of the \nworkers I met there.\n  China's commitment to research, at $60 billion in expenditures, is \ndramatic by any measure. Over the last few years, China has doubled the \nshare of its economy that it invests in research. China intends to \ndouble the amount committed to basic research in the next decade. \nCurrently, only America beats out China in numbers of researchers in \nthe workforce.\n  Over the last few months, I have offered a series of proposals to \nimprove America's competitiveness. Today, I am pleased to introduce the \nResearch Competitiveness Act of 2006. This bill would improve our \nresearch competitiveness in four major areas. All four address \nincentives in our tax code. Government also supports research through \nFederal spending. But I am not addressing those areas today.\n  First, my bill improves and simplifies the credit for applied \nresearch in section 41 of the tax code. This credit has grown to be \noverly complex, both for taxpayers and the IRS. Beginning in 2008, my \nbill would create a simpler 20 percent credit for qualifying research \nexpenses that exceed 50 percent of the average expenses for the prior 3 \nyears.\n  And just as important: The bill makes the credit permanent. Because \nthe credit has been temporary, it has simply not been as effective as \nit could be. Since its creation in 1981, it has been extended 10 times. \nCongress even allowed it to lapse during one period.\n  The credit expired again just last December. And another short-term \nextension is pending in both tax reconciliation bills in conference. \nLast year, the experts at the Joint Committee on Taxation wrote: \n``Perhaps the greatest criticism of the R credit among taxpayers \nregards its temporary nature.'' Joint Tax went on to say, ``A credit of \nlonger duration may more successfully induce additional research than \nwould a temporary credit, even if the temporary credit is periodically \nrenewed.''\n  Currently, there are two different ways to claim a tax credit for \nqualifying research expenses. First, the ``traditional'' credit relies \non incremental increases in expenses compared to a mid-1980s base \nperiod. Second, the ``alternative incremental'' credit measures the \nincrease in research over the average of the prior 4 years.\n  Both of these credits have base periods involving gross receipts. My \nbill replaces these with a new credit, known as the ``Alternative \nSimplified Credit,'' based on research spending without reference to \ngross receipts. The current formula hurts companies that have \nfluctuating sales. And it hurts companies that take on a new line of \nbusiness not dependent on research.\n  The Senate has passed this alternative formula as an optional credit \nseveral times. It is now pending in both versions of the tax \nreconciliation bill. It has not yet been enacted, though, even on a \ntemporary basis.\n  I support the 2-year extension of the R credit contained in the \nSenate version of the tax reconciliation bill. That is why this new \nsimpler formula in my bill would not start until 2008. That start date \nwould give companies plenty of time to adjust their accounting.\n  The main complaint about the existing credits is that they are very \ncomplex, particularly the reference to the 20-year-old base period. \nThis base period creates problems for the taxpayer in trying to \ncalculate the credit. And it creates problems for the IRS in trying to \nadminister and audit those claims.\n  The new credit focuses only on expenses, not gross receipts. And is \nstill an incremental credit, so that companies must continue to \nincrease research spending over time.\n  A tax credit is a cost-effective way to promote R A report by the \nCongressional Research Service finds that without government support, \ninvestment in R would fall short of the socially optimal amount. Thus \nCRS endorses Government policies to boost private sector R\n  Also, American workers who are engaged in R activities benefit from \nsome of the most intellectually stimulating, high-paying, high-skilled \njobs in the economy.\n  My own State of Montana has excellent examples of this economic \nactivity. During the 1990s, about 400 establishments in Montana \nprovided high-technology services, at an average wage of about $35,000 \nper year. These jobs paid nearly 80 percent more than the average \nprivate sector wage, which was less than $20,000 a year during the same \nperiod. Many of these jobs would never have been created without the \nassistance of the R credit.\n\n[[Page S4055]]\n\n  My research bill would also establish a uniform reimbursement rate \nfor all contract and consortia R It would provide that 80 percent of \nexpenses for research performed for the taxpayer by other parties count \nas qualifying research expenses under the regular credit.\n  Currently, when a taxpayer pays someone else to perform research for \nthe taxpayer, the taxpayer can claim one of three rates in order to \ndetermine how much the taxpayer can include for the research credit. \nThe lower amount is meant to assure overhead expenses that normally do \nnot qualify for the R credit are not counted. Different rates, \nhowever, create unnecessary complexity. Therefore, my bill creates a \nuniform rate of 80 percent.\n  The second major research area that this bill addresses is the need \nto enhance and simplify the credit for basic research. This credit \nbenefits universities and other entities committed to basic research. \nAnd it benefits the companies or individuals who donate to them. My \nbill provides that payments under the university basic research credit \nwould count as contractor expenses at the rate of 100 percent.\n  The current formula for calculating the university basic research \ncredit--defined as research ``for the advancement of science with no \nspecific commercial objective''--is even more complex that the regular \ntraditional R credit. Because of this complexity, this credit costs \nless than one-half of 1 percent of the cost of the regular R credit. \nIt is completely under-utilized. It needs to be simplified to encourage \nbusinesses to give more for basic research.\n  American universities have been powerful engines of scientific \ndiscovery. To maintain our premier global position in basic research, \nAmerica relies on sustained high levels of basic research funding and \nthe ability to recruit the most talented students in the world. The \ngestation of scientific discovery is long. At least at first, we cannot \nknow the commercial applications of a discovery. But America leads the \nworld in biotechnology today because of support for basic research in \nchemistry and physics in the 1960s. Maintaining a commitment to \nscientific inquiry, therefore, must be part of our vision for sustained \ncompetitiveness.\n  Translating university discoveries into commercial products also \ntakes innovation, capital, and risk. The Center for Strategic and \nInternational Studies asked what kind of government intervention can \nmaintain technological leadership. One source of technological \ninnovation that provides America with comparative advantage is the \ncombination of university research programs, entrepreneurs, and risk \ncapital from venture capital, corporations, or governments. Research \nclusters around Silicon Valley and North Carolina's Research Triangle \nexemplify this sort of combination.\n  The National Academies reached a similar conclusion in a 2002 review \nof the National Nanotechnology Initiatives. In a report, they wrote: \n``To enhance the transition from basic to applied research, the \ncommittee recommends that industrial partnerships be stimulated and \nnurtured to help accelerate the commercialization of national \nnanotechnology developments.''\n  To further that goal, the third major area this bill addresses is \nfostering the creation of research parks. This part of the bill would \nbenefit state and local governments and universities that want to \ncreate research centers for businesses incubating scientific \ndiscoveries with promise for commercial development.\n  Stanford created the Nation's first high-tech research park in 1951, \nin response to the demand for industrial land near the university and \nan emerging electronics industry tied closely to the School of \nEngineering. The Stanford Research Park traces its origins to a \nbusiness started with $538 in a Palo Alto garage by two men named Bill \nHewlett and Dave Packard. The Park is now home to 140 companies in \nelectronics, software, biotechnology, and other high tech fields.\n  Similarly, the North Carolina Research Triangle was founded in 1959 \nby university, government, and business leaders with money from private \ncontributions. It now has 112 research and development organizations, \n37,600 employees, and capital investment of more than $2.7 billion. \nMore recently, Virginia has fostered a research park now housing 53 \nprivate-sector companies, nonprofits, VCU research institutes, and \nstate laboratories. The Virginia park employs more than 1,300 people.\n  The creation of these parks would seem to be an obvious choice. But \nit takes a significant commitment from a range of sources to bring them \ninto being. To foster the creation and expansion of these successful \nparks, my bill will encourage their creation through the use of tax-\nexempt bond financing. Allowing tax-exempt bond authority would bring \ndown the cost to establish such parks.\n  Foreign countries are emulating this successful formula. They are \nestablishing high-tech clusters through government and university \npartnerships with private industry.\n  Back in 2000, a partnership was formed to foster TechRanch to assist \nMontana State University and other Montana-based research institutions \nin their efforts to commercialize research. But TechRanch is \ndesperately in need of some new high-tech facilities. It could surely \nbenefit from a provision such as this. I encourage my Colleagues to \nvisit research parks in their States to see how my bill could be \nhelpful in fostering more successful ventures.\n  A related item is a small fix to help universities that use tax-\nexempt bonds to build research facilities primarily for federal \nresearch in the basic or fundamental research area. Some of these \nfacilities housing federal research--mostly NIH and NSF funded \nprojects--are in danger of losing their tax-exempt bond status. Counsel \nhave notified some state officials that they may be running afoul of a \nprohibition on ``private use'' in the tax code, because one private \nparty has a superior claim to others in the use of inventions that \nresult from research.\n  The complication comes from a 1980 law. In 1980, Congress enacted the \nPatent and Trademark Law Amendments Act, also known as the Bayh-Dole \nAct. The Bayh-Dole Act requires the Federal Government to retain a non-\nexclusive, royalty-free right on any discovery. In order to foster more \nbasic research through Federal-State-university partnerships, we need \nto clarify that this provision of the Bayh-Dole act does not cause \nthese bonds to lose their tax-exempt status. And my bill directs the \nTreasury Department to do so. I understand that the Treasury Department \nis aware of this significant concern. Whether or not Congress enacts my \nlegislation, I hope that the Treasury Department will clarify the \nsituation later this year.\n  The fourth major area that my bill addresses is innovation at the \nsmall business level. Recently, representatives of a number of small \nnanotechnology companies came to visit me. They told me that their \ngreatest problem was surviving what they called the ``valley of \ndeath.'' That's what they called the first few years of business, when \nan entrepreneur has a promising technology but little money to test or \ndevelop it. Many businesses simply do not survive the ``valley of \ndeath.'' I believe that Congress should find a way to assist these \nbusinesses with promising technology.\n  Nanotechnology, for instance, shows much promise. According to one \nrecent report, over the next decade, nanotechnology will affect most \nmanufactured goods. As stated in Senate testimony by one National \nScience Foundation official earlier this year, ``Nanotechnology is \ntruly our next great frontier in science and engineering.'' It took me \na while to understand just what nanotechnology is. But it is basically \nthe control of things at very, very small dimensions. By understanding \nand controlling at that dimension, people can find new and unique \napplications. These applications range from common consumer products--\nsuch as making our sunblocks--better to improving disease-fighting \nmedicines--to designing more fuel-efficient cars.\n  So, to help these small businesses convert their promising science \ninto successful businesses, my bill would establish tax credits for \ninvestments in qualifying small technology innovation companies. These \nstruggling start-up ventures often cannot utilize existing incentives \nin the tax code--like the R tax credit--because they have no tax \nliability and may have little income for the first few years. They need \naccess to cheap capital to get through\n\n[[Page S4056]]\n\nthose first few research-intensive years.\n  The credit in my bill would be similar to the existing and successful \nNew Markets Tax Credit. The New Markets Credit has provided billions of \ndollars of investment to low-income communities across the country. In \nmy bill, entities with some expertise and knowledge of research would \nreceive an allocation from Treasury to analyze and select qualifying \nresearch investments. These investment entities would then target small \nbusiness with promising technologies that focus the majority of their \nexpenditures on activity qualifying as research expenses under the R \ncredit.\n  In sum, my bill would boost both applied and basic research. It would \nboost research by businesses big and small. And it would foster \nresearch by for-profit and non-profits alike.\n  There is no clear answer to how to address the concerns raised in the \n``Waiting for Sputnik'' report. But the answer is clear that we must \ntry--and soon.\n  A noted environmentalist once said: ``Every major advance in the \ntechnological competence of man has forced revolutionary changes in the \neconomic and political structure of society.'' From telephones to \nrockets to computers, I believe that this is true.\n  Let us work to see that the next big technological advance is \ndiscovered here in America. Only through continued commitment to \nresearch can we ensure that it is.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. CLINTON (for herself and Mr. Schumer):\n  S. 2722. A bill to designate the facility of the United States Postal \nService located at 170 East Main Street in Patchogue, New York, as the \n``Lieutenant Michael P. Murphy Post Office Building''; to the Committee \non Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, today I rise to discuss legislation that \ndesignates the United States Post Office Building in Patchogue, New \nYork as the ``Lieutenant Michael P. Murphy Post Office Building.''\n  Almost a year ago, Navy LT Michael P. Murphy was reported missing in \nthe mountains of Afghanistan while on a covert reconnaissance mission \nin search of Taliban and al-Qaida insurgents. Reports indicate \nLieutenant Murphy and the three other members of his Navy SEAL team \ncame under heavy attack by Taliban insurgents soon after they were \ninserted by helicopter into their position. The military creed of \n``never leaving a fallen comrade behind'' was never more appropriate as \nthis American hero's body was recovered on the Fourth of July, our \nNation's Independence Day. Michael Murphy was only 29 years of age at \nthe time of his passing, but as his father recalls, ``He squeezed more \nlife into 29 years than I will ever see.''\n  Lieutenant Murphy attended Patchogue-Medford High School on Long \nIsland, where he was a National Honor Society student and a varsity \nfootball athlete. After graduating high school he attended Penn State \nUniversity where he majored in political science and excelled \nacademically. At the time of his graduation, he decided to fulfill a \nlifelong dream of becoming a Navy SEAL. While realizing this would be a \nformidable challenge, Michael was determined to serve our country. \nMichael was engaged to be married, and he planned to attend law school \nafter his military service.\n  I ask that the Senate come together and honor this brave American \nhero for his service to our Nation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. CLINTON (for herself, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Jeffords, Mr. \n        Leahy, Mr. Harkin, and Mr. Obama):\n  S. 2725. A bill to amend the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 to \nprovide for an increase in the Federal Minimum wage and to ensure that \nincreases in the Federal minimum wage keep pace with any pay \nadjustments for Members of Congress; to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the ``Standing \nwith Minimum Wage Earners Act''. This legislation will raise the \nminimum wage over the next two years and link future increases in the \nminimum wage to Congressional raises.\n  Today, working parents earning the minimum wage are struggling to \nmake ends meet and to build better lives for their children. The \nFederal minimum wage is currently $5.15 an hour, an amount that has not \nbeen increased since 1997. Sadly, during that time, Congress has given \nitself eight annual pay raises. We can no longer stand by and regularly \ngive ourselves a pay increase while denying a minimum wage increase to \nhelp the more than 7 million men and women working hard across this \nnation. At a time when working families are struggling to put food on \nthe table, it's critically important that we here in Washington do \nsomething. If Members of Congress need an annual cost of living \nadjustment, then certainly the lowest-paid members of our society do \ntoo.\n  There are currently 13 million American children living in poverty \nacross this country, and this number is increasing every day. Families \nwork hard and yet cannot make enough money to support themselves. More \nfamilies are falling into poverty every day, and these families are \nworking 40 hours a week. This is unacceptable.\n  Minimum wage workers have not had a raise in nearly a decade. The \nreality is a full-time job that pays minimum wage just does not provide \nenough money to support a family today. A single mother with two \nchildren who works 40 hours a week, 52 weeks a year earns only $10,700 \na year. This amount--$10,700 a year--is almost $6,000 below the Federal \npoverty line for a family of three. We have a responsibility to help \nfamilies earn a living wage.\n  My legislation will benefit all minimum wage earners, and it would \nespecially benefit women who represent a disproportionate number of \nlow-wage workers. 61 percent of minimum wage earners are women, even \nthough women only comprise 48 percent of the total workforce. And \nalmost one-third of these working women are raising children.\n  The women in my State of New York would feel the effects of a minimum \nwage increase most dramatically. New York is one of the top five States \nwith the greatest number of low-wage women workers.\n  In addition to helping America's hardest working families, raising \nthe minimum wage will also narrow the dramatic income gap between the \nhaves and the have-nots across the country. The average income of the \nrichest fifth of New York State families is 8.1 times the average \nincome of the poorest fifth. Nationwide, families in the top fifth made \n7.3 times more than those in the bottom fifth. This discrepancy needs \nto be fixed and my bill would be a step in the right direction towards \nfairness for America's hard-working families.\n  My legislation would increase the minimum wage first to $5.85 an \nhour, then to $6.55 an hour, and ultimately to $7.25 an hour within the \nnext two years. In addition, my legislation then ensures that every \ntime Congress gives itself a raise in the future that Americans get a \nraise too. This is the right and fair thing to do for hardworking \nAmericans.\n  I would like to recognize my cosponsors Senators Kennedy, Jeffords, \nLeahy, Harkin and Obama and thank them for joining me in this effort.\n  The ``Standing with Minimum Wage Earners Act'' has letters of support \nfrom Service Employees International Union (SEIU), the American \nFederation of Labor--Congress of Industrial Organization (AFL-CIO) and \nthe Coalition for Human Needs.\n  I ask my colleagues to recognize the moral aspect of this issue. It \nis simply wrong to pay people a wage that they can barely live on. And \nit is shameful to continue to give ourselves raises as millions of \nAmerican families struggle to survive. We should raise the Federal \nminimum wage so that working parents can lift their children out of \npoverty. It is past time to make this investment in our children and \nfamilies.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BOND (for himself and Mr. Akaka):\n  S. 2735. A bill to amend the National Dam Safety Program Act to \nreauthorize the national dam safety program, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, my distinguished colleague Senator Akaka and \nI are introducing legislation today to reauthorize the National Dam \nSafety and\n\n[[Page S4057]]\n\nSecurity Program. The goal of this program, administered by FEMA, has \nbeen to advance dam safety in the United States and prevent loss of \nlife and property damage from dam failures at both the Federal and \nState programmatic levels.\n  Over the last several months we have seen in both my home State of \nMissouri and my colleague's State of Hawaii, how critically important \nproper regulation, inspection and safety training is for maintaining \nour Nation's dams. The National Dam Safety Program Act provides much \nneeded assistance to State dam safety programs, which are responsible \nfor regulating 95 percent of the 80,000 dams in the U.S.\n  The States receive training assistance for their dam safety engineers \nand State grant assistance based on the number of dams in the State. \nThe National Dam Safety Program, currently administered by FEMA within \nDHS, expires in September 30, 2006 and needs to be reauthorized.\n  I am proud to introduce this legislation along with my colleague \nSenator Akaka in order to strengthen the protection of our citizens and \ncritical infrastructure from dam failures through the Dam Safety and \nSecurity Program.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise today, along with my colleague, \nSenator Christopher Bond, to introduce the Dam Safety Act of 2006. This \nlegislation is designed to help prevent such tragic failures as the \ncollapse of the privately owned Ka Loko Dam in Kauai last March in \nwhich seven people died. The legislation complements legislation that I \nintroduced with Senator Inouye, S. 2444, the Dam Rehabilitation and \nRepair Act of 2006, which assists in securing and repairing publicly \nowned dams. Both of these bills are critical to preventing the type of \ndevastating collapse which occurred on Kauai.\n  This legislation is vitally important not only to my State but to \nevery State. There are approximately 79,000 dams registered in the \nNational Inventory of Dams. However, there are many more dams that are \nsmall and unregulated. This bill provides funding for State dam safety \nprograms to enhance their oversight and support abilities.\n  The Dam Safety Act of 2006 reauthorizes the National Dam Safety \nProgram, NDSP, which was first established as part of the Water \nResources Development Act of 1996 Public Law 104-303. In 2002, the NDSP \nwas reauthorized for another 4 years by the enactment of the Dam Safety \nand Security Act of 2002 Public Law 107-310. It expires at the end of \nthis fiscal year, so its reauthorization is imperative.\n  The National Dam Safety Program delivers vital Federal resources to \nState governments to improve their dam safety programs by providing \nfunds for training, technical assistance, research, and support. \nFederal incentive grants are awarded to States to enhance their dam \nsafety programs. In addition, funds have been used to hire staff for \ninspections, pay for specialized training, and develop specialized \nmapping in the event that a dam failure necessitates evacuation.\n  Of the approximately $12 million authorized for each fiscal year, $8 \nmillion is divided among the States to improve safety programs and $2 \nmillion is allocated for research to identify more effective techniques \nto assess, construct, and monitor dams. In addition, $700,000 is \navailable for training assistance for State engineers, and $1 million \nis used for the National Inventory of Dams.\n  The costs of failing to maintain dams properly are extremely high. \nThere have been at least 29 dam failures in the United States during \nthe past 2 years causing more than $200 million in property damages. \nThe failure of the Silver Lake Dam in Michigan in 2003 caused more than \n$100 million in property damage. A December 2005 dam collapse in \nMissouri injured three children and destroyed several homes. People \ncaught in the path of a dam collapse are often helpless to escape.\n  Such was the tragic situation in Hawaii when, in March, the Ka Loko \nDam, a 116-year earthen dam, on the island of Kauai suddenly collapsed \nduring heavy rains, killing seven people. When a dam collapses, \ndestruction is often swift and uncontrollable. In the case on Kauai, \nlocal, State, and Federal officials quickly responded to the tragedy, \nassisting citizens while engineers from both the State Department of \nLand and Natural Resources and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers \ninspected the over 50 dams on Kauai. Neighbors worked together to help \nneighbors, and our Governor quickly requested more funds, which the \nlegislature approved, for cleanup and additional inspections.\n  While most of the responsibility is at the State and local level, \nthere is a role for the Federal Government in supplementing State \nresources and developing national guidelines for dam safety. The funds \nHawaii receives under the program help the State's staff to acquire and \nmaintain equipment and software to assess dam safety. It is a small \namount but vitally important to my State and to every State.\n  I urge my colleagues to join Senator Bond and me in supporting the \nreauthorization of the National Dam Safety Program.\n  I ask unanimous consent to insert in the Record at this point a \nletter from the Dam Safety Coalition endorsing this legislation.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                         Dam Safety Coalition,\n\n                                      Washington, DC, May 4, 2006.\n     Hon. Kit Bond,\n     Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Daniel Akaka,\n     Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Bond and Senator Akaka: We would like to \n     commend you for your commitment to dam safety and to the \n     reauthorization of the National Dam Safety Program.\n       Dams are a vital part of our nation's aging infrastructure \n     and provide enormous benefits to the majority of Americans--\n     benefits that include drinking water, flood protection, \n     renewable hydroelectric power, navigation, irrigation and \n     recreation. Yet, these critical daily benefits provided by \n     the nation's dams are inextricably linked to the potential \n     consequences of a dam failure if the dam is not maintained, \n     or is unable to impound water, pass large flood events or \n     withstand earthquake events in a safe manner.\n       The Dam Safety Coalition is proud to highlight the \n     achievements of the National Dam Safety Program, administered \n     by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). \n     Specifically, the program has fostered significant \n     improvements in state dam safety programs, provided critical \n     training to state engineers and established unprecedented \n     cooperation between federal dam safety agencies and state dam \n     safety programs. It requires FEMA to provide assistance to \n     states in establishing, maintaining and improving dam safety \n     programs.\n       Dams in the United States are aging, downstream development \n     below dams is increasing dramatically and many older dams do \n     not meet current dam safety standards. Dam failures are \n     largely preventable disasters.\n       In 2005, the American Society of Civil Engineers published \n     the Report Card for America's Infrastructure giving the \n     condition of our nation's dams a grade of D, equal to the \n     overall infrastructure grade. States have identified 3,500 \n     unsafe or deficient dams, many being susceptible to large \n     flood events or earthquakes. It is a reasonable expectation \n     of every American to be protected by our government; \n     including protection from preventable disasters such as dam \n     failures.\n       To contact the Dam Safety Coalition please call Brian \n     Pallasch if we can be of assistance.\n       We look forward to working with you to enact the National \n     Dam Safety Act in the 109th Congress.\n           Sincerely,\n     Brian T. Pallasch,\n       Co-Chair, Dam Safety Coalition.\n     Lori C. Spragens,\n       Executive Director, ASDSO.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CRAIG (for himself and Mr. Akaka):\n  S. 2736. A bill to require the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to \nestablish centers to provide enhanced services to veterans with \namputations and prosthetic devices, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Veterans' Affairs.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, today I seek floor recognition to introduce \nlegislation to create a series of Amputation and Prosthetic \nRehabilitation Centers in the Department of Veterans Affairs.\n  As many of you are aware, VA already operates numerous specialty care \ncenters for the treatment of veterans with spinal cord injury, \ntraumatic brain injury, and visual impairment. However, at this moment, \nVA does not operate any similar centers of care for the treatment of \nveterans with amputations.\n  I do not mean to suggest that VA does not provide excellent care and \nservices to those veterans who have unfortunately lost a limb or part \nof limb.\n\n[[Page S4058]]\n\nBut, there's always room for improvement in the care VA delivers and, \njust as importantly, there is room for improvement in the prosthetic \nservices and devices that help those men and women with their physical \nrestoration.\n  Many of us have spoken personally with service members who are \nrecuperating from injuries at Walter Reed Army Medical Center or \nBethesda Naval Hospital. Today's extraordinary battlefield medicine is \nbringing back to our shores service members from Iraq and Afghanistan \nwho would never have lived through their injuries in previous wars. \nThanks to the best health care facilities the military has to offer and \nthe wonders of modern medicine, these brave Americans will eventually \nleave the hospital. Then, most will start the difficult process of \nreintegrating into civilian life. For those whose injuries resulted in \nan amputation, that process is just a little more difficult.\n  My hope with this bill is that these centers will be the lynchpin of \na fully integrated Prosthetic Service Network; similar to those I \nmentioned at the outset of my remarks for the care of spinal cord \ninjury, traumatic brain injury, and blindness. They would be fully \nresponsible for the system-wide coordination of all of the Physical and \nOccupational Therapy and Prosthetics care provided to this new \ngeneration of severely wounded veterans. In addition, they will provide \na new level of service to those who have long lived with amputations \ncaused during previous wars or conflicts.\n  Further, it is my hope and expectation that these centers will house \nand drive much of the prosthetic and amputee related research and \ndevelopment projects conducted by VA. I believe that by gathering under \none roof specialists, who have dedicated their medical practice to \ncaring for and rehabilitating those who have lost limbs, we will drive \nthe marketplace of ideas and develop the best treatment in the country. \nThere is no limit to what modern technology, American ingenuity, and a \ngreat cause can accomplish.\n  Just the other day, my Committee held a hearing on VA's research \nprogram. At that meeting, I had the opportunity to speak with a VA \nclinician who, along with many of his colleagues, has created a proto-\ntype prosthetic for someone who had lost part of a hand, but still had \nwrist control. In just a few moments time, I was able to wire the \nequipment to my own arm and with a little practice pick up a glass of \nwater, hold it in the prosthetic hand, and then return it to the table \nand remove the hand from it without spilling a drop. It was nothing \nshort of amazing. It was also a small glimpse of where we can go.\n  Of course, discoveries and inventions, like that hand, do not just \nremain in the VA vacuum. Once created, tested and approved, the R \nwill leave the VA world and almost immediately benefit the civilian \npopulation of amputees. By combining the resources of our government \nand the needs of our veterans, we can improve the American medical \nsystem for all of our citizens.\n  With the right technology, the best health care services, and a \nlittle personal drive, many of our amputees will return to active \nlives. They will play tennis, basketball, go kayaking, and even climb \nmountains. And while I am not suggesting that these centers will cause \nall of that to happen, I believe they will create the environment in \nwhich those things can happen.\n  I hope all of my colleagues will join me in supporting this bill now. \nAnd I hope to report it out of my committee and bring it to the floor \nfor a vote later this summer.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2736\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. AMPUTATION AND PROSTHETIC REHABILITATION CENTERS \n                   FOR VETERANS.\n\n       (a) Establishment.--\n       (1) In general.--The Secretary of Veterans Affairs shall \n     establish not less than five centers to provide \n     rehabilitation services to veterans with amputations or \n     prosthetic devices.\n       (2) Purpose.--The purpose of each center established \n     pursuant to paragraph (1) are--\n       (A) to provide regional clinical facilities of the \n     Department of Veterans Affairs with special expertise in \n     prosthetics, rehabilitation with the use of prosthetics, \n     treatment, and coordination of care for veterans who have an \n     amputation of any functional part of the body; and\n       (B) to provide information and supportive services to all \n     facilities of the Department of Veterans Affairs concerning \n     the care and treatment of veterans with a prosthetic device.\n       (3) Designation.--Each center established pursuant to \n     paragraph (1) shall be known as an ``Amputation and \n     Prosthetic Rehabilitation Center'' (in this section referred \n     to as a ``Center'').\n       (b) Geographic Distribution.--In identifying appropriate \n     facilities for the location of the Centers established \n     pursuant to subsection (a), the Secretary shall ensure, to \n     the maximum extent practicable, that such Centers are \n     geographically located so as to be accessible to as many \n     veterans as possible in the United States.\n       (c) Staff and Resources.--Each Center shall include the \n     following:\n       (1) A modern, well-equipped, and appropriately certified \n     laboratory facility capable of providing state-of-the-art and \n     complex prosthetic devices to all veterans with an \n     amputation, including veterans with an amputation incurred in \n     Operation Iraqi Freedom or Operation Enduring Freedom.\n       (2) Certified and experienced prosthetists, including \n     prosthetists with certifications in new fabrication \n     techniques.\n       (3) An accredited Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation \n     (PM) service with staff who are well-trained in current \n     prosthetic services and emerging trends for treatment of \n     amputations.\n       (4) A modern gait laboratory, permanently located within \n     such Center.\n       (d) No Duplication of Services of Polytrauma Centers.--\n       (1) In general.--The Secretary shall, to the extent \n     practicable, ensure that the services provided by the Centers \n     established pursuant to subsection (a) do not duplicate the \n     services provided by the polytrauma centers of the Department \n     of Veterans Affairs designated as Tier I or Tier II \n     Polytrauma centers.\n       (2) Construction.--Paragraph (1) shall not be construed to \n     prohibit the location of a Center so as to facilitate the \n     ready support of a polytrauma center, referred to in that \n     paragraph.\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, today I rise with my good friend and \ncolleague, Senator Craig from Idaho, to introduce legislation to \nestablish at least five Amputation and Prosthetic Rehabilitation \nCenters within the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). Through \nprogressive and specialized expertise in the area of prosthetics and \nrehabilitation, the visible reminders of the sacrifices made by our \nwounded warriors will become less evident and hopefully less of a \nfactor in their everyday lives.\n  Specialty care for amputees has become an even more pressing concern \nbecause of the types of injuries our brave soldiers have sustained in \nOperation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom. Many would \nagree that this is not the same kind of war that other generations of \nveterans have fought. The use of body armor and improvements in \nbattlefield medicine have saved more lives, but in many cases have left \nour soldiers with traumatic injuries. Servicemembers in the current \nconflicts have suffered from twice as many amputations as those who \nfought in past wars. Unfortunately, the incidence of multiple \namputations from bomb blasts is higher in this war.\n  The VA health care system has only begun to see the men and women \nfrom Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom who are in \nneed of long-term rehabilitation. Indeed, these veterans are young and \nplan on being active for a long time. VA is well poised to take on this \nchallenge. An ongoing study at the Providence VA hospital is looking at \n``biohybrid'' limbs which are implanted into tissue and later become an \nintegral part of the patient.\n  We cannot, however, forget about the war our current veterans \ncontinue to fight everyday against time and their health. Veterans \nstruggling with diseases such as diabetes are often faced with \namputation. The establishment of the Amputation and Prosthetic \nRehabilitation Centers will provide advanced care to those who have \nendured the loss of a limb, which will help them regain full function \nand a better quality of life.\n  The centers will provide VA regional clinical facilities with cutting \nedge expertise in prosthetics, rehabilitation with the use of \nprosthetics, treatment, and coordination of care for a veteran with an \namputation. By placing these centers in locations with the highest \nconcentrations of veterans, those in need will truly benefit from these \nspecialized services.\n\n[[Page S4059]]\n\n  VA has always been a leader in progressive treatment and care. These \ncenters will maintain VA as a leader by providing the tools and staff \nnecessary to do so. The legislation requires that the centers must have \na well-equipped and appropriately certified laboratory facility \nnecessary to provide the most state-of-the-art and complex prosthetic \ndevices.\n  With experienced prosthetists trained and certified in the area of \nnew techniques, an accredited Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation \nservice with trained staff in the most current prosthetic services, and \na permanent modern gait laboratory located within each center, veterans \nare sure to receive the most advanced treatment and care.\n  A critical part of this legislation is that these centers will serve \nas resources for smaller VA hospitals which may not have all of the \nexpertise but will certainly have the patients.\n  As Ranking Member of the Committee on Veterans' Affairs, I urge my \ncolleagues to join Chairman Craig and myself in support of providing \ntreatment to those in need so they can stand on their own.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BINGAMAN (for himself, Mr. Bayh, Mr. Coleman, Mr. \n        Lieberman, Mr. Chafee, Ms. Cantwell, Ms. Collins, Mr. Salazar, \n        Mr. Kerry, Mrs. Clinton, and Mr. Nelson of Florida):\n  S. 2747. A bill to enhance energy efficiency and conserve oil and \nnatural gas, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and \nNatural Resources.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BINGAMAN (for himself, Mr. Bayh, Mr. Coleman, Mr. \n        Lieberman, Mr. Lugar, Ms. Cantwell, Ms. Collins, Mr. Salazar, \n        Mr. Kerry, Mrs. Clinton, and Mr. Nelson of Florida):\n  S. 2748. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \ntax incentives to promote energy production and conservation, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President. I rise today to introduce two energy \nbills: the Enhanced Energy Security Act of 2006; and the Enhanced \nEnergy Security Tax Incentives Act of 2006.\n  All of us know that we face a challenging energy situation in this \ncountry in both the short term and the long term. The world market \nprice of crude oil is above $72 per barrel. We have seen gasoline \nprices above $3 per gallon in many parts of the country. In my home \nState of New Mexico, these prices are a real hardship to the many New \nMexicans who are forced to drive long-distances to work, without the \nprospect of car pooling or public transportation. The steep rise in the \nprice of gas at the pump is putting a nearly unbearable squeeze on \nfamily budgets in New Mexico and all across America.\n  So, we have a major national problem and not much time left in this \nCongress to make progress on it. The question is, what can we do in the \nremaining weeks of this Congress that would be bipartisan, that could \nbe signed into law by the President, and that would hold out the \nprospect of eventually helping to moderate the price of gasoline at the \npump?\n  I have thought for some time that the most effective way of \napproaching the real issues driving the high prices that consumers find \nunacceptable is through a four-part strategy focusing on 1. increasing \nconsumer protection, 2. increasing supply, 3. increasing efficiency of \noil and gas use, and 4. providing incentives for forward-looking energy \nchoices in the market.\n  A fair number of bills have already been introduced that deal with \nthe first two parts of that strategy. What has been lacking is a \nbipartisan path forward to consensus on increasing energy efficiency \nand on stimulating forward-looking investments in energy efficiency and \nrenewable energy technologies.\n  Today's bills are intended to fill that gap. Each of these two bills \nis designed to go to a single committee with jurisdiction over most, if \nnot all, of its contents.\n  The first bill, the Enhanced Energy Security Act of 2006, is \ncomprised of provisions that generally fall in the jurisdiction of the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  The second bill, the Enhanced Energy Security Tax Incentives Act of \n2006, is comprised solely of provisions in the jurisdiction of the \nSenate Finance Committee.\n  Some of the provisions in these two bills have been drawn from other \nbills, including S. 2025, the Vehicles and Fuels Choices for American \nSecurity Act, which was introduced last year by Senators Bayh, Coleman, \nLieberman and Brownback along with others. I appreciate their \nleadership and their support for this effort. What is newsworthy here \ntoday is that we are putting a large body of good policy ideas in a \nform that will facilitate committee action here in the Senate.\n  Relying on the Energy and the Finance committees to do the necessary \nhomework to come up with bipartisan solutions to our energy challenges \nis the best way for us to make progress in this Congress. Both \ncommittees have leaders, in Senators Domenici and Senator Grassley, who \ndemonstrated their commitment to bipartisan engagement on energy issues \nduring the enactment of last year's Energy Policy Act of 2005. I am \nlooking forward to working with both Committee Chairs to move forward \nwith the ideas in these bills on a bipartisan basis.\n  The basic idea behind the first bill, which is coming to the Energy \nCommittee, is that if we want, in the long term, to moderate the prices \nthat consumers are seeing in today's markets from oil and natural gas, \nwe need to focus more strongly on increasing energy efficiency, and \nparticularly increased efficiency of our use of oil and natural gas.\n  That's an area where we were unable to do much in the last Energy \nbill. But, there is a lot that needs to be done.\n  Among the most important provisions we are taking from S. 2025 and \nputting in the new bill, is an emphasis on an expanded plan for \neconomy-wide oil savings. The President is to come up with a plan that \nwill cut our oil use, from projected levels, by 2.5 million barrels of \noil per day by 2016, 7 million barrels of oil per day by 2026, and 10 \nmillion barrels of oil per day by 2031.\n  The new bill, also like S. 2025, includes a number of initiatives \ndesigned to reduce our nearly total reliance on petroleum products in \nthe transportation sector. These include: programs that will speed the \ndevelopment of new vehicle technologies such as ``plug-in hybrids'' and \nthe use of advanced light weight materials in vehicles; expanding the \nauthority of the Secretary of Energy to provide loan guarantees and \ncompetitive grants to auto manufacturers and parts manufacturers for \nconverting existing facilities or building new facilities for \nmanufacturing fuel-efficient vehicles and vehicle components; \nincreasing the availability of alternative fuels, such as E85, across \nthe country by providing funding for alternative fuel fueling stations; \nand providing incentives for the production of cellulosic ethanol--\nincluding loan guarantees and a reverse auction for production \npayments.\n  The new bill will also include a number of provisions aimed at \nrelieving demand and price pressure on natural gas. These include: \nstrengthening the Federal purchase requirement for renewable energy; \nthe 10 percent renewable portfolio standard that has passed the full \nSenate 3 times in the past 4 years; encouraging States to strengthen \ntheir programs on demand-side management; and better educating \nconsumers about energy efficiency measures that they can take.\n  The basic idea behind the second bill, the Enhanced Energy Security \nTax Incentives Act of 2006, is to create fiscal incentives that help \nforward-looking energy technologies to enter the market. As is often \nthe case with technological advancements, many of the energy technology \nalternatives that are poised to enter the marketplace will not be able \nto successfully compete without some transitional help.\n  The first set of provisions in the bill extends, through 2010, the \nvarious alternative fuel, efficiency and renewable energy tax \nprovisions we passed last year. These existing tax incentives will work \nbest if investors, manufacturers and consumers know that the government \nis committed and that they can plan for these tax incentives being \nthere for a few years. The tax provisions we are extending include \nprovisions to encourage the purchase of energy efficient housing and \noffice materials, as well as the generation of electricity from \nalternative sources such\n\n[[Page S4060]]\n\nas biomass, fuel cells, the wind and the sun. It will be nearly \nimpossible for Congress to create a comprehensive national energy \npolicy if important energy tax incentives such as these are in a \nperpetual state of uncertainty over the long term. If we extend these \ntax incentives through 2010 now, we will see a great increase in their \nusefulness in an industry that needs a few years lead-time to plan and \nbuild major energy projects.\n  The second set of provisions in the new tax bill will create new \nincentives to encourage our country to move towards more fuel efficient \nvehicles, such as hybrids. It accomplishes this in several ways.\n  First, as the President has suggested, we lift the current cap on the \nnumber of vehicles per manufacturer that are eligible for a consumer \ntax credit. This proposal was also part of the package unveiled last \nweek by Senators Domenici and Frist. Under the bill I will be \nintroducing, this modified version of the tax credit will be also \nextended until 2010.\n  Next, we create a 35 percent tax credit for manufacturers on the \nexpenses involved in retrofitting or setting up manufacturing \nfacilities to make these fuel efficient vehicles.\n  To encourage businesses with fleets of vehicles, we create a 15 \npercent tax credit for the purchase of more than 10 fuel efficient \nvehicles in a year.\n  In order to encourage alternative fueling stations, we expand the \ncurrent 30 percent tax credit to 50 percent and allow it to be \noperative until the end of 2010.\n  Finally, we create a 25 percent tax credit for the purchase of \nqualified idling reduction equipment so that vehicles currently on the \nroad are not running their engines any more than necessary.\n  While this is a rather large expansion of the currently available tax \nincentives for fuel efficient vehicles, it is what is going to be \nnecessary to get our vehicle policy headed in the right direction.\n  The legislation also contains new provisions to encourage the \npurchase of fuel efficient technologies for residences and businesses. \nIt creates a 10 percent tax credit for the purchase of energy efficient \ncombined heat and power units as well as provides for three year \ndepreciation on the purchase price for ``smart meters.'' These \nprovisions have broad support in the Senate but were regrettably \ndropped in last year's conference on the Energy Bill. I think is \nimportant that we look at these provisions anew.\n  A question that usually arises when you talk about expanding tax \nincentives is whether they are going to be paid for. Many of us here in \nthe Senate are worried about the deficit, so the tax bill that I am \ndescribing contains several revenue offsets, such as the provisions \ncontained in last year's reconciliation tax bill that get rid of tax \nbenefits in the oil and gas industry that are unnecessary and a waste \nof taxpayer dollars. This legislation would also close the SUV tax \nloophole that provides a windfall for the purchasers of inefficient \ncars at a time when the nation needs to be discouraging this activity.\n  I look forward to working with the Chairman and Ranking Member of the \nFinance Committee on both these new tax incentives but also on ways of \npaying for them, so that we are acting in a way that is fiscally \nresponsible.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of both bills be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2747\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to update the Silk Road Strategy Act of 1999 to \nmodify targeting of assistance in order to support the economic and \npolitical independence of the countries of Central Asia and the South \nCaucasus in recognition of political and economic changes in these \nregions since enactment of the original legislation; to the Committee \non Foreign Relations.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Silk Road \nStrategy Act of 2006. Joining me as original cosponsors are Senators \nKyl and Hutchison. I would like to extend my thanks to both of my \ncolleagues and their staff for their assistance and guidance on many of \nthe provisions in the bill.\n  The original Silk Road Strategy Act of 1999 saw the countries of the \nCaucasus and Central Asia--specifically, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, \nKazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan--as a \ndistinct region bound by history and common interests with a shared \npotential that was of critical importance to the United States.\n  The goals of that legislation were as follows: to promote \nindependent, democratic government; to promote the protection of human \nrights, tolerance, and pluralism; to aid in the resolution of conflicts \nand support political, economic, and security cooperation in order to \nfoster regional stability and economic interdependence; to promote \nfinancial and economic development based on market principles; to aid \nin the development of communications, transportation, health and human \nservices infrastructure; to promote and protect the interests of U.S. \nbusinesses and investments.\n  These basic policy goals have not changed; however, historic events \nsince 1999 have had a significant impact on the region's political \nsystems, economic conditions, and security situation which affect U.S. \nperceptions of and interests in the region. These changes include: the \nSeptember 11, 2001 terrorist attack on the United States, which \nclarified the nature and source of the key threats facing this country; \nthe Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan and the removal of the \nTaliban regime; the series of ``colored revolutions'' in Georgia, \nUkraine and Kyrgyzstan; Deteriorating relations between the U.S. and \ncertain regional leaders, especially Uzbekistan's President Islam \nKarimov, and the closure of the U.S. base in that country; the growing \ninfluence of regional powers, namely Russia and China; greater U.S. oil \nand gas interests in the Caspian region; and the threat posed by Iran, \nwhich is seeking to develop a nuclear potential.\n\n  In light of these changes, the Silk Road Act needs to be updated and \nrevised to better address some of the new challenges the U.S. faces in \nits relations with Central Asia and the Caucasus.\n  The U.S.'s vital interests in the Caspian region include: ensuring \nthe independence and security of Azerbaijan and Georgia, through which \ncritical oil and gas pipelines transit; containing Iran; ensuring \naccess to oil and gas reserves; maintaining good relations with \nKazakhstan; promoting peaceful resolution of conflicts; and keeping \nRussian geopolitical ambitions in check.\n  Further East, U.S. interests include: helping Kyrgyzstan to make its \nTulip Revolution a success; the political stabilization of Afghanistan \nand enhancement of its security by defeating the Taliban and Al Qaeda \nand its satellite organizations; political reform and liberalization in \nthe countries of Central Asia to neutralize radical Islamic movements, \nsuch as Hizb-ut- Tahrir al-Islami, HUT--Islamic Army of Liberation; \nreduction of drug production and exports; creation and/or support of \nthe U.S. military base network; and social and economic development in \nthe states of Central Asia.\n  To these ends, among other priorities, this bill emphasizes the \nimportance of East-West gas and oil pipelines, such as the Baku-\nTbilisi-Ceyhan pipeline, BTC. BTC ensures Azerbaijan's security and \neconomic future, and binds the country with neighboring Georgia and \nTurkey, anchoring Azerbaijan in the network of Western states and \ninstitutions.\n  The bill also includes Afghanistan as a Silk Road country and \npromotes the integration of Afghanistan with neighboring Central Asian \nstates in terms of security, trade, infrastructure and energy grids.\n  In all the states of Central Asia and the Caucasus, it is critical to \npromote democratic development. Among this bill's initiatives are calls \nfor supporting independent media outlets, especially electronic media, \nand also for satellite TV programming, to provide authoritative news \nand more diverse opinions than are otherwise available. Specifically, \nit supports satellite TV broadcasting into Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan and \nIran and the activities of their diasporas in the United States. \nFurthermore, the bill offers assistance for the establishment of civil \nservice institutes to train civil servants at all levels in the rule of \nlaw, conduct of elections, respect for citizens' rights, and the needs \nof a market economy.\n  No less important is the need to accelerate and broaden economic \nreform and modernization in the Silk Road countries. Accordingly, this \nbill provides assistance in the privatization of state enterprises and \nderegulation of the economy.\n  The bill also calls for assistance with the establishment of the \nCaspian Bank of Reconstruction and Development, CBRD, to help Silk Road \nstates address problems caused by increased revenues from energy \nexports, and dangers to macroeconomic stability and overheating of the \neconomy infrastructure, as well as promote development in the region.\n  In light of Trans-Caspian Oil and Gas Pipelines, this bill encourages \nthe governments of Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan and especially Turkmenistan \nto improve their business climate and investor confidence by fully \ndisclosing their internationally audited hydrocarbon reserve.\n  The bill strongly supports activities that promote the participation \nof U.S. companies and investors in the planning, financing, and \nconstruction of infrastructure for communications, transportation, \nincluding air transportation, and energy and trade including highways, \nrailroads, port facilities, shipping, banking, insurance, \ntelecommunications networks, and gas and oil pipelines.\n  Furthermore, the bill would assist in the removal of legal and \ninstitutional barriers to continental and regional trade and the \nharmonization of border and tariff regimes, including improved \nmechanisms for transit through Pakistan to Afghanistan and the rest of \nCentral Asia.\n\n[[Page S4073]]\n\n  With respect to the World Trade Organization, the bill offers support \nto Silk Road countries seeking WTO accession, providing assistance in \nreform as needed. Recognizing that PNTR status, through graduation from \nthe Jackson-Vanik Amendment of 1974 Trade Act, and WTO membership have \nbeen extended to Armenia, Georgia and Kyrgyzstan, the bill calls for \nextending the same status to the other two most advanced economies of \nthe region, Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan, by graduating them from the \nJackson-Vanik Amendment, extending PNTR status and aiding in WTO \naccession. But before that support is offered, it is important for the \ntwo countries to demonstrate that they are capable of dealing with the \ndemands of a vibrant economy in a democratic setting.\n  A detailed examination of this bill will reveal many more \ninitiatives. But as you can see, Mr. President, the Silk Road Strategy \nAct of 2006 takes a comprehensive approach to the region, encompassing \nsecurity, economic development, democratic governance and human rights. \nI believe it targets the key issues that U.S. policymakers must address \nin our ever more important effort to establish solid, long-lasting \nrelationships with the countries of the Silk Road. I hope my colleagues \nwill support this bill and I look forward to discussing it with them.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DeMINT:\n  S. 2750. A bill to improve access to emergency medical services \nthrough medical liability reform and additional Medicare payments; to \nthe Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I rise to introduce legislation to \nstrengthen our nation's emergency departments, which are the backbone \nof our health care safety net.\n  Events of recent years--9/11, Hurricanes Katrina and Rita--have \nallowed all of us to see our emergency departments in action, 24 hours \na day, 7 days a week. With every natural disaster or terrorist attack, \nemergency physicians, on-call specialists and nurses are on the front \nlines. Many times, it's their expertise that recognizes a problem. For \nexample, it was the diagnosis and prompt communication of the incidence \nof anthrax that prevented more deaths a couple years ago here in D.C. \nLikewise, should we face pandemic influenza, it is likely to be \ndiscovered first in our emergency rooms.\n  Federal law requires that each person who comes to an emergency \ndepartment be stabilized. Yet health plans are paying less and less of \nthis cost, and many of the 45 million patients without health insurance \ncan't pay at all. In fact, more than one-third of all emergency \ndepartment patients are uninsured or are Medicaid or SCHIP enrollees. \nThis results in huge amounts of uncompensated care in our nation's \nemergency departments, which threatens their viability and everyone's \naccess to emergency care.\n  Unfortunately, America's emergency patients are suffering because \nemergency departments are not supported well enough to handle day-to-\nday emergencies, let alone a pandemic flu or terrorist attack. Patients \nwait hours to see physicians, ``boarding'' sometimes for days in \nemergency departments and diverted in ambulances to other hospitals. \nThis gridlock threatens access to emergency care for everyone--both \ninsured and uninsured.\n  Emergency departments are under-funded and suffer from severe \nstaffing shortages. A new study just released by the Robert Wood \nJohnson Foundation and the American College of Emergency Physicians \nfound that three-fourths of emergency medical directors reported \ninadequate on-call specialist coverage, compared with two-thirds in \n2004: a sure sign that a bad situation is getting even worse.\n  Frivolous lawsuits and the nation's broken medical liability system \nare also driving up the costs of health care for everyone and threaten \nto leave already disadvantaged patients without access to necessary \nhealth care services.\n  But, even in the best of times, the number of visits to emergency \ndepartments continue to increase, while the number of emergency \ndepartments in hospitals continue to decrease. In fact, we've even seen \na number of emergency departments have to close their doors.\n  Surprisingly, there are no standard measures to report the extent of \novercrowding in emergency departments. During the last Congress, the \nGovernment Accountability Office (GAO) surveyed hospital emergency \ndepartments and reported back to Congress--providing us with the data \nneeded to begin to address these issues.\n  The GAO report told Congress that patient ``boarding'' in the \nemergency department was the most common factor associated with \novercrowding. The term ``boarding'' refers to those patients who have \nbeen admitted to the hospital but have not yet been moved from the \nemergency department to an inpatient hospital bed. When these patients \nremain in the emergency department long after the decision to admit \nthem is made (at times on gurneys in halls and elsewhere)--it \ndiminishes the space to care for other patients, and adversely impacts \nthe staff and other resources.\n  My bill requires Medicare to establish regulations to reduce or \neliminate overcrowding and boarding of emergency department patients. \nWe have the data to recognize this problem. Hopefully, national \nstandards coupled with incentive payments for those hospitals \nimplementing the standards and documenting improvement will improve the \nquality of care in this country.\n  My legislation, the ``Access to Emergency Medical Services Act,'' \ndirectly addresses the issues of low reimbursement, emergency \ndepartment overcrowding, and increasing medical liability insurance \ncosts.\n  First, my bill expands the current liability protection granted to \ncommissioned officers and employees of the Public Health Service to \ninclude Medicare participating hospitals or emergency departments \nsubject to the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA). This \nwould also cover physicians and physician groups employed by, under \ncontract, or on-call for duty to stabilize an individual with an \nemergency medical condition. This safeguard does not prevent someone \nfrom taking legal action. Rather, the bill requires that any tort or \nmedical liability case must be brought against the United States, which \nin turn must defend any civil action or proceeding. Awards for \nmalpractice judgments would be paid from a specific fund established \nfor this purpose.\n  Second, my bill increases physician payments by 10% for services \nprovided to Medicare beneficiaries in the emergency department of a \nhospital or critical access hospital. EMTALA is an unfunded federal \nmandate. Current law does not require health insurance companies, \ngovernments or individuals to pay for services that have been provided. \nAs a result, emergency physicians bear the brunt of uncompensated care. \nThis increased reimbursement recognizes and funds this mandate, and I \nhope it will go a long way toward improving physician recruitment and \nretention.\n  Finally, my bill provides financial incentive payments to hospitals \nthat meet standards for prompt admissions of emergency department \npatients requiring inpatient hospital services. The bill would increase \npayments to these hospitals by 10 percent for Medicare beneficiaries' \nemergency department visits. The payments would be made only if the \nhospital certifies, subject to audit, that it met the standards for \nprompt admission.\n  The issues addressed by my bill impact each one of us. When you, or a \nfamily member, need the emergency room, you don't want to worry about \nit being crowded, closed, under-funded, or not having the staff it \nneeds.\n  Emergency physicians, nurses and on-call specialists are the heroes \nin America's hospitals, working under incredibly difficult conditions \non patients who need critical attention. Congress needs to step up and \ntake action. The ``Access to Emergency Medical Services Act'' is an \nimportant first step to address these issues.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. NELSON of Nebraska (for himself and Mr. Domenici):\n  S. 2751. A bill to strengthen the National Oceanic and Atmospheric \nAdministration's drought monitoring and forecasting capabilities; to \nthe Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce \nlegislation that would establish the ``National Integrated Drought \nInformation System'' (NIDIS) within the National\n\n[[Page S4074]]\n\nOceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) for purposes of improving \ndrought monitoring and forecasting capabilities.\n  Over the last decade, several severe and long-term droughts have \noccurred in the United States. Recent severe drought conditions across \nthe Nation and in particular in the West have created life-threatening \nsituations, as well as financial burdens for both government and \nindividuals.\n  Extremely dry conditions have led to numerous forest and rangeland \nfires, burning hundreds of thousands of acres of land, destroying homes \nand communities, and eliminating critical habitats for wildlife and \ngrazing lands for livestock. The subsequent ash and sediment loading \nthreatens the health of our streams. In addition to the millions of \nboard-feet of timber lost, these fires have cost hundreds of millions \nof dollars to fight and have put thousands of lives at risk.\n  The droughts have caused shortages of grain and other agricultural \nproducts resulting in soaring prices that will be passed on to \nconsumers. In addition, deteriorating soil conditions and lack of \nforage are devastating the farm and ranching communities. The droughts \nhave negatively affected livestock market prices and caused the \npremature selloffs of herds.\n  The droughts have threatened municipal water supplies, causing many \ncommunities to develop new water management plans which institute water \nrestrictions and other water conservation measures. Drought causes \nsocial, economic and environmental consequences including negative \neffects on commerce and industry, tourism, air, water and other natural \nresources, and quality of life for our citizens, ranging from limits on \nrecreational opportunities to loss of employment.\n  The fiscal impacts of drought on individuals and governments are \nsignificant. According to NOAA, the federal government spends on \naverage $6-8 billion per year on drought. The most devastating of these \nwas the 1988 drought in the central and eastern U.S. which caused \nsevere losses to agriculture and related industries totaling $40 \nbillion and an estimated 5,000-10,000 deaths.\n  The issue of drought is one I have been involved with for many years. \nFortunately, drought conditions are improving in Nebraska, but we have \nendured a number of very difficult years struggling with the impact \ndrought has had on our economy and environment and the social \nimplications that go along with a disaster like this.\n  One of my biggest frustrations the past few years as an elected \nofficial, trying to help the areas of my State devastated by drought, \nhas been making people understand that this drought really was a \ndisaster--as much as a hurricane, or an earthquake, or a tornado.\n  I even named the drought in Nebraska--Drought David--in an effort to \ncrystallize it so people could see that it is the same kind of \nexperience as any other natural disaster.\n  Unlike other natural disasters, however, droughts are much more \ndifficult to identify. It is hard to miss an oncoming flood or \ntornado--or their immediate aftermath. Drought, and its effects, is \nmuch harder to quantify. It develops slowly; it doesn't necessarily \nhave a beginning point or an ending point but it spans over an extended \nperiod of time.\n  Because it is difficult to forecast and plan for droughts, it is \nespecially important that we have programs in place such as the \nNational Drought Mitigation Center at the University of Nebraska-\nLincoln. The Drought Mitigation Center, among other things, maintains a \nweb-based information clearinghouse, provides drought monitoring, \nprepares the weekly U.S. Drought Monitor which covers all 50 States, \nand develops drought policy and planning techniques. I believe it is \ncrucial to encourage more investment in research programs such as the \nDrought Mitigation Center.\n  The research done upfront in monitoring drought trends will help our \ncapabilities to mitigate and respond to its effects in a much more \neffective manner. It is cost effective to support programs such as the \nNational Drought Mitigation Center and I advocate for continued support \nfor this important program.\n  The National Drought Policy Commission stated in their May 2000 \nreport to Congress that ``Drought is the most obstinate and pernicious \nof the dramatic events that Nature conjures up. It can last longer and \nextend across larger areas than hurricanes, tornadoes, floods and \nearthquakes . . . causing hundreds of millions of dollars in losses, \nand dashing hopes and dreams.'' Among its recommendations to move the \ncountry toward a more proactive approach to drought preparedness and \nresponse, the Commission called for improved ``collaboration among \nscientists and managers to enhance the effectiveness of observation \nnetworks, monitoring, prediction, information delivery, and applied \nresearch and to foster public understanding of and preparedness for \ndrought.''\n  The call for improved drought monitoring and forecasting has also \nbeen advocated by the Western Governors' Association (WGA). In the WGA \npolicy resolution adopted in June 2005, ``Future Management of \nDrought,'' the Governors state that NIDIS ``would provide water users \nacross the board--farmers, ranchers, utilities, tribes, land managers, \nbusiness owners, recreationalists, wildlife managers, and decision-\nmakers at all levels of government--with the ability to assess their \ndrought risk in real time and before the onset of drought, in order to \nmake informed and timely decisions that may mitigate a drought's \nimpacts. The Governors urge Congress and the President to authorize \nNIDIS and provide funding for its implementation.''\n  NIDIS has also become a key component of the multi-national effort to \ncreate the Global Earth Observation System of Systems (GEOSS), a \nmechanism for linking the individual networks of satellites, ocean \nbuoys, weather stations and other instruments scattered across the \nglobe. The U.S. Integrated Earth Observation System (IEOS), the U.S. \ncontribution to GEOSS, has identified NIDIS as one of six ``near-term \nopportunities'' in their Strategic Plan.\n  Finally, the Administration supports this program. Funding for NIDIS \nis included in the President's FY 2007 budget request.\n  The National Integrated Drought Information System Act of 2006 that \nSenator Domenici and I are introducing today would authorize the much \nneeded drought early warning system envisioned by the National Drought \nPolicy Commission, the Western Governors' Association, and the \nIntegrated Earth Observation System. If enacted, this bill will allow \nour Nation to become much more proactive in mitigating and avoiding the \ncostly impacts and contentious conflicts that so often happen today \nwhen water shortages and droughts occur.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2751\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I rise today to join Senator Nelson of \nNebraska to introduce the National Integrated Drought Information \nSystem Act of 2006. I would like to thank Senator Ben Nelson; his \nstrong leadership and hard work on this bill has been key in bringing \nus forward on this important issue.\n  Drought is a unique emergency situation; it creeps in unlike other \nabrupt weather disasters. Without a national drought policy we \nconstantly live not knowing what the next year will bring. \nUnfortunately, when we find ourselves facing a drought, towns often \nscramble to drill new water wells, fires often sweep across bone dry \nforests and farmers and ranchers are forced to watch their way of life \nblow away with the dust. This year, my home State of New Mexico is \nfacing a very real threat of devastating drought, as our snow pack was \nfar below average.\n  We must be vigilant and prepare ourselves for quick action as this \nnext drought cycle begins. Better planning on our part could limit some \nof the damage felt by drought. I submit that this bill is the exact \ntool needed for facilitating better planning.\n  This Act establishes the National Integrated Drought Information \nSystem within the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to \nimprove national drought preparedness, information collection and \nanalysis. This information system collects and integrates information \non key indicators of drought in order to make usable, reliable and \ntimely drought forecasts and assessments. This information will be \ndisseminated to federal, state, tribal and local decision makers in \norder to better prepare them for the effects of drought.\n  The impacts of drought are also very costly. According to NOAA, there \nhave been 12 different drought events since 1980 that resulted in \ndamages and costs exceeding $1 billion each. In 2000, severe drought in \nthe South-Central and Southeastern states caused losses to agriculture \nand related industries of over $4 billion. Western wildfires that year \ntotaled over $2 billion in damages. The Eastern drought in 1999 led to \n$1 billion in losses. These are just a few of the statistics.\n  On April 18, 2006, the Texas Agriculture Experiment Station predicted \na dramatic decrease in water flows and reservoir storage throughout New \nMexico. Early predictions indicate that river water supply will be at \n54 percent due primarily to receiving half our annual snow pack and \nabove average temperatures in my state. Additionally, several of our \nreservoirs are at severely diminished capacity. Specifically, the \nElephant Butte, El Vado and Caballo reservoirs will all be below 10 \npercent of capacity by Labor Day. Several New Mexico communities have \nalready begun to institute water restrictions in preparation for what \nis predicted to be one of the worst years on record. As this drought \npersists, I want to ensure each New Mexican that I am committed to \ndoing everything possible to make sure they have the tools and \ninformation they need to make the best decisions.\n  While drought affects the economic and environmental well-being of \nthe entire nation, the United States has lacked a cohesive strategy for \ndealing with serious drought emergencies. As many of you know, the \nimpact of drought emerges gradually rather than suddenly, as is the \ncase with other natural disasters.\n  I am pleased to be following through on what I started in 1997. The \nbill that we are introducing today is the next step in implementing a \nnational, cohesive drought policy. The bill recognizes that drought is \na recurring phenomenon that causes serious economic and environmental \nloss and that a national drought policy is needed to ensure an \nintegrated, coordinated strategy.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. AKAKA:\n  S. 2753. A bill to require a program to improve the provision of \ncaregiver assistance services for veterans; to the Committee on \nVeterans' Affairs.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise proudly today to introduce \nlegislation that would provide assistance to those who care for our \nNation's veterans. These caregivers provide a great service to our \ncountry and play a vital role in providing non-institutional long-term \nhealth care for veterans.\n  There is deep concern regarding the anticipated number of veterans \nthat will need long-term care by the year 2010. In 2005, there were \nalmost one million veterans age 85 and over, and by 2010, it is \nanticipated that the number of veterans in this age category will grow \nto 1.3 million. The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) will be faced \nwith a crisis related to the demand for care of this population, and we \nmust help VA prepare for this situation.\n  VA has been disturbingly inactive in instituting the long-term care \nprovisions of the 1999 Millennium Health Care Act. The General \nAccounting Office has been the most critical, citing major \ninconsistencies across the VA system in the implementation of non-\ninstitutional care. During the Committee on Veterans' Affairs' \noversight work in Hawaii, we found that the Kauai clinic lacked a home \ncare specialist and the Maui clinic was arbitrarily limiting non-\ninstitutional care. Caregivers are crucial in bridging these gaps in \nnon-institutional long-term care services.\n  With more veterans returning from combat with severely debilitating \ninjuries, young spouses and parents have been forced to take on an \nunexpected role as caregivers. Many have interrupted their own careers \nto dedicate time and attention to the care and rehabilitation of loved \nones. These caregivers do not plan for this to happen and are not \nprepared mentally or financially for their new role. Therefore, we must \nprotect, educate, and lend a helping hand to the caregivers who take on \nthe responsibility and costly burden of caring for veterans, both young \nand old.\n  This legislation serves to provide comprehensive assistance to these \ncaregivers. By providing such services as respite care, caregivers can \nhave time to run errands and attend to their own health concerns. They \ncan rest easier knowing that there is someone there to care for their \ndisabled veteran while they are out. Another service provided through \nthis legislation is adult-day care for veterans. This serves a dual \npurpose in that it provides short-term supervision and also gives \nveterans a place to go for some camaraderie.\n  The last years of a veteran's life can be difficult for both the \nveteran and for the caregiver. This legislation would also provide \nhospice services so that this period is one of peace and comfort.\n  Other services that would support caregivers under this legislation \ninclude education, training, transportation services, readjustment \nservices, rehabilitation services, home care services, and any other \nnew and innovative modalities of non-institutional long-term care.\n  I cannot try to quantify the invaluable service that caregivers \nprovide.\n\n[[Page S4076]]\n\nWhat can be done is to make funds available to carry out programs to \nassist them. The legislation authorizes $10 million to be allocated to \nindividual medical facilities within VA, especially to those in rural \nareas without a long-term care facility, based upon the proposals \nsubmitted by the facilities. In efforts to evaluate the improvements \nmade in caregiver assistance services, a report shall be submitted to \nCongress by the Secretary no later than a year after enactment of this \nbill. The report should include information on the allocation of funds \nto facilities and a description of the improvements made with the \nfunds.\n  Let us meet these caregivers halfway by giving them the assistance \nthey need to care for the veterans that depend on them. I ask my \ncolleagues to join me in supporting this effort.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2753\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. IMPROVEMENT OF SERVICES FOR CAREGIVERS OF \n                   VETERANS.\n\n       (a) In General.--The Secretary of Veterans Affairs shall \n     carry out a program to expand and improve the services that \n     assist caregivers of veterans, including veterans of the \n     Global War on Terrorism.\n       (b) Caregiver Assistance Services.--For purposes of this \n     section, the term ``caregiver assistance services'' includes \n     the following:\n       (1) Adult-day health care services.\n       (2) Coordination of services needed by veterans, including \n     services for readjustment and rehabilitation.\n       (3) Transportation services.\n       (4) Caregiver support services, including education, \n     training, and certification of family members in caregiver \n     activities.\n       (5) Home care services.\n       (6) Respite care.\n       (7) Hospice services.\n       (8) Any modalities of non-institutional long-term care.\n       (c) Funding.--\n       (1) Source of funds.--In carrying out the program required \n     by subsection (a), the Secretary shall identify, from funds \n     available to the Department of Veterans Affairs for medical \n     care, an amount not less than $10,000,000 to be available to \n     carry out the program and to be allocated to facilities of \n     the Department pursuant to subsection (d).\n       (2) Minimum allocation of funds.--In identifying available \n     amounts pursuant to paragraph (1), the Secretary shall ensure \n     that, after the allocation of funds under subsection (d), the \n     total expenditure for programs in support of caregiver \n     assistance services for veterans is not less than $10,000,000 \n     in excess of the baseline amount.\n       (3) Baseline amount.--For purposes of paragraph (2), the \n     baseline amount is the amount of the total expenditures on \n     programs in support of caregiver assistance services for \n     veterans for the most recent fiscal year for which final \n     expenditure amounts are known, adjusted to reflect any \n     subsequent increase in applicable costs to support such \n     services through the Veterans Health Administration.\n       (d) Allocation of Funds to Facilities.--The Secretary shall \n     allocate funds identified pursuant to subsection (c)(1) to \n     individual medical facilities of the Department in such \n     amounts as the Secretary determines appropriate based upon \n     proposals submitted by such facilities for the use of such \n     funds for improvements to the support of the provision of \n     caregiver assistance services for veterans. Special \n     consideration should be given to rural facilities, including \n     those without a long-term care facility of the Department.\n       (e) Report.--Not later than one year after the date of the \n     enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall submit to the \n     Committee on Veterans' Affairs of the Senate and the \n     Committee on Veterans' Affairs of the House of \n     Representatives a report on the implementation of this \n     section. The report shall include information on the \n     allocation of funds to facilities of the Department under \n     subsection (d) and a description of the improvements made \n     with funds so allocated to the support of the provision of \n     caregiver assistance services for veterans.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/04/senate-section/article/S4076-1", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4076]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 465--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE WITH RESPECT \n    TO CHILDHOOD STROKE AND DESIGNATING MAY 6, 2006, AS ``NATIONAL \n                    CHILDHOOD STROKE AWARENESS DAY''\n\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS (for himself and Mr. Frist) submitted the following \nresolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S.

Mr. President, I rise today to submit a Senate \nresolution concerning Channel Islands National Park, with Senator Boxer \nas an original cosponsor.\n  We firmly believe that Channel Islands National Park, including Santa \nRosa Island, should continue to be administered by the National Park \nService in accordance with the laws, regulations, and policies of the \nNational Park Service, including the National Park Service Organic Act.\n  Channel Islands National Monument was designated in 1938 by President \nFranklin D. Roosevelt under the authority of the Antiquities Act.\n  The monument was expanded to include additional islands and \nredesignated as Channel Islands National Park in 1980 in order to \nprotect the nationally significant natural, scenic, wildlife, marine, \necological, archaeological, cultural, and scientific values of the \nChannel Islands in California.\n  Santa Rosa Island was acquired by the United States in 1986 for \napproximately $30 million for the purpose of restoring its native \necology and making the island available to the public for recreational \nuses. The previous owners of the Island retained only an agreement for \nthe non-commercial use and occupancy of a 7.6-acre parcel of land \nthrough 2011.\n  The non-native elk and deer population are to be removed from the \npark by 2011 under a court-approved settlement and the Island restored \nto management consistent with other national parks.\n  We introduce this resolution to express our concern with a provision \nthat the House Armed Services Committee has included in the House \nversion of the Defense authorization bill.\n  The provision would prohibit the Park Service from carrying out the \ncourt-approved settlement's direction to remove the population of non-\nnative deer and elk.\n  To the contrary, we believe that Congress should not direct the \nNational Park Service to manage Santa Rosa Island in a manner that \nwould result in the public being denied access to significant portions \nof the Island for any substantial period of time.\n  If the Park Service is unable to manage the non-native deer and elk \npopulation, the population will likely be managed through the present \npractice of privately organized hunting editions that currently require \nthe closure of about 90 percent of the Island to the general public for \n4-5 months out of the year. The national parks belong to the American \npeople, and the parks should remain freely open to the people.\n  We also believe that Congressional direction for Santa Rosa Island \nshould not be inconsistent with the requirement to protect and enhance \nnative park resources, including threatened and endangered species.\n  There are 11 endangered or threatened plant and animal species on the \nIsland, many of which would be harmed by the proposal.\n  In particular, the bald eagle is at risk from eating carcasses \ncontaining lead bullets used by the hunters; the Santa Rosa Island fox \nis preyed upon by golden eagles attracted by fawns and other deer; and \nthe Island's endangered plants are threatened by the deer and elk.\n  In addition, there are substantial archaeological resources on the \nIsland\n\n[[Page S4078]]\n\nwhich could be at risk, including potentially the oldest discovered \nhuman remains in North America, 13,000 years old, and remains of the \nrare pygmy mammoth.\n  In summary, we believe that the National Park Service should manage \nSanta Rosa Island to ensure that the Island's natural, scenic, and \ncultural resources are properly protected, restored, and interpreted \nfor the public, and that park visitors are provided with a safe and \nenjoyable park experience.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this Senate resolution.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/04/senate-section/article/S4078-1", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4078]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 3860.

I ask unanimous consent the committee-reported amendment \nbe agreed to, the bill as amended be read a third time and passed, the \nmotion to reconsider be laid upon the table and any statements be \nprinted in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The committee amendment in the nature of a substitute was agreed to.\n  The bill (S. 1086), as amended, was read the third time, and passed.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, S. 1086, which we just passed, is the Sex \nOffender Registration and Notification Act. I do want to take a few \nmoments to comment because this is an important piece of legislation. \nThe House has passed companion legislation already in the past, but the \nfact that we have passed this bill tonight means we will dramatically \nimpact the lives of hundreds, indeed thousands, of victims and \npotential victims of sexual predators.\n  This has been remarkable to me. I followed a Dateline series, ``To \nCatch A Predator,'' over the last several weeks and months, but it was \n2 nights ago that my legislative director and my counsel e-mailed me, \nor BlackBerried me, at 9 o'clock at night and said that in a few \nminutes another episode of ``To Catch A Predator'' is coming on and I \nturned it on. Once again I saw the devastation that occurs today, which \ncannot be totally prevented but we know can be prevented by arming the \nAmerican people with the tools that can help catch these predators and, \nonce they are caught, making sure they are kept away from children, \nthat children are kept out of their reach. I think we have all been \nmoved by this excellent investigative type of reporting that has \ndemonstrated, in shocking terms, today how vulnerable our children are \nto sexual predators, much of that originating and facilitated by the \nuse of the Internet, at times when our children simply do not have that \nsupervision there, minute by minute. The sexual predators reach into \ntheir lives, taking advantage of them, as vulnerable as they might be, \nand then literally ruining their lives.\n  This evening I am proud of what we have done. This body passed the \nSex Offender Registry and Notification Act. It has been a long time. \nSeveral weeks ago on the floor I tried to get unanimous consent from \nthe other side to agree to go to the bill unattached to other types of \namendments unrelated to the registry itself, unrelated to these sexual \npredators. There was objection. We have been able to overcome, in the \nbest spirit of this body, working together, those objections and pass \nthis bill.\n  Among its many provisions--let me comment on three--it creates a \nNational Sex Offender Registry that is accessible on the Internet and \nsearchable by ZIP Code. For the first time you will be able to go on \nthe Internet or have somebody in your family go on the Internet, put in \na ZIP Code or surrounding ZIP Code, and you will know whether any sex \noffenders who might be in your neighborhood are actually in your \nneighborhood. For the first time you will be able to be armed with that \ninformation.\n  Second, it requires convicted sex offenders to register, including \nchild predators who use the Internet to commit a crime against a minor. \nThat registration is required. If you have been into the legal system \nand you have been labeled, appropriately so, a sex offender, you are \ngoing to go into this registry.\n\n[[Page S4090]]\n\n  Third, it toughens criminal penalties for violent crimes against \nchildren under 12 years of age.\n  Just by creating a national registry we are going to make it easier \nfor law enforcement to act on that tip and to identify and intercept \nsex offenders before they can commit those repeat crimes and victimize \nmore children.\n  From the episode I saw two nights ago it was very apparent that one \nof the criminals--maybe it was more, but the second one I saw--was \nsomebody who had been convicted before and was just about ready to go \nto jail but, once again, in that period before going to jail slipped \nout to commit another crime.\n  Currently, there are over 100,000 missing sex offenders who have \nfailed to register under current State laws. This bill will enhance the \npenalty for failure to register from a Federal misdemeanor to a Federal \nfelony. I am proud the Senate is acting to protect our Nation's most \nvaluable resource--our children.\n  I close by thanking those people who are recognizable in the sense \nthat they have been fighting for this legislation for such a long time; \nnamely, our distinguished colleague from Utah, Senator Orrin Hatch, \nwhose bill this is, who has been on the issue, has helped educate all \nof us on both sides of the aisle, who has fought for this piece of \nlegislation, who has encouraged me to keep fighting for this \nlegislation in spite of others' attempts to attach unrelated \namendments, and indeed because of his persistence, again, thousands of \nyoung kids will be safer in the future.\n  Also, there is someone I have gotten to know personally, but the \nAmerican people know in large part because of his very effective voice \non television, and that is John Walsh. John Walsh, who runs the \nNational Center for Missing and Exploited Children, is commenting \nconstantly and staying on this issue, having suffered a real tragedy \nwith his own child in the past.\n  On ``Dateline NBC,'' the producer, who has done a tremendous job, \nChris Hansen, has been the face and voice in heading this show, ``To \nCatch a Predator.''\n  The list could go on and on, but I know we have to keep moving on \nwith tonight's business. This is such a huge success for the American \npeople and for families. I appreciate my colleagues coming together to \npass this bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/04/senate-section/article/S4090-1", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4090]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                NATIONAL CHILDHOOD STROKE AWARENESS DAY\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the consideration of S. Res. 465, which was submitted \nearlier today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 465) expressing the sense of the \n     Senate with respect to childhood stroke and designating May \n     6, 2006, as ``National Childhood Stroke Awareness Day.''\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I rise today to raise awareness about \nchildhood stroke. Very little is known about the cause, treatment, and \nprevention of childhood stroke. Only through medical research can \neffective treatment and prevention strategies for childhood stroke be \nidentified and developed. The earlier that we are able to diagnose and \nbegin treatment for victims of childhood stroke, the better the chances \nare for recovery and a reoccurrence is less likely to happen.\n  The need for awareness on this issue was brought to my attention by a \nyoung man from Norcross, GA, Alan Blinder. In January of 2006, Alan was \nhaving a normal day at school, as any sophomore in high school would. \nAs he was sitting in his fourth period Algebra class, the entire left \nside of his body went numb and he was unable to speak. Alan was \nescorted to the school nurse and she sent him home. That evening Alan's \nmother explained her son's situation to a friend who suggested the \nincident could have been a pediatric stroke. After seeing a physician, \nAlan learned that he had suffered a transient ischemic attack, or a \nmini stroke. These attacks can be ominous warning signs for potential \nfuture strokes. While Alan was able to receive a diagnosis from a \nspecialist, there are thousands of children, adolescents, and parents \nwho do not know the signs of this life threatening episode that leaves \nmany individuals impaired. Alan was very lucky and I am happy to report \nthat he is doing well. Alan is a smart young man who has a very bright \nfuture ahead of him.\n  Each year a stroke occurs in 20 out of every 100,000 newborns. Almost \n3 out of every 106,000 children experience a stroke before the day they \nare born. Of these children who experience a stroke, 12 percent will \nlose their lives as a result. Over half of the children who have a \npediatric stroke will have serious, long-term neurological \ndisabilities, including seizures, speech and vision problems, and \nlearning disabilities. The result of a pediatric stroke may require \nongoing physical therapy and surgeries for years and into their young \nadulthood. The permanent health concerns and treatments resulting from \nchildhood stroke can result in a heavy financial and emotional burden \non both the child and the family.\n  It is my hope that greater awareness of the symptoms of childhood \nstroke, I introduce legislation to designate May 6, 2006, as Childhood \nStroke Awareness Day. I urge the people of the United States to support \nefforts, programs, services, and advocacy of the American Heart \nAssociation to enhance public awareness of childhood stroke.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the resolution \nbe agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, and the motion to reconsider \nbe laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 465) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 465\n\n       Whereas a stroke, also known as a ``cerebrovascular \n     accident'', is an acute neurologic injury that occurs when \n     the blood supply to a part of the brain is interrupted by--\n       (1) a clot in the artery; or\n       (2) a burst of the artery;\n       Whereas a stroke is a medical emergency that can cause \n     permanent neurologic damage or even death if not promptly \n     diagnosed and treated;\n       Whereas 26 out of every 100,000 newborns and almost 3 out \n     of every 100,000 children have a stroke each year;\n       Whereas an individual can have a stroke before birth;\n       Whereas stroke is among the top 10 causes of death for \n     children in the United States;\n       Whereas 12 percent of all children who experience a stroke \n     die as a result;\n       Whereas the death rate for children who experience a stroke \n     before the age of 1 year is the highest out of all age \n     groups;\n       Whereas many children who experience a stroke will suffer \n     serious, long-term neurological disabilities, including--\n       (1) hemiplegia, which is paralysis of 1 side of the body;\n       (2) seizures;\n       (3) speech and vision problems; and\n       (4) learning difficulties;\n       Whereas those disabilities may require ongoing physical \n     therapy and surgeries;\n       Whereas the permanent health concerns and treatments \n     resulting from strokes that occur during childhood and young \n     adulthood have a considerable impact on children, families, \n     and society;\n       Whereas very little is known about the cause, treatment, \n     and prevention of childhood stroke;\n       Whereas medical research is the only means by which the \n     citizens of the United States can identify and develop \n     effective treatment and preventio9n strategies for childhood \n     stroke; and\n       Whereas early diagnosis and treatment of childhood stroke \n     greatly improves the chances that the affected child will \n     recover and not experience a recurrence: Now, therefore, be \n     it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates May 6, 2006, as ``National Childhood Stroke \n     Awareness Day''; and\n       (2) urges the people of the United States to support the \n     efforts, programs, services, and advocacy of organizations \n     that work to enhance public awareness of childhood stroke, \n     including--\n       (A) the Children's Hemiplegia and Stroke Association;\n       (B) the American Stroke Association, a division of the \n     American Heart Association; and\n       (C) the National Stroke Association.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/04/senate-section/article/S4090-2", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4090-S4091]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     NEGRO LEAGUERS RECOGNITION DAY\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of S. Res. 466, submitted \nearlier today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n\n[[Page S4091]]\n\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 466) designating May 20, 2006, as \n     ``Negro Leaguers Recognition Day.''\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I, along with Senators Talent \nand DeWine, have proudly introduced a resolution recognizing May 20, \n2006, as ``Negro Leaguers Recognition Day.''\n  Since 1885, long before Major League Baseball was integrated in 1947, \nAfrican Americans were organizing their own professional leagues. These \nleagues did not succeed because of racial prejudice and lack of \nadequate financial backing. However, this changed dramatically with the \ninception of the first successful Negro league. On May 20, 1920, the \nNegro National League played its first game. Its creation was the \nresult of the efforts of an African American player and manager named \nAndrew ``Rube'' Foster. Mr. Foster's success inspired the formation of \nother leagues.\n  As a result, on October 3, 1924, the first Negro League World Series \ngame was played between the Kansas City Monarchs of the Negro National \nLeague and Hilldale of Philadelphia of the Eastern Colored League. This \nhistoric and exhaustive first series lasted ten games, covered a span \nof almost three weeks, and was played in four different cities. In the \nend, Kansas City claimed the championship.\n  But the lasting legacy of the Negro leagues, as the six separate \nleagues between 1920 and 1960 are collectively known, are the \ntremendous baseball players they produced. Some of the names we know \nand some we don't. Among them is Jackie Robinson, the first African \nAmerican to break the baseball color barrier; Leroy ``Satchel'' Paige, \nwho was considered one of the greatest pitchers of all time; Josh \nGibson, who was a prolific home-run hitter; Larry Doby, the first \nAfrican American to play in the American League in July 1947; and John \nJordan ``Buck'' O'Neil, who was the first African American coach in the \nMajor Leagues and who is now head of the Negro Leagues Baseball Museum.\n  It is important that we remember and honor these players. In breaking \ndown the baseball color barrier, these pioneers dealt a blow to hatred \nand prejudice across America. Today, we can honor them by declaring May \n20, 2006 as, ``Negro Leaguers Recognition Day.''\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the resolution \nbe agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, the motion to reconsider be \nlaid upon the table, and that any statements relating thereto be \nprinted in the Record without intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 466) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 466\n\n       Whereas even though African Americans were excluded from \n     playing in the major leagues of their time with their white \n     counterparts, the desire of many African Americans to play \n     baseball could not be repressed;\n       Whereas Major League Baseball did not fully integrate its \n     league until July 1959;\n       Whereas African Americans began organizing their own \n     professional baseball teams in 1885;\n       Whereas the skills and abilities of Negro League players \n     eventually made Major League Baseball realize the need to \n     integrate the sport;\n       Whereas six separate baseball leagues, known collectively \n     as the ``Negro Baseball Leagues'', were organized by African \n     Americans between 1920 and 1960;\n       Whereas the Negro Baseball Leagues included exceptionally \n     talented players who played the game at its highest level;\n       Whereas on May 20, 1920, the Negro National League, the \n     first successful Negro League, played its first game;\n       Whereas Andrew ``Rube'' Foster, on February 13, 1920, at \n     the Paseo YMCA in Kansas City, Missouri, founded the Negro \n     National League and also managed and played for the Chicago \n     American Giants, and later was inducted into the Baseball \n     Hall of Fame;\n       Whereas Leroy ``Satchel'' Paige, who began his long career \n     in the Negro Leagues and did not make his Major League debut \n     until the age of 42, is considered one of the greatest \n     pitchers the game has ever seen, and during his long career \n     thrilled millions of baseball fans with his skill and \n     legendary showboating, and was later inducted into the \n     Baseball Hall of Fame;\n       Whereas Josh Gibson, who was the greatest slugger of the \n     Negro Leagues, tragically died months before the integration \n     of baseball, and was later inducted into the Baseball Hall of \n     Fame;\n       Whereas Jackie Robinson, whose career began with the Negro \n     League Kansas City Monarchs, became the first African \n     American to play in the Major Leagues in April 1947, was \n     named Major League Baseball Rookie of the Year in 1947, \n     subsequently led the Brooklyn Dodgers to 6 National League \n     pennants and a World Series championship, and was later \n     inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame;\n       Whereas Larry Doby, whose career began with the Negro \n     League Newark Eagles, became the first African American to \n     play in the American League in July 1947, was an All-Star 9 \n     times in Negro League and Major League Baseball, and was \n     later inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame;\n       Whereas John Jordan ``Buck'' O'Neil was a player and \n     manager of the Negro League Kansas City Monarchs, became the \n     first African American coach in the Major Leagues with the \n     Chicago Cubs in 1962, served on the Veterans Committee of the \n     National Baseball Hall of Fame, chairs the Negro Leagues \n     Baseball Museum Board of Directors, and has worked tirelessly \n     to promote the history of the Negro Leagues; and\n       Whereas by achieving success on the baseball field, African \n     American baseball players helped break down color barriers \n     and integrate African Americans into all aspects of society \n     in the United States: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates May 20, 2006, as ``Negro Leaguers \n     Recognition Day''; and\n       (2) recognizes the teams and players of the Negro Baseball \n     Leagues for their achievements, dedication, sacrifices, and \n     contributions to both baseball and our Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/04/senate-section/article/S4091-1", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4091-S4092]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          HONORING THE CONTRIBUTION OF CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST\n\n  Mr. FRIST.

Mr. President, I am pleased to support passage of H.J. \nRes. 83, which authorizes funds for a bust to be placed in the Supreme \nCourt honoring the late Chief Justice Rehnquist. Chief Justice \nRehnquist served admirably on the country's highest court for 33 \nyears--19 as Chief Justice. It is appropriate that we honor his service \nas we have the other Chief Justices with a bust in the Supreme Court \nbuilding.\n  I was privileged to have known the Chief Justice for many years and \nto have had the pleasure of serving with him on the Smithsonian Board \nof Regents. We also shared a love for the beautiful land and the \nindependent people of Vermont--a place that served as a special refuge \nfor the Chief Justice and his family over the years. His courage and \ncommitment were without question, particularly recently when he \nattended the last inauguration and continued work to the end.\n  It would also be fitting in my view to honor other important figures \nin the Supreme Court's history. Justices Sandra Day O'Connor and \nThurgood Marshall broke barriers and became the first woman and first \nAfrican American justices on the Supreme Court in our Nation's long \nhistory. Both are role models not only for women and African Americans \nwho will follow them on the Supreme Court, but for judges everywhere \nand all Americans.

Chief Justice \nRehnquist served admirably on the country's highest court for 33 \nyears--19 as Chief Justice. It is appropriate that we honor his service \nas we have the other Chief Justices with a bust in the Supreme Court \nbuilding.\n  I was privileged to have known the Chief Justice for many years and \nto have had the pleasure of serving with him on the Smithsonian Board \nof Regents. We also shared a love for the beautiful land and the \nindependent people of Vermont--a place that served as a special refuge \nfor the Chief Justice and his family over the years. His courage and \ncommitment were without question, particularly recently when he \nattended the last inauguration and continued work to the end.\n  It would also be fitting in my view to honor other important figures \nin the Supreme Court's history. Justices Sandra Day O'Connor and \nThurgood Marshall broke barriers and became the first woman and first \nAfrican American justices on the Supreme Court in our Nation's long \nhistory. Both are role models not only for women and African Americans \nwho will follow them on the Supreme Court, but for judges everywhere \nand all Americans. It would be appropriate to honor their significant \naccomplishments and contributions to the law, to the Supreme Court and \nto the country by including them among those honored at the Supreme \nCourt building.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the joint \nresolution be read a third time and passed, the preamble be agreed to, \nthe motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, and any statements \nrelated to the resolution be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The joint resolution (H.J. Res. 83) was read the third time and \npassed.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n\n[[Page S4092]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/04/senate-section/article/S4092-1", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4092]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\nAUTHORIZING USE OF CAPITOL GROUNDS FOR SPECIAL OLYMPICS LAW ENFORCEMENT \n                               TORCH RUN\n\n  Mr. FRIST.

Tomorrow, the Senate will continue to discuss medical \nliability and small business health plans. Tomorrow, it will be \nnecessary to file cloture motions on the motions to proceed to these \nbills. Senators can expect two votes Monday afternoon at approximately \n5:15. These votes will be cloture votes to proceed to the two medical \nliability bills. If cloture is not invoked on these bills, we will have \na cloture vote on Tuesday morning on the motion to proceed to the small \nbusiness health plans bill.\n  I am pleased we will be addressing these health care issues which, if \nwe enact this legislation, both the medical liability and the small \nbusiness health plans, will diminish the cost of health care to \neveryone who is listening, to my colleagues and others listening across \nAmerica. There is no question about it, the cost of health care will go \ndown.\n  Secondly, it will improve access to health care. Right now, it is \ncrazy. It is absurd that expectant mothers have to worry about whether \nthey are going to have an obstetrician to deliver their child or there \nare people who have to worry about, if they are in a trauma accident, \nwhether there is going to be somebody at the hospital who can give them \nthe immediate treatment, therapy that can be curative at the time they \narrive. But that is the reality. That is where we are today.\n  If we come together, put partisanship aside and address these bills \non principle, then we can do a lot for the American people in terms of \naffordable health care, assuring access to health care, and raising the \nquality of health care.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/04/senate-section/article/S4092-4", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4092]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 9:30 A.M.
