Mr. President, yesterday the President made clear that he \nwill veto any supplemental spending bill that exceeds the \nadministration's request. I thank and applaud the administration and \nrecognize their determination to stick to true emergency spending. I \nwill support the veto, if necessary, to keep Federal spending under \ncontrol. Families live within their means; so should Washington.\n  The President has taken a strong stance on a necessary, must-pass \npiece of legislation that we know will bolster our national security, \nsupport hurricane recovery, and border security efforts as well. We \nneed to work swiftly and in good faith to meet the President's request, \nbut we need to focus on the necessary spending.\n  The President submitted his request for $92.2 billion in emergency \nspending in late February. The House passed the supplemental in March. \nThis legislation needs to be on the President's desk before Memorial \nDay. We intend to do just that.\n  We need to support our troops who are currently in the field fighting \nto protect us, and we need to support our fellow citizens who are \nworking hard to rebuild and recover their homes and communities on the \ngulf coast. Both are extraordinary responsibilities. We should not in \nany way, with either of these issues, play politics in succeeding on \nthese critical efforts. Nor can we afford to encumber this must-pass \nlegislation with unnecessary amendments. It is always tempting for \npeople to come forward and get their own projects or interests attached \nto these must-pass spending bills. On this bill, we encourage people \nnot to do that.\n  In order to keep within our spending limits, we are encouraging \nSenators who may have legitimate emergency spending requests to find \noffsets for those amendments in order not to drive the overall top line \nof this bill higher and higher.\n  For example, the amendment I cosponsored with Senator Judd Gregg \nincreases emergency spending for border security, but it is offset \nwithin the bill, and I think that is how we should approach issues as \nmuch as possible.\n  Time is limited. We must finish this legislation, I hope within the \nweek, so we can quickly get on to a conference with the House and get \nit to the President for signature. These are emergency funds and the \ntroops need these funds overseas. By pulling together, I am confident \nwe can move this legislation forward and get the critical work of the \nAmerican people done.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/04/26/senate-section/article/S3528-1", "month": "04", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3528]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S3528]]\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, in Nevada, the average price of a gallon of \ngasoline is $2.97. We know it is $3.10 a gallon elsewhere. And in other \nplaces, it is higher than that. That 45-cent increase has caused \ntremendous pain in Nevada and around the rest of the country. The \nprices are going up and up and up. Talk to any Senator about the price \nof gasoline.\n  I watched the evening news last night and they had a segment where \nthey talked about the booming business of pawnshops since the price of \ngas has gone up. It showed people there pawning antique watches. One \nman was pawning a watch he had that was 100 years old, which was his \ngrandfather's. Why? He had no money to get back and forth to work. They \nare also pawning guitars and guns. One man even went in and pawned his \ncar. He got to drive it away, but he gave the title to the pawnshop. \nThat is the price of gasoline as reported on the national news.\n  It is not just Nevada, as indicated in the national news. Talk to any \nSenator; they have similar stories. The average price of gas in \nCalifornia is $3.14. In New York, it is $3.09. Here, in the District of \nColumbia, it is $2.99. In Illinois, it is $2.96. Those are average \nprices. Unfortunately, gas prices are expected to soar and increase at \nleast another quarter by this summer--that is, if nothing goes wrong. \nThere doesn't appear to be any relief in sight.\n  That is especially true if this President and this Republican \nCongress have their way. Yesterday, the President said he had a four-\nway plan. I don't come here to the floor every day just to say things \nabout the President, that I don't agree with him, because there is \nnothing else to talk about. I come here because I believe I have an \nobligation to the people of Nevada and all the people in this country \nto call it the way I see it.\n  We went to the White House yesterday. I thought what the President \ndid in dealing with immigration was significant. I heard myself on the \nmorning news complimenting the President, as I should have. I cannot \ncompliment the President today because he is wrong on this gas \nsituation. What he did with his four-way plan is nothing. Most of it \nhas already been done, thanks to Democratic amendments in the Senate. \nOther parts don't make a dent. For example, he talks about an \ninvestigation. In the bill we passed in Commerce, State, Justice last \nyear, we passed what he says he wants done. It is the law of the land. \nThey are going to report sometime next month on their investigation. \nThe President said he is not going to pump 12 million barrels of oil \nthis summer into our Strategic Petroleum Reserve. Well, two things--\none, we are not buying oil to put in it now. We are not doing that now.\n  We use 21 million barrels of oil every day. Twelve million barrels \nover the summer?\n  So what the President has done is not a serious attempt. What he \nprovided in his speech was not a solution to the energy crisis but \nexactly what you would expect from a President who spent 5\\1/2\\ years \nstanding side by side with big oil in his Oval Office. And next to big \noil is an even bigger oil baron, the Vice President of the United \nStates.\n  America needs a new direction on energy. Our dependency on oil is \nruining our competitiveness, the balance of trade, damaging our \nnational security, and limiting freedom and opportunity. It is time to \nchange. We, the minority, want the American people to guide that \nchange. We have a plan for a better future, and it doesn't involve \nEnron or the former CEO of Exxon.\n  I hope the Republican majority will work with us on this bill to give \nconsumers relief and security to America's long-term energy future.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Illinois is recognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I salute my colleague, the leader on the \nDemocratic side, Senator Reid, for addressing the shortcomings of the \nPresident's message yesterday.\n  People across America get this. They understand that every morning \nwhen they go to fill up their tanks, it is costing them more money than \nthey ever imagined. Senator Reid, from Nevada, has referenced a \nsituation in his State where people are going to pawnshops and taking \nvaluable things they own, trying to come up with enough cash to keep \ngoing.\n  We find in Illinois that we have what are called ``payday loans.'' I \ndon't know if you have it across the country. It is not an industry I \nadmire. It charges some of the highest interest rates to people who \nhave low credit ratings. We find people going into these payday loan \nshops, borrowing against their next paycheck to buy gasoline for their \ncars to go to work. This is obviously a desperate move by people who \nhave nowhere to turn.\n  We hear from the President that he is going to call on the Federal \nTrade Commission to get tough. As Senator Reid said, we already \nincluded that in the last Energy bill in a Democratic amendment offered \nby Senator Stabenow of Michigan. It is in the bill. This is nothing \nnew. To hold back 1 day's investment of oil into the Strategic \nPetroleum Reserve is not going to have a measurable impact on anything.\n  The simple fact is the President has to call the oil company \nexecutives into his office, stare them in the eye, and tell them they \nare destroying the American economy, they are killing jobs in America, \nthey are making farming unprofitable, and they are causing a hardship \nto American families much greater than any tax rebate check sent \nseveral years ago by this administration. Until the President stares \nthem in the eye and tells them he is going to take action against them, \nthey are going to continue to kite their profits at the expense of the \nAmerican workers and businesses.\n  That is why ExxonMobil had the largest profit in the history of \nbusiness in America in a quarter. It showed billions of dollars in \nprofit and then rewarded its retiring CEO for his fine job in running \nup the price of gasoline and gave him a $400 million going-away gift. \nThat is some gold watch, isn't it? Mr. Raymond didn't even have to buy \na Powerball ticket, and he got $400 million. Why? Because we are paying \noutrageous sums for gasoline at the pump. The oil companies blame \neverybody--Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, OPEC--and they have all kinds \nof explanations. But the bottom line is their profits are going through \nthe roof. Every morning in newspapers across America are full-page ads \nsaying: Don't hold against us that we are profitable; we are going to \ndo good things with the money you are sending us.\n  It doesn't work. They are crippling the economy. There are \nindications on Capitol Hill that the oil industry executives got the \nmessage yesterday.\n  Do you know what the announcement was this morning? The oil company \nexecutives have announced that because of this concern across America \nfor rising gasoline prices, they have gotten the message. They are \ngoing to invest $30 million in buying more lobbyists in Washington, DC. \nThat's right. The Hill newspaper this morning reports that the American \npetroleum industry has decided they are going to buy $30 million worth \nof lobbyists to roam and crawl through the Halls on Capitol Hill to \nfind their friends and to tell them this really isn't a problem.\n  You know what. Unfortunately, they may be successful. Just yesterday, \nin the reconciliation bill, the House Republicans decided they did not \nwant to have taxes imposed on the oil companies. They want to take \nthese taxes off the oil companies. Why would you do that? The oil \ncompanies have record profits. The money coming back from those profits \nshould be helping America and helping consumers. But with $30 million \nmore worth of lobbyists on Capitol Hill, I am afraid I know how this is \ngoing to end--the special interests will win again, and the consumers \nwill lose.\n  I say to my colleague from Nevada, as we consider the issues that \nface us, we believe--I hope he shares in that belief--that energy is a \ncritical issue. It is important not only to family budgets, it is \nimportant to economic growth in America. And unless and until we have \nthe vision and leadership coming from the White House to stare down \nthese oil company executives and to set an agenda for energy \nindependence in America, it is my fear that we will continue to see \nthese crippling gasoline prices in Nevada and across Illinois.\n\n[[Page S3529]]\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. REID. Every day I get something called ``A Look at Today's \nNews,'' such as immigration and homeland security. But No. 1 on today's \nnews is energy.\n  Is the Senator aware that the L.A. Times headline today reads, \n``Bush's Proposals Viewed as a Drop in the Oil Bucket''? Is the Senator \naware that the Washington Post headline today is, ``GOP Blocks Measures \nBoosting Taxes on Oil Companies' Profits,'' and the New York Daily News \nheadline is, ``Midterm Elections Fuel His''--meaning the President's--\n``Sudden Flip-Flop,'' and the Hill newspaper, about which the Senator \nhas already commented, headline is, ``Oil Industry Prepares $30 Million \nFight Back''? Is the Senator aware of these headlines?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I am aware of that. I know the Democratic leader is also \naware that two of our colleagues came to the floor yesterday and asked \nfor emergency consideration of measures to deal with this right now, \nthings that could make a difference.\n  Senator Menendez of New Jersey came to the floor and asked that we \nhave a tax holiday so that the money can be given back to consumers \nacross America that is being charged them now at the pump.\n  Senator Cantwell of Washington came to the floor and asked for us to \nconsider an antigouging amendment so we can say that if oil companies \nare found guilty of gouging, they will be asked to pay the price in the \ncourts and through the regulatory agencies.\n  The Senator from Nevada realizes that despite the best efforts of our \ncolleagues, both of them were ruled out of order. The obvious question \nis: If we can't consider those measures on this bill, how soon will the \nRepublican leader of the Senate move to legislation that deals with \nthis immediately? The idea that we will get to this in 2, 3, 4, 5 \nmonths is not acceptable where I live. Families I know and businesses I \nknow cannot wait. They expect this Congress to respond.\n  I know the Senator from Nevada realizes within our caucus there will \nbe many other proposals that might deal with this issue. Senator Nelson \nof Florida has come up with a proposal as well to deal with this issue. \nWe had Senator Stabenow come to the floor. Why aren't we dealing with \nthis on an emergency basis? It is truly an emergency across America \nwhen it comes to our economy.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, is the Senator aware that the profits these \nmassive international companies that are controlling the cost of \ngasoline and fuel oil in this country are theirs only? If one goes to \ntheir corner service station or convenience store that pumps gas, does \nthe Senator realize they only make about 4 cents a gallon on each \ngallon of gas, even though the consumer may be paying $3.20 for that \ngallon of gas?\n  This is all a gouge, an obscene gouge by these massive international \ncorporations. Even the people who retail their product make no money. \nIs the Senator aware of that fact?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I am aware of it, and I feel sorry for the \npeople who run these gas stations. One can imagine what their customers \nsay when they come to the counter. They are outraged over the increase \nin gasoline prices, angry over this situation and the impact it is \ngoing to have on their lives. And, of course, they try to take it out \non the first person they see, and that happens to be an innocent \nbystander, the person running the gasoline station.\n\n  What troubles me as well, instead of moving toward energy \nindependence, we have resistance for putting in place facilities so \nthat alternative fuels can be used by consumers across America.\n  Senator Obama of Illinois, my colleague, has introduced legislation \nto put E-85--that means it is a fuel you can use in your car that is 85 \npercent alcohol fuel, 85 percent ethanol, cheaper now than a gallon of \npetroleum-based gasoline. The oil companies have been very slow to put \nthose facilities in the gas stations even across Illinois, the largest \nproducer of ethanol in the Nation.\n  What Senator Obama has pushed for--and I agree--is that we need to \nhave the oil companies opening up opportunities so that consumers can \nat least fight back.\n  If you have a car or a truck that can burn this environmentally \nfriendly and energy-efficient ethanol, then you ought to have an option \nto fill your tank that way. Sadly, they don't. The oil companies have \nbeen very slow and dragging their feet in giving consumers that option. \nWhy? Because they don't make the ethanol and, as a consequence, they \ndon't want to promote a product from which they cannot profit. That day \nis over. We have to move toward alternative fuels.\n  Isn't it amazing that the country of Brazil decided more than 10 \nyears ago they were not going to be held hostage to foreign oil and \nthey would become energy independent. Making that decision with the \nright leadership at the top, they are moving soon to the day where they \ndon't have to worry about foreign dictators pushing them around like \nchumps when it comes to oil supplies.\n  How did they do this? They went to alcohol fuel. They said: We can \nfuel an economy with home-grown energy.\n  We can do the same thing in America. How important is it? Take a look \nat the morning paper, the Washington Post, and you will see a story \nabout Iran. The man who runs this country of Iran is a very strange \nman. He makes pronouncements about the world and history which are \nnothing short of bizarre. Yet he sits on top of 70 million people and \nsome of the largest oil reserves in the world.\n  What did he say about the pressure from the United States to stop him \nfrom building nuclear weapons?\n\n       Other Iranian officials said the Islamic republic would \n     hide its nuclear program and curtail its oil production if \n     foreign governments took harsh actions against Iran for \n     failure to restrict its nuclear activities.\n\n  In most places, this is known as blackmail--blackmail--that the \nleader of Iran would say to us: If you put pressure on us to stop \nbuilding nuclear weapons, we are going to hold back your oil. You think \n$4 a gallon is expensive? How about $5? That is the kind of showdown we \nface because these petro-dollar-based puppet dictators around the world \nhave us over an oil barrel.\n  When are we going to change? When will we find leadership from this \nPresident and this administration to move us to energy independence? \nWhen will we have fuel efficiency for cars and trucks instead of seeing \nit go the wrong way--21 miles a gallon and lower? Why aren't we moving \ntoward the day when it is 35 miles per gallon and more?\n  When I offered an amendment for CAFE standards in the last bill, I \nhad very little support. I didn't even have everybody on my side of the \naisle, to be perfectly honest with you. But I wonder what would happen \nif that amendment came back today. People need to understand we need \nfuel-efficient vehicles, we need alternative fuels, we need \nconservation.\n  To think we signed an energy bill last August creating a national \nenergy policy and have had nothing but energy crises ever since is an \nindication we need to go back to the drawing board. We need to reassess \nwhere we are in this world economy, and we need to understand that the \nfault at the pump is not because of an addiction to oil by consumers. \nThe fault at the pump is because of the greed of oil companies and the \nlack of vision and leadership at the top in our American Government.\n  We need to have a new direction, a significant change in direction if \nwe are going to become energy independent in the near future and if we \nare going to see gasoline prices come down before they cripple the \nAmerican economy.\n  I know of what I speak. If you go to O'Hare Airport, you will find it \nto be the home of United Airlines, now emerging from bankruptcy. It was \na painful process. Workers and retirees gave up a lot to get through \nbankruptcy. And the major reason that airline went into bankruptcy? The \ncost of fuel. Other airlines face the same situation--reducing their \nworkforce, reducing their pay, reducing retirement, reducing health \nbenefits because the price of fuel went up. While they are suffering, \nExxonMobile has record-breaking profits.\n\n  What is wrong with this picture? Where is the fairness? Where is the \nequity? Where is the President? We need\n\n[[Page S3530]]\n\nvoices here that speak to these oil company executives about a new \ncourse of action.\n  Gasoline prices across America are intolerable. We can go through \ncommunity after community, and you can see it when you go home, as I \ndid this last work period, the Easter work period, back in the State of \nIllinois. People understand this one. They understand there is a \nfailure in leadership. If we lament the fact that people don't get up \nand vote and don't seem to care about the state of our Government, it \nis because when they are in trouble, the Government is not there.\n  The simple speech made by the President yesterday is not the answer, \nbut it is the beginning, I hope, of a dialog, a bipartisan dialog to \nmove us in a new direction.\n  I hope the President not only invites the oil company executives in \nto tell them they are destroying the American economy but also invites \npeople from both sides of the aisle in, in a bipartisan dialog, about a \nnew direction. To give a speech on Earth Day about hydrogen-powered \ncars is an interesting, long-term concept. It is certainly not a near-\nterm or medium-term answer to what we are faced with in America.\n  We have to have a new approach and a new direction when it comes to \nour energy. There are ways to do it. Lessening our dependence on \nforeign oil, an amendment offered by Senator Cantwell of Washington to \nthe Energy bill, was rejected on a partisan vote. It said: Why doesn't \nAmerica set a goal of reducing our dependence on foreign oil by at \nleast 50 percent over the next few years? It was rejected on a partisan \nbasis. Everyone on the other side of the aisle voted against it. Why? \nIn my mind, that is the beginning of energy independence and a stronger \nAmerican economy.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Vitter). Who yields time?\n  The Senator from New Mexico is recognized.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Parliamentary inquiry: How much time do we have now?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I have been \ndeeply concerned about our reliance on foreign oil and the rising cost \nof energy for many years. That was one of the reasons I gave up my post \nas chairman of the Budget Committee in the Senate to become chairman of \nthe Energy Committee. I saw energy dependence and rising energy prices \nas a big problem for this great Nation, and I wanted to help solve it.\n  Last year, we passed a bipartisan policy act called the Energy Policy \nAct of 2005. It was the first comprehensive Energy bill in 12 years. It \ntook Republicans and Democrats 5 years and a lot of hard work to get \nthis bill passed. It is an excellent bill and one I am proud of. This \nbill fixed a lot of our energy problems, and in a year or two from now, \nit will fix a lot more. Let me highlight a couple of the remarkable \naccomplishments which our Energy bill has put before the American \npeople.\n  We create a pilot program in seven Western States that will \nstreamline the permitting process so oil and oil developers won't have \nto wait years to develop their leases. Some people wonder: Are we doing \nanything to help America solve our problems? One thing we must do is \ndevelop our resources where we have them and where we can. We cannot \nsit by and be naysayers about developing what we have that we can use, \nso we don't have to buy it from others.\n  In this bill, we require 8 billion gallons of ethanol be included in \nthe gasoline by 2012. This provision will help ethanol displace 2 \nbillion barrels of foreign oil over the next 6 years.\n  There are those on the other side who say the President proposed \nnothing to help the farmers of the United States and the ranching \ncommunity. I just discussed with you what the Energy bill will do with \nreference to ethanol, and all of that creates a new market for the \nproducts of our farmers, makes them wealthy, gives them alternatives to \nsell their product so they can be used to ultimately go into the tanks \nof our automobiles in lieu of crude-oil derivatives called gasoline. We \nprovide several incentives in this bill for new nuclear power that have \nprompted nine utility consortia to plan at least 19 new nuclear \npowerplants in the immediate future. We had zero, we are already moving \ntoward 19, and some think it is 22.\n\n  The bill encourages wind, solar, and geothermal sources. Our \nincentives will bring more than 14,000 megawatts of wind energy that \ncould be on line by the end of next year, which is enough energy to \npower roughly 5 million homes for 1 year. Those are the things we did. \nThose are the things that would have all been front and center had \nKatrina not hit us and taken away all of the positives we were thinking \nof and put us in that tank that came as a result of that enormous \nhurricane which we are still recovering from. But all of the things I \nam discussing are there, actually taking place, as the United States \nchanges because of that new energy bill.\n  The oil and gas prices continued to climb after the Energy bill was \npassed, and a lot of that was due to the hurricane I have described. We \nstill have two refineries that are down because of the storm. That \naccounts for 5 percent of our refining capacity. We have lost about 1.5 \nmillion barrels of oil per day because of damaged oil rigs. That is a \nwhopping 22 percent of our domestic production.\n  So for all of those who wonder: Did anything happen that could have \ncaused the problems we are having that might have been otherwise? \nObviously we can look at Katrina and say something very bad happened. \nWe didn't have to have that. Things could have been better.\n  Let me talk about the global unrest and the rising global demand that \nhas driven up the prices of oil across the globe. Oil is a global \ncommodity. Nobody knows what a barrel of oil is worth as it comes out \nof the ground. Nobody knows what it is inherently worth. Let me say to \nmy fellow Americans, I regret to tell you, it is worth what somebody \nwill pay for it. That sounds strange, but that is what it is. It comes \nout of the ground, it is gathered up, and when it finally gets on a \nship, somebody buys it. And what do they buy it for? They buy it for \nwhat they think it is worth, and they bid it, and that is what it is \nworth. So oil is worth what people pay for it. Regrettably, they are \npaying more and more because they are worried about the world situation \nand whether oil supply is credible, whether it is going to remain \nreliable. So they bid it up higher and higher.\n  Problems in producing nations such as Venezuela, Nigeria, and Iran \nhave sharply driven up this price, along with this great, new, \nvoracious appetite on the part of China and India. They are entitled--\nthey are entitled, just as we are--to use this oil, and they are buying \nit up, bidding it up, causing the supply and demand to have the impact \nI am describing with all of you here this morning.\n  There are some things we can do to try to ameliorate this problem, \nand, yes, some of them are very difficult. Most of it we can't do much \nabout, unless we either wean ourselves off foreign oil, which will take \nseveral years to do, or dramatically increase our own production of \noil. I regret to say there are too many on the other side of the aisle, \nnot everyone but most on the other side of the aisle here in the Senate \nand in the House who refuse to acknowledge that we must produce more of \nour own wherever we can.\n  Let's talk about what we can do.\n  President Bush proposed four things yesterday, and I endorse every \none of them. Every one of those is now out there for the market to look \nat, for everyone to look at, and they have already had a positive \neffect. He wants an aggressive investigation of fraud and manipulation. \nWe mandated a similar investigation in the Energy bill, and I \nabsolutely support what the President called for--an ongoing \ninvestigation into the manipulation or cheating that might be taking \nplace. Let's get on with it. Let's put the resources in. Let's make \nsure the American people feel comfortable that it is taking place. We \nare doing it. Whether it proves anything, we will have to wait and see.\n\n[[Page S3531]]\n\n  The President wants to do another thing. He wants to repeal certain \ntax breaks that are in the Energy bill. He says they are unnecessary \nfor oil companies. I agree. Actually, I thought they would do some \ngood, but the President has convinced me and many of us, under his \nleadership, to repeal those tax items that are in the bill. I am happy \nto take the lead, along with those who write the tax laws, and see if \nwe can repeal and eliminate the deepwater drilling tax relief that is \nin the bill.\n  The President also recommended and announced that he will temporarily \nhalt the filling of SPR, a move I hope will free up about 12 million \nbarrels of oil this summer, meaning we won't use it for the Strategic \nPetroleum Reserve. So it will be available to those who are purchasing \noil to be used as we have been describing it here: for the marketplace \nto put in refineries and be used by the great demand that is worldwide.\n  If we had developed ANWR--and I note the presence of the junior \nSenator from Alaska on the floor--if we had done that 10 years ago, if \nwe had passed ANWR legislation--we did pass it. Had the President of \nthe United States not vetoed it--and that was President Bill Clinton \nwho vetoed it--then what we would have had available is at least 1 \nmillion barrels of oil--American owned--that we could use every day, \nand it would be added to the inventory that is out there for the world \nto use, and for the United States it would be a dramatic reduction in \nthe amount of oil we would have to buy from others.\n  We have to wake up. There is nothing to be damaged. You can go look \nat ANWR and see what we would be doing with new drilling, new \napproaches to drilling, if we would get that done. It is regrettable \nthat we won't produce our own and we will sit and talk and blame, and \nin particular, the other side will blame the President and blame \nRepublicans. These Senators understand that today's gasoline prices are \ndriven ever increasingly by long-term speculation on global production. \nThey understand that a strong signal on supply can drive prices up \ntoday and down tomorrow. They know a vote to develop ANWR will have an \nimmediate impact on oil prices, which in turn will have an immediate \nimpact on gasoline prices.\n  Look at what happened to the energy markets yesterday after the \nPresident announced his four-prong plan. Energy prices fell. Yet these \nsame Senators fought against ANWR, fought against OCS production, and \nhave consistently fought against new energy production almost anywhere, \nproduction they know will ease our price and supply problems.\n  We have worked in the committee and marked up, gotten ready for a \nvote, Lease Sale 181 on natural gas, a bill that will develop oil and \ngas 100 miles off the coast of Florida. Democrats have threatened to \nfilibuster the bill when it comes to the floor. It shows there is no \ndesire to produce even what is our own.\n  The Massachusetts delegation continues to block the Weaver Cove \nliquefied natural gas facility, a facility proposed for Fall River that \nwould provide 400,000 mcf of natural gas per day. That is enough to \nease the price and supply pressure for most of New England.\n  Another example is if you don't want to produce energy that is our \nown, then you ought not be complaining about the fact that the price \ncontinues to rise because of shortages in global markets. Instead, \ntoday some on the other side propose a tax holiday. I find it \ninteresting that it is Democrats who want to temporarily repeal the \ngasoline taxes since it was they who voted over the years to increase \nthat same tax.\n  I can support the idea of a holiday. I like the idea of helping \nAmerican families keep some of their money they are spending at the gas \npump. But we use that money to build roads and mass transit. The \nFederal Government is going to have to make up those revenues \nsomewhere. So let me propose this idea: Let's let the oil companies \nmake up the difference. That is what we ought to do.\n  Anyway, I suggest we are on the right track. The President's \nsuggestions are good suggestions, and we can come up with some more. \nBut in the meantime, we ought to tell the American people the truth: \nThere is no quick fix, and it is easier to blame than it is to have \nsolutions. Let's look for the solutions and then we will all get a \nchance to judge who is doing the most to help America move toward \nenergy independence.\n  I believe I have some additional time, and I yield it to the \ndistinguished Senator from Alaska.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Vitter). At this time all time has expired \non the majority side.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 5 \nadditional minutes to be added on this side and on the other side as \nwell.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I commend the distinguished chairman of \nthe Energy Committee who has taken such a leadership role on the issue \nof achieving energy independence for this country.\n  We all had an opportunity to go home over the past couple of weeks, \nand I think it is fair to say that without question, in every State \nacross this country, the No. 1 issue our constituents are talking about \nis energy prices. With the crude oil prices passing an all-time high of \n$75 a barrel last week, I think it is fair to say we can anticipate \nthat the prices will go higher and higher.\n  It seems we all want to blame someone. Americans want to blame \nsomeone--anyone--for the high prices. They want to blame the oil \nindustry companies that have been showing record profits. They want to \nblame the filling station operators and accuse them of price gouging. \nThey want to blame the oil commodities traders for bidding up the price \nof crude. They want to blame the Congress for allowing and perhaps \nencouraging these prices. Quite frankly, it is hard for us not to \naccept some of the blame. But what Americans don't want to accept is \nthat these prices we are seeing are the result of nearly 20 years of \nincoherent energy policy.\n  The reasons for the price increases are many, and we have heard the \nchairman discuss many of them. But the biggest goes back to the lessons \nwe learned in high school economics about the law of supply and demand. \nToday the world consumes 80 million barrels of oil a day. The U.S. is \nresponsible for a quarter of that. Right now, our oil producers \ncollectively around the world have the ability to produce at most 81 \nmillion barrels daily. So the demand is bumping dangerously close to \nmaximum current supply, and that demand for the oil is booming.\n  We talked about China. China last week announced that its economy \ngrew more than 10 percent last year, and its demand for fuel is rising \nan equivalent amount. Developing nations are outbidding industrial \nnations for oil, and the trend continues. Demand for fuel in the Asian \npacific region is likely to grow at over 3 percent annually for the \nnext 25 years, nearly 5 times the growth rate of fuel use in North \nAmerica and 4 times the rate in Europe.\n\n  In addition to the demand side of the picture, the supply side is \ndown. Six percent of the Nation's oil production remains offline as a \nresult of the damage from Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. We have often \ntalked about the world's supply. The world's supply is uncertain, given \nthe unrest we are seeing in Nigeria, the political events in Venezuela, \nrhetoric from Iran, supply disruptions that plague Iraq.\n  We here in Congress also have a place in this equation when we look \nto the supply side. It was 6 years ago that Congress passed the \nrequirement that said by June 1 of this year the Nation's refineries \nmust reduce the sulfur in diesel fuel from 500 parts per million to 15 \nparts per million, and refiners have spent the money, more than $8 \nbillion, to comply. The changes are this: They are going to cut the \ndiesel exhaust pollution by 90 percent. But it does take more fuel to \nmake a similar amount of diesel, and it is costing the refineries more \nmoney to comply with the ultralow sulfur diesel rules.\n  Last year we were talking about MTBE and what to do about it. We \ndidn't provide for an organized phaseout of MTBE, which means the \nrefineries are rushing to acquire ethanol to replace MTBE in gasoline. \nWhat this does is causes a host of different price pressures, from the \nadded costs of building new tanks to store the ethanol to the crush of \nfinding railroad tank\n\n[[Page S3532]]\n\ncars to move the ethanol from the Midwest to the Northeast and down \ninto Texas, where it can be blended into the gasoline.\n  Since it requires a special base form of gasoline, the ethanol-to-\nMTBE switch makes it difficult for us to import gasoline from overseas \nto relieve these price pressures, because outside of Europe there are \nfew foreign refineries that can actually make this base form. So that \nmeans tighter fuel supplies that cannot readily be remedied by imported \nproduct.\n  We talk about the cost to us as Americans. According to the Energy \nInformation Administration, we are already paying about twice as much \nfor fuel today as we did in the summer of 2002. On the whole, our \ncountry is spending $212 million more per day for gasoline than we did \nlast year, a half billion dollars more per day than 4 years ago. It is \nincredible.\n  What do we do about it? The chairman of the Energy Committee noted \nsome of the steps, and noted some of the steps the President has \nadvanced. But our first effort today is to conserve, to increase our \nconservation and efficiency efforts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 1 \nadditional minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. We must do the simple things first. Conservation, \nefficiency, make sure the tires are inflated, our cars are in tune, \ndrive less, reduce the air conditioning--those small things that will \nmake a difference. We have to move quickly to increase our fuel \nefficiency, continue to expand the use of renewables such as wind, \ngeothermal, biomass, oceans, solar--all of those that are available. \nBut we must increase our domestic supplies of oil and natural gas, and \nthe first place we start is up in ANWR. We have the ability to do it. \nWe have demonstrated that we can. Opening ANWR would produce up to 1 \nmillion barrels a day of additional oil for 30 years to meet the world \ndemand and drive the prices down.\n  People are saying it is not going to make a difference today, and \nthey are correct. But we didn't get to this place in 1 day. What we are \nanticipating is the need down the road. Anyone who thinks in 5 or 10 \nyears there are not going to be anymore hurricanes or supply \ndisruptions or production impediments is fooling himself. So let's plan \nfor the future. Let's plan for our own domestic energy security by \ndoing what we can in this country. The first place to start is by \nopening ANWR to limited oil exploration and development, and doing it \nin an environmentally sensitive and balanced manner.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I understand the remaining time on the \nDemocratic side is not needed and may be yielded back.\n  Mrs. MURRAY.

The Senator from Tennessee is recognized.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I yield to myself 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, there will be a rare opportunity about \nnoon on the Senate floor. There will be a chance for the American \npeople to have for themselves a handy list of big spenders, something \nthey can put on their blogs, something they can put in their \nnewsletters, something they can speak about at the dinner table, \nsomething they can read to friends. There is always a lot of talk \naround here about who is responsible for the fact that the Federal \nGovernment is spending more money than it ought to. We are about to see \na good example of who is responsible for that, if things go true to \nform, because we will have two amendments before us at noon. One is by \nthe distinguished Senator from New Hampshire, Senator Gregg, and one by \nthe distinguished Democratic leader, Senator Reid. Both of them are \nborder security amendments.\n  There will not be very many votes in this body, I suspect, against \nborder security. I want to speak about border security because the \nGregg amendment takes very important steps to maintain our current \nlevel of security on the border, which is a minimum level of security. \nI am proud to cosponsor that. And the Gregg amendment pays for it by \ntaking money from other parts of the President's budget. That is the \nGregg amendment.\n  The Reid amendment, as I understand it, which we will be voting on \nside by side, does identically the same thing on border security the \nGregg amendment does, except it pretends that money comes out of thin \nair, that it grows on trees, that it comes from nowhere. It is the \nthing we see time and time again around here, whereby someone comes up \nwith an essential, good idea but with no way to pay for it. So we print \nthe money, make it up, and the runaway spending goes on and on.\n  I wish to talk this morning a little bit about those two issues--\nfirst, border security, the subject of the Gregg amendment and why I \nbelieve it is essential that we adopt it as part of the supplemental \nappropriations bill that is before us. I also want to talk about the \ndifference between how it is paid for so the American people can get \nready to make their handy list of big spenders because those who vote \nfor the Reid amendment will be on a handy list of big spenders because \nthat amendment is not paid for.\n  Let me start with the Gregg amendment and the condition of border \nsecurity. Americans are angry about border security, or the lack of it. \nThey have a right to be angry about border security, or the lack of it. \nThat is not the responsibility of the Governor of the State of Arizona \nor the Governor of Texas or the Governor of California. It is a Federal \nresponsibility. Immigration is our job. Border security is our job. It \nis a Washington job and it is a job that has been neglected for a long \nperiod of time.\n  At least to the credit of the majority leader, he has forced this \nSenate to deal with this issue and we are in the middle of it and we \nought not rest nor go home again until we deal with the issue of border \nsecurity. There are a lot of other issues that do not have to deal with \nimmigration. How many temporary students do we want here in the United \nStates? We have 572,000 of them today. They are an important part of \nour country, contributing to our standard of living. When they go home, \nthey usually spread our values and our good will better than any \nforeign aid ever has. We have about half a million people who are here \neach year and we give them new temporary worker status. It is important \nto have them here as well, because in a vibrant, growing economy, we \nneed more workers. We have an important debate to have about what to do \nabout the 10 to 12 million people\n\n[[Page S3533]]\n\nwho are illegally here, and what I think is the most important part of \nthe whole immigration debate and that is how do we make sure those who \nare not citizens of this country are, for the most part, becoming \nAmericans so we do not leave this country a large enclave of people \nwhose allegiance is to some other country.\n  We are a big country, 300 million people. We have about 30 million \npeople, or 10 percent of us today, who are noncitizens--about two-\nthirds legally here and one-third of those illegally here. But we need \nto make sure that for the most part, people who are here who are not \ncitizens are learning English, are learning the saga of American \nhistory, are learning about our founding documents and are willing to \ntake the oath which foreswears allegiance to where they came from and \nadopts allegiance to this country.\n  There are many important debates about immigration, but there is \nnothing more important than border security. Border security is the \nfirst issue before us because it is based upon the bedrock principle of \nthe American character which is the rule of law. Most families who have \ncome to this country are immigrant families. Almost all of us descend \nfrom those. Most of those families, in addition to wanting to make a \ndollar, wanting to improve their lives, wanting to gain freedom, wanted \nto come to a country where there is the rule of law. They did not want \nto live in some other country where some potentate could snatch you out \nof your bed in the middle of the night and, based on the whim of that \nruler, decide your fate. Or where a contract that you made would be \ndecided by some person, not by the rule of law, and where some people \nare higher than the law and some people lower than the rule of law. \nThey wanted to come to this country, the United States, which honors \nthe rule of law and upholds the rule of law.\n  Yes, people came here because they wanted freedom. They wanted to be \nable to drive across State lines, but they expected to have to stop at \nstop signs. They wanted to come to a country where they were free to \nmake contracts with whomever they wanted, but they expected the \ncontracts would be enforced. They wanted to come to a country where \nthey have second amendment rights to own a gun, but they expected they \nwouldn't be allowed to shoot people with that gun.\n  This has been a country with the rule of law, and we have been \nignoring that for the last number of years by looking aside while \nmillions and millions of people stream back and forth across our \nborders illegally while millions of other people patiently wait in \nline, attesting to their good character, learning at least eighth grade \nEnglish, passing a test on American history, waiting for 5 years, and \npreparing themselves to take an oath where they foreswear their \nallegiance from where they came and pledge allegiance to the United \nStates.\n\n  Those people are bypassed by these people running back and forth \nacross the border. It is unfair to them. Principally, it is an offense \nto the principle of the rule of law. There may not be anyone in this \nChamber who does not agree with the principle of the rule of law and \nthat we ought to secure and control our borders. If we believe that, we \nought to do it.\n  I am growing increasingly to think that Senator Isakson is right as \nhe suggests that the first thing we ought to do in this immigration \ndebate is secure our borders, perhaps allow the President to certify \nthey are secured, and then begin to deal with temporary workers and \nother issues that come up.\n  In any event, we want to secure or borders. That is why the Gregg \namendment is so important. Senator Gregg has proposed we provide $1.9 \nbillion in emergency funding as a critical investment in border \nsecurity in this supplemental appropriations bill which is now before \nthe Senate. This is an integral component of the war on terror.\n  Key critical capital improvements that are part of this bill include: \nNo. 1, stemming the tide of illegal aliens entering the country; No. 2, \nensuring that terrorists and weapons of mass destruction are not \ncapable of slipping through our arguably porous borders; No. 3, \ndecreasing the illegal drug flow.\n  The subject matter of the debate, the bill before the Senate, is an \nemergency appropriation for the war on terror. This is an integral part \nof the war on terror except that the border is on our southwest border \nand not somewhere in the Middle East. It is at home. It is part of what \nwe ought to be talking about.\n  Here are a few examples of exactly what the Gregg amendment, which I \nam proud to cosponsor along with others, would do. These are \nimprovements necessary to secure our borders. For example, we have an \noutdated fleet of aircraft. The P-3 fleet which serves as our border \nsecurity's primary air surveillance is over 40 years old, 20 years \nbeyond the average life of this type of plane. Last month, the entire \nfleet was grounded due to safety issues uncovered during a routine \ninspection. The entire fleet needs to be overhauled to extend its \nservice life.\n  Example No. 2, outdated vehicles. Nearly 1,700 vehicles are virtually \nunusable due to the wear and tear of the desert, extreme environments \nand hard use, forcing border patrol agents and investigators to use \nvehicles with a high breakdown rate.\n  Example No. 3, lack of sufficient patrol boats. There are not enough \npatrol boats today, resulting in fewer patrol boat hours now than we \nhad in 1998, about half the number of hours needed to meet the mission \nrequirement.\n  Next example, lack of sufficient patrol aircraft. We currently detect \n3 out of every 10 boats carrying smugglers. Of the boats detected by a \npatrol aircraft, we stop 75 percent of them. More aircraft are needed \nto act on intelligence regarding human and drug smuggling activities.\n  Next, unmanned aerial vehicles. We have only one unmanned aerial \nvehicle operating along our southwest border. In 7 months it has \nassisted in the apprehension of over 1,000 aliens. Yesterday morning it \ncrashed while surveying the Arizona border. The department has only \nbegun to grapple with how to replace this surveillance capacity until \nthe next unmanned aerial vehicle is delivered in August. The department \nindicates that up to 18 are needed.\n  Armed helicopters is another example. So the $2 billion increase in \nborder dollars will replace--or repair, when that is sufficient--\noutdated vehicles, aircraft, helicopters, and boats. The money will \nalso be used to improve law enforcement communications.\n  The point I am seeking to make is that these essential capital \nimprovements on border security, the $1.9 billion this year, which is \nin addition to the amount of money that Senator Gregg and this Congress \nadded to the budget in the last two budgets, will make capital \nimprovements necessary to merely maintain our current capacity to \nenforce our borders. There is no need to pass any kind of immigration \nbill unless we have both the authority and the money to secure the \nborders. We should want to send a clear signal to the American people \nthat before we establish a system of temporary workers and confirm our \nsystem of student visas and put into place other applications to help \npeople legally here become American citizens, we should make sure we \nare doing our job of ensuring that border is secure.\n  Let me talk about the money. There are a great many urgent ideas \nexpressed in the Senate. That is what we are for: Let ideas percolate, \nideas that need resolution, debate them and solve them. It is a \nwonderful system. The more I travel and see the rest of the world, as I \nhave over my lifetime, the more I admire the system we have, messy as \nit often is.\n  The No. 1 issue that might light up the switchboards would be border \nsecurity. I judge No. 2 would be runaway Federal spending. That is why \nI say it is important for those paying attention to this debate to be \nready to make a list of big spenders. For those who believe in voting \nfor a good idea but then getting the money out of a tree or up off the \nground or out of some imaginary printing press to pay for it, that is \nwhy we have a big Federal deficit. We vote for a big idea, and then we \ndo not pay for it.\n  Senator Gregg pays for it. He does it by saying we will take the $1.9 \nbillion from the 2.775 percent reduction in the $69 billion in funding \nprovided for the Department of Defense in title I, chapter 3, and title \nII, excluding military construction money. Senators Cochran, Stevens, \nand Frist all believe that leaves the committees with sufficient \nflexibility to support our needs in Afghanistan, Iraq, as well as our \nneeds along the border.\n\n[[Page S3534]]\n\n  The President has said he will veto a supplemental appropriations \nbill that just balloons to the sky, that goes over $92.2 billion. The \nletter came last night, and it does not say ``advisors predict'' or \n``someone said.'' It says the President will veto anything over $92.2 \nbillion. I intend to support the President if he does have to veto. I \nhope we will be fiscally responsible.\n  The Democratic amendment takes $106 billion and adds another $2 \nbillion to it for this good idea, border security. The Gregg amendment \nsays let's pay for it out of funds we have, keep it within the budget.\n  At noon today, we will have a chance, No. 1, to vote for border \nsecurity. That is essential. Both amendments do the same thing. The \nsecond thing we have a chance to do is compile for the country a list \nof big spenders, those who believe in taking the money out of the air \nsomewhere, printing it in a printing press. You can do a lot of \ntalking, but if you do not offset the dollars, you are a big spender \nand you go on the list.\n\n  Perhaps one should be proud of being on such a list, but I would \nrather vote with Senator Gregg, which is why I am cosponsoring his \namendment rather than the Democratic leader's amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington is recognized.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I yield 15 minutes to the Senator from New York and 15 \nminutes to the Senator from Massachusetts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from New York is recognized.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, sitting here listening to my colleague \nfrom Tennessee reminds me of that old story about the boy who kills his \nparents and then stood before the judge and asked for mercy because he \nwas an orphan. This is an unbelievable narration we have just heard.\n  The other side of the aisle has been expert in running up the largest \ndeficits we have ever had. We had a balanced budget, we had a surplus 5 \nyears ago. We were on the right track economically. We were fiscally \nresponsible. But the combination of this White House and this \nRepublican majority has blown all of that to smithereens.\n  This President has never vetoed anything and now we finally get a \nveto threat on an emergency supplemental. This President has used \nemergency supplementals in order to avoid the budget realities that \nwould confront anyone who knows elementary arithmetic about how much we \nare spending that we do not have.\n  With all due respect to my colleague, this is a rather strange \nargument to be making at this point in time as though none of the \nhistory of the previous 5 years had occurred.\n  The debate between these two amendments is a worthy debate; however, \nit is an unnecessary debate. The President sent a budget to this \nCongress just a few months ago. It could have had much of what is in \nthis emergency supplemental in the budget. They chose not to do so \nbecause even they are getting a little embarrassed about the ocean of \nred ink we are all swimming in these days.\n  What this supplemental appropriations bill does is provide vital \nsupport for our men and women currently serving in Iraq, Afghanistan, \nand elsewhere. This emergency supplemental provides body armor, tools \nto defeat improvised explosive devices, the so-called IEDs that are \nkilling and maiming young Americans every single day. This supplemental \nprovides money for training for the Iraqi security forces. Maybe, \nfinally, we will have a government in Iraq that knows how to do that. \nThey certainly need to get the message that we are not there for the \nlong term unless they start defending themselves and providing security \nfor their own people.\n  These funds are to replenish the money we are spending in our \nmilitary to make sure our young men and women who are bravely serving \nus have the resources, the equipment, the tools they need to do the job \nwe sent them to do.\n  The bill also includes funds to continue the rebuilding from \nHurricane Katrina. As we approach yet another month of debris, confused \nleadership, failure to supervise and monitor expenditures from this \nadministration, we know how much more needs to be done to rebuild New \nOrleans and the gulf coast region.\n  Here we are, about to have a vote in a few hours on an amendment--\nreally, two amendments--as to whether we are also going to face up to \nour responsibilities along our border, and how we are going to pay for \nthat. Both the Gregg amendment and the Reid amendment recognize the \ncritical need for increased border security.\n  I have long maintained it is unconscionable to think that in our \npost-September 11 world we still do not know the identities of people \nwho enter our country, stay illegally in our country, and may or may \nnot exit our country. Over the past several weeks, we have seen \nagreement in the Senate that securing our borders must be a top \npriority and a major component of whatever immigration reform we \nconsider.\n  Now, there are those who are, frankly, misguided and demagogic in \ntheir claims that all we need is border security. We know that is not \nthe case. Senator Kennedy, who is in the Chamber at this moment, has \nbeen a leader on immigration reform for decades. He knows if you do not \nhave comprehensive immigration reform, you do not deal with the \nchallenges we confront.\n  We all are in agreement we have to do more to secure our porous \nborders. The Reid amendment is a step in the right direction because it \ndoes provide $1.9 billion to strengthen our borders. These funds would \nbe used to replace and upgrade law enforcement communications, provide \nBorder Patrol agents with air and land vehicles, expand air operations \nfor Customs and border protection, invest $100 million in sensor and \nsurveillance technology that will help our Border Patrol agents be more \neffective.\n  If we can succeed in securing our borders, something that we have not \nyet succeeded in doing, then we can turn our attention as a nation and \nfocus our energies and our resources on other credible threats against \nour homeland.\n  I commend Senator Reid's efforts to direct resources to strengthening \nour borders. I know he would agree with me that obtaining these \nadditional funds should not be mistaken for comprehensive immigration \nreform. We still need comprehensive immigration reform that secures our \nborders, creates a better set of agreements and understandings with our \nneighbors to the south as to what they are going to do to stop the flow \nof illegal immigrants through their countries, particularly Mexico, and \nimposes and enforces tough sanctions against employers who employ \nillegal immigrants. After all, these people would not be risking their \nlives if there wasn't a job waiting for them at the other end of their \ndangerous journey; make sure we don't disadvantage people who have \nwaited legally for their opportunity to come here to join a family \nmember and to get a job that has been promised.\n\n  We need to do something to help alleviate the financial burden on \nlocal communities--not just along the border but, frankly, in New \nYork--that are paying health care and education and law enforcement \ncosts because this Federal Government can't figure out how to run an \nimmigration system.\n  Yes, we need an earned pass to citizenship to bring out of the \nshadows the 11 or 12 million hard-working immigrants who are here and \ngive them a chance through paying back taxes, going through a \nbackground check, learning English, and waiting their turn to become \nlegal. We know what comprehensive reform looks like. And border \nsecurity is absolutely paramount, but passing the Gregg amendment is \nnot the end of immigration reform. I hope everyone understands that.\n  My colleague from New Hampshire agrees that we need to increase \nborder security, but he would cut needed funds for our troops in the \nname of border security. The Gregg amendment would take money from \ntroop pay, body armor, and even from the joint improvised explosive \ndevice funds. That is a false choice, and it is a wrong choice.\n  I do not believe that we should be engage in deficit spending. That \nis why I have voted against many of the provisions that have come from \nthe other side--tax cuts which we can't afford, spending that should be \nunder control. But it is an odd moment indeed that all\n\n[[Page S3535]]\n\nof a sudden my friends have found a conversion experience and they want \nto take money from our troops to secure our borders. I will take that \ncomparison any time. I will be on any list that says don't take money \nfrom our troops; don't cut the research which we finally have as to how \nwe are going to defeat improvised explosive devices because you now \ndecide you want to do border security when you have been presenting \nbudgets for 5 years after 9/11.\n  We need to get serious about defending this country and the men and \nwomen who serve on its behalf. We shouldn't be cutting funds for our \ntroops in the name of border security. It is wrong to cut funds for \nbody armor or for efforts to defeat IEDs. It is wrong to cut money from \nIraqi security force training when they are finally about to have an \nIraqi Government, something we have all been waiting for. It is wrong \nto cut the defense health program which provides medical assistance to \nour troops on the battlefield. And it is wrong to cut the death \ngratuity which assists the families of fallen soldiers.\n  If I sound a little passionate about this, it is because I am. I find \nthis a false, cheap choice to score political points. And I think it is \nwrong.\n  The most important obligation of our Government is to provide for the \nsecurity of the American people. Border security is an urgent need. It \nshould and must be addressed by this Congress. But our security and our \nvalues are not served by choosing between protecting our troops and \nprotecting our homeland, nor by playing support for our men and women \nin uniform against our need for border security. The Gregg amendment \nundermines both. I urge my colleagues to support the Reid amendment.\n  Do we need to get back to fiscal responsibility? You bet we do. Let \nus talk about that when it comes to cutting even more taxes for people \nmaking more than $1 million a year. Let us talk about that when we are \nspending $10 billion a month in Iraq and Afghanistan. Let us talk about \nthat when we borrow $60 billion a month from foreign lenders, such as \nthe Governments of China, Japan, South Korea, Saudi Arabia, and India.\n  How do we protect our security against an increasingly dangerous \nworld? How do we stand up to the threats from unstable regimes and from \ncompetition from China and elsewhere for scarce natural resources when \nwe can't even get our own fiscal house in order because the other side \nof the aisle and the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue are addicted to \ntax cuts for the wealthy regardless of the costs for anything else, \nregardless of the costs for our country?\n  We need an energy policy that moves us toward energy independence. We \nget rhetoric, we don't get budget priorities. We are living on borrowed \ntime and borrowed money. We are one accident or one terrorist attack \naway from oil at $100 a barrel--not just $75. We have no leadership. We \nare not asked to sacrifice anything. The only people who sacrifice on a \ndaily basis are the young men and women wearing our uniform.\n  Now we are standing up here with a straight face saying we are going \nto cut funds for body armor, we are going to cut the IED research \nprogram, we are going to cut the death gratuity so we can score \npolitical points and act all of sudden as if we have become fiscally \nresponsible. I am sorry, I find that a sad commentary about what should \nbe expected from each and every one of us.\n  I hope we will begin to seek common ground and try to figure out how \nwe get ourselves out of the dangerous situation we are in today. All \none has to do is pick up the morning newspapers or turn on the news. It \nis beyond me why we would want to have a political debate pitting \nborder security against the needs of our men and women in uniform.\n  There are other ways to pay for this. There is money for construction \nthat could be postponed until a real budget emerges. There are other \nkinds of options. But, no, we are going to have a debate about two \nserious, urgent requirements that we should be stepping up to meet.\n  I hope we will support the Reid amendment and do what is right by our \ntroops and our border needs, and then let's get down to a serious \ndiscussion that is long overdue in this Chamber about where this \ncountry is headed.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from \nMassachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask the Chair to let me know when there \nis 3 minutes remaining.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair will so notify the Senator.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, as she is exiting the Chamber, I wish to \ncommend my friend and colleague, the Senator from New York, for an \nexcellent statement and comment about what is really at play here at \nnoontime in the Senate; that is, a choice between meeting our \nresponsibilities to the service men and women who are serving bravely \nand gallantly in Iraq and Afghanistan and also meeting our \nresponsibilities to protect our country at our border. I have listened \nto her on many different occasions, and she spelled out the choice as \nclearly and as passionately as I have ever heard the case made. I thank \nher for her excellent and eloquent comments.\n  Mr. President, we are getting close to decision time on this \nparticular amendment. Just to review very briefly where we are on the \nissues that are before us, I think all of us in this Chamber understand \nthat we are making progress on an extremely difficult and complex \nissue; that is, the issue on immigration reform.\n  There are strong emotions, strong feelings, and strong beliefs on a \nvariety of different aspects of immigration reform, but one which I \nbelieve has total support in this body is that what we do need to do is \nbe able to control our borders, and to be able to do that, we have to \nbe able to make the investment which is going to be necessary to secure \nour borders.\n  Many of us believe that just in and of itself trying to establish \njust a border or just a fence in one part of the country is not going \nto do it.\n  All we have to really do is look at history. We understand that 10 \nyears ago, about 40,000 illegals were coming into the United States. \nSince that time, we have spent over $10 billion on border security, we \nhave increased the number of border guards by 300 percent, and now we \nhave some 400,000 coming into the United States.\n  It is going to take tough border security, but it is going to take \nsomething more in terms of law enforcement in this country for those \nwho are eligible to be able to work and separating out those who are \nineligible and also to be able to develop a program of earned \ncitizenship for individuals who are here because they want to provide \nfor their families, to work hard, to play by the rules, and to serve in \nthe Armed Forces. They are prepared to pay a penalty, and they are \nprepared to go to the back of the line and wait their turn for up to 11 \nyears before they would even be eligible for citizenship.\n  The immigration debate will continue along, and we will get back to \nit here in the Senate, but there is broad agreement on doing more in \nterms of our border security. There is some difference in how that \nshould be shaped, but we ought to recognize that we need the resources, \nwe need the $2 billion which is before the Senate. What is completely \nunacceptable is the tradeoff between trying to deal with and seal our \nborders and to see a reduction in the support for our military and the \narmed services in both Iraq and Afghanistan. A number of us have worked \nvery hard to increase in more protective humvees and the up-armoring of \nthe humvees over the last 3\\1/2\\ years.\n  I serve on the Armed Services Committee. We have had 12 different \nestimates from the Defense Department on the requirement for up-armor \nhumvees, and after each and every time, they have raised the \nrequirement in order to protect troops.\n  We have added resources, both in the Armed Services Committee and \nhere on the floor, to ensure that we are going to provide the best \nprotection that the humvees can provide when they are up-armored. Now \nwe are faced with an amendment which would reduce the resources for up-\narmoring humvees, something I believe is completely unacceptable. The \ntradeoff is completely unacceptable. We need both.\n  We have read and Americans have understood that we need to do a great \ndeal more on armor for our troops. We are all familiar with the stories \nof American servicemen going through\n\n[[Page S3536]]\n\ndumpsters in Iraq to get strips of steel and metal and strapping those \nonto their vehicles because we weren't providing sufficient body armor \neither to individuals or to the trucks that are used in convoys over \nthere. Nonetheless, the proposal that is being offered by the Senator \nfrom New Hampshire would reduce the funds available for the kinds of \nprotective armor which is so essential for individuals and for their \nvehicles.\n  The IED, as we have heard from General Casey, as we have heard from \nGeneral Abizaid, and as we have heard from the commanders in the field, \nis the primary threat to American service men and women. Who of us has \nnot watched the news virtually every single night and not seen the \nsmoking ruins of some vehicle where young, brave, courageous American \nmen have lost their lives? Those are primarily destroyed by IEDs.\n  We have not done the kind of research into IEDs necessary in order to \nmaster the technology so our servicemen will have a defense. In the \nvery beginning, IEDs were being set off with simple signals, but we \nwere unable to jam them because it interfered with our military's \ncommunications. We have an opportunity. We have sent men and women to \nthe Moon and brought them back, but we are unable to develop the \nelectronics to set off the IED before it can hurt our troops coming \ndown the road. I don't understand it. But I know that we haven't \nutilized to the extent we should the entrepreneurship, the ideas, and \nthe innovation in the private sector in terms of electronics to be able \nto advance this whole area of technology.\n  We have finally established a very interesting important task force \nto try to bring in the best minds in defense and the private sector \ntogether to solve this problem. But we are going to be cut back on that \nfor border security. What possible sense does that make?\n  Those are a few of the very top priorities but there other priorities \nthat will be affected, including training the Iraqi security forces to \nupgrade their skills so they can stand up and Americans can stand down. \nThis amendment would cut that program, as well as training programs in \nAfghanistan.\n  Why in the world, if we have made assessments that these programs are \njustified, are necessary, that are included in the supplemental, is it \npossibly justified to say: Well, those weren't really accurate, those \nreally didn't reflect the need? We can chip away at any number of those \nprograms because we need border security. It is a bad choice. I would \nlike to take note, particularly of some of the smaller dollar items \nbut, nonetheless, items which are of enormous importance and \nconsequence.\n\n  Family support counseling: We have read about the explosion in the \nnumber of divorces that have taken place among our service men and \nwomen who are returning from Iraq. It is now four or five times the \nnational average of those in their generation because of the stress \nexperienced by these individuals, both those who go to Iraq and, sadly, \nthose who are left behind. So we provide assistance in terms of family \nsupport counseling, which is so important, so necessary.\n  And all of us are familiar with the stories of children who are \nmissing their father and may have difficulties in school. We also hear \nof the families who have difficulties in adjusting to the fact that \nparents are away for a long time, come home for a brief time, and then \nare sent back to Iraq; come home for a brief time, and then are sent \nback to Iraq again. This puts enormous pressure on families who see \nthese enormous potential dangers to the lives and well-being of their \nloved ones. So the resources in here to help with support counseling \nare very important. This amendment would reduce those services.\n  This amendment would also reduce the help and assistance, \nparticularly, for patient transportation, medical services, and \nrehabilitation services, particularly for those severely wounded. The \nfact is, we have made some progress in the advancement of technology \nfor helmets, so we have less injuries to the brain and to the head than \nwe have seen in previous wars. And we have also made improvements in \nbody armor. But as a result we have seen the extraordinary trauma in \nthe extremities, and many servicemen have lost their limbs--legs and \narms. We have some special provisions in this legislation to give \ngreater focus and attention, direction and support, to programs that \ndeal with these injuries.\n  I do not understand why, if we are talking about getting $2 billion \nfor border security--which I strongly support--we ought to put at risk \nany of these programs. That is what this amendment will do. We know we \nhave to do something to protect our borders. We know we need to make \nthe improvements which are outlined in both the amendments of Senator \nReid and Senator Gregg, which are areas I certainly support, but we \nshould not do it at the cost of these essential programs which are \nabsolutely necessary for those individuals who are fighting on the \nfront line and risking their lives every single day in a dangerous part \nof the world, and their families.\n  It is the wrong choice to make, to put any of these programs at risk \nin order to support the $2 billion. We ought to be able to support \nthat. We ought to add that and it should be a part of this Nation's \nobligation for the future.\n  I just remind ourselves of a recent excellent report by a Nobel \nlaureate, Professor Stiglitz, at Columbia, whose estimate is that this \nwar in Iraq--just in Iraq--is going to cost $1 trillion--$1 trillion--\nbefore the end of it. A Nobel laureate estimating it will cost $1 \ntrillion. We are being asked here for just about $2 billion to provide \nvital support services to those men and women who fight this war. It \nseems to me we have seen extraordinary expenditures already to date. I \nhad my reservations, and I opposed going to this war, and I still \nbelieve it has not enhanced our national security or the security of \nAmericans, but, nonetheless, what I am sure of is that it does not make \nsense for us to see a reduction in these programs that are so vital for \nour service men and women.\n  Mr. President, I yield back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Graham). The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I yield to the Senator from Tennessee 5 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee is recognized.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I do not suppose there is a row of \nseats in the U.S. Senate that produces more passion and eloquence than \nthe back row on the other side of the aisle. I enjoyed listening to the \nSenator from New York and the Senator from Massachusetts on this \nsubject. I was especially struck by the Senator from New York, who \nspoke about budget deficits and talked about history and talked about \nan ocean of red ink and made a very impassioned speech. Then, when she \ngot to the end of her speech, she volunteered to be on the list of big \nspenders that is going to be created at noon, which will be those who \nvote for the Reid amendment.\n  The Gregg amendment and the Reid amendment are identical. They are \nabout border security. All the Reid amendment does is they took the \nGregg amendment, which is a carefully structured approach to try to \nhelp maintain our border security on the southwest border, just at its \npresent level, and they just struck out ``Gregg'' and they wrote in \n``Reid'' and they did something else: they struck out the way to pay \nfor it. So they are going to pay for it from thin air. They are going \nto pay for it with cotton candy.\n  There was talk about a brazen smokescreen. That is a brazen \nsmokescreen. That goes on all the time here. I am on the Budget \nCommittee. The Senator from New Hampshire is the chairman. We sat in \nthe Budget Committee and voted down--I think it was 17 ``no'' votes--as \nthe Democrats sought to add $128 billion over the next 5 years. Then \nthe debate moved to the floor, and they tried to add $273 billion over \nthe next 5 years.\n  So I guess it is all right to be fiscally irresponsible, but at least \nyou ought to stand up and say: Yes, I am the one doing it. I am the one \nwho has the good idea and then does not want to pay for it--which is \nexactly what the Reid amendment does.\n  The Senator from New York said: Oh, there must be other ways to pay \nfor it. Why doesn't she suggest one? Why doesn't she cut something?\n  The Gregg amendment does not cut anything. This is a supplemental \nemergency appropriation for the war on terror. The war on terror is \nmostly in Iraq\n\n[[Page S3537]]\n\nand Afghanistan and in the Middle East, but it is also along our \nsouthwest border. I believe the Senator from New Hampshire believes \nthat, and I believe most American people believe that. I believe it is \nappropriate to include that with the additional money that we are \nappropriating to support our men and women in uniform.\n  So the false choice--the false choice--is to stand up and say: We \nwant to support border security, but we have no money to pay for it. \nThat puts you on a list of big spenders. So as it stands today, the \nGregg amendment is the responsible amendment. And the Senator, I am \nsure, will speak, as I have spoken earlier, on exactly what it does to \nhelp maintain our current infrastructure.\n  The Reid amendment is the identical amendment, except it is a \nsmokescreen. There is no way to pay for it. So as to the list of those \non the Reid amendment, those votes will be a handy list of big \nspenders, which can be taken to your blog, which can be taken to your \ndinner table. And when somebody says: Who is it in Washington who keeps \ncoming up with these good ideas but then never pays for it with real \ndollars, and so as a result we have runaway spending, then you will \nhave a list of people who do that.\n  This is not about the last 5 years. It is not about the next 5 years. \nIt is about today's vote: the Gregg amendment, which is the border \nsecurity paid for amendment; or the Reid amendment, which is the same \namendment not paid for.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I appreciate the very concise and accurate \nsummation of this amendment, its purposes, and how it would affect \nspending by the Senator from Tennessee. I do think it is appropriate to \nrespond even a little further on this issue.\n  The purpose of this amendment is to basically give the people who are \ndefending us on our borders--the border security agents, the Customs \nagents, the Coast Guard--the tools they need to do their job right, \nwhich includes the airplanes, the unmanned vehicles, the boats, the \ncars, and the helicopters. That is clearly a critical element of our \nnational defense in the fight in the war on terrorism. It has to be \ndone. It has to be done now.\n  For example, the Senator from Tennessee noted that the one unmanned \nvehicle on the southwest border crashed--it is fairly ironic it would \ncrash this week, but it crashed this week--so we now have none. We need \nto replace that. We not only need to replace it, we have to add about \nthree or four more. It costs money, and this amendment would accomplish \nthat. We know that has to be done if we are going to get the borders \nunder control. With the proper capital support, with the proper \ntechnical support, and with the proper number of people on the border, \nwe can bring the border under control.\n  We are on a path to do that. We added 1,500 agents. We are going to \nadd another 1,500 agents this year. We are adding them as fast as we \ncan hire them. But the problem is hiring is a little difficult because \nthey are high-quality people, and we get about 40,000 applicants for \nevery 1,500 we can hire, so it takes a while to ramp up. But with \nthis capital support, we will have to accomplish that, and we will have \nthe border under control, in the near term. But this argument coming \nfrom the other side: Well, you should not pay for this initiative, is \njust plain wrong. We are a country which, if we are going to remain \nstrong and vibrant, has to be fiscally responsible and set priorities.\n\n  Now, it was my priority, quite honestly my personal priority, that we \npay for this by taking out of the emergency request that came up from \nthe Defense Department a number of items which really are not clearly \nemergencies. They go more to the core operation of the Defense \nDepartment, but I think they were put in the emergency because they \nthought it was maybe a way to pick up those dollars and not have to \nworry about them in their basic underlying budget.\n  I suggested the modernity initiative, which is about $3.5 billion and \nwould essentially have paid for this initiative in the Border Patrol, \nbe taken out and replaced by the Border Patrol needs which are an \nemergency. They are an emergency. The planes are not flying. The UAV \ncrashed. We do not have enough boats. The cars aren't running. The \nfacilities are not there. It is an emergency. The Defense modernity is \nsomething we need to do, but it should be done and built out over the \nbasic defense budget. There are a couple of other items in this \nemergency supplemental that also fall into that category, such as the \nV-22 Osprey purchase.\n  But I went to the people who understand defense spending around here, \nand I said: How should we pay for this? I went to Senator Stevens. My \nstaff talked to Senator Warner's staff, Senator Cochran. And they said \nthey would rather pay for it the way the amendment has been structured \nwith basically an unidentified across-the-board cut--it is not going to \neven be across the board but an unidentified reduction to the overall \nnumber, giving the Defense Department the flexibility to find those \ndollars within the $530 billion they will spend, $2 billion.\n  So to come down here and allege that these funds are going to come \nout of the needs of the people who are on the front lines in Iraq or \nAfghanistan is pure poppycock, pure. And to make that representation is \nhyperbole and waving a red flag, which is totally inappropriate to this \ndebate because if they read the amendment and they recognize how the \namendment was structured, they would know that would never happen. They \ndo know it would never happen. They are down here just trying to get \nattention for their position and make an excuse for why they are not \nwilling to pay for their proposal.\n  The fact that it will not happen is because when you line up Senator \nStevens and Senator Warner and Senator Cochran on one side, and you put \nthe folks who are saying the opposite on the other side, I tend to come \ndown on the side of those three Senators as knowing more about what we \nare going to do and what we need in defense than necessarily the \ncritics of this amendment. These are the people who have stood by our \nDefense Department for not only this year but for generations.\n  When the defense was being cut, savaged basically under the Clinton \nadministration, when it was basically being hollowed out under a \nDemocratic Congress in the early 1990s, it was people like Senator \nStevens and Senator Warner who stood on this floor and tried to stop \nit. It is those folks who have built the Defense Department back up so \nour soldiers have what they need so we have a strong national defense. \nThey came to me and said: We would like to see your amendment done this \nway rather than the way you proposed. And I said: OK. You are the \nexperts. I am perfectly willing to follow your suggestion.\n  So this argument that is being thrown out on the other side is a \nstraw dog. The issue is, as Senator Alexander has framed it, a question \nof whether we are going to set priorities, whether, when we say we are \ngoing to do something about the Border Patrol needs, Coast Guard needs, \nCustoms needs in the area of capital assets--such as planes and \nhelicopters, unmanned vehicles--we are going to do that, and whether we \nare going to prioritize so that goes to the top of the list or close to \nthe top of the list of our national priorities, and so it is paid for \nand is not put into debt.\n  So the choice, as Senator Alexander has reflected, is: Are you going \nto pay for it or aren't you going to pay for it? Are you going to be a \nbig spender or are you going to be somebody who is fiscally \nresponsible?\n  The amendment I have put forward is a fiscally responsible amendment \nwhich will have no negative impact on any soldier who is in the field \nor on our operational capabilities in Afghanistan or Iraq. That \nrepresentation clearly is inappropriate and wrong. I take a little bit \nof umbrage at it.\n\n  I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I wonder if, through the Chair, I might ask the \nSenator from New Hampshire a question. Typically, a piece of \nlegislation that is paid for has a better chance of making it all the \nway through to the end than a piece of legislation that is not paid \nfor; is that not correct?\n\n[[Page S3538]]\n\n  Mr. GREGG. The Senator is absolutely correct. We have attempted in \nthe past to get these capital funds for the Border Patrol without \npaying for it, and the language has been dropped as it worked its way \nthrough the process. This is a priority we should be willing to pay \nfor. As responsible governors of the purse of the American people, we \nshould pay for it rather than just put it on the debt.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. There is some talk about a brazen smokescreen on the \nother side. I suggest the brazen smokescreen might be to first stand up \nand say we are going to have more border security but we are not going \nto pay for it, and then turn around 30 seconds later and claim to be \nthe guardians of fiscal responsibility. You can't do that. That is a \nsmokescreen.\n  Another way to have a brazen smokescreen might be to stand up and \nmake an impassioned speech and say: Let's spend $2 billion for border \nsecurity without paying for it, knowing full well that many amendments \nthat are not paid for then get lost somewhere in the process and never \nare passed. And then the American will people say: What happened over \nthere in the Senate? I saw them say they were for border security, but \nthe money never came through.\n  The American people want us to maintain the border, pay for it, and \ndo it. The Gregg amendment does it. The amendment offered by the \ndistinguished Democratic leader does not.\n  Mr. GREGG. I reserve the remainder of the time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the final \n10 minutes of debate before the votes at noon be equally divided \nbetween the Democratic leader and the majority leader or their \ndesignees, with the final 5 minutes reserved for the majority.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. I suggest the absence of a quorum and ask unanimous \nconsent that the time be applied to both sides equally.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I wish to speak for 5 minutes on the \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is only 3\\1/2\\ minutes remaining.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. If the 3\\1/2\\ minutes is not taken on our side, I \nwill ask unanimous consent for that time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I rise to speak in favor of Senator \nGregg's amendment. I appreciate the job Senator Gregg has done in his \nposition as chairman of the Appropriations Subcommittee on Homeland \nSecurity, which has done so much to try to beef up our borders. Senator \nGregg has been a leading proponent of strengthening control of our \nborders with Mexico and Canada.\n  I think this amendment is a very positive and productive one, adding \n$1.9 billion to homeland security and trying to do the things that \nwould make access through our borders more secure. The US-VISIT \nProgram, which sometimes stifles legitimate commerce on our borders \nwill be provided $60 million. This will be used to integrate the \nbiometric databases so they will work better and we will know who is in \nour country and to allow people who are legitimately in our country to \nbe able to go back and forth. It adds funds for Customs and border \nprotection. It adds money for construction of new stations, checkpoints \nand tactical infrastructure, Immigration and Customs enforcement.\n  I think this is an issue everyone in America is absolutely behind. We \nwant to have control of our borders. I have had meetings with Hispanic-\nAmerican leaders, and I have had meetings with small business people \nwho are on the border, as well as throughout our country. Everyone \nbelieves that as a sovereign Nation and for the security of our \ncountry, we need to control our borders. We had 160,000 other-than-\nMexican illegal aliens entering our country from all over the world \nlast year through the Mexican border. This is unacceptable for a \nsovereign country not to know who is in our country, particularly when \nal-Qaida puts out the word that if you want to penetrate America, go \nthrough the southern border.\n  It is not good for Mexico. Mexico knows there are people coming \nthrough their southern border, all the way through Mexico, sometimes as \na criminal element, and they are doing so to get to the United States.\n  So it is very important that we pass the Gregg amendment. What is \ndifferent about the Gregg amendment from the Reid amendment is that it \nis offset, it is an agreed-to offset, with a reduction in spending in \nother parts of the bill, in order to pay for this effort to secure our \nborders, and strengthen our national security.\n  I think it is so important that we are focusing on the Coast Guard to \nupgrade their patrol aircraft, their ships, and their patrol boats. The \nwhole Gulf of Mexico is a very vulnerable area, and we need to secure \nthe coast, as well as the land border areas.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote for the fully offset Gregg amendment \nthat will beef up our border security at a time when we all know this \nis a first priority.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, for those of us who have served in the \nSenate for the past 5 years, the irony of the amendments before us \ntoday is inescapable. Had the Bush administration fulfilled its \npromises over those years and lived up to its rhetoric about bolstering \nour Nation's border security, there would be no need for the emergency \nsupplemental spending amendments proposed by the distinguished chairman \nof the Homeland Security Subcommittee of the Appropriations Committee \nand the Democratic leader.\n  The administration's failure on this front has not gone unnoticed. In \nDecember of 2005, the 9/11 Commission's Report Card gave the Bush \nadministration a `D' grade for its efforts on border security, and \nspecifically, for its failures in fostering international collaboration \nto improve border security. This is particularly disappointing in light \nof the grandiose statements in February 2001 in which the President \nheralded a new era of cooperation with President Vicente Fox on \nimmigration and border issues.\n  For all its talk and swagger about security, the Bush-Cheney \nadministration has not lived up to its public promises. Just last month \nwe heard about nuclear material being successfully smuggled across our \nborders in a sting operation. Not long after that bombshell, a U.S. \nCitizenship and Immigration Services employee, Michael Maxwell, \ntestified before a House subcommittee about an astonishing culture of \ncorruption, and misdirected priorities in the agency within the \nDepartment of Homeland Security charged with processing immigration \napplications. For an administration that has regularly touted its \ncommitment to national security, it is incomprehensible that the type \nof behavior Mr. Maxwell testified about was occurring in one of our \nmost critical border security agencies.\n  You do not have to take my word for it or read the New York Times to \nsee criticism of this administration's competence when it comes to \nborder security. Take just one day's worth of reports from the \nWashington Times, one of the most conservative papers in the country. \nOn Tuesday, that paper ran a front page story in which it reported that \nU.S. law enforcement officials say that ``[h]undreds of Mexican \nnationals who wear government-issued uniforms, carry official \nidentification cards and are authorized to use weapons are helping \nsmugglers move tons of drugs into the United States.'' This follows \nnumerous reports of uniformed incursions into the United States.\n  On page 3 we read that the Homeland Security Department's inspector \ngeneral has completed a 22-month investigation ``into Syrian nationals \nsuspected of practicing to hijack a plane during a Detroit-to-Los \nAngeles flight.'' The inspector general's public summary says that the \nDepartment needs to better coordinate information on suspicious \npassengers, and on the conflicting jurisdictions of the FBI and Federal \nAir Marshal Service that can\n\n[[Page S3539]]\n\ncompromise investigations of in-flight incidents. Because the 40-page \ninspector general report is classified, its detailed contents have not \nbeen made public, but it involves an incident from June 2004. According \nto the paper, the suspects were traveling under expired visas on one-\nway tickets bought with cash, but that immigration officials had failed \nto report to the airport to detain them.\n  Then on page 13, Tuesday's Washington Times reports about the case of \na high-ranking Iranian official travels in and out of the United States \non a U.S. green card, even though he carries an Iranian passport and is \nreported to be ``an economics and technology aide to Iran's top nuclear \nnegotiator,'' and is reported to have ``joined the Iranian government \nlast year'' and to be a ``high-ranking Iranian official.''\n  The three incidents I have just described are all possible border \nsecurity scandals reported in just one newspaper on just 1 day.\n  Just as gas prices for American consumers have doubled during the \nBush-Cheney administration so, too, have the number of undocumented \nimmigrants within the United States doubled. I do not think that I need \nto remind the American people that the same Government Department that \nso mishandled Katrina and its aftermath is in charge of border \nsecurity. Nor will any of us forget that after 9/11 the immigration \nauthorities were still sending cordial correspondence to dead suicide \nhijackers.\n  Here in Congress, we have met the President's calls for increased \nborder enforcement with authorizations across the board. Indeed, we \nhave often acted, as we are now, to provide additional authorities and \nresources that the administration did not request in order to try to \nforce progress on border security. The administration, however, has not \nlived up to its end of the bargain. Despite the funding mandates of the \nintelligence reform bill that provided for 2,000 new Border Patrol \nagents annually, the President's budget request for 2006 would have \nprovided enough funding to add only 210 Border Patrol agents. That is \n10 percent of what Congress mandated, and not a single new agent would \nhave been assigned to help protect our northern border.\n  What the President has said and what the administration has done \ncouldn't be more different. He has talked about border security, but \nhis priorities in the budget proposals he has sent to Congress shows \nthat his administration values tax cuts for the rich over robust border \nsecurity.\n  It is incomprehensible that almost 5 years after the horrific attacks \nof September 11, only 6 percent of shipping containers entering U.S. \nports are screened. Despite the recommendations of the 9/11 Commission \nand despite Coast Guard recommendations that $5.4 billion is needed for \nport security over a 10-year period, the Republican Congress has \nappropriated only $800 million in grants during the last 5 years. I \ncommend Senator Byrd for the port security additions he has made over \ntime and to this bill. Following its failed effort to approve the Dubai \nPorts deal, the administration has recently made a big show of arrests \nof undocumented workers at one company. Ironically, those recent raids \nemphasize how little this administration has done over the last 5 years \nin terms of interior enforcement and enforcement of prohibitions \nagainst employers' illegal hirings. Where is the President's leadership \non these critical issues?\n\n  I was pleased to see an increase in the President's proposed budget \nto allow for the hiring of 1,500 or more Border Patrol agents in 2007. \nThe Judiciary Committee reported a bipartisan bill that calls for even \nmore agents and investigators than that. But even the 1,500 new agents \nproved to be another hollow promise from the Bush administration. On \ncloser scrutiny, it is clear that the funds to pay for these agents do \nnot exist. The administration's budget also fails to specify whether \nany of these new positions are allocated to the northern border.\n  The President's budget priorities for fiscal year 2007 raise other \nserious concerns, including a proposal to eliminate grants dedicated to \nport security. This short-sighted proposal inexplicably shortchanges \nwhat we know is already a critically vulnerable aspect of our border \nsecurity. It is difficult to reconcile what this President says about \nborder security and what his administration does or does not do.\n  The lack of effectiveness of this administration is represented for \nmany Americans by the Department of Homeland Security's failures to \nprepare for and respond to Hurricane Katrina. It was a disgrace and a \nhuman tragedy. It has been 6 months since the hurricane hit. We know \nthat 1,604 lives were lost, but approximately 1,840 individuals are \nstill listed as ``missing'' or ``whereabouts unknown.'' These numbers \nare astonishing. Is it possible that more lives were taken by Hurricane \nKatrina--a storm that we knew was coming for several days before it \nhit--than on September 11, 2001, when we were attacked without warning? \nWhat is being done to locate these persons and discover if they are \nliving or if their lives were taken in the storm? It is no surprise \nthat Congress is required to force action on border security when we \nconsider how the Bush administration has performed.\n  I support the additional funding for border security in these \namendments, though I do so with the regret that the Bush \nadministration's lack of leadership on this critical issue has brought \nus to this point. Many of the items are the types of expenditures that \nwe are now categorizing as ``emergency spending'' because of more than \n5 years of neglect and incompetence in making them part of our regular \nbudget and spending priorities as they should have been.\n  I conclude by commending the Democratic leader for his amendment. He \nhas recognized a serious concern with the way that the alternative \namendment was drafted. Both amendments contain the same funding. Both \nprovide for long overdue law enforcement communications upgrades. \nSenator Gregg and I have worked on these matters since the tragic Drega \nincidents that affected our States demonstrated this critical need. \nBoth amendments contain funding for border patrol vehicles and \nsurveillance technology. Years ago it was a Vermont agent who helped \ndevelop remote sensors for border patrol purposes. Both contain almost \n$800 million for helicopter replacement and other air patrol and \nsurveillance needs. Both contain $600 million for the Coast Guard \nvessels, aircraft, and equipment that is needed. Some of the other \ninclusions are less essential but I will not quibble with the \nsubcommittee chairman or the Democratic leader who both include the \nsame items and dollar amounts.\n  The difference between the amendments is a significant one, however, \nas the Democratic leader has explained. He supports, we all support, \nincreased border security. But his amendment ensures that these \nadditions are not paid for by taking funds from the emergency funding \nrecommended for the needs of troops fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan or \nfrom the needs of those victimized by Hurricane Katrina in the gulf \nregion. We should not be cutting pay and benefits for our National \nGuard, Active Duty and Reserve troops. We should not be cutting Iraqi \nsecurity force training funding. We should not be cutting the Joint \nImprovised Explosive Device Defeat Fund that is intended to protect our \ntroops from the scourge of deadly IEDs that threaten them in Iraq. We \nshould not be cutting but should be improving health programs for out \nveterans and, sadly, the death benefits for their families. I agree \nwith Senator Reid and will support his amendment to better secure our \nborders and years of neglect but will do so without shortchanging the \nneeds of the troops whom the President has committed to fighting in \nIraq, and that we all authorized be sent to Afghanistan.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the Senate will vote today on two amendments \nto provide $1.9 billion of critical resources to enhance our border \nsecurity. I will vote for both amendments.\n  Last month, the Senate began debate on immigration and border \nsecurity legislation, part of which would authorize a whole host of \nitems intended to secure our borders. The legislation would authorize \nthe hiring of additional Border Patrol agents. The legislation would \nauthorize the hiring of additional immigration enforcement agents and \ndetention officers. It would authorize border surveillance technology \nand unmanned aerial vehicles. However, the immigration bill is just an \nauthorization bill. If you are serious\n\n[[Page S3540]]\n\nabout border security, you must approve real dollars.\n  Yesterday, the administration sent Congress a Statement of \nAdministration Policy on the pending emergency supplemental bill. I \nwill ask that the statement be printed in the Record. In this \nstatement, the President threatens to veto the bill if it exceeds $94.5 \nbillion. He opposes providing disaster aid to our farmers impacted by \ndrought and hurricanes. He opposes funding for 31 States to repair \nhighways that were damaged by floods, and other disasters. He fails to \nendorse critical investments in port security.\n  By threatening to veto the bill if it exceeds $94.5 billion, he \nforces the Congress to make very difficult tradeoffs. By endorsing \nadditional border security funding while capping the bill at $94.5 \nbillion, the President is supporting cuts in his own request for the \nDepartment of Defense, or for aiding the victims of Hurricane Katrina.\n  I think this tradeoff is unnecessary and unfortunate. That is why I \nwill vote for the Reid amendment. However, Chairman Gregg has done an \nexcellent job in crafting the $1.9 billion package of border security \ninvestments. If the only way to get the additional border security \nfunds is to accept the President's position requiring offsets, then, in \nthis case, I will vote for the Gregg amendment as well.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the before mentioned statement be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                   Statement of Administration Policy\n\n\n H.R. 4939--Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act for Defense, the \n           Global War on Terror, and Hurricane Recovery, 2006\n\n     (Sponsors: Cochran (R), Mississippi; Byrd (D), West Virginia)\n\n       The Administration supports expeditious Senate passage of \n     an FY 2006 Emergency Supplemental for the Global War on \n     Terror and Hurricane Relief as requested by the President. \n     The Administration commends the Committee for its continued \n     support for our ongoing military and intelligence operations \n     in the Global War on Terror (GWOT), other international \n     activities, and hurricane relief and reconstruction. The \n     Senate reported bill also included $2.3 billion in emergency \n     funds for pandemic influenza preparedness and prevention \n     included in the President's Budget for FY 2007. The \n     Administration wants to work with Congress to secure \n     enactment of pandemic influenza funding before October 1, \n     2006, and believes this is an appropriate vehicle to ensure \n     the funding is available when it is needed.\n       However, the Senate reported bill substantially exceeds the \n     President's request, primarily for items that are unrelated \n     to the GWOT and hurricane response. The Administration is \n     seriously concerned with the overall funding level and the \n     numerous unrequested items included in the Senate bill that \n     are unrelated to the war or emergency hurricane relief needs. \n     The final version of the legislation must remain focused on \n     addressing urgent national priorities while maintaining \n     fiscal discipline. Accordingly, if the President is \n     ultimately presented a bill that provides more than $92.2 \n     billion, exclusive of funding for the President's plan to \n     address pandemic influenza. he will veto the bill.\n       In addition, today the President sent to Congress a \n     revision to the Administration's pending supplemental \n     request, asking for an additional $2.2 billion for the U.S. \n     Army Corps of Engineers to heighten and strengthen levees in \n     New Orleans. This additional funding is fully offset by a \n     corresponding reduction to the previous request for the \n     Disaster Relief Fund and assumes a non-Federal share for a \n     portion of the work. The Administration urges the Senate to \n     amend the bill to incorporate this revised request during its \n     consideration of the bill.\n       The Administration would like to take this opportunity to \n     share additional views regarding the Committee's version of \n     the bill.\n     Global War on Terror (GWOT)\n       The Administration appreciates the Committee's strong \n     commitments to the President's funding request for ongoing \n     military operations in the GWOT. The Administration also \n     commends the Committee for funding the President's request \n     for international funding for counter-insurgency and \n     stabilization activities in Iraq and urgent, unanticipated \n     needs to help relieve human suffering, including in Sudan and \n     other parts of Africa.\n       The Administration appreciates the Committee's full support \n     for the training of the Iraqi Security Forces, but opposes \n     the $290 million reduction from the President's request of \n     $2.2 billion for the Afghan Security Forces Fund (ASFF). \n     This reduction to ASFF would set back efforts to build \n     police forces by denying them the ability to operate from \n     secure, functional, and economical facilities. Such \n     setbacks hamper the effort to build cohesive units able to \n     secure the peace and foster continued democratic \n     transition in Afghanistan.\n       Similarly, the Administration opposes the reduction of \n     funding for coalition support by more than one-half, or $760 \n     million. Failure to fund this effort through the end of the \n     calendar year would jeopardize continued coalition partner \n     support and a shared coalition responsibility for success in \n     Iraq and Afghanistan this fall and winter.\n       The Administration opposes the reduction in requested \n     transfer authority, particularly the failure to increase \n     general transfer authority from $3.75 billion to $5 billion. \n     The lack of additional transfer authority and needed \n     flexibility will hamper the Department of Defense's (DOD's) \n     ability to ensure that funding goes to the most pressing \n     requirements.\n       The Administration appreciates the Committee's support for \n     military pay and allowance programs, but notes that the \n     increase of over $500 million for these programs should have \n     been appropriated in the base appropriations bill for FY \n     2006. The Administration opposes the inclusion of unrequested \n     procurement funding while reducing critical funds for \n     supporting combat missions in Iraq and for responding to \n     unanticipated requirements. The Committee reduces $104 \n     million from the Army's Operation and Maintenance account \n     that is intended to sustain Iraqi military forces operating \n     side-by-side with American units.\n       The Administration appreciates the Committee's support for \n     the National and Military Intelligence Programs. However, the \n     bill funds the National Intelligence Program at a higher \n     level than requested, particularly for the National \n     Reconnaissance Office. The Administration urges the Senate to \n     redirect this funding to restore other reductions to the \n     President's request.\n       In addition, the Administration is concerned about the $13 \n     million rescission to the Export-Import Bank's subsidy \n     appropriations that are available for tied-aid grants, which \n     help deter or defend against trade distortions caused by \n     government-to-government concessional financing of public \n     sector capital projects in developing countries.\n     Hurricane Disaster Relief and Recovery\n       The Administration appreciates the Committee's support for \n     the request for FEMA's Disaster Relief Fund. However, the \n     Administration is concerned that the additional $1.2 billion \n     provided far exceeds what is needed for the new ``alternative \n     housing pilot program'' authorized in the bill. Such a pilot \n     program should maintain the Department of Housing and Urban \n     Development as the lead agency for longer-term and permanent \n     housing initiatives, and focus on cost-effective alternatives \n     that treat severely affected communities equitably.\n       The Committee provides $5.2 billion in Community \n     Development Block Grant funds, $1 billion above the request. \n     The Administration is concerned that the bill would permit \n     funding to all affected States rather than limiting it to \n     Louisiana, as requested, because Louisiana faces unique needs \n     to mitigate future flood risk and address other housing \n     concerns. The Administration also believes that designation \n     of $1 billion of the total for affordable rental housing is \n     unnecessary and hampers the ability of local communities \n     to prioritize funding based on local needs and citizen \n     input.\n       The Administration commends the Committee for supporting \n     the President's proposed actions to strengthen the Greater \n     New Orleans hurricane protection system, including providing \n     needed authorization for levee improvements and restoration \n     of wetlands. Today the Administration is transmitting a \n     proposal to Congress to authorize and fund actions needed to \n     certify the majority of the levee system in the New Orleans \n     area and, where needed, replace floodwalls. The \n     Administration requests that Congress support the revised \n     request, which is fully offset by a reduction to the Disaster \n     Relief Fund request.\n       The Administration urges the Senate to eliminate section \n     2303, which instructs the Navy to adjust shipbuilding \n     contracts for business disruptions that contractors incurred \n     as a result of the hurricanes in 2005, for several reasons. \n     First, it would require the Navy to cover shipbuilding costs \n     that are routinely borne by private insurance, creating an \n     incentive for insurance companies to deny payments. Expanding \n     the scope of the Navy's liability would also limit \n     flexibility in future contract negotiations because \n     shipbuilders could claim business disruption for years to \n     come. Second, Federal Acquisition Regulations expressly \n     disallow insurable losses and already adequately evaluate the \n     costs at issue in the shipbuilding contracts. Third, the \n     legislation would require the Navy to cover business \n     disruption costs of any affected shipyard--including those \n     completely unrelated to DOD.\n       The Administration also opposes the $594 million provided \n     for Federal Highway Emergency Relief for requirements \n     unrelated to the Gulf hurricanes, and the $200 million \n     provided to the Federal Transit Administration, which was not \n     requested.\n       The Administration strongly objects to the $700 million \n     included in the Senate bill to relocate the privately owned \n     rail line that runs along the Mississippi Gulf Coast. The CSX \n     Corporation, using its own resources, has already repaired \n     damage to the line, and trains are now running. Relocating \n     the tracks would represent a substantial investment beyond \n     pre-disaster conditions and would improperly require U.S. \n     taxpayers to pay for private sector infrastructure.\n\n[[Page S3541]]\n\n       The Senate is also urged to eliminate other unrequested and \n     unnecessary funding and programmatic waivers in the bill, \n     such as that included for the National Aeronautics and Space \n     Administration, private historic residences, USDA debris \n     removal and rural development programs, Job Corps \n     construction, National Civilian Community Corps, Army Corps \n     projects and reprogramming activities, and grants for Federal \n     law enforcement.\n     Other Items\n       The Administration understands that an amendment may be \n     offered to add additional funding for border security \n     efforts. The Administration believes that such funding can \n     significantly complement comprehensive immigration reform \n     that provides enhanced border security and increased interior \n     enforcement efforts and creates a temporary worker program \n     that does not provide amnesty and allows new citizens to \n     fully assimilate into their communities. The Administration \n     looks forward to working with Congress to ensure that any \n     additional funding provided for these purposes is targeted to \n     address enforcement challenges on the Nation's borders most \n     effectively.\n       The Administration strongly opposes the Committee's \n     agricultural assistance proposal, totaling nearly $4 billion. \n     The 2002 Farm Bill was designed, when combined with crop \n     insurance, to eliminate the need for ad hoc disaster \n     assistance. In 2005, many crops had record or near-record \n     production, and U.S. farm sector cash receipts were the \n     second highest ever. Furthermore, the proposed level of \n     assistance is excessive and may over-compensate certain \n     producers for their losses.\n       The Administration appreciates the Committee's support for \n     the President's proposed funding to rebuild a National \n     Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration facility, assess \n     fishery resources, and provide mapping to assist debris \n     removal. However, the Administration strongly objects to the \n     additional $1.1 billion provided for the Department of \n     Commerce. Providing direct income assistance would constitute \n     preferential treatment for fishing industry participants, who \n     are already eligible for other sources of assistance. In \n     addition, the Committee provides substantial funding for non-\n     emergency needs such as a promotion campaign for seafood.\n       The Administration urges the Senate to remove a provision \n     prohibiting the use of funds to implement a final rule \n     regarding foreign control of U.S. airlines. The \n     Administration is committed to working with the Congress to \n     address concerns with the rule.\n       The Administration objects to restrictions on the \n     Bonneville Power Administration's (BPA) ability to use a \n     portion of its secondary revenues to pay down debt owed to \n     the Treasury. The Administration's proposal is consistent \n     with sound business principles and would provide BPA with \n     more financial flexibility to meet its long-term capital \n     investment needs.\n       The Administration appreciates the Committee's support for \n     the Administration's previous request for pandemic influenza \n     prevention and preparedness activities and looks forward to \n     working with the Congress to ensure this funding is allocated \n     in the most effective manner possible to achieve our \n     preparedness and prevention goals.\n     Constitutional Concerns\n       The language under the heading, ``State and Local Law \n     Enforcement, Office of Justice Programs,'' purports to \n     require that the Attorney General consult with Congress prior \n     to obligating funds. Because this provision would infringe on \n     separation of powers, it should be modified to be permissive.\n       In addition, Section 2503 of the bill purports to require \n     approval of the Committees prior to the obligation of funds. \n     This provision should be changed to require only notification \n     of Congress, since any other interpretation would contradict \n     the Supreme Court's ruling in INS v. Chadha.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I support the increased funding for \nborder security that is provided by the Gregg and Reid amendments. This \nfunding for replacing and upgrading the equipment and vehicles that we \nneed to protect our borders is vital to our security. Of course, border \nsecurity alone will not solve our immigration problem, and I am \ncommitted to working toward comprehensive immigration reform. But \nproviding much needed resources to those who are working to secure our \nborders is a critical part of guaranteeing our national security and \ndealing with our broken immigration system.\n  Although both amendments would provide this funding, only Senator \nGregg's was offset. The spending of this Republican-controlled Congress \nhas been out of control, and it is beyond time to rein it in. The Gregg \namendment is a start. The 2.75-percent cut to the defense portions of \nthis bill will not come out of important items to protect our troops. I \nwould never consider supporting any measure that threatened their \nsafety. This is supposed to be an emergency funding bill, but there are \nbillions of dollars of nonemergency items in the bloated defense \nportion of this bill that have nothing to do with protecting our troops \nand have no business in this supplemental--items that can be cut to pay \nfor the real border security needs funded in both amendments. Some \nexamples include the unrequested funding for V-22 Ospreys and C-17s and \nthe clearly nonemergency Army modularity program. Our spending on our \nnational security is also completely imbalanced, with almost all \nresources going to the Department of Defense and very little to other \nimportant national security priorities such as border security and the \nU.S. Coast Guard. The Gregg amendment brings back some balance to our \nspending.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I rise today to express my opposition to the amendment \nput forward by Senator Gregg to the emergency supplemental \nappropriations bill--an amendment to provide additional funding for \nborder security at the expense of the U.S. Armed Forces.\n  While I certainly support the goal of providing an additional $1.9 \nbillion to secure our Nation's borders, it is completely unconscionable \nto cut funding for our military men and women at a time when they are \nrisking their lives in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n  Let me explain how Senator Gregg's amendment would hurt our military.\n  The Gregg amendment cuts Department of Defense programs included in \nthis bill. This includes critical funding, such as funding for the \nmilitary personnel account--which provides pay and benefits for Active-\nDuty, Guard and Reserve troops--and the Defense Health Program, which \nis responsible for providing our troops with medical assistance.\n  Funding for the training of Iraqi security forces is included, as \nwell. We know this mission is critical to our success in Iraq and the \nability to bring home our brave servicemembers.\n  The bill also includes funding for the Joint Improvised Explosive \nDevice Defeat Fund, which provides assistance to our troops seeking to \neliminate IEDs the leading cause of death for U.S. troops in Iraq.\n  Furthermore, the Death Gratuity Fund, which provides assistance to \nthe families of fallen soldiers, is included in this bill.\n  Senator Gregg's amendment seeks to secure our borders but does so by \nreducing much-needed funding for the men and women fighting for our \ncountry every day. This is unacceptable.\n  While I oppose Senator Gregg's amendment, I am pleased to support \nSenator Reid's amendment. The Reid amendment also provides nearly $2 \nbillion in additional funding for our Nation's border security but \nwithout dangerous funding cuts that would harm our troops.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, how much time is remaining on the \nDemocratic side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 4\\1/2\\ minutes remaining.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, the news this morning tells us Secretary \nof Defense Donald Rumsfeld is in Iraq. That is a good thing. It is a \ngood thing for the leaders of our Government to be in touch in the \nfield to let them know we are on their side. I am glad the Secretary is \nthere. I know when he visits there, he often learns things--things that \nhelp us wage this war more effectively.\n  Do you remember not so long ago when Secretary of Defense Donald \nRumsfeld had an open meeting with the soldiers in Iraq? He invited them \nto comment on how the war was going. A member of the Tennessee National \nGuard stood up and said: Mr. Secretary, why as a soldier do I have to \ndig through a dump to find a piece of metal to put in my humvee to \nprotect me and my fellow soldiers? Why has it come to this?\n  It was a moment of great embarrassment for the Secretary. It was a \nmoment of embarrassment for our Nation. We ask these young men and \nwomen to take an oath to defend this country and risk their lives in \nuniform for us every day. We stand and sit in the comfort of this \nChamber on Capitol Hill with all of the protection around us, and they \nwake up every morning putting on a uniform knowing it may be their last \nday on Earth.\n  Now take a look at this amendment. Take a close look at this \namendment. This amendment is designed to give us better control of our \nborders, and we need it. Our borders are out of control. There are \n500,000 illegal people crossing\n\n[[Page S3542]]\n\nthem every year, at least. We know that has to change, not just because \nof the immigration issue, a terrible challenge to America to get it \nright, but because of security. So we all support, on both sides of the \naisle, more resources at the borders, more people, more technology, \nbetter efforts to stop this illegal flow of immigration.\n  It is a serious problem, and we should take it seriously. That is why \nthe Democratic leader, Senator Reid, has offered this amendment, an \namendment which provides the resources for the border. He says it is an \nemergency; it should be treated as such. I couldn't agree with him \nmore.\n  But listen to the other side of the aisle. Senator Gregg on the \nRepublican side said we can only pay for border security at the expense \nof soldiers in the field. He takes the roughly $2 billion out of the \nmilitary account to make our borders stronger. That is not fair to the \nsoldiers. It is not fair to the men and women who are risking their \nlives every day in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n  We know we have failed them many times. This administration has \nfailed to provide the body armor these troops needed. Senator Dodd of \nConnecticut had to offer an amendment to allow ordinary American \nfamilies to deduct from their taxes the cost of body armor that they \nwould buy for their soldiers which they sent overseas. I have met them \nin Illinois, families who said: I got tired of waiting for the Army to \ngive my son protection; my wife and I bought it ourselves.\n  Another one said: We had a little potluck supper at church to raise \nmoney for body armor for our soldiers.\n  Think about that. We know about these humvees. They were death traps \nfor entirely too long. They were not well protected. We know what \nhappened. We had helicopters in the field that didn't have good defense \ndevices, and they were shot down.\n  Now the Republican side says let's take more money away from the \ndefense of our soldiers so our borders are more secure. What a terrible \nchoice to ask of this Senate, but what an easy choice for many of us.\n  I am not going to take money away from these soldiers. This Senator \nvoted against this war in Iraq, but I have voted to give this President \nand this administration every penny they have asked for to wage this \nwar for one basic reason. I thought to myself: What if it were my son \nor daughter, would I want them to have the best equipment and best \nsupplies, even if I felt the foreign policy was wrong? You bet. And \nwhen it comes to this choice in this amendment, it is very clear. We \ncan take the Republican approach of making our borders safer while \nmaking our soldiers less safe, or we can take the approach which \nSenator Reid is suggesting: Declare this an emergency at our borders \nthat deserves emergency status.\n  Isn't it interesting, when it comes down to these choices, so many on \nthe Republican side of the aisle say: Now we are going to be fiscal \nconservatives, fiscal conservatives at the expense of our soldiers. It \nis plain wrong.\n  I ask my colleagues: Read these amendments carefully. Understand the \nstark choice we are being given. Support Senator Reid's amendment which \ndeclares it an emergency to have strong enforcement at the borders but \nnot at the expense of our men and women in uniform who risk their lives \nwhile we stand in the safety of this Capitol Building.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I have the greatest respect for the chairman \nof the Budget Committee, the distinguished senior Senator from New \nHampshire, but he is absolutely wrong on this issue. I heard his \nimpassioned statement that this is no problem; anyone who says this is \na problem, they haven't read the bill.\n  The amendment is written in English. It is very clear:\n\n       The aggregate amount provided by . . . chapter 3 of title \n     II of this Act may not exceed $67,062,188,000.\n\n  The amendment takes $1.9 billion from this bill. It seems rather \nunusual to me that on an emergency appropriations bill--this bill--\neverything in it is being paid for, like everything else around here, \nby the American taxpayers. This, I am sorry to say--like most of what \nhas been paid for in the past 5\\1/2\\ years in the Bush administration--\nis being paid by my children, their children, their children's \nchildren. Deficit spending and suddenly there is a concern about this.\n  Our concern is that money that should go to our gallant troops in \nIraq and Afghanistan will not go to them if the amendment that has been \noffered by the Senator from New Hampshire is adopted.\n  What are these cuts? They are cuts to the military personnel account, \noperations and maintenance, Iraqi security forces training, the \nimprovised explosive device defeat fund, defense health program. What \nare these programs? No matter what my friend from New Hampshire says, \nthe $2 billion has to come from someplace, and this is what is in this \nbill:\n  Military personnel account: This includes hardship pay for those in \nthe line of fire--I think people in Afghanistan and Iraq who are \nserving in our military qualify for that--and family separation pay for \nthose who are forced to serve in combat zones away from their families.\n  Is this what we want, for men and women currently serving in Iraq and \nAfghanistan not to get this pay I have outlined?\n  The operations and maintenance accounts provide resources for the \nday-to-day needs of our military. This money allows our forces to \nconduct operations against insurgents in Iraq and Afghanistan. It \nincludes money for nuts-and-bolts activities--the airlifts, the \ntransportation, and other logistical missions. It also provides for the \nCommander's Emergency Response Program which gives resources to \ncommanders on the front lines to support humanitarian reconstruction \nprojects. If a commander in the streets of Baghdad wants to put up a \npower line that was knocked down, this account gives them tools to do \nthat. Is this what we want to cut?\n  As the President has said time and again, as foreign troops stand up, \nwe can stand down. This account is what will help us ensure foreign \ntroops are able to stand up. It is the money that we use to assist the \nGovernments of Iraq and Afghanistan to assume increased responsibility \nfor their Nation's security. Is this what we want to cut? I hope not.\n  The joint improvised explosive device defeat account: Explosive \ndevices every day are a threat to our forces in Iraq. This account \ndirects money helping our troops to spot these IEDs and defuse them. \nThese people in Iraq are very ingenious. We figure out a way to stop \nthem from using a certain method, and they figure out a way to go \naround that. We need to stay ahead of them. We are not doing a very \ngood job of that, and cutting money from this account isn't going to \nhelp. Our troops need resources so they can keep up with everchanging \nenemy tactics. This account will help them do that.\n  Defense health program: This is money for health care for our \ntroops--and their families--who are serving today in Iraq. It is their \nhealth care.\n  The choice here is pretty direct: If the amendment offered by the \nSenator from New Hampshire is adopted, we will have added border \nsecurity.\n  Mr. President, I will use my leader time now.\n  If the amendment offered by the Senator from New Hampshire is \nadopted, we will have improved border security, and that is important. \nIf there were ever an emergency, this is it. If my amendment is \nadopted, we will have increased border protection. But with my \namendment, we pay for it as we do everything else in this bill--in this \nbill. I think it is rather unusual to have the majority coming to the \nfloor now suddenly with qualms of conscience about these deficits that \nhave been run up by President Bush and his administration--trillions of \ndollars, not billions, trillions.\n  I am not willing to vote to cut the military personnel account, \noperations and maintenance, Iraqi security forces training, explosive \ndevice defeat fund, the defense health program, or the death gratuity \nfund. I am not willing to cut those programs. I want border security. \nIt is important. I was 3 weeks ago today on the border. If there ever \nwas an emergency and we need to do something, it is this program. I \ndon't make any apologies for saying this situation on the border is an \nemergency.\n\n[[Page S3543]]\n\nIt is an emergency, like other matters in this bill.\n  I hope that on a bipartisan basis we will vote to give the troops \neverything they need and also do a better job of protecting our \nborders.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Murkowski). The majority leader.\n  Mr. FRIST. Madam President, in a few moments we will begin the votes \non these two amendments. I wish to say right up front that I applaud \nand congratulate Senator Judd Gregg, chairman of the Appropriations \nSubcommittee on Homeland Security, for having as the very first \namendment on the supplemental request an amendment that focuses on \nborder security, on national security, on tightening the borders that \nwe all know are too porous. It shows good leadership. It shows \npriorities in this being the first amendment to tighten the borders and \nstrong border enforcement.\n  Actually, the first step was taken last year by Senator Gregg, when \nwe were on this floor, under his leadership, and funded an additional \n1,400 border guards, as well as 1,800 detention beds, a strong \nstatement recognizing the importance of addressing border security. \nThis is step two today in addressing more the capital expenditures, the \nequipment, the infrastructure which we know those border guards require \nto guard that border.\n  A key element of our security, of our global war on terrorism, \nindeed, is securing our Nation's borders, and this amendment takes that \nnext major step in that direction by providing $1.9 billion for \nimproving that border infrastructure.\n  The Democratic leader just mentioned he had been on the southern \nborder. I have been on the southern border. It doesn't take long to \nwitness for every one person detained and stopped, there are two or \nthree people who sneak around that border, and that is as many as 2 to \n3 million people a year who come to this country. We don't know who \nthey are, why they are here, or what their intentions are. For this \nparticular amendment, there are a number of things we have talked about \nover the course of the morning. It will provide needed funds to upgrade \nan outdated P-3 aircraft fleet that is used for surveillance along our \nborders. When you are there and you look at that 1,900 mile border, you \nknow how important it is to have those surveillance aircraft to be able \nto look down and identify along that long expanse people coming across \nillegally. It will provide needed funding for a number of unmanned \naerial vehicles operating along our southwest border. As we talked \nabout already today, it is amazing that we only have one UAV, unmanned \naerial vehicle, which has worked very effectively, but--I said we \nhave--we had, because literally that aircraft crashed yesterday morning \nwhile serving along that Arizona border.\n\n  The amendment will provide additional resources for continued \nconstruction of the border fence--the fence itself, the physical \nstructure--near San Diego.\n  This first amendment also sets what is a very important standard \nframework, a fiscal spending framework as we begin debate on this \nemergency funding bill. The initiative included in the amendment put \nforward by our side of the aisle--we initiated this amendment for the \ntightening of border security--is paid for in the bill itself, and that \nis a very important framework which I hope we can continue to use for \nabsolutely necessary emergency spending as we look at the rest of this \nbill.\n  Securing our borders is the first step for any action we need to take \nin terms of more comprehensive reform of immigration, an issue we \ndebated for 2 weeks on the floor beginning about a month ago and an \nissue we will come back to. But border security is first, it is \nforemost. I feel strongly that we need to look at workplace enforcement \nand interior enforcement and a temporary worker program as well, and we \nwill come back to that later. But now is the time for us to say \nforcefully that we are serious about tightening that border, and we \nwill provide the resources, the personnel, and capital infrastructure \nto do just that.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that it now be in order to \nask for the yeas and nays on both amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FRIST. Madam President, I now ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There appears to \nbe a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to amendment No. 3594. The clerk will \ncall the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

(a) Findings.--Congress makes the following \n     findings:\n       (1) As part of the United States effort to bring democracy \n     and freedom to Iraq and Afghanistan, employees of a broad \n     range of Federal agencies are needed to serve in those \n     countries, furnishing expertise to their counterpart agencies \n     in the Government of Iraq and the Government of Afghanistan.\n       (2) While the heads of a number of Federal agencies already \n     possess authority to provide to their personnel on official \n     duty abroad allowances, benefits, and death gratuities \n     comparable to those provided by the Secretary of State to \n     similarly-situated Foreign Service personnel on official duty \n     abroad, other agency heads do not possess such authority.\n       (3) In order to assist the United States Government in \n     recruiting personnel to serve in Iraq and Afghanistan, and to \n     avoid inequities in allowances, benefits, and death \n     gratuities among similarly-situated United States Government \n     civilian personnel on official duty in these countries, it is \n     essential that the heads of all agencies that have personnel \n     on official duty in Iraq and Afghanistan have the same basic \n     authority with respect to allowances, benefits, and death \n     gratuities for such personnel.\n       (b) In General.--During any fiscal year, the head of an \n     agency may, in the agency head's discretion, provide to an \n     individual employed by, or assigned or detailed to, such \n     agency allowances, benefits, and gratuities comparable to \n     those provided by the Secretary of State to members of the \n     Foreign Service under section 413 and chapter 9 of title I of \n     the Foreign Service Act of 1980 (22 U.S.C. 3973; 4081 et \n     seq.), if such individual is on official duty in Iraq or \n     Afghanistan.\n       (c) Construction.--Nothing in this section shall be \n     construed to impair or otherwise affect the authority of the \n     head of an agency under any other provision of law.\n       (d) Applicability of Certain Authorities.--Section 912(a) \n     of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 shall apply with respect \n     to amounts received as allowances or otherwise under this \n     section in the same manner as section 912 of the Internal \n     Revenue Code of 1986 applies with respect to amounts received \n     by members of the Foreign Service as allowances or otherwise \n     under chapter 9 of title I of the Foreign Service Act of \n     1980.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, the U.S. Navy today very proudly has 12 \naircraft carriers on active service. That is a figure that was acted \nupon by this body and the other body and enacted into law, instructing \nthe Commander in Chief, the President, and the Secretary of Defense to \nmaintain no less than 12 carriers in our fleet.\n  Subsequent to the legislation by the Congress, and the law enacted, \nthe Navy has determined that the USS John F. Kennedy--a ship that bears \na name in which every Member of this Chamber takes a deep and abiding \npride--that ship is now 38 years old and is, in the judgment of the \nChief of Naval Operations, not qualified to perform her primary mission \nof aviation operations. And she is not deployable without a significant \ninvestment of resources. By that I mean to return her to her primary \nmission would require an inordinate amount of money to go into \nreconstruction of the launching and arresting gear, the main \npowerplant, steam-powered plant. She is a conventional as opposed to a \nnuclear-powered carrier.\n  It is a decision of the Department of the Navy that those \nexpenditures on a ship 38 years old are simply not prudent, not in the \nbest interests of the Navy, and those funds should be directed towards \nnew ship construction.\n  As to the risks inherent to naval aviation--and they are very \nsignificant risks to all of us who have been aboard those carriers and \nwatched aircraft take off and land--and as to maintaining her at sea, \nat this point in time she cannot perform that primary mission. \nTherefore, the purpose of this amendment is to revise the previous \nlegislation such that the Secretary of the Navy can retire this ship.\n  Now, I recognize to many it is a painful thing to realize this ship \ncan no longer serve. But these are the consequences, if we were not to \nenact this legislation: Each month there is a delay on a decision--the \ndecision being not acting on this piece of legislation--costs the Navy \n$20 million in operations and manpower funds, funds that are sorely \nneeded elsewhere by the Navy.\n  It puts an extraordinary burden upon the sailors who are proudly \nattached to this ship and deep in their hearts regret that ship can no \nlonger perform its primary mission. And it puts a burden on their \nfamilies. There have to be adjustments in their new assignments--moves, \ntransfers, and all the other personnel actions that are essential to \nmaintain our fleets throughout the world.\n  Madam President, as I said, I rise today to offer an important piece \nof legislation related to our Navy and national security.\n  The Department of Defense has submitted its report to the Congress on \nthe Quadrennial Defense Review for 2005 and, as we are all well aware, \nin the 4 years since the previous Quadrennial Defense Review the global \nwar on terror has dramatically broadened the demands on our naval \ncombat forces. In response, the Navy has implemented fundamental \nchanges to fleet deployment practices that have increased total force \navailability, and it has fielded advances in ship systems, aircraft, \nand precision weapons that have\n\n[[Page S3545]]\n\nprovided appreciably greater combat power than 4 years ago.\n  However, we must consider that the Navy is at its smallest size in \ndecades, and the threat of emerging naval powers superimposed upon the \nNavy's broader mission of maintaining global maritime security requires \nthat we modernize and expand our Navy.\n  The longer view dictated by naval force structure planning requires \nthat we invest today to ensure maritime dominance 15 years and further \nin the future; investment to modernize our aircraft carrier force, to \nincrease our expeditionary capability, to maintain our undersea \nsuperiority, and to develop the ability to penetrate the littorals with \nthe same command we possess today in the open seas.\n  The 2005 Quadrennial Defense Review impresses these critical \nrequirements against the backdrop of the National Defense Strategy and \nconcludes that the Navy must build a larger fleet. This determination \nis in whole agreement with concerns raised by Congress as the rate of \nshipbuilding declined over the past 15 years. Now we must finance this \ncritical modernization, and in doing so we must strike an affordable \nbalance between existing and future force structure.\n  The centerpiece of the Navy's force structure is the carrier strike \ngroup, and the evaluation of current and future aircraft carrier \ncapabilities by the Quadrennial Defense Review has concluded that 11 \naircraft carriers provide the decisively superior combat capability \nrequired by the National Defense Strategy. Carefully considering this \nconclusion, we must weigh the risk of reducing the naval force from 12 \nto 11 aircraft carriers against the risk of failing to modernize the \nnaval force.\n  Maintaining 12 aircraft carriers would require extending the service \nlife and continuing to operate the USS John F. Kennedy, CV-67.\n  The compelling reality is that today the 38-year-old USS John F. \nKennedy, CV-67, is not qualified to perform her primary mission of \naviation operations, and she is not deployable without a significant \ninvestment of resources. Recognizing the great complexity and the risks \ninherent to naval aviation, there are very real concerns regarding the \nability to maintain the Kennedy in an operationally safe condition for \nour sailors at sea.\n  In the final assessment, the costs to extend the service life and to \nsafely operate and deploy this aging aircraft carrier in the future \nprove prohibitive when measured against the critical need to invest in \nmodernizing the naval force.\n  Meanwhile, each month that we delay on this decision costs the Navy \n$20 million in operations and manpower costs that are sorely needed to \nsupport greater priorities, and it levies an untold burden on the lives \nof the sailors and their families assigned to the Kennedy.\n  We in the Congress have an obligation to ensure that our brave men \nand women in uniform are armed with the right capability when and where \ncalled upon to perform their mission in defense of freedom around the \nworld. Previously, we have questioned the steady decline in naval force \nstructure, raising concerns with regard to long-term impacts on \noperations, force readiness, and the viability of the industrial base \nthat we rely upon to build our Nation's Navy. Accordingly, I am \nencouraged by and strongly endorse the Navy's vision for a larger, \nmodernized fleet, sized and shaped to remain the world's dominant \nseapower through the 21st century.\n  However, to achieve this expansion while managing limited resources, \nit is necessary to retire the aging conventional carriers that have \nserved this country for so long.\n  To this end, I offer this amendment which would eliminate the \nrequirement for the naval combat forces of the Navy to include not less \nthan 12 operational aircraft carriers.\n  Therefore, I urge the Senate to act favorably upon this amendment. At \nthis time I will not seek the yeas and nays. I will defer to the \nmanager that at such time as he believes it is appropriate that this \nmatter be brought up.\n  Now, Madam President, to the second amendment. I have taken a great \ninterest, along with other Senators--and it came into clear focus on my \nlast trip to Afghanistan and to Iraq--that we simply have insufficient \ninfrastructure in place from those Departments and agencies other than \nthe Department of Defense. We are ever so proud of the courage and the \ndedication of the men and women in uniform who each day are assuming \nrisks to see that the people of Iraq and Afghanistan have a government \nof their own choosing and take their place alongside other democracies \nin our world community.\n  But they need help, those military people. The Iraqi people need \nhelp. The new government which is making considerable progress towards \nits formation needs help. We need people experienced in agriculture, \npeople experienced in commerce, people who can help them devise a code \nof military justice, a framework of laws, the whole framework of \ninfrastructure that must be put in place to support these emerging \ndemocracies.\n  I first learned of this need in testimony months ago by General \nAbizaid, General Casey, Ambassador Khalilzad appearing before the Armed \nServices Committee and, indeed, in other public appearances. I have \ntalked to them personally.\n  I subsequently have had two brief meetings with the President of the \nUnited States on this subject. I am very pleased to say that he is in \nfull support of this legislation, which legislation devised by the \nOffice of Management and Budget enables the various Cabinet officers to \ngive additional incentives to their employees to accept all of the \nrisks and hardships of being transferred to Iraq to perform missions to \nsupport our military, to support the formation of the new government by \nthe Iraqi people.\n  Madam President, as I said, I rise today to propose an amendment \nalong with Senators Lugar and Clinton that will equalize authorities to \nprovide allowances, benefits, and gratuities to civilian personnel of \nthe U.S. Government serving in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n  Many civilian agencies and Departments already have provisions to \nprovide pay, allowances, benefits, and gratuities in danger zones. \nHowever, others do not. This amendment applies to those currently \nwithout such authorities.\n  Over the past few months, the President has explained candidly and \nfrankly what is at stake in Iraq and Afghanistan. The free nations of \nthe world must be steadfast in helping the people of these nations to \nattain a level of democracy and freedom of their own choosing.\n  It is vital to the security of the American people that we help them \nsucceed such that their lands never again become the breeding ground or \nhaven for terrorism as was Afghanistan for Osama bin Laden and al-\nQaida.\n  We have seen how terrorists and insurgents in Iraq have failed to \nstop Iraq's democratic progress.\n  They tried to stop the transfer of sovereignty in June 2004; they \ntried to stop millions from voting in the January 2005 elections; they \ntried to stop Sunnis from participating in the October 2005 \nconstitutional referendum; they tried to stop millions from voting in \nthe December 2005 elections to form a permanent government under that \nconstitution; and, in each case, they failed.\n  Just in the past few days, there have been significant, encouraging \ndevelopments toward forming a unity government in Iraq. Clearly, the \nefforts of administration officials and congressional Members in \nmeetings with Iraqi leaders and parliamentarians have contributed to \nthese developments.\n  In my view, this represents important forward momentum, which has \nbeen long awaited. The new leadership in Iraq is making commitments to \ncomplete cabinet selection and take other actions to stand up a unity \ngovernment. This is a pivotal moment in that critical period many of us \nspoke about after the December elections. We must be steadfast and \ndemonstrate a strong show of support for Iraq's emerging government.\n  For 3 years now the coalition of military forces have, from the \nbeginning, performed with the highest degree of professionalism, and \nthey and their families have borne the brunt of the loss of life, \ninjury, and separation.\n  In hearings of the Armed Services Committee this year, with a \ndistinguished group of witnesses, and based on two--and I say this most \nrespectfully and humbly--personal conversations I have had with the \nPresident of the United States and, indeed, the Secretary of State, I \nvery forcefully said\n\n[[Page S3546]]\n\nto each of them that we need to get the entirety of our Federal \nGovernment engaged in our efforts to a greater degree.\n  The Department of Defense concurs. I was struck by the 2006 QDR that \nwhich aptly states that:\n\n       Success requires unified statecraft: the ability of the \n     U.S. Government to bring to bear all elements of national \n     power at home and to work in close cooperation with allies \n     and partners abroad.\n\n  I would add that General Abizaid, when he appeared before our \ncommittee this year, stated in his posture statement:\n\n       we need significantly more non-military personnel . . . \n     with expertise in areas such as economic development, civil \n     affairs, agriculture, and law.\n\n  I fully agree. I, along with five other Senators, heard the same \nsentiments from our field commanders and diplomatic officials during a \ntrip to Iraq and Afghanistan last month.\n  The United States has a talented and magnificent Federal work force \nwhose skills and expertise are in urgent need in Iraq and Afghanistan. \nWe must provide our agency heads with the tools they need to harness \nthese elements of national power at this critical time.\n  I have spoken about this publicly on previous occasions. I have \nwritten to each Cabinet Secretary asking for a review of their current \nand future programs to support our Nation's goals and objectives in \nIraq and Afghanistan, and I have spoken to the President about this.\n  I will ask to have a copy of one of the letters printed in the \nRecord.\n  The aim of this bill is to assist the U.S. Government in recruiting \npersonnel to serve in Iraq and Afghanistan, and to avoid inequities in \nallowances, benefits, and gratuities among similarly situated U.S. \nGovernment civilian personnel. It is essential that the heads of all \nagencies who have personnel serving in Iraq and Afghanistan have this \nauthority with respect to allowances, benefits, and gratuities for such \npersonnel.\n  In my conversations with President Bush and the Cabinet officers and \nothers, there seems to be total support.\n  The administration, at their initiative, asked OMB to draw up the \nlegislation, which I submit today in the form of an amendment.\n  I hope this will garner support across the aisle--Senator Clinton has \ncertainly been active in this area, as have others--and that we can \ninclude this on the supplemental appropriations bill. The urgency is \nnow, absolutely now.\n  Every day it becomes more and more critical that the message of 11 \nmillion Iraqi voters in December not be silenced. We want a government, \na unified government, stood up and operating. To do that, this emerging \nIraqi Government will utilize such assets as we can provide them from \nacross the entire spectrum of our Government. Our troops have done \ntheir job with the Coalition Forces.\n  Now it is time for others in our Federal workforce to step forward \nand add their considerable devotion and expertise to make the peace \nsecure in those nations so the lands of Iraq and Afghanistan do not \nrevert to havens for terrorism and destruction. I know many in our \nexceptional civilian workforce will answer this noble call in the name \nof free people everywhere.\n  Madam President, I ask for the consideration of this amendment at \nsuch time as the distinguished manager so desires. I will reappear on \nthe floor. Perhaps these amendments can be accepted. If not, I will ask \nfor rollcall votes.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the before \nmentioned letter to Cabinet officials regarding interagency support to \nour operations in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                                  Committee on Armed Services,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 15, 2006.\n     Hon. Condoleezza Rice,\n     Secretary of State,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Madam Secretary: Over the past few months, the \n     President has candidly and frankly explained what is at stake \n     in Iraq. I firmly believe that the success or failure of our \n     efforts in Iraq may ultimately lie at how well the next Iraqi \n     government is prepared to govern. For the past three years, \n     the United States and our coalition partners have helped the \n     Iraqi people prepare for this historic moment of self-\n     governance.\n       Our mission in Iraq and Afghanistan requires coordinated \n     and integrated action among all federal departments and \n     agencies of our government. This mission has revealed that \n     our government is not adequately organized to conduct \n     interagency operations. I am concerned about the slow pace of \n     organizational reform within our civilian departments and \n     agencies to strengthen our interagency process and build \n     operational readiness.\n       In recent months, General Peter Pace, USMC, Chairman of the \n     Joint Chiefs of Staff, and General John P. Abizaid, USA, \n     Commander, United States Central Command, have emphasized the \n     importance of interagency coordination in Iraq and \n     Afghanistan. General Abizaid stated in his 2006 posture \n     statement to the Senate Armed Services Committee, ``We need \n     significantly more non-military personnel * * * with \n     expertise in areas such as economic development, civil \n     affairs, agriculture, and law.''\n       Strengthening interagency operations has become the \n     foundation for the current Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR). \n     The QDR so aptly states that, ``success requires unified \n     statecraft: the ability of the U.S. Government to bring to \n     bear all elements of national power at home and to work in \n     close cooperation with allies and partners abroad.'' In the \n     years since the passage of the Goldwater-Nichols Act of 1986, \n     ``jointness'' has promoted more unified direction and action \n     of our Armed Forces. I now believe the time has come for \n     similar changes to take place elsewhere in our federal \n     government.\n       I commend the President for his leadership in issuing a \n     directive to improve our interagency coordination by signing \n     the National Security Presidential Directive-44, titled \n     ``Management of Interagency Efforts Concerning Reconstruction \n     and Stabilization,'' dated December 7, 2005. I applaud each \n     of the heads of departments and agencies for working together \n     to develop this important and timely directive. Now that the \n     directive has been issued, I am writing to inquire about the \n     plan for its full implementation. In particular, what steps \n     have each federal department or agency taken to implement \n     this directive?\n       I ask for your personal review of the level of support \n     being provided by your department or agency in support of our \n     Nation's objectives in Iraq and Afghanistan. Following this \n     review, I request that you submit a report to me no later \n     than April 10, 2006, on your current and projected activities \n     in both theaters of operations, as well as your efforts in \n     implementing the directive and what additional authorities or \n     resources might be necessary to carry out the \n     responsibilities contained in the directive.\n       I believe it is imperative that we leverage the resident \n     expertise in all federal departments and agencies of our \n     government to address the complex problems facing the \n     emerging democracies in Iraq and Afghanistan. I am prepared \n     to work with the executive branch to sponsor legislation, if \n     necessary, to overcome challenges posed by our current \n     organizational structures and processes that prevent an \n     integrated national response.\n       I look forward to continued consultation on this important \n     subject.\n       With kind regards, I am\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      John Warner,\n                                                         Chairman.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I thank the chairman of the Committee on \nArmed Services for his kind words about aircraft carrier named for my \nbrother. The chairman has long been a friend of my family, and his \nsupport is deeply appreciated and reciprocated.\n  All of us in our family are proud of the USS John F. Kennedy, and to \nher many years of outstanding service to our country. The keel for the \ncarrier was laid on October 22, 1964, in the chairman's home State of \nVirginia. She was christened on May 27, 1967, by President Kennedy's \ndaughter Caroline, when she was just 9 years old, the carrier came to \nbe affectionately known to her crew as ``Big John.''\n  In 1983, the JFK was called upon to support U.S. forces during the \ngrowing crisis in Beirut. Six years later, at the height of the cold \nwar, F-14 Tomcats assigned to the Kennedy shot down two Libyan Mig-23s \nthat were threatening the battle group.\n  Afterward, the JFK returned to the U.S. and visited New York City for \nFleet Week and then returned home to Boston for the Fourth of July, to \nthe state that my brother was so proud to represent. Soon after that, \nshe was assigned to the Red Sea, and stayed to support Gulf War I in \nOperation Desert Storm in 1991.\n  The following year, she was deployed to the Mediterranean Sea and \nmonitored the turmoil in the former Yugoslavia. Later returning to the \nU.S. for routine maintenance, she was designated as the Reserve \nOperational Carrier.\n  In 1996, the carrier made a dramatic visit to the port of Dublin in \nIreland.\n\n[[Page S3547]]\n\nMore than 10,000 visitors were able to tour the ship and learn about \nher history. I was honored to be there for that visit and awed by love \nthe Irish people showed her. Before she left, 16 planes from the JFK \ntook off from the flight deck and performed a thank-you flyover of Cork \nand Dublin, in gratitude for the affection shown by people.\n  From September 1999 through March 2000, the JFK was back in the \nMediterranean, and her aircraft patrolled Iraq's southern no-fly-zone. \nIn 2002, in the Mediterranean and in the Arabian Gulf, she supported \nour troops in Afghanistan and Operation Enduring Freedom. She was \ncalled on again in 2004 to support U.S. troops in Operation Iraqi \nFreedom. She was relieved by the USS Harry S Truman. She returned to \nher homeport in Mayport, FL, that December and last year, she made what \nmay be her final visits to Boston and New York.\n  It is bittersweet to know she will be retired, but the people of \nMassachusetts and the Kennedy family are very proud of her service and \nknow she holds a special place in the hearts of the Navy and the \nNation.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thune). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, earlier today, the chairman of the Senate \nAgriculture Committee, Senator Chambliss, and the ranking member, \nSenator Harkin of Iowa, held a very important hearing on the biofuels \nindustry. I hope it will be the first and not the last because \nbiofuels, specifically ethanol and biodiesel, are real, viable, here-\nand-now alternatives to the ever-increasing cost of gasoline and diesel \nfuels.\n  We are in the midst of another price crisis for the gasoline, diesel, \nand oil upon which our citizens, our industries, and our lifestyles and \nour entire national economy depend.\n  Most Americans want their fuel prices to be lower, but they do not \nwant to change their fuels in order to make them so. People say, \nunderstandably: Solve our energy problems right now, but don't make us \ndo anything differently. That is why I respectfully disagree with \npeople who say: We do not have a national energy policy. We do. And it \nis to maintain the status quo for as long as possible.\n  That is actually a rational policy because our existing energy \nsources, over 95 percent of which are oil and oil-derived products, \ncoal, natural gas, and nuclear, have been and, in most cases, continue \nto be cheaper, more available, more convenient, and certainly more \nfamiliar than any of their alternatives.\n  The sources of supplies, their production, transportation, \ndistribution systems, and retail networks are all well established and \nwell protected by everyone who profits from them. Those industries and \ncompanies that control and profit from our country's enormous and \nalmost exclusive dependence upon their sources of energy have enormous \nstakes in preserving their control and protecting their profits by \ndestroying any real competitive threats to their energy monopolies.\n\n  Nowhere are the stakes higher than in our Nation's transportation \nsector. Over 40 percent of total U.S. energy consumption is of oil and \npetroleum products, and over two-thirds of that oil is used for \ntransportation. Our country now consumes almost 30 percent of all the \noil produced in the entire world each year, which means that 20 \npercent, or one out of every five barrels of oil produced in the entire \nworld, goes into an American car, truck, train, or airplane. Up until \nrecently, oil was the only fuel that those cars, trucks, trains, and \nairplanes could run on. What a gigantic energy monopoly that is. It is \nthe largest monopoly of any in the world. And like most monopolies, it \nis hugely profitable for the monopolists and hugely expensive for \neveryone else. Like every other source of enormous profits and \nfinancial power, it is not going to be surrendered voluntarily by the \nprofitable and the powerful.\n  The huge oil and oil products monopoly is not going to willingly \nsurrender sales or market share or profits, not to a competitor such as \nthe biofuels industry. Like any other established energy monopolies, \nthey may give lip service to those energy alternatives, but they don't \nreally mean it. That was very clear when the Senate considered its \nenergy bill last year. There were full-page ads in the Hill and Roll \nCall newspapers, run by the American Petroleum Institute, which smeared \nthe biofuels industry with the same misrepresentations, distortions, \nand fearmongering that they tried to use a decade ago to defeat a 10-\npercent ethanol mandate in the Minnesota Legislature.\n  Back then, the oil industry claimed that biofuels, particularly \nethanol, would raise the price of every gallon of gasoline, that the \nsupply would be impure and unreliable, and that people's gas tanks \nwould explode or their carburetors would implode or the cars would be \ndamaged or destroyed. None of those occurred. Yet almost 10 years after \nMinnesota required every gallon of gasoline sold in our State to \ncontain at least 10 percent ethanol, we were still the only State to do \nso. Nationwide, the use of ethanol is only about 2.5 percent that of \ngasoline.\n  It turns out that regular automobile, SUV, and small truck engines \nnot only run very well, with no modifications at all, on 90 percent \ngasoline and 10 percent ethanol, but they can also, with factory-\nmodified engines, run as well or even better on a blend of 85 percent \nethanol and 15 percent gasoline called E-85 fuel. In Brazil, where I \nvisited 2 weeks ago, automobiles run very effectively on 100 percent \nethanol.\n  This week's U.S. News and World Report magazine contains a two-page \nad by General Motors touting its flex fuel engines which could run on \neither 100 percent regular unleaded gasoline, 85 percent ethanol, or a \ncombination of the two. Yesterday, Daimler-Chrysler announced that in \nmodel year 2008, 500,000--or one-fourth of its vehicles--are going to \nbe produced with flex fuel engines.\n  The flex fuel engine is the key to unlocking the gasoline monopoly. \nWith a flex fuel engine, as I have in both my Minnesota and Washington \ncars, the consumer has a choice at every service station offering both \nregular unleaded gasoline and E-85 fuel. It is that price competition \nwhich will do more than anything else to stop the price gouging and \nprofiteering by the oil and gasoline companies.\n  For the past 3 years, I have introduced legislation requiring that \nevery car, truck, and SUV sold in this country have a flex fuel engine, \nbeginning with the model year 2005, 2007, 2009--you can pick the year. \nSome people say that simply isn't possible, but last year over 70 \npercent of all automobiles sold in Brazil had flex fuel engines. I met \nlast year in Detroit with General Motors and Ford company engineers. \nThey told me they can design and install flex fuel engines at a \nproduction cost of between $100 and $300 per vehicle. They are better \nengines. However, until now, most American consumers haven't known \nabout them or even wanted them.\n  We in the Federal Government can take one of two positions: We can do \nnothing and let the markets eventually change manufacturers' and \nconsumers' behaviors, as they are starting to do now, or we can act to \naccelerate that transition. It seems clear that our constituents are \nclamoring for us to make available alternatives to the rising cost of \ngasoline and other fuels. We have before us right now the opportunity \nto do so--right now, not 10 years from now with hybrid engines, not 20 \nyears from now with hydrogen engines. They may ultimately be more \nenergy efficient and environmentally friendly, but ``ultimately'' is \nyears away. Right now, we can give Americans a real energy alternative, \nthe first large-scale, readily available alternative to a traditional \nenergy source in many years, because ethanol--and behind it, \nbiodiesel--is not just a substitute for the gasoline additive MTBE, it \nis a substitute for gasoline. It is not perfect. No energy source yet \nis. There are transition costs, production and distribution challenges, \nand similar susceptibilities to supply manipulation, price gouging, and \nprofiteering as with oil, gasoline, or other fossil fuels. The key is \nthe competition, consumers' ability to choose the lower priced, better \noption.\n\n[[Page S3548]]\n\n  Last week, traveling around Minnesota, I could choose, with my \nvehicle with the flex fuel engine, between E-85, which was costing \nabout $2.39 a gallon, and regular unleaded gasoline, which was costing \nabout $2.79 a gallon. Both of those prices were significantly higher \nthan they were in Minnesota 6 months or a year ago. Both prices are too \nhigh. Americans are being taken advantage of at the gas and the E-85 \nstations in Minnesota and other places around the country, and this \nCongress has a choice whether to do something about it or to do \nnothing.\n  President Bush said last weekend that his administration would \ninvestigate and prosecute price gouging and profiteering at the \ngasoline pump. I am glad to hear the President say that. I only \nquestion whether he really means it because he said the same thing last \nSeptember when gasoline prices skyrocketed after Hurricane Katrina. Yet \nas far as I know, there is not a single charge that has been brought \nagainst anyone. In fact, the Chairman of the Federal Trade Commission \nsubsequently testified before a Senate committee that no ``Federal \nstatute makes it illegal to charge prices that are considered to be too \nhigh, as long as companies set those prices independently.'' She went \non in her prepared statement to state that an oil company's \n``independent decision to increase price is and should be outside the \npurview of the law.''\n  As my mother used to say to me, actions speak louder than words. \nPrice gouging investigations and prosecutions for now are just words. I \nurge the President to turn them into actions.\n  The President yesterday touted his support for biofuels. However, in \nthe last 2 years, he has signed into law cuts of almost 50 percent in \nbioenergy grants. His fiscal year 2007 budget calls for a 57-percent \nreduction for renewable energy grants. I urge the President and the \nCongress to turn their words into actions by increasing Federal funding \nfor biofuels and other renewable energy research and development.\n  Another important action Congress should take this year is to pass a \nnew energy bill. Some progress toward increasing the supply and use of \nbiofuels such as ethanol and biodiesel was achieved in last year's \nenergy bill but, as a nation, we are tiptoeing when we should be \nrunning. A new energy bill should accelerate this transition away from \nour Nation's increasing dependence on foreign oil which, even after \nlast year's legislation, is projected to increase from 62 percent now \nto 67 percent in 2012. If we are really serious about reversing our \ngrowing energy dependence on oil and its products and not being held \ncaptive to rising oil, gasoline, and diesel prices here and around the \nworld, we must act again by passing energy legislation, and we must act \nthis year in doing so.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING \nOFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sununu). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be set aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3633\n\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about what is on \neverybody's mind in my State, and that is what is happening as it \nrelates to gas prices.\n  First, we all know there are multiple ways in which we need to \naddress this issue. I was in an Agriculture hearing this morning on \nbiofuels. It is very exciting to see colleagues on both sides of the \naisle talking about what we can do in the way of policy to build on \nwhat was in the Energy bill that was passed last August in terms of \nethanol and biobased fuels.\n  I know in my home State, we will have five ethanol plants by the end \nof the year. We already have biobased diesel being used. There are many \nexciting opportunities to create jobs, to help our farmers create new \nmarkets, to address our environmental issues in a sound way that deal \nwith protecting our environment, protecting the Earth and, at the same \ntime, getting us off foreign oil. I believe very strongly, if we work \ntogether--and we need to do this boldly and quickly--we can start \nbuying our fuel from Middle America instead of the Middle East. That \nshould be a goal for all of us. I know colleagues on both sides of the \naisle share the excitement about moving forward in this way. We have \nthings happening in all of our States.\n\n  From my perspective, not only corn but sugar beets can be used for \nethanol. Soybeans are part of what we grow in our multitude of \ndifferent crops in Michigan, and there are a lot of opportunities, not \njust for fuel but for us to replace oil-based plastic with corn-\nbyproduct-based plastic, and to do a number of other things that will \nmove us off foreign oil, which needs to be one of our major goals as a \nCongress, and certainly working here in the Senate.\n  We have some short-term issues we have to deal with as well. While we \nmove boldly--and I believe we need to move very quickly on the question \nof real competition--we also have to address what is happening right \nnow without competition. We have an oil industry that has been \nconsolidated down to five major companies. There is no real \ncompetition. It is not a regulated utility such as electricity and \nother basic necessities. Yet it is a necessity. Gasoline is not a \nluxury, it is a necessity. And the fact is, price increases for this \nnecessity are making it harder and harder for people to be able to \nafford the product they need to get them to work, to get the kids to \nschool, to be able to till the fields, to be able to do business, or to \nbe able to take that trip up north in beautiful northern Michigan on \nvacation where tourism is so critical for us.\n  We also know it directly relates to jobs. GM executives have \nindicated, for example, that for every $1 increase in the cost of a \nbarrel of oil, it costs them $4 million more to operate. So this is a \nquestion of jobs. From every angle, this is something that needs our \nimmediate attention while we address where we go long term. Nothing \nwould please me more than to be able to drive my American-made \nautomobile into a service station--and by the way, they use flex fuels \nand E-85 ethanol and a number of products right now--right now--for our \nautomobiles, and we see GM and Ford and Daimler Chrysler doing \nwonderfully bold things and advertising alternative fuels, flex fuels \nright now. But nothing would please me more than to see a pump with E-\n85 in it that is giving competition to the other pumps where the prices \nare going through the roof.\n  It would be one thing if this was just about supply and demand, but \nit is not. We know there are multiple factors. It is not about an \nindustry hard hit, an oil industry barely being able to make it because \nof international factors or because of the hurricanes. No, we are \ntalking about an industry that had over $111 billion in combined \nprofits last year. We are talking about ExxonMobile with the highest \nprofits recorded in the history of the country. And to add insult to \ninjury for people, that same company pays their top executive, we \nunderstand, the equivalent of $110,000 a day in salary--a day. That is \nmore than the average person in Michigan makes in a year, $110,000 a \nday. Then, when he announced his retirement, he gets a combined package \nof $400 million.\n  No wonder people are outraged. No wonder they look at us and say: \nWhat are you doing? What is going on here? You have the industry with \nthe highest profits ever paying their executives more than the revenue \nof some cities in my State. Yet, at the same time, the policies \ncontinue to support tax break after tax break subsidized by American \ntaxpayers to continue to increase the profits of the oil companies. It \nmakes absolutely no sense whatsoever. It is outrageous that the oil \ncompanies are bringing in billions of dollars in profits each year, \nwhile families are now paying over $40 every time they fill up their \ngas tank, and certainly it could be $50 or it could be $60. On average \nin Michigan right now, it is about $42. That is up $4 from last month \nand $10 from last year, and we know it is going to be going up and up \nas the summer goes on.\n  We also know that, unfortunately, there appears to be no relief in \nsight. On average, I am told that Michigan families will be paying at \nleast $500 more in the next year for their gasoline\n\n[[Page S3549]]\n\nbased on what is happening. Five hundred dollars may not sound like a \nlot to a lot of people. In fact, Exxon CEO Lee Raymond indicated in an \ninterview with CNN that a single quarter or a single year of profits is \n``not all that significant,'' and that what is happening evidently in \nthe oil industry is not all that significant.\n  Well, it is significant when it comes to what is happening to people \nwho are working hard every day trying to make it. Five hundred dollars \nis a house payment. It is the rent. It is a car payment. It is paying \nfor food. It is making sure your kids have the opportunity to go to \ncollege, maybe pay for the books that are needed for them to be able to \ngo to college for a year. So it is a lot of money for the average \nperson.\n  I think it is outrageous that somebody who has been earning the \nequivalent of $110,000 a day would act like what is happening to \naverage families and the profits that are going to the oil companies is \nsomehow insignificant. People in my State don't know if they are going \nto have a job tomorrow. There are policies, unfortunately, that have \ncaused manufacturers in our country to believe, I am concerned to say, \nthat maybe we don't need to make things anymore in this country, which \nof course is what has built our middle class. And those folks who have \nbuilt our middle class and created our way of life and are the \nconsumers who buy goods so that we can be successful in this country \nare now feeling that they are getting hit on all sides. They may not \nhave a job.\n\n  Health care is going up. They may not have their pension. The cost of \ncollege certainly has gone up, based on things that have been happening \nhere, such as taking away $12 billion as it relates to student loans \nand other proposals, to have the cost of college go up.\n  Now, to add insult to injury, we have an industry that is more \nprofitable than it has ever been, with the highest recorded profits by \nExxonMobile, the highest of any publicly held company ever, and now the \nAmerican consumer is being told: You are going to pay again. You are \ngoing to pay for all of the excesses that are going on right now by \nmaking it harder for you to get to work, to take the kids to school, to \nbe able to do your job, and maybe to take a little vacation this \nsummer. It is absolutely outrageous.\n  I want to also make the point that this is not about our gas station \nowners. I met with some terrific people on Monday who talked to me \nabout how they are helping people literally piece together pennies, \nhelping people who have been longtime customers of theirs, a single mom \ncoming in with kids and the gas station owners trying to help her piece \ntogether a few dollars so they can put enough gas in the tank so she \ncan go to work, so she can take care of her kids. I was told by one gas \nstation owner that a gentleman came in with 69 cents trying to figure \nout how he could get a gallon of gas into his tank. Sixty-nine cents \nbuys a quarter of a gallon. We are now hearing stories about pawn \nbrokers doing great guns right now, their business is going great \nbecause people are pawning their watches, their jewelry, their cars, \nwhatever they have, in order to get enough money to be able to drive to \nwork.\n  This is in America. We can do better than this in our country. People \nexpect us to stand up and fight for them, not an industry that is \ngouging the American consumer and raking in billions of profits in the \nmeantime.\n  I am putting forward an amendment that will address this very thing. \nPeople say: What can we do about it right now? We need to look long \nterm. When I began speaking, I said I know we need to look long term. \nThis morning, in the Agriculture Committee, we had a wonderful \nbipartisan discussion, and there is a lot of excitement about a number \nof things that we can do together to look long term. We know there are \nways for us to move off of foreign oil and to move off of oil period, \nand we can do that. There is the old saying that the first way to get \nout of a hole is to stop digging. We need to stop digging. Part of that \nright now is to stop the continuation of tax breaks that Americans, \nworking hard every day and paying their taxes, are subsidizing for the \noil companies which then turn around and are so grateful that they \nraise their price at the pump.\n  In the conference committee right now there is work being done \nrelating to tax cuts. There is an additional $5 billion in new tax \nbreaks for the oil companies. Some of it relates to how we subsidize \ntheir foreign activity. They do business with the Middle East and \nsomehow we are going to give them favorable treatment through our tax \npolicy. It makes absolutely no sense. It is an insult to the American \npeople. That is on top of $2 billion that was put into the Energy bill \nthat was passed last year in subsidies. It is unexplainable and \nunacceptable at a time when there are so many other areas where we need \nto provide tax relief, when we need to address middle-income people \nbumping up against the alternative minimum tax or small businesses that \nare trying to make it, businesses large and small, when we need to deal \nwith health care costs that need a tax credit--and I am more than happy \nto support that. But instead of that, we have $5 billion in the \nconference committee report that subsidizes an industry that is raking \nin billions and billions of dollars in profits at the expense of the \nAmerican consumer. I think that is wrong.\n  My amendment would take that $5 billion and instead put it right back \nin the pockets of the folks paying the bill. We know on average there \nis going to be about $500 in additional cost for the average family for \nthe next year as a result of these high gas prices. My amendment will \ngive an immediate $500 rebate to every individual or family, just as we \ndid with the $300 rebate. It is the very same process that was done \nthen, where people were given the $300 rebate when the tax cut was \ndone. We can use that very same mechanism. It is very simple and \nstraightforward. In fact, we can do this if we act quickly, before \nLabor Day, to help people pay their bills.\n  My amendment would give $500 back to each family or each individual \nfiler so that they are able to help pay the price of this outrageously \nhigh-price gas. That is a short-term fix while we get our act together \non what needs to be happening to create more competition and more \nalternatives, which I believe we can do, working together in the \nSenate. But I believe it is an outrageous situation when we are \ncontinuing to add $5 billion in tax breaks to an industry that is \ncausing so much pain for American families.\n  My amendment is based on a bill of mine called the Oil Company \nAccountability Act. In total, it would repeal both the $5 billion in \ncommittee plus the $2.6 billion that was passed in the Energy bill, for \na total of $7.6 billion in tax breaks for oil companies, and provide an \nimmediate $500 tax rebate to families to offset their energy costs.\n  I send the amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Michigan [Ms. Stabenow] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3633.\n\n  Ms. STABENOW.

Mr. President, I make a point of order that the \namendment is not in order under the provisions of rule XVI.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \namendment be in order, notwithstanding the point of order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request?\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard. The Chair sustains the \npoint of order under rule XVI and the amendment falls.\n  The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, the people of Michigan and the people of \nthe country deserve better than what we are doing right now. There is a \nsense of urgency. We can make this in order if we want it to be in \norder. There is no question about it.\n  If we come together and we want to act today, if we want to put in \nplace the opportunity for people to have a $500 rebate before Labor Day \nto help pay for the high gas prices they are paying right this minute, \nwe can do that. The choice of the majority is not to do that, but we \ncould be doing that if there were agreement. That is very unfortunate \nbecause there is a sense of urgency on behalf of every individual, \nevery family right now, trying to figure out what they are going to do, \nwith gas prices that are over $3, $3.20, $3.50--in some parts of the \ncountry $4 a gallon. It is the difference between whether people will \nbe able to pay their bills, go to work, do what they have to do for \ntheir families. The American people, certainly the people of my great \nState, deserve better than inaction.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside the \npending amendment to offer an amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator is recognized.\n\n[[Page S3551]]\n\n                           Amendment No. 3615\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 3615, which is at \nthe desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Wyoming [Mr. Thomas] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 3615.\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the amendment \nbe dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \namendments.'')\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I bring forward an amendment this \nafternoon to talk about my concern with the process we are going \nthrough. We started out with a request for $92.2 billion in emergency \nspending--$20 billion for hurricane recovery, $72 billion for the war \non terror. Then we added $14 billion of additional nonemergency \nspending.\n  Our constituents simply can't run their households or businesses like \nthis, and I think we should not be running our business here, for the \ncountry, in that way either. The money we spend here does not come out \nof thin air. Of course, it comes out of the pockets of hard-working \nAmericans. We should not take the emergency spending process lightly.\n  By definition, these are dollars we have not budgeted, and they \nshould be reserved only for the urgent and dire need for which they \nwere intended. There are some examples, very briefly, of nonemergency \nitems. There are a number of them. Regardless of their merit, and they \nprobably have merit, the question is, Do they belong in this bill? Why \nare we using this bill to provide $230 million for an Osprey program \nwhich is not involved in either Iraq or Afghanistan? We also just \nenacted a $286 billion highway bill less than a year ago. Yet this bill \nwill add an additional $594 million in additional highway spending that \nreally has nothing to do with any emergency. Why is there an emergency \nto spend $700 million to move a railroad that, while damaged by \nKatrina, has already been repaired? It may be a useful thing. Is it an \nemergency? I think not.\n  Finally, this is not the right vehicle for spending almost $4 million \nin farm subsidies or increasing the funding for community development \nblock grants.\n  Again, these may be legitimate priorities. Perhaps they are. But in \nmy view, this is not the right vehicle, nor the right process. \nTherefore, I have offered this amendment which will pull out all the \nextraneous spending and get us back to the President's request for \nemergency funds. I understand the way my amendment is drafted it merely \nstrikes the whole bill and replaces it with the original amount in the \nPresident's request and this would vitiate any amendments adopted in \nthe interim. I have also modified my amendment to account for Senator \nGregg's security amendment and the President's revised request with \nrespect to avian flu funding.\n  It seems to me this is something we ought to consider. Obviously, we \nhave a lot of things to do. But overall, we have a responsibility, a \nfinancial responsibility to follow the rules, to go through the \nprocesses that are appropriate to do something about holding down \nspending, not put these items in the budget if they are not \nemergencies, and we ought not to be using these kinds of vehicles to \nspend more money when we are in the process of trying to do away with \nthe deficit we have. These issues are out there, and they are out there \nall the time.\n  We have all just been home for a couple of weeks. What do we hear \nabout a lot? We have to do something about spending. We have to do \nsomething about the deficit.\n  We do. Still, here we are expanding a request--one, frankly, that the \nPresident has threatened to veto. I encourage him to continue to take \nthat position. We ought to deal with those things that are out here \nthat fit this definition of emergency.\n  I have introduced this amendment, and I hope we give it some \nconsideration at the appropriate time.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nWyoming for bringing this amendment to the floor. It does go to some of \nthe points of contention that have been raised in the discussions based \non whether the President's request should be exceeded by the Congress.\n  First of all, the President has threatened to veto the bill, which, \nof course, he has a right to do. He is setting out another marker that \nany amount over and above the request of the President would be \nconsidered inappropriate and therefore would subject the bill to a \nveto.\n  This is very early in the process of considering the bill for the \nPresident, in my opinion, to be threatening a veto. We have clear \nemergencies confronting the country that require the expenditure of \nfunds for the Department of Defense and our military forces which are \ndeployed in Iraq and elsewhere and engaged in the global war on terror \nto protect the security interests of our country and the lives of our \nAmerican citizens. That is the major portion of this legislation.\n  Another very important part of the bill is to replenish some accounts \nin the Department of State, where agencies and officers of that \nDepartment are engaged in the same kind of peacekeeping activity, \ndiplomatic efforts to avoid conflict, to preserve the peace where it \ncan be preserved and protect the security interests of our citizens.\n  The third request the President submitted was to provide additional \ndisaster assistance for the gulf coast States, primarily in the State \nof Louisiana but also across the gulf coast. I know that we can \ndisagree on the exact dollar amounts. In the Senate, we are going to \nhave a difference of opinion on some of these issues, but it suits me \nnow to just test the water and see where the Senate is. Do we want to \nignore, as a body, the needs that are clear and important and serious, \nthat are addressed by the funding in this legislation? This amendment \ntakes a lot of money out of the bill. It may respond to some concerns \nthat some have that this bill calls for spending more money than is \nnecessary. The Senate Appropriations Committee reported this bill to \nthe Senate and is recommending its passage. I am hopeful that we can \nget an early reading. If this bill should go back to the committee, we \ncould reconsider it.\n  But I think the time is now, when we should come to terms with the \nrealities of this legislation. Either the Senate agrees that these \nneeds are real, that they require the funds we recommended be \nappropriated, or not. We had an open discussion in the committee, in \npublic. Any Senator who serves on that committee could offer an \namendment to reduce funding. I don't recall any amendment to reduce \nfunding. There were amendments to add funds to address needs that had \neither arisen after the President submitted his request and the House \nhad acted early on the legislation or because of information that had \ncome to the attention of the Committee on Appropriations. It was the \nview of the majority, the vast majority of the members of that \ncommittee, that the funding should be included at the amount reported \nto the Senate.\n  I am prepared to have a vote. I suggest--I don't know of any reason \nwhy we can't have the vote now. I can move to table the amendment and \nask for the yeas and nays and we will get a vote. I think that is what \nwe will do.\n  Mr. President, I move to table the amendment of the Senator from \nWyoming, and I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  Mr. President, I will withhold my request until you have made a \ndecision on the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There appears to \nbe a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion to \nlay on the table amendment No.\n\n[[Page S3552]]\n\n3615. The yeas and nays have been ordered. The clerk will call the \nroll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Martinez). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senator from Idaho.\n\n\n                          Sound Energy Policy\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I speak today of my strong concern over \nwhat I believe are troubling movements in the Western Hemisphere in \nrelation to U.S. energy independence, energy security, and \ncompetitiveness of the U.S. oil and gas industry in the region and this \ncountry's political and economic influence in our own backyard.\n  For all the right reasons, in the past few years we have been \nappropriately focused on developments in the greater Middle East as we \nhave engaged in a global war on terror and fought in Afghanistan and \nIraq. Again, we are absolutely right to be engaged in conflicts in that \nregion. But it is dangerous for any region to have a monopoly on this \ncountry's attention.\n  At home, in this Senate, we have engaged in many debates regarding \nU.S. energy independence. This issue was first recognized in World War \nI, when Winston Churchill stated that the answers to energy security \n``lie in variety and variety alone.''\n  Energy security is becoming a hot topic, and many Senators--Democrats \nand Republicans--have been on the floor the last few days talking about \ntight oil markets, high oil prices, threats of terrorism, instability \nin some of the exporting nations, nationalistic backlashes in other \nfiercely competitive areas and supplies, geopolitical rivalries, and \nall countries' absolute need for energy to power their economic growth.\n  We have no time to waste to move forward on a sound national energy \npolicy. Many of us in this body have taken the first step. We passed \nlast August a national energy policy. By its action, we agreed to \ndrastically decrease our energy dependence on the Middle East. Now our \neconomy in energy is working in that direction, slowly, because of the \nphenomenal investment in time it takes to turn something as big as our \nenergy industries of all kinds.\n  In 2005, the U.S. obtained 41 percent of its total petroleum imports \nfrom OPEC countries, which equals 27 percent of total U.S. consumption.\n  In order to reduce our reliance on Middle East energy sources and \nstrengthen our Nation's energy security, it goes without saying that \nour energy sector must be doing business elsewhere. No doubt, the \nclosest, therefore the most economically viable, option should be to \nturn to our own backyard or should I say ``-yards.''\n  Unfortunately, that is hard to do when we too frequently send our oil \nand gas companies into international competition hobbled by self-\ndefeating laws and regulations that allow our economic adversaries and \nour competitors to beat us to the punch right at our doorstep.\n  I must point out that it is certainly ironic that the same people \nblocking the American public from obtaining resources in our own \ncountry, and in the region, are the same people not offering solutions \nto the new and very rapidly growing demand across the world.\n  Frankly, the United States has taken our neighbors in the Western \nHemisphere for granted. We have hamstrung the United States energy \nsector from seeking additional resources in the region while at the \nsame time allowing the likes of China and Canada and Brazil and France \nand others to freely seek energy opportunities 50 miles off our coast \nwithout competition from state-of-the-art technologies and expertise of \nour own United States gas and oil industries.\n  I have here a chart that is phenomenally self-explanatory. As shown, \nhere is the coast of Florida, Alabama, Mississippi, and Louisiana. Of \ncourse, here is the great peninsula or the Panhandle of Florida down to \nthe Keys. Here is Cuba. And literally, within the last 2 years, Cuba, \nwithin their water, 50 miles off the furthest point of the Keys of \nFlorida, has allowed the nations of China and Canada and Spain to start \ndrilling. It will be possible--or should I say it may be possible--to \nstand on the furthest Florida Key in the near future and see an oil rig \ndrilling in Cuban water.\n\n  Did that happen accidentally? No. Why isn't an American company, with \nthe best technology that could do it the cleanest, there? Because we \nsimply have not allowed that to be.\n  For example, a February 2005 U.S. Geological Survey reported on a \npossible deposit in the Northern Cuban Basin--this area shown on the \nmap that is all charted off--estimated at 4.6 billion barrels of oil, \nand possibly as much as 9.3 billion barrels. I would remind my \ncolleagues these estimates are almost the same as the kind we are \ntalking about on the Coastal Plain of Alaska known as ANWR, and it is \nsimply 50 to 60 miles off our coast.\n  So the question must be asked: What is the U.S. doing while foreign \ncountries and companies are exploring right off the U.S. coast in the \nNorthern Cuban Basin, which is adjacent to the U.S. Outer Continental \nShelf and contiguous to this country's Exclusive Economic Zone?\n  Well, I can firmly tell my colleagues that we are doing absolutely \nnothing about it. Not one single U.S. company is exploring in these \npotentially beneficial waters that extend to within 50 miles off the \nFlorida coast. Oh, we are all angst about Gas Lease Sale 181, and it is \nat least 120 miles off of any coast. But stand on a high place in the \nlower Florida Keys someday and you may see an oil rig, and it will not \nbe ours. It could be Red China's, or certainly mainland China's. I \nguess that is the politically correct thing to say about them now. And, \nfrankly, ladies and gentlemen, it is China, and they are drilling in \nour backyard.\n  I am certain the American public would be shocked, as this country is \ntrying to reduce its dependency on Middle East oil, that countries such \nas China are realizing this energy resource. In my opinion, China is \nusing the area off our coast and in the Cuban national waters as a \nstrategic commodity reserve. It is doing this by acquiring exclusive \nrights in the emerging Cuban offshore oil sector, thereby forever \nclosing the door on those resources to the United States itself and \ndramatically impacting our foreign policy in the region.\n\n[[Page S3553]]\n\n  As the administration recently pointed out in its National Security \nStrategy, China has quickly become the world's second largest user of \npetroleum products. Additionally, the administration's most recent \nNational Security Strategy appropriately points out that China is \n``expanding trade, but acting as if they can somehow lock-up energy \nsupplies around the world or seek to direct markets rather than opening \nthem up.''\n  We will miss the boat--because, folks, this boat will sail only but \nonce--if we continue to deny ourselves the right to allow our companies \nto engage where they ought to be engaging, where they have the talent, \nthe resources, and the expertise to engage. But, instead we are by our \naction forcing potentially substandard companies that do not have the \ntalent, the expertise, the environmental know-how, to drill in an area \nthat could be phenomenally damaging to the coast of Florida. That is \nthe reality of today's policy in this country.\n  Higher oil prices will spur others to turn marginal opportunities \ninto commercial prospects with or without the United States. As we saw \nlast week, since demand for oil is so high, any disruption in small oil \nproduction--whether it be in Ecuador or Argentina or the Congo or Egypt \nor Azerbaijan or Bahrain or Sudan or Yemen or Chad--can have a profound \nimpact on oil prices at the pump anywhere in this country. It is for \nthis reason that we must and should act aggressively to diversify our \nimports and production and compete with other nations around the world.\n  On top of the economic competitiveness we are missing out on, we are \nalso allowing the energy security of this country to slip away, to slip \naway right in our backyard. Simply put, too many unknowns lie in the \nhands of terrorists, instability, and chaos in the Middle East. \nTherefore, let us think about and rid ourselves of the vulnerability \nthat we forced ourselves into by the responsible and environmentally \nsound development of our own resources or resources that are just \nacross the fence in our neighbor's backyard. This is the opportunity we \nnow deny ourselves.\n  I intend to look at these opportunities to bring about potential \nlegislation that will cause this Senate to look and to act responsibly, \nas it would allow us to deal with these kinds of opportunities, instead \nof simply denying them. We think we can build a buffer around us to \nsecure ourselves environmentally, and yet we have denied our backdoor. \nOur backdoor is open. The southern Florida coast is potentially \nvulnerable to second-rate drilling capabilities from foreign countries \nthat do not have the kind of deepwater expertise and talent that has \nresulted in no spills by U.S. companies now for well over a decade.\n  Therein lies the opportunity. Yet we have some who would say: Oh, my, \n50 miles we will turn our back on but 100 miles out, oh, we have a \nproblem there. No, folks, we have a problem here, and we have a problem \nin Cuba. We ought to be recognizing it instead of denying it.\n  Here is the reality. Here is the sale area, the opportunity that Cuba \nis now exploiting by allowing foreign countries to come in our backyard \nor, can I say, just across the fence in our neighbor's backyard. Is it \n50 miles off the coast of Key West? Is it 70? Is it 90? It is all of \nthose. And it is potentially an opportunity for us to work with another \ngovernment in effectively, responsibly, and environmentally exploiting \na very valuable resource. We have denied it. Shame on us.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. CRAIG. I will be happy to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. The Senator's point that he makes very well is \nthat foreign governments, such as the Republic of China, drilling off \nthe north coast of Cuba, because of the currents--the currents come up \nthere in the Gulf of Mexico and down around the Florida Keys, what is \nknown as the Straits of Florida, and then northward, as it turns into \nthe gulf stream--the Senator is making the point that illegitimate or \nunrestrained second-rate drilling that would occur off the north Cuban \ncoast could threaten the delicate environment and ecology of the coral \nreefs and the Florida coast. Is that one of the points the Senator \nwould make?\n  Mr. CRAIG. Well, the point I am making is, we have had the expertise \nin the gulf to do it and do it right without any environmental damage. \nBut we have denied exploration within a certain margin or buffer zone \nof the coast.\n  As shown on the map, in this case, here is Lease Sale 181 that is \nbeing talked about today. On the average, from Pensacola, it is 100 \nmiles out, approximately. And this is gas.\n  This is oil and gas. At the closest point, we believe, at least to \nthe line here of the EEZ, it is 50 miles.\n  I simply offer this as an opportunity for the American people to \nbecome aware that in their backyard something is going on we are \nignoring at this moment, and that we should not be ignoring.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. If the Senator will further yield, I would \npoint out very respectfully to the Senator that the chart he shows with \nthe oblong green block there--that is the existing lease of Lease Sale \n181. What is proposed is an additional 4 million acres to the east.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Yes.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Yes, sir. In there is the area that is \nrestricted because it is the largest training and testing area for the \nU.S. military in the world. It is, as declared by the Pentagon, \nincompatible to have rigs where we are doing the testing and training \nof our U.S. military.\n  I ask the Senator, who is a great supporter of the military, why did \nall pilot training for the FA-22 come to Tyndall Air Force Base in \nPanama City, and why, in the realignment, did all pilot training for \nthe new F-35 Joint Strike Fighter come to Eglin Air Force Base, and why \ndid all of the U.S. Navy Atlantic fleet training come to northwest \nFlorida after it was shut down?\n  Mr. CRAIG. I will reclaim my time, Mr. President, since the Senator \nhas answered for himself. It is obvious, training capability. We also \nknow--and the military will agree--that once a well is drilled, the rig \ngoes away. There is no surface obstruction. We are talking about 3 \ntrillion cubic feet of gas potentially. We may be talking about a whole \nregion that has 6 or 7 billion barrels of oil in it, let alone \ntrillions of cubic feet of gas. We ought to be concerned \nenvironmentally, but my guess is we can fly around them a little bit \nwhile it is going on and then the rigs go away. But the oil and the gas \nkeep flowing for the security of the economy of this country.\n  I don't think citizens at the pumps right now are worried too much \nabout flight patterns, but they are worried an awful lot about a flat \npocketbook because we have not allowed ourselves the foresight that I \nam trying to suggest our foreign policy in these instances denied. You \nand I will debate 181 and beyond. But at our back door, and a heck of a \nlot closer to the coastline of your State than any sale proposed today \nout of 181, toward the east, 50 miles off is where the Chinese at this \nmoment are test drilling to determine whether in fact there is a supply \nof oil. Then the rigs go in place. Then the environmental issues that \nyou and I are concerned about may well come to be. I hope I am wrong. \nBut I know I am right about this. These sales and test drillings are \ncurrently going on.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. This Senator, if I might conclude and \ncompliment the Senator from Idaho, certainly has a commonality of \ninterest with the Senator with regard to countries such as China \ndrilling off the north coast of Cuba and the threat not only to U.S. \ninterests that that portends but also to the interests of Florida. We \nwill debate the question of oil drilling out there in the military area \nof the eastern Gulf of Mexico, particularly at a time that the people \nrecognize that we ought to be independent of oil, not continuing the \ndependence that we have.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I thank the Senator for his comments. Before I yield the \nfloor, whether it is the Senator from Florida or Idaho, the American \npeople are saying to us: A foreign policy that allows China to drill in \nour backyard is not a very good policy.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3632\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask unanimous consent to set aside all pending \namendments and call up amendment No. 3632.\n\n[[Page S3554]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, more than half the men and women serving \nthe United States now in Iraq and Afghanistan are members of Guard and \nReserve units. Not that long ago they were working civilian jobs with \nregular payroll and, of course, performing their responsibilities in \nthe Guard and Reserve on weekends and during summer duty. They \nunderstood when they volunteered that they could be activated. They \nhave been. In my State, 80 percent of the Guard units have been \nactivated. They have served this Nation bravely, selflessly. They have \ndone it at great sacrifice to themselves and their families: The pain \nof separation to be away from your family for a whole year, sometimes \nlonger, to be gone when important family events occur, and an \nadditional hardship that comes with this service.\n  Some of these service men and women find that when they are activated \nin the Guard and Reserve units, they are paid less by the military than \nthey were receiving in their civilian capacity. So the expenses they \nincur, the bills they have to pay--whether it is for a mortgage, \nutility bills, education expenses for their children--continue, even \nthough as they serve our country they receive less money. We are \nfortunate that many of their civilian employers have stepped up and \nsaid: We will protect you. If you will stand up for America, we will \nstand up for you. We will make up the difference between your pay as \nyou serve our country in the Guard and Reserve and what you would have \nearned if you would have stayed here.\n  We appreciate that. As a nation, we should be grateful, thankful that \nthese companies stand by these men and women when they need it most so \nthat as they worry about the pain of separation and coming home safely, \nthey don't have to worry about whether the bills will be paid. We \ncreate Federal Government Web sites paying tribute to these companies \nthat stand by Guard and Reserve Units. Some of the companies and some \nof the entities involved include Ford Motor Company, IBM, Verizon, \nSafeway, the State of California, Los Angeles County, and Austin, TX. \nThe list goes on and on. There are some 23 different States that have \nsaid: If any of our State employees are activated, we will make up the \ndifference in pay.\n  So why do I rise today with this amendment? Because the largest \nsingle employer of Guard and Reserve members in the United States fails \nto make up that difference in pay. There is one huge employer that will \nnot say to these activated men and women: We will stand by you. If you \nare going to lose money, we will make up the difference.\n  Who could that employer possibly be? The United States Government. \nThe Federal Government does not make up the difference in pay for these \nGuard and Reserve members. Why? If we value their service, if we praise \nthese private entities and State governments and local governments that \nstand by these men and women, if we say they are setting a great \nexample for America, why aren't we setting an example as the Federal \nGovernment? Why aren't we making up the difference in pay?\n  Some would argue there may be a disparity, that you may have two \nsergeants serving in the same place: one is in the active military \nbeing paid less than one who is having a supplemented salary as a \nformer Federal employee, now activated as a sergeant serving overseas. \nThink about the current disparity, a disparity where this soldier, in \nprivate life a few weeks or months before, incurred expenses for his \nfamily which he thought he would be able to pay, and now, because he is \nserving his country, he cannot. I don't think the active military \nsoldier will resent this. They will understand it and be glad they have \na fellow soldier standing by them, leaving the comfort and security\n\n[[Page S3555]]\n\nof a civilian life to serve our country so well.\n  What this amendment says is that the Federal Government will stand \nbehind its employees activated in the Guard and Reserve to make up the \ndifference in pay for them. It is a reasonable suggestion--in fact, so \nreasonable it has passed in the Senate several times, last time by an \noverwhelming vote. More than 90 Senators voted for it. Sadly, when it \ngoes to conference where the House and Senate come together, it doesn't \nhave a good fate. It turns out the Department of Defense and this \nadministration don't care for the idea much, and they usually kill it \nonce it gets to conference.\n  I am going to give them another chance for this Government to stand \nbehind these soldiers. I hope my colleagues in the Senate will join me, \nas well as my other colleagues--Senator Mikulski of Maryland, who is a \ncosponsor, Senator Allen of Virginia, Senators Biden, Bingaman, \nLandrieu, and Lautenberg. We offer this amendment and hope that it will \nbe adopted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, this is an amendment, as the Senator \npoints out, which has been before the body before. We have approved it \nby a substantial margin on a recorded vote. We are prepared to \nrecommend that the amendment be accepted on a voice vote, so we can \nproceed to that unless there are other Senators who want to be heard on \nthe amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate?\n  If not, the question is on agreeing to amendment No. 3632.\n  The amendment (No. 3632) was agreed to.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which \nthe amendment was agreed to.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n\n\n                                 Energy\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I am concerned about the increase in \ngasoline prices. They are indicative of other increases in natural gas \nand diesel fuel. It is an important national issue. A family that may \nhave been paying $150 for a month for fuel, $200 a month, may be paying \n$50, $75 dollars more a month than they were several years ago. It is \nreal money out of real working Americans' pockets. It is an issue we \nneed to confront. We have talked about it on the floor for many years. \nUnfortunately, we have not done enough to confront the problem and deal \nwith it in a way that actually makes a difference.\n  We did recently pass an energy bill that is better than most people \nrealize, that did a lot of good things. For example, it took us from \nzero preliminary applications for a nuclear powerplant to now 18. Since \nlast fall, we have had 18 or 19 applications which would reduce the \ndemand for natural gas that we are using so much now to generate \nelectricity. But we failed in a number of important issues.\n  It is surprising to me, but the strength of the economy and the \nincrease in productivity of our workforce is such that we haven't seen \na surge in inflation across the board as a result of these increasing \nenergy prices. But it could happen. It could begin to happen and could \naffect our economy adversely. We went through the last spike without \nserious consequences. But when you absorb this much extra cost, it does \nhave some impact.\n  Unfortunately, what I have been hearing on the floor is a lot of \npolitics, a lot of blame game from people who oftentimes are the very \nones who have blocked key decisions that we should have made that would \nhave made our energy situation far better.\n  I see my colleague from Idaho. Few people--as a matter of fact, \nvirtually no Senators--have steeped themselves in energy issues more \nthan he. When he speaks on this issue, we should listen. He has \nhistorical perspective and knowledge of the issues. I compliment him \nand will follow up on some of the things he said.\n  There is some bipartisan work going on. I am part of the energy \nsecurity caucus that believes we should treat energy as a national \nsecurity issue and even take steps that might in the short run seem not \nto be economically as wise but in the long run will be wise and help \nour economy. I care about this. I believe we should work in a \nbipartisan way.\n  I want to push back a little bit and talk about how we got in this \nfix and what it is going to take to get out of it. A few months ago \nthis bipartisan group and others were invited to the White House. We \nmet with President Bush. He passionately argued and excited all of us, \nRepublicans and Democrats, about his vision for ethanol and hydrogen \nand biodiesel. It was a good give-and-take session. He heard \neverybody's ideas. He is moving forward in many different ways. It is \ngood to have the President engaged personally in these issues. He has a \nlot of things on his plate, but I am glad he has chosen--and has for \nseveral months now--to personally push the development of better energy \nsupplies.\n  How did we get here? A number of things are important to note. I just \nsaw a report about the world economy. The world economy is growing at a \ngreat rate, 4 or 5 percent internationally. This is so much better than \nthe downturn that they suffered several years ago. I was recently in \nPeru and the Dominican Republic. Their growth rate has exceeded ours, \nalthough we have had the highest growth rate of any industrialized \nnation in the world, higher than any single European Nation, at least \nof the larger economies in Europe. But the Dominican Republic has \nexceeded our growth--9 percent growth. You know about China and India's \nsustained growth, and they are using more oil and gas in all these \nareas, and we are using more as a result of that economy. It has \nincreased demand, and we do have political instability around the \nworld.\n\n  We have had problems in Nigeria and problems with Venezuela. The \nlines are still open there, but that is an area which causes some \nproblem. There is concern and speculation that we could have a shutoff \nfrom any number of areas in the Middle East. So those are things which \nhave curtailed supply while demand has been increased.\n  I wish to talk about some of the key votes we have cast in the \nSenate--votes that are very important. I have to say that in the votes \nI will be talking about, my Democratic colleagues provided the bulk of \nthe votes that blocked decisions that should have been made, some of \nwhich I think go beyond the pale. I have said that for years.\n  Let's talk about ANWR. We have heard that discussed time and time \nagain. It was passed one time. President Clinton vetoed it. We came \nwithin a vote or two of passing it several times since. Ninety percent \nof my colleagues on the other side of the aisle voted against opening \nup ANWR to exploration. The ANWR region of Alaska is so large, it is as \nlarge as the State of South Carolina. The area they want to drill in, \npropose to drill in, where they have identified huge reserves of oil \nand gas, is the size of Dulles Airport. That is how small it is. With \ndirectional drilling and the scientific skills we have developed, we \nhave a proven track record that oil can be produced safely in these \nkinds of regions. It is beyond my comprehension that we would deny our \nNation these large amounts of oil in the ANWR region.\n  I will show you what we would have to move CAFE standards to, which \nis the mileage standards for automobiles, to equal the impact of the \nANWR oil and gas. You would have to raise CAFE standards to 39 miles \nper gallon for cars and 29 miles for light trucks. The amount of oil \nthere is equivalent to the energy that would be generated by a 3.7 \nmillion-acre wind farm. It would be the size of the entire States of \nConnecticut and Rhode Island combined. That is how much energy we are \ntalking about. Or solar energy from 448,000 acres of solar panels. A \nfifth of America's domestic oil could be produced out of ANWR by 2025.\n  We should have done this 10 years ago. It should be flowing today. We \nshould hold companies and producers accountable and make sure there \nwill be no spills. We are producing oil and gas so much safer than we \never have. We are not having a problem, frankly, anywhere with oil and \ngas spills.\n  I will say one more thing about this issue. It is very offensive to \nme when you say to those of us who have advocated ANWR drilling and \nother areas,\n\n[[Page S3556]]\n\nlike in the gulf: Oh, you are for the oil companies. You are doing this \nfor the oil companies.\n  Let me make one thing clear. My proposal to drill in ANWR and the \ngulf and other areas is for the American people. Now, the oil companies \nwhich own oil interests around the world--sometimes I think they don't \nhave enough interest in finding new reserves. They have their reserves. \nThey will sell it at whatever the market price is. If the supply is low \nand demand is high, they will charge every dime they can charge. That \nis what they have always done, and that is what they will always do. \nBut when we deny our people the ability to produce oil and gas in our \nown country and keep that money at home--it has been estimated by union \ngroups that support this drilling that 600,000 jobs would be created in \nAmerica. Why would we not do that? Why would we send our money off to a \nforeign nation that is hostile to our interests, perhaps, and let them \nspend it and create jobs in their nation? You tell me why.\n  This is not a political issue. It has always been about accessibility \nof oil and gas for the American people. It is not for the oil \ncompanies, it is for the American people, to keep our wealth at home. \nYou may say: We care about the environment. Do you care about Lake \nMaracaibo in Venezuela where they are drilling perhaps thousands of \nwells or the Persian Gulf--aren't those nice areas for the environment? \nWhat about the hundreds and thousands of wells in the Gulf of Mexico \noff of Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, and Texas?\n  We have to get real here. Ninety percent of the votes cast to block \nthe drilling in ANWR came from our Democratic colleagues. They are the \nvery ones in this Chamber right now who are complaining and blaming \nPresident Bush because we don't have enough oil and gas and the price \nis going up. Let's just say that is what it is. That is a plain fact.\n  Now, Senator Larry Craig really talked about something I know a good \nbit about, just because of my location. I live in Mobile, on the Gulf \nof Mexico. This past weekend, I visited my brother-in-law, who has a \nhouse on Fort Morgan, out toward the peninsula there on Mobile Bay. \nRight off of his pier, in the bay, is a producing oil well. Friday, we \ngot up early and went fishing; it was the first day of snapper season. \nWe didn't catch any snapper. We caught some redfish. Where did we go? \nWe went out a few miles into the gulf and fished around the oil well. \nThere were four boats fishing around that oil well. We caught four nice \nredfish. We threw them back. That is where people fish. It provides \ngood structures for fish.\n\n  Louisiana, Texas, Mississippi, and Alabama are providing the Nation a \ntremendous amount of production. Twenty percent of that production was \nlost as a result of Hurricane Katrina. They have shut off the valves, \nso if the rigs are damaged, the shutoff valve doesn't allow oil and gas \nto spill. Many of the rigs' valves are still shut off. They are not \nconnected. But oil is not being spilled.\n  My point is that we lost 20 percent of our offshore production, and \nwe have a 5-percent problem still as a result of Katrina's damage to \nrefineries. The Senator from Mississippi knows that so well. So just \nthose factors right there make a demand for oil and gas to exceed the \nsupply. When that happens, the people who have the supplies can \nmanipulate the price and can charge whatever they think they can get. \nThat is what is happening. It has impacted us adversely. That is the \nway the world works. I am not prepared to try to fix the prices on \nthis. I am willing to look at what has happened and ask tough questions \nof the oil companies, like: Do you really have enough interest in \nexploring new reservoirs and finding new reserves and bringing that on \nline? Maybe you do not have enough interest. Maybe you are happy to not \nconfront the environmentalists or the Democratic obstructionists and \nsit on what you have, and if the price goes up, charge it. We are not \ngetting enough production, in my view. A big part of the problem is \npolitical; it is Congress.\n  Let me show you a couple of things. ANWR is a big deal. I read off \nhow much ANWR has. If I am not mistaken, ANWR is less than a half \nbillion barrels of oil. The Gulf of Mexico, according to our best \nestimates, has about 3.65 billion barrels of oil, but they are under \nmoratorium; we cannot drill there. This is a pocketbook issue, not a \npolitical issue. Whole regions of the gulf are not available for \ndrilling today. What is happening? Fidel Castro in Cuba is partnering \nwith China and is moving forward with plans that could allow him to \ndrill within 50 miles of Florida, off the Florida coast. He can drill, \nbut we cannot. He can take the money and fund his adventures around \nSouth and Central America and complain against the United States. And \nwe are going to buy oil from him? Is that who we pay? And the Chinese \ncompany that produces it--is that what people would like to see?\n  This is reality. That is all I am saying. It is not a pleasant \nthought. It is unfortunate. I suggest that if we had moved forward out \nthere, we may not be seeing such activities now.\n  I will show you another chart. This shows what Secretary of the \nInterior Norton said about Hurricane Katrina, one of the most powerful \nhurricanes ever to hit the United States:\n\n       Despite such intense winds and powerful waves offshore, we \n     experienced no significant spills from any offshore well on \n     the outer continental shelf.\n\n  See these dots on the chart? They represent oil platforms. There are \nhundreds and hundreds of them there, and we are getting a tremendous \namount of oil and gas from them. It is important to the American \neconomy. If we weren't buying it there, who would we be paying for it? \nIran, Venezuela, Saudi Arabia, Nigeria? So we have been getting it here \nin Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama.\n  Look over at this area of the gulf, where 3.65 billion barrels of \nreserve is expected to be, and there is a moratorium on that; we cannot \ndrill out there. Why? Because somebody in Florida believes it might \nimpact their coastline adversely. But we have had no impact, and they \nare drilling a mile off of our shores, in our bay, in little Mobile Bay \nright here, up in the bay, where there are wells. And there are wells \noff of the Texas and Louisiana coasts by the hundreds. We are not \nhaving oil spills. Do you think you would not see it on television if \nthere were a spill? They would have it on the front pages, whether it \nwas significant or not. We are just not seeing that. They have learned \nto do this in such a safe way that we have been able to avoid any \nsignificant spills.\n  So, as Senator Craig noted, right here on the chart there is a little \nlease area--some area we can drill in--and we are working on that now. \nSome are trying to block that. I want to repeat that the votes we have \ncast on the floor that deal with that issue have fundamentally involved \nparty-line votes on so many of these issues--although not totally. Our \nPresiding Officer cares about this issue. He is from Florida, and I \nadmire him so much. We just disagree on this issue. I fish around these \nrigs. I am not so much worried about it. I would like my Florida \nfriends to get more comfortable with the wells, and they would be less \nconcerned about them. So these wells are there, and we have an \nopportunity to drill a tremendous amount of them, and then that natural \nwealth will be returned again and again in our own economy so that we \ncan keep it in our Nation instead of sending it to nations around the \nworld, many of which are hostile to our political interests or to our \nnational security interests. It is important. That is why we have a \nnational security caucus, because we are concerned about the transfer \nof American wealth to nations whose interests are not harmonious with \nours.\n  It is a big deal. I point out a story I told a year or so ago on the \nfloor. My hometown of Mobile produces natural gas offshore, and there \nis a pipeline there. Our friends in Florida down in Tampa and other \nplaces on the beach have nice houses and they have to keep them cool. \nSo they took our natural gas that we produce and put a pipeline all the \nway to Florida so they could generate electricity to cool their fine \nhouses on the beach where they can have their mint juleps out there in \nthe breeze. It is such a beautiful area down there.\n  I think they ought to start asking themselves: Would it hurt if we \nhad some wells out in this area of the country? Would it help the \nAmerican economy? Wouldn't it make us a healthier, stronger nation? I \nthink so.\n\n[[Page S3557]]\n\n  So we had some debates about this last year with the Energy bill and \na modest proposal came up.\n  I will conclude with this, because I am pushing back a little bit at \nsome of my colleagues who are screaming about the high price of oil and \ngas. Somebody came out with a proposal to survey the Atlantic Coast \nwhere we haven't surveyed to see if there is oil and gas out there. The \nreligious crowd, the anti-oil production religious crowd opposed that. \nThey opposed even doing a survey. Seventy percent of the votes against \nthat amendment were provided by my colleagues on the other side.\n  I assure you, a good percentage of those who voted against even \nsurveying our coastline to see if there is any more oil and gas \navailable, if we ever decided to drill, are some of the same ones who \nare yelling the loudest about high oil prices.\n  I thank the Chair for this time. We need to move away from politics. \nWe need to think through this issue carefully and see what we can do to \nimprove the method of production, to improve conservation, and to deal \nwith the scientific breakthroughs and accelerate those so we can \nconfront the problems we face and reduce these high oil and gas prices.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask that this point, division 1 of the \noriginal amendment, be pending, and I will withhold my time until I \nhave noticed both Senators Lott and Cochran--and I see Senator Cochran \nhere--because I know they will want to be active on this debate. I \nwould ask their guidance on when I should bring this up for \nconsideration of this first amendment which has to do with the railroad \nand supplemental moneys for the movement of the CSX railroad in \nMississippi.\n  I ask their advice and desire.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Division 1 is pending.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield, I have no \nadvice to give him except to withdraw the amendment. I disagree with \nit, the part I have read, so that would be my advice.\n  Mr. COBURN. I thank the Senator from Mississippi.\n  I want to talk first about this. Our country is facing some pretty \nsignificant financial difficulties, and we find ourselves with a \nsupplemental bill, as requested by the President. Basically, the whole \nidea of this supplemental is something the American people should \nreject. We have been in a war now going into the fourth year. We should \nhave the money for funding this war as part of the regular budget. It \nshould not be in an emergency supplemental. Of what we know about the \nKatrina results, that should have been budgeted this year as well, but \nit was not.\n  It is important for everybody to know why it was not. It is not \nbudgeted because it becomes part and parcel of the debt your children \nand grandchildren will have to pay, without ever getting on the books \nof the Federal Government. So when you hear the deficit or the \nsurplus--which it has not been for some time, as a matter of fact not \nsince the early 1970s if you were honest in the accounting--you hear \nthe budget numbers this year, for what the budget will be, and it will \nnot count this money. This money will not be counted, although it will \nbe added to the IOUs that our children and grandchildren will be paying \nback.\n  I am thankful for the leadership, in terms of giving us an \nopportunity this June to talk about budget process reform. Nobody would \nrun their household this way. No business runs this way. This is a \ngimmicky way under which we can disguise how much we put this country \nin debt, and it ought not to be that way.\n  Most people understood that and would agree with it. Yet we find \nourselves here. I am not happy we are doing a supplemental emergency \nbill in that regard.\n  The second thing is many of the things with Katrina we knew were \ncoming before the budget came through the Senate and the House, and \nthat should not be an emergency. Emergencies are supposed to be \nreserved for true emergencies, unexpected costs facing the Federal \nGovernment. This bill is loaded with things that are not unexpected. We \nknew the war was going to be expected. We knew some of these costs \nassociated with Katrina and Rita and Wilma were expected. So we need to \naddress the integrity of our process. It is my hope in June we will be \nable to do that.\n  I know this amendment will, in fact, not win when it comes to a floor \nvote on the Senate floor. But I want to give a little background. \nDuring Hurricane Katrina, large sections of the CSX railroad along the \ngulf coast of Mississippi were damaged or destroyed. One 40-mile \nstretch of track was completely destroyed. The railroad hugs the gulf \ncoast and stretches from New Orleans to Mobile, AL. It is one of only \ntwo railroads that reach New Orleans from the east. The other passes \nover Lake Ponchartrain and runs parallel to the I-10 Twin Spans Bridge. \nThree railroads approach New Orleans from the west. Although the CSX \nrailroad was significantly damaged by Katrina, it was repaired; $250 \nmillion in insurance proceeds and I believe somewhere between $30 \nmillion and $50 million from CSX to repair it and bring it back up to \nusable and safe status.\n  Governor Barber, following Hurricane Katrina, created a commission. \nMy hat is off to him. I think he has done a wonderful job for the State \nof Mississippi and their response to this. This commission was to \nreview and recommend options for recovery and rebuilding in the State \nof Mississippi. The report released by the Governor's commission \nrecommended purchase of the CSX right-of-way in order to create a new \neast-west thoroughfare, relieve congestion on US 90, and to provide for \nlight rail or rapid transport through Gulfport. The report also \nproposes to transform US 90, which runs directly along the gulf coast, \ninto a scenic, pedestrian, friendly beach boulevard. One of the \nCommission's reports also states:\n\n       For many years, planners and local leaders have called for \n     the removal of freight traffic on the CSX railway, which runs \n     east-west through the region, roughly 800 feet from the \n     coast.\n\n  I actually went to Mississippi and visited this area after the \nhurricane. You can see the hurricane damage, you can see this road, and \nthen you can see the rail.\n  Numerous news outlets, including the Washington Post and ABC, have \nstated local developers and planners have wanted this railway relocated \nfor years. I agree with that. I think this is a great development plan \nfor the State of Mississippi to enhance the value of their beaches, \ntheir waterfront, and the wonderful coastal assets they have. I do not \nobject to the plans behind this. I think it is very good from a \ndevelopmental standpoint.\n  What is unknown at this point is where the existing CSX freight \ntraffic will be transferred. While the Governor's commission recommends \nin some areas the relocation of the railroad somewhere north of I-10, \nwhich is 3 to 6 miles from the coast, the Commission's final report \npegs the cost of that proposal at $795 million and states the idea is \nno longer seen as practical. If the entire railroad right-of-way of \nMississippi is purchased by the State, rail traffic heading west from \nAlabama would have to be rerouted northwest from Mobile to Hattiesburg, \ninto Mississippi, and then southwest into New Orleans and Lake \nPonchartrain. The additional distance of this route relative to the CSX \nline along the coast is approximately 100 miles. There is currently a \nrailroad that runs from Hattiesburg into Gulfport, but if the CSX \nright-of-way is surrendered, it would not be possible for a freight \ntrain traveling along that line to go from Gulfport to New Orleans.\n  There are a lot of other things I will not go into. I think the \nprinciples that\n\n[[Page S3559]]\n\nwe ought to be asking about are, is this a bad idea? No, it is not a \nbad idea. It is a good idea.\n  No. 2, is it an emergency? I would contend that this is not an \nemergency, especially on the fact that this has been planned and \nadvocated for years in Mississippi in terms of the development--some \nfor safety. Some will argue the railroad line now has 70-plus \ncrossings. But the statistics on safety are that they are at a 5-year \nlow in terms of injury. For 30 years it has been a declining number. It \nis not an emergency.\n  The railroad is vulnerable, where it currently lies, to hurricanes. \nThere is no question about that. But so will a five- to seven-lane \nhighway that is going to be put in its place be vulnerable.\n  The current budget resolution for 2006 explicitly defines what \nconstitutes an emergency, and it should be noted that all of the \nfollowing five criteria must be satisfied in order for something to be \nconsidered an emergency: necessary, essential, and violent; sudden, \nquickly coming into being and not building up over time; an urgent, \npressing, and compelling need requiring immediate action; unforeseen, \nunpredictable, and unanticipated; and not permanent, temporary in \nnature.\n  The proposal to move this railroad does not meet the definition of \nemergency as defined by the Congress. The permanent removal of a \nrailroad to make way for permanent construction of a highway does not \nqualify as an emergency either, as well. While the railroad may indeed \nbe vulnerable to hurricanes because of its proximity to the coast, it \nmakes no sense to replace it with a highway that is going to be just as \nvulnerable in its proximity to the coast.\n  Despite the vulnerability of the railroad, CSX and its insurers \nquickly repaired the lines such that it was fully operational within \nmonths of its destruction.\n  There is no desire, I believe, by CSX to move this line, and it would \nbe good business sense if CSX thought it was vulnerable to the point it \nshould make a business decision to move the line interior to the State \nof Mississippi.\n  According to Gary Sease, a spokesperson for CSX:\n\n       We rebuilt that line across the gulf coast as quickly as \n     possible because it is a critical artery for us. It serves \n     our purposes. It meets our customers' needs. There is \n     absolutely nothing wrong with it.\n\n  Furthermore, at a time when it is important more than ever to have \nfreight quickly delivered to devastated regions in New Orleans along \nthe gulf coast, it is inadvisable to remove one of the only railroads \ninto New Orleans from the east, one of two, thus forcing the remaining \nfreight over Lake Pontchartrain.\n  Within the emergency spending bill, the railroad funding is provided \nthrough the Rail Line Relocation Capital Grant Program which was \ncreated in the 2005 highway bill. That program requires the Secretary \nof Transportation to analyze the effects of the railroad relocation on \nmotor vehicle, pedestrian traffic, safety, community, quality of life, \nand area commerce. However, the language providing money for the \nrailroad specifically prohibits the Secretary of Transportation from \nconsidering those factors as they apply to the CSX relocation.\n  If safety is a sufficient reason to relocate the rail, it is \nincredibly odd that the Secretary of Transportation would be prohibited \nfrom making judgments as to the effects of the railroad relocation on \nsafety and traffic. We will hear today that hurricane evacuation is a \nreason to relocate the railroad so it will relieve congestion along \nU.S. 90 and allow for a better evacuation route in the potential of \nfuture hurricanes. They will also say at the same time that the \nrailroad's current location is too vulnerable to future hurricanes. \nThese claims are mutually exclusive and cannot be both true at the same \ntime.\n  If the current location is too vulnerable to future damage, it makes \nno sense to build a brand new highway in exactly the same place. It \nwill be wiped out in the next massive hurricane as well.\n  Both the railroad and the proposed new east-west thoroughfare are \nlocated half a mile from U.S. 90 and the gulf coast. A major interstate \nhighway, I-10, is located only 3 to 6 miles farther to the north. Given \nthat the railroad was completely destroyed by Katrina at least over a \n40-mile section, the argument that a new road in its place would be \nsafe is hard to fathom.\n  I have great respect for the Senators from Mississippi. They are \ngreat advocates for their State. They are accomplished legislators. \nThey are experienced beyond all means in the operations of the Senate \nand how to accomplish the best goal that they perceive for their State \nand our country.\n  I have to say that at some point it has to stop. Americans have to \nask the question:\n  No. 1, is something truly an emergency?\n  No. 2, is it truly the responsibility of the rest of the country to \ndo an economical development project that was on the drawing table long \nbefore Katrina and to use Katrina as the justification to have the rest \nof us pay for it?\n  I don't believe that is fair for future generations of this country. \nI don't think it is fair for the process.\n  I think you can see in the wording of this bill that the very \ndefinition of emergency is not met. I think you can also see very \nclearly that blocking the Secretary of Transportation from making an \nevaluation on safety was designed because they may in fact not pass \nthat test. It has to stop. Our children and grandchildren deserve for \nus to preserve the opportunities we have had. We cannot continue to \nborrow money from their future standard of living so we can do what we \nwant to do today. The heritage of our country is one of sacrifice in \nthe present generation to create opportunity for the future.\n  This is a good plan for Mississippi; it is just not a plan that the \npeople of the rest of the country--especially on an emergency basis--\nought to be asked to do.\n  If in fact it is brought back through the proper process and channels \nand looked at by the full committee and this body feels it should be \ndone in a prudent and thoughtful way, that would be far better than \nputting it into this bill. Mississippi will win if this happens. But \nthe future of our country loses if this kind of thing continues to \nhappen.\n  This is called an earmark. It is placed in a bill to benefit one \nspecific area at the expense of everyone else. It has legitimate value \nfor the State of Mississippi. It is not an emergency. And it certainly \nwill be paid for through lost opportunities for our kids and our \ngrandkids. Think about what $700 million could do for everybody else in \nKatrina. How many classrooms can be rebuilt? How many hospitals to \nserve the poor and helpless can be made available? How much education \ncan we offer up that will create future opportunities and earnings?\n  The progress we seek to secure for the future is being limited by our \nown inability to make the hard decisions that aren't pleasing, aren't \nfun, but that are necessary to secure that future.\n  If you assume an interest rate on our debt--which is going to be very \nsoon 6 percent--this $700 million relocation will balloon to more than \n$4 billion by the time we start paying it back. The net present value \nof this isn't $700 million, it is $4 billion. That is what your \ngrandchildren will have to pay back for what we are proposing to do \ntoday.\n  I respect a great deal the chairman of the Appropriations Committee. \nHe has a very difficult job. Everybody asks and nobody wants to give \nwhen they come to see Chairman Cochran. Everybody has a need. He has \nthe job to find the best way to get a bill out of his committee. This \nparticular project just happens to lie within his home State, and he \nadvised me that his best recommendation would be for me to withdraw the \namendment. I understand why. But I cannot in good conscience withdraw \nwhat I perceive to be and many are willing to debate on the floor \nsomething that is truly not an emergency, and truly even though it will \noffer great benefits for Mississippi in terms of economic development \nis not something the rest of us in the country should be paying for.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent I be yielded 10 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise today with the Senator from \nWashington, Senator Murray, and the Senator from Massachusetts, Senator \nKerry, to offer an amendment to address the costs of providing health \ncare to veterans. I am proud that 16 of our colleagues have joined us \nin this effort.\n  Last year, we all recognized the need to provide supplemental funds \nto VA. We did this to allow VA to absorb an influx of new patients from \nOperations Iraqi and Enduring Freedom. It is time to act once again.\n  This amendment we offer today allows VA to provide care for returning \ntroops without displacing those veterans currently using the system. It \nprovides VA with more tools to deal with those mental health issues \nfaced by returning veterans.\n  The amount of this amendment, $430 million, is largely directed \ntoward mental health needs, coupled with a modest level of funding to \neradicate waiting lists and existing shortfalls. Eighty million dollars \nis directed to Vet Centers, readjustment counseling, and outreach. For \nreturning veterans who have suffered psychological wounds, the stigma \nsurrounding these types of injuries creates a barrier that oftentimes \nprevents them from seeking the care they need. Vet Centers provide a \nmeans to overcome this barrier because of the location in the community \nand because veteran staff members can relate to the experiences of \nveterans seeking services.\n  We are receiving information that our Vet Centers maintenance funding \nis being depleted. We learned also that resources for equipment that is \nneeded by the centers cannot be bought because funds are not available. \nIn the year 2005, Vet Centers cared for 36,000 veterans. So far this \nyear, Vet Centers have seen more than 70,000 such veterans.\n  This chart shows in 2003 there were 1,936 veterans; in 2004 there \nwere 9,611 veterans; in the year 2005, 36,717. It is projected to be \n70,547. Therefore, the need for assistance is there.\n  When we close the books on 2006, Vet Centers will have ended up \nseeing nearly 140,000. That is a projection. Yet the budget for the \nprogram has remained virtually stagnant.\n  Another component of our amendment aggressively targets the more \ndebilitating mental health issues of servicemembers. The experts \npredict as many as 30 percent of those returning servicemembers may \nneed psychiatric care. Yet we are told that the system is nowhere near \nready to handle this type of workload.\n  Steady budget cuts over the years have diminished VA mental health \ncare capacity. GAO found VA has lagged in the implementation of \nrecommendations made by its own advisory committee on PTSD to improve \ntreatment of veterans who suffer from this very serious mental illness. \nThe GAO has questioned whether VA can keep pace with the demand for \nmental health treatment from veterans of Operations Iraqi and Enduring \nFreedom. In order to provide the VA health care system for these needs, \nwe believe $168 million should be sent to VA. The VA developed its own \ncomprehensive plan to reach all veterans in clinics or in VA hospitals. \nThis is the administration's plan, but we need to find a way to fund \nit.\n  In addition to mental health needs, our amendment addresses the \nexisting shortfalls in the system. We know right now waiting lists have \nbegun to creep up. VA hospitals are running deficits. Yes, we are back \nhere again.\n  Let me share some specifics. In Phoenix, the supplemental funds \nprovided last year went almost entirely to help with the backlog of \npatients and nary a dime was used for equipment purchases or \nmaintenance which was delayed previously.\n  In Network 22, they are still relying on management efficiencies to \nbalance the budget. These same efficiencies were decried by the GAO as \nbeing fictitious.\n  In Texas, the VA is again using maintenance and equipment funds to \ncover its current deficit.\n  Health care provider positions also remain open all across the \ncountry, resulting in shortages of doctors, nurses, and medical \ntechnicians, to name a few. We know we can do better.\n  I close by taking my colleagues back a year when we offered a similar \namendment to the last war supplemental. Armed with evidence that VA \nfacilities were operating in the red, we came before our colleagues and \nasked that VA be given the funds necessary to care for returning \nservicemembers. We had VA's own documentation which showed that higher \nnumbers of patients were seeking care than were expected.\n  The Bush administration, at the same time, assured all Members that \nsufficient funds were available. Our amendment was rejected. Many were \nled to believe VA could handle the unexpected workload. It took 4 \nmonths for the VA to come clean and admit help was needed from \nCongress. With swift bipartisan action, the VA finally ended up with \nmore funding.\n  Let's be upfront about the fact that the costs of the war we are \nfighting today will continue to add up long after the final shot is \nfired, mainly in the form of veterans' health care and veterans' \nbenefits.\n  I urge my colleagues to join in this effort to see that \nservicemembers are provided the care they are currently earning.\n  I yield to the Senator from Washington.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n\n[[Page S3561]]\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I am very proud to be in the Senate today \nto support the Senator from Hawaii, Senator Akaka, in offering this \namendment, the current pending business regarding adding additional \nfunds for our veterans who have served us so honorably overseas every \nday in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry: Can the Senator \nyield to another Senator?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. He cannot yield, but the Senator can be \nrecognized on her own and she was recognized.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, every day in Iraq and Afghanistan the men \nand women of our Armed Forces make us very proud. Last year, I had the \nhonor of visiting our troops in Baghdad and Kuwait. I was personally \nimpressed with their commitment and their professionalism. We in this \nSenate all agree that we support them and we stand with them as they \ncarry out the mission they have been asked to do.\n  However, they also deserve our support when they come home, when they \ncome home as veterans. We need to make sure they have the health care \nthey were promised, job training, and transition assistance. They \ndeserve all the things our country promised them when they signed up to \nserve us.\n  Unfortunately, today our country is still falling short of meeting \nthose needs. We all have known for years that the demands on the VA \nhave grown considerably, but funding just has not kept pace. Senator \nAkaka talked about what happened last year with the funding shortfall \nwe got into. We had to get back in place emergency funds to meet the \nneeds last year.\n  We are again offering this amendment to increase funding for \nAmerica's veterans, frankly, because they were there for us and now it \nis up to us to be there for them.\n  We need this amendment this year again because veterans are still \nfacing tremendous shortages and delays in getting the care they need. \nVeterans today coming back from Iraq and Afghanistan are able to get an \nappointment initially with the VA, but then they have to wait up to 6 \nmonths for a consultation and another 7 months for surgery. So, as a \nresult, we are seeing veterans today take over a year before they get \nthe care they are seeking at our veteran services. A lot of our \nveterans coming back from Iraq have to wait 18 months to get their \ndisability claims processed. Imagine returning from Iraq and waiting a \nyear and a half before you get the services you have been promised.\n  We all have met with veterans who have returned. We know many of them \nare coming back with severe injuries. Many of them are facing \ntremendous mental health hurdles. Today, the VA is operating on a bare-\nbones funding. It is doing more and more with less and less. As the war \nin Iraq continues, our heavy reliance on the Guard and Reserve has \naffected the VA and utilization rates in our ability to keep our \npromises to them for their health care and their services when they \nreturn.\n  Last month, the Secretary of the VA came in front of the MilCon VA \nSubcommittee and told us that OIF and OEF veterans accessing VA care \nwas 38 percent higher than expected halfway through this fiscal year--\n38 percent higher than they predicted, than they had requested funds \nfor.\n  We have to make sure the VA has the funds it needs to care for our \nveterans. I personally can think of no better way to honor those who \nhave made the ultimate sacrifice in Iraq and Afghanistan and their \nfamilies than by taking care of them when they return.\n  All Senate Members have met with our veterans, their families and \nspouses, those who serve them. We know the mental health care of our \nveterans is not being met today. Recent reports have verified that 30 \npercent of OIF and OEF veterans are accessing mental health services. \nThat is much higher than anyone predicted.\n  We need to make sure those mental health care services are available. \nThat is why Senator Akaka is in the Senate today offering this \namendment to provide the VA with $430 million to enhance readjustment \ncounseling and outreach to returning servicemembers, to shore up the \nVA's capacity to provide mental health services to veterans who need \nthem, and to address the current shortfalls we are facing across the \nsystem.\n  Our amendment simply recognizes that caring for our veterans is and \nshould be part of the ongoing cost of war. The bulk of the VA's \nreadjustment counseling is provided through our Vet Centers, as many \nMembers know. These are storefront facilities that operate \nindependently of the rest of the VA health care system. That separation \nfrom the institutional VA care makes them an invaluable resource in \nreaching many of our returning servicemembers who today may be wary of \nthe VA system or in very remote locations.\n  Our amendment provides $80 million for these Vet Centers so they can \nmeet the needs they are seeing today. We know in the budget these Vet \nCenters have been flatlined. Over the years, these centers have \nprovided services to a total of 118,811 OIF and OEF veterans. So far \nthis year, these Vet centers have provided services to 70,547 OIF and \nOEF veterans. And these vet center services include outreach to our \nreturning servicemembers at their demobilization sites. So they are \nvery critical services, and we need to make sure they are funded.\n\n  I mentioned mental health a minute ago. I think we all know that men \nand women who are returning from Iraq and Afghanistan are suffering \nserious mental health problems. So our amendment addresses that by \nproviding $168 million toward the implementation of the VA's own mental \nhealth strategic plan. That will help serve our veterans who are \nsuffering from PTSD and other debilitating conditions.\n  We all know, and as I know from talking to our soldiers in Iraq and \nAfghanistan, many of these soldiers are literally on the front line 24-\n7, and we know the cost of that in returning. We have to make sure they \nget the services they need for PTSD and other mental health conditions \nbecause not only should we provide that for them because they need it \nbut because we need to make sure when they come home they get the help \nthey need so they can remain valuable members of our communities.\n  Finally, the amendment secures an additional $182 million for the \nvarious regions in the country that are once again suffering from \nshortfalls. Despite all of our work last year, and despite our efforts \non the floor last year, evidence has continued to mount that \ndemonstrates there is still a need for supplemental funds. The VA \nmedical centers are still millions of dollars in debt. We need to make \nsure we provide the dollars within the supplemental to take care of \nthat.\n  So I am proud to stand with Senator Akaka as we offer this amendment. \nI hope every Senator recognizes that part of the cost of war is paying \nfor the care of our men and women when they return home. I can think of \nno more important promise to keep. I urge all Senators to join us in \nsupporting this critical amendment.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  (At the request of Mr. Reid, the following statement was ordered to \nbe printed in the Record.)\n Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I am proud to be a cosponsor of the \nAkaka amendment to increase funding for the Department of Veterans \nAffairs by $430 million dollars.\n  We are offering this amendment on this emergency legislation composed \nprimarily of war funding for two simple reasons. In the first place, \nthis funding is needed urgently to meet the needs of America's \nveterans. Second, caring for America's veterans is a continuing cost of \nwar.\n  Sadly, the Department of Veterans Affairs continues to have to \ntighten its belt to meet the needs of its patients. Last year, after \nwarnings from Democrats, the administration was compelled by the \ngravity of events to admit a shortage of more than $1 billion for \nveterans health care. Congress made an emergency supplemental \nappropriation of the needed dollars, but we know now that the \nDepartment is still $182 million short. I don't believe that the VA \nshould have to squeeze budgets to provide patient care. So this \namendment rightfully provides $182 million to cover unmet needs.\n  Not all the wounds of war are physical. In July of 2004, the New \nEngland Journal of Medicine reported that one in six combat veterans in \nIraq and Afghanistan showed symptoms of major depression, anxiety, or \nposttraumatic\n\n[[Page S3562]]\n\nstress disorder. A more recent study in the Journal of the American \nMedical Association found that 19.1 percent of returning veterans from \nIraq and 11.3 percent of veterans returning from Afghanistan reported \nmental health problems. We know from historic experience that soldiers \nwill return from war having to navigate a range of emotional issues, \nregardless of whether they are diagnosed with PTSD.\n  So this amendment will provide $248 million dollars to fund expanded \nscreening and treatment of posttraumatic stress disorder and other \nmental health conditions. It will enable the VA to make use of \ncommunity-based outpatient clinics for PTSD screening and treatment. It \nwill expand innovative programs that link the work of Vet Centers with \nNational Guard units returning from combat.\n  We must never forget the veteran--that young American who stood up to \nbe counted when their country needed them. Now they need our \nassistance, and it is our turn to stand with them. I urge my colleagues \nto stand up and be counted on this important amendment.\n  (At the request of Mr. Reid, the following statement was ordered to \nbe printed in the Record.)\n Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I want to indicate my strong \nsupport for the amendment by Senators Akaka, Murray and others to \nprovide an additional $430 million for the Department of Veterans \nAffairs as part of the supplemental appropriations. I have asked to be \nincluded as a cosponsor of this crucial amendment.\n  While I am recovering from recent surgery and unable to cast my vote \non the floor, I continue to monitor the work of the Senate and I want \nto signal my continuous support for better funding for VA care. We \nshould make it a priority to care for all our veterans, the young \nsoldiers returning from Iraq and Afghanistan and the aging veterans \nfrom previous conflicts including our WWII veterans.\n  This amendment is a strategic investment. It would provide $80 \nmillion for our vet centers that provide vital readjustment counseling. \nThe budget for vet centers has been flat for too long. In recent years, \nthe centers and staff have struggled to meet the needs of our returning \nveterans from Iraq and Afghanistan. Since 2001, over 118,811 veterans, \nincluding Guards and Reservists, have sought services and support from \nour vet centers. I have visited vet centers in West Virginia and \nprivately met with returning veterans so I am very aware of the care \nand support our centers provide. The work of our centers is truly \nimportant for our veterans and their families throughout West Virginia \nand our country.\n  This amendment also includes $168 million for a comprehensive VA \nMental Health Plan. Many studies indicate that as many as one out of \nevery three returning veterans will need some type of mental health \ncare, and many veterans will struggle with posttraumatic stress \ndisorder. Rumors persist throughout my state about delays in testing \nand care for mental health issues for veterans after their initial \nhealth care appointment. Every veteran who has served in combat \ndeserves the full range of health care in a timely manner, including \nmental health care.\n  Another concern is a variety of shortfalls that our VA hospitals and \nnetworks are reporting. Some areas need specialty doctors, while other \nhospitals face nursing shortages. This important amendment would \nprovide $182 million to deal with current shortfalls in the system \nbased on local needs and problems.\n  For West Virginia veterans, and veterans across our country, this \namendment states that we fully support their service to our country, \nand their return home and successful readjustment to civilian \nlife.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, it is my understanding that the \ndistinguished Senator from Texas has an amendment to the Akaka \namendment which she intends to offer. And I was going to be sure she \nhad that opportunity at this time. I am happy to yield to her for that \npurpose.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. ENSIGN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, do I have the floor?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I send a second-degree amendment to \nthe desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator withhold for a moment?\n  The Chair is corrected. The Senator cannot yield the floor to another \nSenator.\n  The Senator from Nevada is recognized.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I have the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada has the floor.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Thank you, Mr. President.\n\n\n                           Motion to Recommit\n\n  Mr. President, I want to thank Senators McCain, Graham, DeMint, \nSununu, and Coburn for joining me in a motion to commit that I will \nraise in a minute. I believe the Appropriations Committee needs to go \nback to the drawing board to come up with a bill that does not exceed \nthe President's request of $94.5 billion in emergency spending. Let me \nbe clear--I don't agree with everything in the President's request--I \ndo believe that we should not spend above the total level of his \nrequest.\n  The emergency supplemental appropriations bill we are considering \ntoday provides funds necessary to support our troops who are fighting \nto make our nation more secure. This bill provides $72 billion for \ndefense. Much of this funding is absolutely critical. It will ensure \nthat our troops have the safest and most up-to-date equipment, as they \nserve in harm's way, in order to protect each of us.\n  That is why I support many of the provisions of this supplemental \nappropriations bill. I am, however, disappointed that this bill \nincludes so much unnecessary, and in fact wasteful, spending. Spending \nthat is not related to the emergency needs of the military. Spending \nthat was not requested by the President, the Commander-in-Chief of our \nNation's military.\n  In my opinion, this bill abuses the spending process. Certain \nprovisions in this bill clearly reflect that the Senate is using our \ntroops to push wasteful spending through Congress. That is simply \nwrong.\n  Congressional spending is out of control. So much spending in \nWashington is simply wasteful. We are running huge deficits as a result \nof too much spending. The American public understands all of this. What \nI can't understand is why Congress does not.\n  This bill has questionable and unnecessary spending. The purpose of \nan ``emergency supplemental'' is to provide spending to address \nnational emergencies. Last year's budget contained a comprehensive \nexplanation of what constitutes an emergency. The budget states that an \nemergency addresses a situation that is ``necessary, essential, or \nvital.'' Much of the spending included in this emergency supplemental \nappropriations bill does not meet the budget's definition of an \nemergency. This bill shows that the Senate has no concept of what an \n``emergency'' is.\n  Congress has a responsibility to ensure that taxpayer dollars are \nbeing spent wisely. We should not, in good conscience, continue to pass \noff trillions of dollars in debt to our children and grandchildren in \norder to fund extraneous nondefense spending. If we enact this bill, \nCongress will not be acting as good stewards. I agree with the \nPresident when he says ``taxpayer dollars should be spent wisely, or \nnot at all.'' Sadly, there is a great deal of spending in this bill \nthat should not be spent at all.\n  I make a motion to recommit the underlying bill to the Committee on \nAppropriations with instructions that it be reported back with total \nnet spending not to exceed $94.5 billion.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I will yield to the Senator from Arizona \nfor a question without losing my right to the floor.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Will the Senator from Nevada explain exactly what his \nmotion is?\n  Mr. ENSIGN. I thank my colleague from Arizona for his question. It is \nimportant for my colleagues to understand the substance of this motion. \nThis motion only sets the spending ceiling for this bill. We are not \nsingling out anyone's projects with this motion. We are not stripping \nfunding for any provision.\n\n  This motion sends the bill back to the Appropriations Committee for \nfurther consideration. It preserves the rights of the committee to \ndetermine the level of spending for each program.\n\n[[Page S3563]]\n\nWe are not taking anything away from the committee's jurisdiction. The \nmotion lets the committee make their decisions but within the top line \nnumber that the President called for yesterday.\n  If the Appropriations Committee wants to fund items in this bill that \nwere not requested by the President, they can do so. But they must pay \nfor it. They must find offsets. That is what this motion does. We were \nsent here to make decisions, sometimes hard ones. This motion ensures \nthat this Congress makes tough decisions today rather than heaping debt \non to the backs of our children and grandchildren.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nevada [Mr. Ensign] moves to recommit the \n     underlying bill to the Committee on Appropriations with \n     instructions that it be reported back with total net spending \n     not exceeding $94.5 billion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I move to table the motion to recommit, \nand I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Texas is \nrecognized.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3647 to Amendment No. 3642\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I send a second-degree amendment to \nthe Akaka amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Texas [Mrs. Hutchison] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3647 to amendment No. 3642.\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n            (Purpose: To clarify the availability of funds)\n\n       Before the period at the end of the amendment insert the \n     following:\n       ``: Provided further, That these amounts shall be available \n     only to the extent that an official budget request for the \n     entire amount is submitted to the Congress by the President \n     that includes designation of the entire amount of the request \n     as an emergency requirement.''\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, the amendment is on behalf of myself \nand Senator Burns. This second-degree amendment basically says that the \nfunds available in the Akaka amendment would only be expended if the \nPresident requests of Congress such an emergency expenditure.\n  I certainly understand that the veterans need to have all of the \nmoney that would cover their legitimate health care costs. That is \nexactly what we have done in the underlying appropriations bills from \nlast year and this year. In fact, the Veterans' Administration, after \nwe put $1.5 billion in emergency spending in the health care account \nlast year, is 4.3 percent below last year's spending level. That is \nbecause they now have better modeling for what is forecast to be needed \nin the medical care-medical service area.\n  In the mental health area that is covered by the Akaka amendment, \nthere is already $2.8 billion from the 2006 budget which is $386 \nmillion over the 2005 level. The 2006 medical care account has $31 \nbillion, and that is $1.1 billion over the 2005 level. We have also \nadded supplemental expenditures over the 2006 budget.\n  I think the prudent thing for us to do is to allow this money to be \nmade available only if the President and the Veterans' Administration \nrequest it, and that is exactly what my amendment does.\n  I ask for support of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I want the Senator from Texas to know that \nI do appreciate the changes made by her. I believe it is an approach \nwith which we can all live.\n  A letter was circulated last year to Senators in which the VA assured \nSenators ``that the VA does not need emergency supplemental funds in FY \n2005 to continue to provide the timely quality service that is always \nour goal. But certainly for the remainder of this year, I do not \nforesee any challenges that are not solvable within our own management \ndecision capability.''\n  We know that in the end, however, emergency funds were needed. With \nthis modification in my amendment, I expect the President to come \nforward expeditiously and will not tolerate forestalling and \nsuppression of the facts. Our men and women are depending on us. We \nwill be watching.\n  I express my appreciation for the second-degree amendment. Following \nthe adoption of that amendment, I will ask for the yeas and nays on my \namendment, as amended by the Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, let me answer the Senator from Hawaii \nby saying I commend the President and Secretary Nicholson for coming \nforward after the letter that had been written during our regular \nappropriations process and saying they did need extra money. And, \nCongress stepped right up to the plate. We worked together with the \nSenator from Hawaii, the Senator from Washington, and my colleague \nSenator Feinstein to provide that money. We always will do that. We \nwill never skimp on veterans' care and, in fact, it is now acknowledged \nthat it is the best health care system in America.\n  This money Senator Akaka has proposed will be available, if needed, \nif the President asks for it. It will certainly be there. I ask for the \nadoption of my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the second-degree \namendment? If not, the question is on agreeing to amendment No. 3647.\n  The amendment (No. 3647) was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, let me speak briefly on what we have done \nand why I suggest we do not need to do it. I have the great privilege \nof being the chairman of the authorizing Veterans Affairs Committee. \nThe Senator from Texas has done the right thing to shape the Akaka \namendment that calls for, in an emergency spending bill, an emergency \nof $430 million in this fiscal year, and yet, did you hear what the \nSenator from Texas said?\n  Because of what I demanded last year, because of what she demanded, \nbecause of what Senator Murray demanded, because of what Senator\n\n[[Page S3564]]\n\nAkaka demanded, we now have a much more accurate accounting system, a \nquarterly reporting system of the Veterans' Administration. Right now, \nbased on the money we gave them for the 2006 budget, they are 4.3 \npercent under their spending levels as projected.\n  What does that mean? It means that over $600 million they thought \nthey would spend they are now not spending. So where is the emergency? \nIt doesn't exist. Why are we doing this? How can you spend more in a \nprogram in the last half of the year than the whole program was \ndesigned to spend in 12 months? And yet in three of the four programs \nthat the Akaka amendment deals with, it does just that.\n  It doesn't make any sense. Well, any fiscal sense. It may make \npolitical sense. But the reality is this is simply wrong. In the 2007 \nbudget, we increased their spending. It is the largest increase in a \nsingle department spending than any of our Government. Why? Because \nCongress--Democrats and Republicans--are phenomenally sensitive to the \nneeds of our veterans, and I am extremely proud of that.\n  In no way do I suggest that the Senator from Hawaii is less \nsensitive. It is why he is on the floor and cares deeply about our \nveterans and our veterans' needs, and we work closely together. But I \nmust tell my colleagues, how can we increase budgets halfway through \nthe year by 75 or 80 percent and spend them wisely, responsibly? We \ncannot.\n  This money, if it were allocated, will not get spent. That is why the \nSenator from Texas, who is the chairman of the Appropriations \nSubcommittee on VA, said only if an emergency occurs.\n  Right now there is almost $600 million in unspent money that was \ndesignated for the timeframe, and there is a $430 million contingency \nfund already built into the VA, and we know that. That is a fact. It is \noperated that way. Do the numbers, folks.\n  If there were an emergency, we have over $1 billion worth of \nresources to assure that our veterans have what they need.\n  I will argue all the time for our veterans, but I do believe our \nveterans expect us to be fiscally responsible, along with meeting their \nneeds. I cannot imagine that there is a veteran out there today who \nwould suggest that in most instances we are not meeting their needs. We \nbrought one of the finest health care systems in the world to the \nforefront again. We have expended phenomenal amounts of money on it. \nAnd this year, the VA budget is bigger than any other budget in our \nFederal Government, including Defense during wartime. I am talking \nabout rates of increase, not total dollars.\n  Those are the realities with which we are dealing. I don't mind \nstanding up and talking about it. Why? Because I can go home to my \nveterans and say we have been fair and we have been responsible, and I \nam not willing to listen to the VSOs that ``you gotta, gotta, gotta \nspend more.'' Is there a limit to how much we should spend? No, there \nisn't, apparently.\n  I hope in the end, even though it has been effectively shaped so it \nwon't get spent and it won't get spent because it isn't needed, that \nthe President, as he should, and the Secretary of the Veterans' \nAdministration, as he should, will have the opportunity to declare an \nemergency if it happens and this Congress will know it now because of \nwhat we in a bipartisan way did to make sure what happened a year ago \nnever happens again. We are now reported to quarterly for the first \ntime in the history of the VA. By the last report, they are 4.3 percent \nunder their spending proposal and that $600 million--do the numbers, \nfolks. At a time of major deficits in this country, we are going to \nspend more of this kind of money? No, we are just going to put it on \nthe books now.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Durbin \nbe added as a cosponsor to my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on my \namendment, as amended.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  Is there further debate? If not, the question is on agreeing to the \namendment No. 3642, as amended. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, now we are back on the pending amendment, \nthe Coburn amendment; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thune). The first division.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, for some time now public officials in \nMississippi have been concerned about the vulnerability and safety of \nthe CSX rail line long the Mississippi Coast. These discussions have \ntaken on a sense of urgency as part of the overall dialogue about how \nto rebuild the gulf coast region after Hurricane Katrina.\n  Transportation is the lifeblood of our economy, and making it less \nvulnerable to future destruction while also making it safer should be a \npriority. I am an unabashed advocate of safer roads, bridges and yes, \nrailroads--most recently lending my support to a $700 million plan to \nmove the Mississippi gulf coast's CSX railroad line north to higher \nground, away from people and storm surges.\n  In the aftermath of the worst natural disaster in American history, \nany good post-Katrina reconstruction plan should consider moving these \ntracks. Given the tracks' proximity to the Gulf of Mexico and to motor \ntraffic and flood waters, gulf coast residents and leaders would be \nirresponsible if we did not consider a safer place for the railroad. At \nsome point we must move these tracks from the middle of busy, growing \ncommunities like Biloxi, Gulfport, and Pascagoula.\n  Let me briefly discuss the rail safety problem in the 3 Mississippi \ncounties along the gulf coast. There are 185 highway-rail crossings on \nthe CSX line in those counties. That is more than 2 crossings per mile. \nIn some cases, there are more than 2 crossings in 1 mile of rail track.\n  In the last 10 years, 40 people have been killed in collisions \nbetween vehicles and trains. In other words someone is killed every 3 \nmonths in a rail accident along the gulf coast. Another 68 people have \nbeen injured. There have been 147 accidents over those 10 years. That's \nmore than 1 accident per month.\n  This is an authorized national program. The funds for this project \nwould\n\n[[Page S3565]]\n\nbe appropriated under the Rail Line Relocation and Improvement Program. \nI was a long time champion of the legislation to create this program, \nand last year Congress finally passed it. This program was designed to \nalleviate the adverse effects of rail traffic on safety and on \ncommunities. Now that funds are available for projects that can save \nlives, such as this one in Mississippi, the program should be utilized.\n  Many have asked why this qualifies as an emergency project when the \nrail lines have already been rebuilt. They are oblivious to the fact \nthat this strategic railroad--actually spans the length of our Nation \nbetween California and Florida, handling vital cargo.\n  The simple answer is that this project is needed to prevent future \nemergencies. There was no way that CSX could have waited on the Federal \nGovernment to relocate the line. This project will not be completed \nuntil 2008 at the very earliest. Therefore, there was never serious \nconsideration given to not rebuilding the line. The urgency to restore \nrail operations for the benefit of customers along the corridor was \nparamount. That is why CSX spent private dollars to rebuild the line as \nquickly as possible. To be clear, no Federal money has been spent to \nrepair the existing line, as press reports lead you to believe.\n  It ultimately took CSX 143 days to get the line back in condition to \nserve customers. Six major bridges and 40 miles of track had to be \nrebuilt or repaired. During that time hundreds of businesses were \nwithout service, 300 CSX employees were affected. Millions of citizens, \nand numerous seaports depend on this critical rail artery for freight \nand passenger services. The gulf coast corridor serves as the \nSoutheast's primary gateway for freight being shipped to the western \nUnited States. Even with the new construction and rebuilt \ninfrastructure built to the best possible standards, this line would \nstill be significantly damaged in another storm given the proximity to \nthe storm surge.\n  It is also important to mention, there are significant national \nsecurity and energy security benefits to moving the current line away \nfrom the Nation's highest density of defense--for example, Ingalls, \nKeesler, Coast Guard, CBC Gulfport, CRTC Gulfport, Stennis Space Center \nFederal Reservation, and energy--for example, Chevron refinery, fuel \ntransfer pipelines--infrastructure.\n  The fact is this is not solely a Mississippi project. Remember, the \nCSX line runs form Jacksonville, FL, to the Port of New Orleans before \ncontinuing on to Los Angeles. The Federal investment required to \nrelocate the line will benefit Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, and \nLouisiana by upgrading tracks within those states. Factually, this is a \nSoutheast United States project, not a Mississippi project.\n  Our State has not asked for anything that is unreasonable or that the \npeople in this devastated region do not deserve.\n  Mr. President, I know the hour is getting late and Senators have \ncommitments. This is an issue which I feel very strongly about. It is \none we have to address. These are the problems which have been created \nby the CSX transportation rail line across the Mississippi gulf coast. \nI thank Senator Cochran, the chairman of the Appropriations Committee, \nfor taking the initiative to address this issue.\n  I would like to correct several misunderstandings. First, this would \nprovide the funds to relocate the railroad track from right along the \ncoastline, including crossing significant bodies of water in three \ndifferent places, and it would then be relocated to an area north of \nthere, connecting several railroad tracks. It would run like this, to \nNew Orleans, instead of all the way along the gulf coast. Keep in mind, \nthis is a major corridor that runs from Jacksonville, in Florida, all \nthe way to California. This issue needs to be addressed.\n  Senator Cochran and I and our Governor and our officials in \nMississippi have tried to be restrained and responsible and \nconservative in the requests we have made. This Congress has been very \nhelpful, the Senate has been very helpful to meet a lot of our needs, \nbut we need to come to terms with this issue. That is why Senator \nCochran has chosen to put it in the supplemental.\n  Let me make sure you understand that this is Katrina related, No. 1. \nSome people will say: Look, the old railroad tracks were rebuilt after \nHurricane Katrina at the cost of $250 million. But it was not one \nnickel of Federal dollars in it. It was done by the rail company and \nwas done with insurance money, because this is a major thoroughfare \nthat serves a lot of companies that had to get back in business. If we \nmake this move, it will be 2008 at the earliest before it can possibly \nhappen. I wanted that corrected.\n  There has been some suggestion that it relates to the gaming industry \nalong the gulf coast. It does not, not at all. In fact, they would \nprobably like for it to stay in this area, which forces traffic along \nHighway 90, along this coastline, instead of moving it off of the \ncoast. By moving, then, the highway which runs right along the coast, \nit will be north of where the gaming area is. So there is no connection \nthere.\n  Why do we need this? Let me make it real clear. There are several \nvery good reasons. No. 1, it is exposed. It does run right along the \nwater and has been blown out several times in the past--three times. It \nis there because it has been there for a hundred-and-something years.\n  This shows what happens every time we have a major blow. This is the \ntrack. It is built in marshes and on sand. It cannot stand. It will not \nstand. So we are going to have to do this repeatedly.\n  This shows the strength of the hurricane. This is a railroad bridge. \nLook at how the railroad track is actually bent.\n  This is going to be repeated. It causes economic dislocation. They \nshut down for 134 days just after this hurricane. That is one factor.\n  The second thing is, it is a major thoroughfare. We do not have \nevacuation capability with the current location, where it is now. We do \nnot have east-west rails where people can get to the north-south lines. \nWe just do not have enough room to do that. We will take a railroad bed \nand turn that into a five- or six-lane road across the major county \nthat is involved, Harrison County, MS.\n  It is also about safety. People are killed and injured here every \nyear. On this chart, the circles show deaths and injuries that have \noccurred. I will just give you the numbers we are talking about. Over a \nperiod of 10 years, there have been 147 accidents along this trackage. \nThere have been 40 people killed in the last 10 years. There are 185 \nhighway and rail crossings that are involved here.\n  Some people say you should do it through the authorization process. \nThat has been done. Last year, as part of the highway bill, we passed \nfor the first time the National Rail Relocation Act. This sort of thing \nneeds to be done in a lot of places in America, from State to State. We \nhave an authorization in place, so it is authorized. This provides the \nfunds through the authorization. But this is about hurricanes, it is \nabout evacuation, it is about safety, and it is about getting track out \nright along the coastline and moving it north so we do not have this \nrepeated problem.\n  I ask my colleagues to look at it seriously. There are also going to \nbe some 18 amendments to follow that will knock out various and sundry \nthings in the bill. This is an important part of the Katrina recovery. \nWe are still going to be able to get into New Orleans with the trackage \ncoming north and move that transportation traffic on farther to the \nwest coast. But I just wanted to rise and speak briefly in support of \nwhat is in the bill and against the motion to strike.\n  I thank Senator Cochran for his leadership in providing this \nopportunity.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, the Senator has very ably explained the \nchallenge that is faced to restore and rebuild and recover in terms of \ntransportation assets on the Mississippi coast, but this applies and \nwill have an effect across the breadth of the area of the gulf coast \nthat was damaged, including Louisiana, Mississippi, as well as Alabama.\n  Somebody cavalierly noted the other day that this is like the bridge \nto nowhere--this is the railroad to nowhere.\n  It is a transportation corridor that links New Orleans; Bay St. \nLouis, MS; Pass Christian; Gulfport, MS; Biloxi, MS; Pascagoula, MS; \nMobile, AL, and\n\n[[Page S3566]]\n\nbeyond--as the Senator said--all the way to California on the west \nside. This is a very important part of the transportation system across \nthe southern United States, and on this line of transportation \nfacilities the Stennis Space Center, where our rockets are tested for \nthe space program, and many other military activities in that part of \nthe gulf coast area--the ship yards at Pascagoula, the Keesler Air \nForce Base along U.S. Highway 90 in the Biloxi, MS, area, and on and on \nand on. The Coast Guard facilities and the former naval station at \nPascagoula have other activities there.\n  There are national security consequences for the failure to rebuild \nand recover and restore these important transportation facilities. That \nis why it is appropriate to do it now.\n  This is authorization. The committee recommended $700 million for the \nRail Line Relocation Capital Grant Program. That is the entity where \nthe money goes, and through that money to mitigate damages and restore \ntransportation under the provisions of that authorization, the funds \nwill be used to relocate.\n  This is what our committee report says:\n\n       To relocate tracks that are currently located along the \n     coast of Mississippi, the damaged railroad line----\n\n  These are findings of a committee of Congress----\n\n     is a major east and west freight corridor adjacent to the \n     Mississippi gulf coast.\n\n  It is vitally important to numerous Mississippi, Louisiana, and \nAlabama industries, and essential to the successful operations of major \nGulf of Mexico ports.\n  The rail line sustained major damage and total destruction in some \nareas as a result of Hurricane Katrina's winds and water surges. Eleven \nbridges were destroyed. More than 38 miles of track were completely \nlost. Signaling and safety systems were demolished and many track beds \nwere completely washed out along the rail corridor. The rail line has \nbeen out of commission for 143 days.\n  Progress is being made, but these funds will be used to accelerate \nthe reconstruction and the recovery that is essential for that area of \nthe gulf coast of the United States.\n  We have made a case for it in committee. The committee agreed to \nprovide these funds. The Senator from Mississippi, my colleague, has \nadequately and impressively described the consequences to the gulf \ncoast area. This amendment should be defeated. It would strike all of \nthese funds that have been approved by the committee.\n  I move to table the amendment, and I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I would like to speak a few moments \ndiscussing why we are all here.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma should be informed \nthat the motion to table is not debatable. Is the Senator seeking \nconsent to debate?\n  Mr. COBURN. I ask unanimous consent to answer the questions raised in \nthe debate by the Senator from Mississippi.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I never asked any questions. The Senator \nhas had an opportunity to describe his amendment. He did that earlier \nin the day. He used information that I presume he will present all over \nagain. I don't have any objection to his proceeding, but I don't want \nhim to talk too long. We have Members who are waiting to vote. They \nhave read comments in the paper and the debate that has been carried \nthroughout the press for the last 2 weeks while the Senate wasn't in \nsession. I think the Senate has heard enough about it and is ready to \nvote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I will do this quickly.\n  First of all, what is the definition of ``emergency'' by our own \nbudget rules? Necessary, essential, vital, suddenly, quickly coming \ninto being, not building over time, urgent, pressing, compelling need, \nrequiring immediate action, unforeseen, unpredictable, and \nunanticipated, not permanent, temporary in nature.\n  That is the first point I would make.\n  The second point is the committee's own report says:\n\n       Even prior to Katrina, Presidents, business leaders and \n     local and State officials seriously considered relocating the \n     rail line from its present location to alleviate burgeoning \n     traffic which continually worsened as the region's tourism \n     industry grew.\n\n  This is $700 million. It is a great project for Mississippi. I agree. \nIt is probably something that should be done. The question is, Is it an \nemergency and should everybody else in this country pay for it?\n  I could go into all the details. I will not do it in deference to the \nchairman's request that I be brief.\n  But Mississippi people have spoken. This was planned long before this \nhurricane. The fact is, if we are going to replace this rail line with \nFederal money which is going to come in and build a new road, that is \ngoing to be susceptible to the same hurricane damage. We have to figure \nout how we should go through a regular process.\n  The final point I would make is the committee report eliminates the \nability of the Department of Transportation to say whether it is a \nsafety issue. They specifically take it out so they cannot stop it.\n  The point is, we are leaving the regular process to do something \nwhich is maybe a great idea, but our grandchildren shouldn't be paying \nfor it. If we continue to do this, this is going to be costly. This \n$700 million will cost $4 billion by the time we start paying it back, \nif we want to sacrifice the next generation--not in terms of trying to \ntake it away from Mississippi but setting a standard of which we can \nbehave in a manner that secures the future. That is what I am asking \nfor.\n  I am sorry it is against two Senators I really like. I want \nMississippi to be a hit. This is not the way for us to conduct business \nin the Senate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coburn). The question is on agreeing to \nthe motion to table amendment No. 3641, division I.\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from Delaware (Mr. Biden) and \nthe Senator from West Virginia (Mr. Rockefeller) are necessarily \nabsent.\n  I also announce that the Senator from Massachusetts (Mr. Kerry) is \nabsent due to family illness.\n  I further announce that, if present and voting, the Senator from \nMassachusetts (Mr. Kerry) would vote ``nay.''\n  The result was announced--yeas 49, nays 48, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 99 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--49\n\n     Akaka\n     Alexander\n     Allard\n     Baucus\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Burns\n     Byrd\n     Clinton\n     Cochran\n     Coleman\n     Collins\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     Dayton\n     DeWine\n     Domenici\n     Dorgan\n     Feinstein\n     Frist\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Harkin\n     Hatch\n     Hutchison\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Lincoln\n     Lott\n     Martinez\n     McConnell\n     Menendez\n     Mikulski\n     Murkowski\n     Pryor\n     Roberts\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Smith\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Vitter\n     Warner\n\n                                NAYS--48\n\n     Allen\n     Bayh\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burr\n     Cantwell\n     Carper\n     Chafee\n     Chambliss\n     Coburn\n     Conrad\n     Cornyn\n     DeMint\n     Dodd\n     Dole\n     Durbin\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Feingold\n     Graham\n     Hagel\n     Inhofe\n     Isakson\n     Kohl\n     Kyl\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lugar\n     McCain\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Obama\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Salazar\n     Santorum\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Stabenow\n     Sununu\n     Talent\n     Thomas\n     Thune\n     Voinovich\n     Wyden\n\n                             NOT VOTING--3\n\n     Biden\n     Kerry\n     Rockefeller\n  The motion was agreed to.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition?\n  The Senator from Louisiana is recognized.\n\n[[Page S3567]]\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I seek recognition to ask unanimous \nconsent to lay aside the pending amendments so that I may call up four \nrather minor amendments, outline them very briefly, and basically put \nthem in order for consideration on the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I object only because we have not seen \nthe amendment. If we can see it fairly quickly, then I am sure we can \nproceed with it. So I would just call for a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Louisiana retains the floor.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I will be happy to send copies over to the \nSenator. I will resume consideration in a few minutes when she has a \ntime to peruse them.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator suggest the absence of a \nquorum?\n  Mr. VITTER. In the meantime, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. VITTER. Thank you, Mr. President. Again, I rise seeking \nconsideration of four specific amendments. All of them are hurricane \nrelated very directly, and none of them add to the cost of the bill.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3627\n\n  Mr. President, the first amendment I call up and ask for its \nconsideration is amendment No. 3627, which has been filed at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Louisiana [Mr. Vitter] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3627.\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To designate the areas affected by Hurricane Katrina or \nHurricane Rita as HUBZones and to waive the Small Business Competitive \n Demonstration Program Act of 1988 for the areas affected by Hurricane \n                       Katrina or Hurricane Rita)\n\n       On page 253, between lines 19 and 20, insert the following:\n\n\n    SMALL BUSINESS RELIEF FROM HURRICANE KATRINA AND HURRICANE RITA\n\n       Sec. 7032. (a) Section 3(p)(1) of the Small Business Act \n     (15 U.S.C. 632(p)(1)) is amended--\n       (1) in subparagraph (D), by striking ``or'';\n       (2) in subparagraph (E), by striking the period at the end \n     and inserting ``; or''; and\n       (3) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(F) an area in which the President has declared a major \n     disaster (as that term is defined in section 102 of the \n     Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance \n     Act (42 U.S.C. 5122)) as a result of Hurricane Katrina of \n     August 2005 or Hurricane Rita of September 2005.''.\n       (b) Section 711(d) of the Small Business Competitive \n     Demonstration Program Act of 1988 (15 U.S.C. 644 note) is \n     amended--\n       (1) by striking ``The Program'' and inserting the \n     following:\n       ``(1) In general.--Except as provided in paragraph (2), the \n     Program''; and\n       (2) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(2) Exception.--The Program shall not apply to any \n     contract related to relief or reconstruction from Hurricane \n     Katrina of 2005 or Hurricane Rita of 2005.''.\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, this amendment would do something very \nspecific, very narrow, but also very important in terms of making sure \nthat small business, including local business, gets a full opportunity \nto participate in the recovery throughout the gulf coast region. This \nwould designate the areas affected by Hurricane Katrina or Hurricane \nRita as HUBZones and would waive the Small Business Competitive \nDemonstration Program Act of 1988 for those specific areas.\n  This idea has been fully vetted in the committee of jurisdiction, the \nSmall Business Committee, on which I serve. It was an important element \nof a larger small business package that was reported out of the \ncommittee to the floor, to the full Senate. However, because of other \nunrelated matters in that bill package, that overall package has some \nobjection and has not passed through the Senate. So I simply chose to \nremove out of the full package these narrower HUBZone provisions to \ninclude in the supplemental bill.\n  I would also note that the leadership of the Small Business Committee \nsupports this move in terms of this legislation and has no objection to \nthe amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition? Is there further debate \non the amendment?\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3626\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I now call up amendment No. 3626 and ask \nfor its consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Louisiana [Mr. Vitter], for himself and \n     Ms. Landrieu, proposes an amendment numbered 3626.\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n     (Purpose: To increase the limits on community disaster loans)\n\n       On page 166, line 12, insert before the colon the \n     following: ``, and may be equal to not more than 50 percent \n     of the annual operating budget of the local government''.\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, this amendment has to do with the \nCommunity Disaster Loan Program. That is a preexisting program that \nexisted well before these hurricane events that in particular \nsituations loans money to communities in dire straits that have major \ndisasters and therefore revenue problems.\n  Obviously, in this hurricane, there are many communities in that \nsituation--the city of New Orleans, St. Bernard Parish, and others. The \ncommunity disaster loan program has been utilized to help them through \nthis very difficult time. Already in the supplemental appropriations \nbill is $300 million for this program, additional dollars to use in the \ndisaster area. My amendment would simply tweak certain language that \nwould say rather than the upper limit of a jurisdiction, which \njurisdiction is subject to be able to borrow being 25 percent of its \nannual operating budget, my language would raise that upper limit to 50 \npercent, so it would change language. It would not add money to the \nbill. The appropriations and the money are already in the bill.\n  This is very important for the hardest hit communities, such as St. \nBernard Parish, such as the city of New Orleans, because they have \nvirtually no revenue for the foreseeable future. This is absolutely \nnecessary to help them get through these very difficult times for the \nnext several months.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3628\n\n  Mr. VITTER. With that, Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 3628.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Louisiana [Mr. Vitter] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3628.\n\n  Mr. VITTER. I ask unanimous consent that reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To base the allocation of hurricane disaster relief and \n recovery funds to States on need and physical damages, and for other \n                               purposes)\n\n       On page 253, insert between lines 19 and 20, the following:\n\n\n  allocation of hurricane disaster relief and recovery funds to states\n\n       Sec. 7032. (a) In this section the term ``covered funds'' \n     means any funds that--\n       (1) are made available to a department or agency under \n     title II of this Act for hurricane disaster relief and \n     recovery; and\n       (2) are allocated by that department or agency for use by \n     the States.\n       (b) Notwithstanding any other provision of law (including \n     title II of this Act)--\n       (1) before making covered funds available to any State, the \n     head of the department or agency administering such funds \n     shall apply an allocation formula for all States based on \n     critical need and physical damages; and\n       (2) not later than 5 days before making such covered funds \n     available to any State, submit a report to the Committees on \n     Appropriations of the Senate and the House of Representatives \n     on the allocation formula that is being used.\n\n\n[[Page S3568]]\n\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, this amendment is language only. It does \nnot add dollars or cost to the bill. It is important language to make \nsure that all of our activity and all of our spending in the disaster \narea goes to important needs. This language would base the allocation \nof hurricane disaster relief and recovery funds to States on need and \nphysical damages rather than by other arbitrary allocation formulas. \nThis is specifically in the situation where Congress, in a particular \nissue area, allocates a fund for the entire disaster area and leaves it \nto the administration to disburse those funds between the various \nlocalities and States affected. This language would simply say that \nwhen you do that, the administration has to think about a fair formula \nthat is based on actual objective criteria that is based on actual \nobjective need or statistics that make sense and then would have to \npublish that formula with regard to the specific funds we are talking \nabout several days in advance of the money being disbursed. This would \nmake sure that the money is used appropriately in the disaster area and \nis not allocated in an arbitrary or purely political way.\n  That explains this amendment. Again, it is language. It does not add \nany additional cost to the bill.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3648\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to call up \namendment No. 3648 which is at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Louisiana [Mr. Vitter] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3648.\n\n  Mr. VITTER. I ask unanimous consent that reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n     (Purpose: To provide assistance to damaged fishery vessels in \n                      Hurricanes Katrina and Rita)\n\n       On Page 139, line 8, insert after ``and'' the following: \n     ``replace or''. On Page 139, line 17, insert after ``docks'' \n     the following: ``vessels''. on Page 140, line 22, after \n     ``repairing'' add ``vessels and''\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, this has to do with the fisheries \ncomponent of the bill. Thanks to the leadership of the chairman of the \ncommittee, a fisheries component was included in this supplemental \nappropriations bill because the fisheries industry was truly devastated \nalong the gulf coast. Before this general fisheries provision was \nadded, I believe this is the first instance in U.S. history where an \nadministration has made a declaration regarding fisheries losses but \nhas not followed that declaration of loss with a request for funds.\n  The chairman's committee action would, in a general sense, remedy \nthat. My amendment No. 3648 would tweak the language--again, not add or \nincrease any dollars--so that that money could be used in part for the \nrepairing of vessels in situations where those repair costs go beyond \ninsurance proceeds available and other available funds.\n  This is a very large component of the need that exists in the \nfisheries of the gulf coast. Passing this fisheries aid package without \nmaking any of that money available under the proper circumstances for \nrepairing vessels would leave a huge hole in our attempt to get that \nindustry up and running once again.\n  To reiterate, this is language that would not change or increase the \nspending level of the bill.\n  I have explained my four pending amendments. I look forward to any \nfurther discussion on them as well as votes, hopefully tomorrow.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum. The \ndistinguished Senator from Kentucky is on his way. He wishes to present \nwrap-up, and then I have an amendment to offer.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/04/26/senate-section/article/S3568-1", "month": "04", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3568]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

DWAIN PRESTON\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today to honor an outstanding \nIllinoisan, Dr. Dwain ``Doc'' Preston, one of our State's finest \neducators, and congratulate him on his upcoming retirement.\n  Doc Preston began his teaching career in 1961, after serving in the \nAir Force, at Quincy Junior High School in Quincy, IL. Since then, he \nhas taught high school and college students in a variety of fields \nincluding American history, English, and speech.\n  Doc Preston is retiring from his position at Quincy Notre Dame High \nSchool, QND, where he has educated and inspired his students for more \nthan 25 years. He has also taught at the University of Illinois in \nUrbana-Champaign, Western Illinois University in Macomb, and John Wood \nCommunity College in Quincy. Doc has taught his mother, mother-in-law, \nwife, and all four of his daughters at some point in time. He also \ntakes great pride in teaching senior citizens how to tell their life \nstories through writing.\n  Doc has served as a mentor and role model to so many students in \nwestern Illinois, including current and former members of my Senate \nstaff. He has emphasized the importance of writing and public speaking \nin all fields and careers and gently encouraged even the quietest \nstudents to express themselves.\n  In addition to his many successes as an educator, including winning \nthe prestigious Golden Apple and Rush Memorial Awards, Doc Preston is a \nprolific author and photographer as well as a professional storyteller. \nHe possesses a lifetime love of politics and has been active in his \ncommunity. He is a sage political observer and adviser, whether helping \nstudents on the Quincy Notre Dame Student Council or lending a hand in \nwriting announcement speeches for candidates.\n  Doc is supported in all his endeavors by his wonderful wife, Regina, \nalso a QND faculty member, and their 4 daughters--Carolyn, Cheryl, \nDeborah, and Teresa--and 11 grandchildren. He has shown his devotion to \nhis family by writing poems and books to mark the births and birthdays \nof his grandchildren as well as the weddings and birthdays of his \ndaughters and wife.\n  Mr. President, I congratulate Dr. Dwain Preston on his many \naccomplishments throughout his long and distinguished career. I am sure \nhis retirement will give him more time to spend with his family, write, \nand cheer on the St. Louis Cardinals.\n  I thank him for his service and wish him all the best.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/04/26/senate-section/article/S3568-3", "month": "04", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3568-S3569]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             EQUAL PAY DAY\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, today, is Equal Pay Day, which means that \n115 days into 2006, an average American woman will finally have earned \nenough in 2005 and 2006 together to equal what a man doing similar work \nearned by the end of 2005. Equal Pay Day is a sad reminder that gender \ndiscrimination is still very much a part of our country.\n  In America today, women earn only 77 cents for every dollar earned by \nmen. The wage gap exists in every segment of our society. Women of \nevery race and national origin earn less than their male counterparts. \nAfrican-American women earn just 68 percent of the average earnings of \nAfrican-American men. Latinas earn only 57 percent of the average \nLatino male wage. Asian-American women earn 88 cents for every dollar \nearned by Asian-American men.\n\n[[Page S3569]]\n\n  This is not a problem just for poor women or rich women; it cuts \nacross all occupations. There are even wage gaps in the operating room. \nThe average male physician or surgeon makes $52,000 more a year than \nthe average female physician. In the boardroom, the average male CEO \nmakes $35,000 more a year than his female counterpart.\n  There are wage gaps in the classroom. The average male teaching \nassistant earns $5,000 more a year than the average female. In the \ndining room, the average male cook makes $2,000 more than his female \ncounterpart.\n  The problem is not getting better. This year's wage gap of 23 cents \nis the same gap that existed in 2002. Since 1963, when the Equal Pay \nAct was passed, the wage gap has narrowed by less than half of a penny \na year.\n  The wage gap is caused in part by how society deals with the \nrealities of working women's lives, such as time out from the workforce \nto have children and care for family members. Among working women, \nnearly two-thirds do not receive paid maternity leave when they give \nbirth; a quarter have to quit their jobs to care for their children, \nand doing so permanently lowers their future earning potential. It is \nwrong to dismiss the pay gap as a consequence of women's choosing to \ntake time out of the workforce. Women do not willingly choose to forego \nfair pay in order to have children and care for elderly parents, nor \nshould they.\n  More important, we cannot blame the pay gap exclusively on women's \npredominant role in childcare. The evidence shows that actual gender \ndiscrimination also accounts for the disparity between men and women's \npay. In 2004, the Census Bureau concluded that the substantial gap in \nearnings between men and women could not completely be explained by \ndifferences in education, tenure in the workforce, or occupation. \nSimilarly, a recent General Accounting Office report concluded that the \ndifference in men and women's working patterns does not explain the \nentire disparity in their wages. Discrimination plays a role as well, \nand we need to combat it with Federal legislation to close the gap. \nCongress needs to act.\n  I strongly support Senator Clinton's Paycheck Fairness Act and \nSenator Harkin's Fair Pay Act to prevent and remedy gender pay \ndiscrimination. It is appalling and unacceptable that such \ndiscrimination still exists in America. The issue is simple fairness. I \nurge my colleagues to stand up for working women and end wage \ndiscrimination by passing the Paycheck Fairness Act and the Fair Pay \nAct.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/04/26/senate-section/article/S3569-1", "month": "04", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3569-S3584]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         RULES OF THE COMMITTEE ON ENVIRONMENT AND PUBLIC WORKS\n\n  Mr. INHOFE.

Mr. President, on Monday we observed the 91st anniversary \nof the Armenian genocide. On April 24, 1915, the Turkish Ottoman Empire \nbegan a coordinated campaign of deportation, expropriation, torture, \nstarvation, and massacre which lasted 8 long years and left an \nestimated 1.5 million Armenians dead. The violence forced an additional \n500,000 people to leave their homeland and live in exile.\n  The Armenian genocide is a shameful period in world history that \nhighlights the catastrophic consequences of inaction in the face of \nviolent persecution. It is a tragedy which could have and should have \nbeen prevented by the intervention of all nations who value freedom and \npeace. A retired Theodore Roosevelt wrote in 1918, ``The Armenian \nhorror is an accomplished fact. Its occurance was largely due to the \npolicy of pacifism this nation has followed for the last four years.'' \nRoosevelt argued for U.S. involvement ``because the Armenian massacre \nwas the greatest crime of the war, and failure to act against Turkey is \nto condone it; because the failure to deal radically with the Turkish \nhorror means that all talk of guaranteeing the future peace of the \nworld is mischievous nonsense.''\n  It is important to make clear that the annual remembrance of the \nArmenian genocide is not a condemnation of our NATO partner, the \npresent day Republic of Turkey. Indeed, it was the founder of the \nRepublic, Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, who ended the Ottoman government.\n  Instead, the annual remembrance of the Armenian genocide presents us \nwith an opportunity to both honor the memory of those that were lost \nand rededicate ourselves to working with our allies, including Turkey, \nto prevent any occurrences of persecution and genocide around the \nworld.\n  Unfortunately, we know too well that the Armenian genocide was the \nfirst but not the only genocide of the 20th century, and millions more \nperished as additional genocides were perpetrated against innocent \nminorities in Europe, Africa, and Asia. In remembering the victims of \npast genocides, we must now turn our efforts to ending the first \ngenocide of the 21st century in the Darfur region of Sudan.\n  Only by remembering the loss of family and loved ones and by working \nto alleviate the current suffering of others can we truly honor the \nvictims of the Armenian genocide. That is the goal of the 91st \nanniversary remembrance of the Armenian genocide.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/04/26/senate-section/article/S3585-2", "month": "04", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3585]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             EARTH DAY 2006\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, this past weekend we celebrated Earth \nDay. That celebration, begun in 1970 by the late Gaylord Nelson, a \ngreat environmental leader whose U.S. Senate seat I hold today, \nprovides us the chance to reflect on our environmental past, take stock \nof our present environmental situation, and formulate a vision for our \nenvironmental future.\n  We have much to be proud of in our past, especially the bipartisan \ninitiatives that were produced in the 1970s, including the Clean Air \nAct, the Endangered Species Act, and the Clean Water Act. \nUnfortunately, our present environmental circumstances show we have a \nlot of work to do. Mercury pollution contaminates our waterways and \nthreatens the health of our citizens, increased greenhouse gas \nemissions feed global climate change, and the majestic Great Lakes, a \nnatural resource of particular interest to me and my fellow \nWisconsinites, face such threats as invasive species and loss of \nwetlands. It is the future, though, that I urge Americans from all \nwalks of life and from all across the country to focus on as they \ncelebrate Earth Day this year.\n  Quite frankly, over the next few years we will face major decisions \nthat will shape our relationship to our natural resources. We can make \ndecisions that demonstrate we want a future that recognizes that when \nwe disrespect and dishonor the planet, we, in fact, disrespect and \ndishonor ourselves, or by failing to act or by making shortsighted \nchoices, we can turn our backs on our responsibility to pass on to \nfuture generations a vibrant and living planet.\n  Despite what is at stake, there is reason for hope. One of the most \npressing challenges we face is that of making a commitment--both \nindividually and collectively--to adopting sustainable energy habits \nthat will serve the country for years to come. Our Nation, throughout \nits history, has faced challenges that we have overcome based on our \ningenuity and our unwillingness to fail. It is this attitude that must \nbe embraced today as we look to our energy future.\n  We must challenge ourselves to adopt a new energy vision for the 21st \ncentury. This new vision involves moving away from our dependence on \noil, a source of energy that puts our environment, our national \nsecurity, and our economy at risk. We all know that the burning fossil \nfuels, like oil, emits tremendous amounts of greenhouse gases into our \natmosphere and that these gases fuel global warming. We all also know \nthat global climate change is a problem plagued by a lack of leadership \nby the current administration and by its allies in Congress. Getting \nreal about global warming--which must happen soon--will require a \ncommitment to reducing our dependence on oil as opposed to continually \nfighting about opening up pristine areas, including the Arctic National \nWildlife Refuge, for oil drilling. Reducing our dependence on oil will \nalso make us more secure. Given that we have less than 3 percent of the \nworld's proven oil reserves here in the United States, we will be \ndependent on others for our fuel until we get serious about using \nbiofuels that can be produced here at home.\n  A new energy future will not create itself--it will require a \ndedicated effort by individuals across the country and by decision \nmakers at all levels. This new energy future can be built on efforts to \nbe more efficient, efforts to only use only what we need, and efforts \nto use renewable sources of energy. While the Federal Government has \nfailed to take bold action, Americans are forging ahead, actually \nleading the way. For example, students at universities are holding \ncompetitions to reduce energy use, and nearly 200 cities are part of a \nnationwide movement to reduce greenhouse emissions in their cities to 7 \npercent below 1990 levels by 2012.\n  But more must be done, and Americans must demand accountability and \nleadership from their Federal elected officials.\n  So as we come together on Earth Day 2006, let's make a commitment to \neach other and to future generations to rise to the challenge of \nsecuring a new energy future for our country, for this is not only one \nof the most important environmental commitments we can make to each \nother, but it is also a decision about our national security and our \neconomy. Let's work toward an environmental future that our children's \nchildren will, years from now, reflect upon as a turning point in our \nhistory, a time during which we came together and worked for the best \ninterest of humanity, across the globe.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/04/26/senate-section/article/S3585-3", "month": "04", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3585-S3586]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n               HONORING ARMY LIEUTENANT JEROME N. SHAPIRO\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, this week, as we observe Holocaust \nRemembrance Day, Yom Hashoah, I would like to take a moment to \nrecognize Stephanie Mellen of Troy, MI, for her tireless and enduring \nefforts to honor the memory of her father and help ensure that the \nhorrific events of the Holocaust will never be forgotten.\n  On May 7, 1945, Ms. Mellen's father, 1Lt Jerome N. Shapiro, led the \nteam that captured Air Marshal Hermann Goering, the de facto leader of \nNazi Germany following Adolf Hitler's suicide. Eighty miles behind \nenemy lines in Austria, Lieutenant Shapiro and three others caught \nGoering and his entourage of 78 people. Goering calmly surrendered his \nweapon to Lieutenant Shapiro, a Jewish American, and was held under \nLieutenant Shapiro's command at Fischhorn Castle in Zell Am See, \nAustria, until he was transferred to Allied headquarters 2 days later. \nHermann Goering was the principal defendant at the Nuremberg Trials the \nfollowing year, and Lieutenant Shapiro continued as part of his guard \ndetail during the trial.\n  Lieutenant Shapiro was hesitant to talk about his role in Goering's \ncapture, but Stephanie Mellen began to\n\n[[Page S3586]]\n\nunderstand the importance of his story even as a young girl. She saw \nthe gun that her father was carrying when Goering surrendered and \nrecalls using Goering's field typewriter to type her school \nassignments. Stephanie was 13 years old when she saw her father named \nas ``Goering's guard'' in a television documentary. These memories \nhelped her to understand and appreciate what her father accomplished.\n  Lieutenant Shapiro passed away on April 4, 1968, but his legacy lives \non through the committed actions of his daughter. Stephanie Mellen has \nspent countless hours writing and speaking to educate people on the \nimportance of what her father did to bring Hermann Goering to justice. \nShe shares her father's story to honor the courage and resolve of \nLieutenant Shapiro and all those members of America's ``greatest \ngeneration'' who fought and defeated the Axis Powers in one of \nhumanity's most critical moments. But most of all, she shares the story \nof her father to remind all of us that the cause of universal human \nfreedom and dignity is our own.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/04/26/senate-section/article/S3586-1", "month": "04", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3586]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  NOTIFICATION OF AN EXECUTIVE ORDER BLOCKING PROPERTY OF ADDITIONAL \n   PERSONS IN CONNECTION WITH THE NATIONAL EMERGENCY WITH RESPECT TO \n                              SYRIA--PM 45\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and \nUrban Affairs.\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  Pursuant to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, as \namended (50 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.) (IEEPA), I hereby report that I have \nissued an Executive Order blocking property of persons in connection \nwith the terrorist act in Beirut, Lebanon, on February 14, 2005, that \nresulted in the assassination of former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafiq \nHariri and the deaths of 22 others, and other bombings or assassination \nattempts in Lebanon since October 1, 2004, that are related to Hariri's \nassassination or that implicate the Government of Syria or its officers \nor agents. I issued this order to take additional steps with respect to \nthe national emergency declared in Executive Order 13338 of May 11, \n2004, concerning certain actions of the Government of Syria. In \nExecutive Order 13338, I determined that the actions of the Government \nof Syria in supporting terrorism, continuing its occupation of Lebanon, \npursuing weapons of mass destruction, and undermining United States and \ninternational efforts in Iraq constituted an unusual and extraordinary \nthreat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the \nUnited States, and declared a national emergency to deal with that \nthreat.\n  The United Nations Security Council, in Resolution 1595 of April 7, \n2005, established the international independent investigation \nCommission (the ``Commission''), reiterated its call for the strict \nrespect of the sovereignty of Lebanon, and reaffirmed its unequivocal \ncondemnation of the February 14, 2005, terrorist bombing that killed \nLebanese Prime Minister Rafiq Hariri and 22 others. The Commission's \ncharter included identifying the bombing perpetrators, sponsors, \norganizers, and accomplices. United Nations Security Council Resolution \n(UNSCR) 1636 of October 31, 2005, called upon all States to provide \nnecessary assistance to the Commission concerning its investigation \ninto the February 14, 2005, terrorist bombing and to freeze the assets \nof those persons designated by the Commission or the Government of \nLebanon as suspected of involvement in this terrorist act, upon \nnotification of such designation to, and agreement of, the Committee of \nthe Security Council established by UNSCR 1636. United Nations Security \nCouncil Resolution 1644 of December 15, 2005, condemned other terrorist \nattacks in Lebanon since October 2004 and reaffirmed that all those \ninvolved in these attacks must be held accountable for these crimes, \nand in doing so, authorized the Commission to extend its technical \nassistance to Lebanese authorities with regard to their investigations \nregarding the terrorist attacks perpetrated in Lebanon since October 1, \n2004.\n\n  In view of UNSCR 1636, my new order takes additional steps with \nrespect to the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13338 by \nblocking the property and interests in property of persons determined \nby the Secretary of the Treasury, after consultation with the Secretary \nof State, to be, or to have been, involved in the planning, sponsoring, \norganizing, or perpetrating of the terrorist act on February 14, 2005, \nthat resulted in the assassination of former Prime Minister Rafiq \nHariri and the deaths of 22 others, or any other bombing, \nassassination, or assassination attempt in Lebanon since October 1, \n2004, that is related to Hariri's assassination or that implicates the \nGovernment of Syria or its officers and agents, or to have obstructed \nor otherwise impeded the work of the Commission. The order further \nauthorizes the Secretary of the Treasury, after consultation with the \nSecretary of State, to designate for blocking those persons determined \nto have materially assisted, sponsored, or provided financial, \nmaterial, or technological support for, or goods or services in support \nof, any such terrorist act, bombings, or assassination attempts, or any \nperson designated pursuant to this order, or to be owned or controlled \nby, or acting or purporting to act for or on behalf of, directly or \nindirectly, any person designated pursuant to this order.\n  I delegated to the Secretary of the Treasury, after consultation with \nthe Secretary of State, the authority to take such actions, including \nthe promulgation of rules and regulations, and to employ all powers \ngranted to the President by IEEPA and the United Nations Participation \nAct, as amended (22 U.S.C. 287c), as may be necessary to carry out the \npurposes of my order.

A bill to direct the Federal Communications Commission to \nmake efforts to reduce telephone rates for Armed Forces personnel \ndeployed overseas; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, the Call Home Act of 2006 would require \nthe Federal Communications Commission to take such actions as may be \nnecessary to reduce telephone rates for Armed Forces personnel deployed \noverseas, including the waiver of government fees, assessments, or \nother costs.\n  In seeking to reduce phone rates, the legislation would require the \nFCC to evaluate and analyze the costs of calls to and from official \nduty stations including vessels whether in port or under way; evaluate \nmethods of reducing rates including deployment of new technology such \nas Voice over Internet protocol, VOIP, or other Internet protocol \ntechnology; encourage phone companies to adopt flexible billing \nprocedures and policies call to and from Armed Forces personnel; and \nseek agreements with foreign governments to reduce international \nsurcharges on phone calls.\n  The legislation would, however, prohibit the FCC from regulating \nrates in order to carry out the Call Home Act's requirements.\n  The Call Home Act of 2006 would replace similar legislation from 1992 \nthat limited the FCC's efforts to reduce rates to specific countries. \nThe Call Home Act would expand the FCC's efforts to benefit troops \nwherever they are deployed in support of the global war on terrorism.\n  We have received a letter of support from the Military Coalition, \nwhich represents 36 military and veterans groups. We have also received \nletters of support from individual members of that coalition and others \nurging Congress to enact this legislation: Veterans of Foreign Wars; \nAssociation of the United States Army; Enlisted Association of the \nNational Guard; Military Officers Association of America; American \nLegion; Naval Reserve Association; Naval Enlisted Reserve Association; \nGold Star Wives of America; and Air Force Sergeants Association.\n  The Veterans of Foreign Wars' letter of support says that calls home \nare ``lifeline'' for the brave men and women stationed abroad.\n  I urge you to vote for this important legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent letters in support of this legislation be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                       The Military Coalition,\n\n                                   Alexandria, VA, April 10, 2006.\n     Hon. Ted Stevens,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Stevens: The Military Coalition (TMC), a \n     consortium of uniformed services and veterans associations \n     representing more than 5.5 million current and former \n     servicemembers and their families and survivors, is writing \n     to express our strong support of your bill, ``Call Home Act \n     of 2006,'' that directs the Federal Communications Commission \n     to seek ways to reduce telephone rates for Armed Forces \n     personnel deployed overseas.\n       Everyday, military members deployed or assigned \n     unaccompanied overseas are faced with the burdens of being \n     separated from families and loved ones. Your bill recognizes \n     the burden these members and families encounter and takes an \n     important step forward to reduce the costs of high phone \n     rates.\n       The Military Coalition thanks you for introducing this \n     legislation and recommends that the bill be expanded to \n     include all members of the uniformed services. We also \n     appreciate your leadership on issues affecting all \n     servicemembers and their families and pledge our strong \n     support in seeking enactment of this important legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n       Signed by 36 representatives of member organizations of the \n     Military Coalition.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                Association of the\n\n\n                                           United States Army,\n\n                                     Arlington, VA, April 6, 2006.\n     Hon.

Ted Stevens,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Stevens: On behalf of the 4 million members of \n     The American Legion Family, I would like to take this \n     opportunity to offer our support for your draft legislation \n     entitled, The Call Home Act of 2006.\n       Your legislation would direct the Federal Communications \n     Commission (FCC) to make every effort possible to reduce \n     telephone rates for those deployed and fighting overseas in \n     the war on terror. The bill also directs the FCC to develop \n     new technologies, encourage foreign governments to reduce \n     international surcharges, and help provide flexible billing \n     for troops and their families. All of these things would help \n     make positive improvements in the lives of our servicemembers \n     who just want to phone home and talk to a loved one.\n       We support efforts to reduce telephone rates for our \n     servicemembers stationed overseas who depend on an affordable \n     and timely means of communication with their family and loved \n     ones. Over a decade ago, American Legion National Commanders \n     discovered in their visits to troops in the Balkans that our \n     servicemembers were being charged exorbant telephone rates to \n     call home. The American Legion is strongly supportive of \n     military quality of life, and frequent and timely calling \n     home is a huge morale factor which could only pay dividends \n     to oUr troops going into harm's way.\n       Thank you for introducing this legislation and for your \n     continuous support of those on the battlefield today. We look \n     forward to working with you and your staff on the enactment \n     of this legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                                Clarence Hill,\n\n                                                         Chairman,\n     National Security Commission.\n                                  ____\n\n                                       Enlisted Association of the\n\n\n                                               National Guard,\n\n                                    Alexandria, VA, April 6, 2006.\n     Hon.

The bill also directs FCC to evaluate the \n     role of new technologies, encourage foreign governments to \n     reduce international surcharges, and help provide flexible \n     billing for troops and their families. All of these things \n     would help make positive improvements in the lives of our \n     servicemembers who just want to phone home and talk to a \n     loved one.\n       We believe that telephone calls and service are a lifeline \n     for our servicemembers stationed abroad who depend on an \n     affordable means of communication with their friends and \n     family. To help decrease these costs in any way is the least \n     we can do for those fighting for our freedoms and for their \n     families who are making their own sacrifices on the home \n     front.\n       Thank you for introducing this legislation and for your \n     continuous support of those on the battlefield today. We look \n     forward to working with you and your staff on the enactment \n     of this legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Robert E.

A bill to protect consumers, and especially young consumers, \nfrom skyrocketing consumer debt and the barrage of credit card \nsolicitations, to establish a financial literacy and education program \nin elementary and secondary schools to help prepare young people to be \nfinancially responsible consumers, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. MENENDEZ:\n  S. 2655. A bill to amend the Truth in Lending Act, to prohibit \nuniversal default practices by credit card issuers, to limit fees that \nmay be imposed on credit card accounts, and to require credit card \nissuers to verify a prospective consumer's ability to pay before \nextending credit to the consumer, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, today, families across this country face \na growing problem of rising credit card debt. In 2004, the average \nAmerican household had $9,300 in credit card debt, up from $3,200 just \n12 years earlier. More and more Americans are using credit card debt to \nmanage daily living expenses such as basic living costs, medical bills, \nand house or automotive repairs. And for college students, the problem \ncannot be overstated. According to university administrators, colleges \nlose more students to credit card debt than to academic failure.\n  To fuel that growth, credit card issuers have increased the number of\n\n[[Page S3593]]\n\nsolicitations sent to consumers 500 percent since 1990 to a record 5.23 \nbillion in 2004. And they start sending them to children at younger and \nyounger ages. Last year, AJ, the son of my State director received his \nvery first solicitation at the age of 2 years old. If you have a pulse \nand a social security number, you can get a credit card.\n  Credit card companies are increasingly targeting people who are \nlikely to default. They have focused their attention on teenagers and \ncollege students, people who live beyond their means, and those who \nhave declared bankruptcy. Clearly, credit card companies are not paying \nattention to whom they are giving a credit card, much less if the \napplicant can afford to pay the balance.\n  There is no question that we must demand personal responsibility from \nconsumers, but at the same time credit card companies should not be \nallowed to take advantage of consumers with excessive fees and \nunreasonable interest rates. One study found that people in this Nation \npay $90 billion each year in penalty fees and interest payments. Just \nthink about that for a second--- $90 billion annually. It is money that \ncould be used to send our children to college, to pay the health care \nbills of both our children in the dawn of their lives and our parents \nin the sunset of theirs, while still saving for our own retirements.\n  One of the most egregious practices is known as ``universal \ndefault.'' It involves credit card companies raising interest rates, up \nto 30 percent APR, on customers who have a perfect record with the \ncredit card but miss a payment with any other creditor. So a person can \nmake their credit card payment on time every month but see their \ninterest rate skyrocket because they paid their gas bill late. Further, \nthis penalty interest rate is often applied not only to future \npurchases but retroactively to current balances as well. This is a \ncompletely arbitrary rate-hike intended solely to hike the company's \nbottom line.\n  That is why I am introducing the Credit Card Bill of Rights--two \npieces of legislation that, taken together, will stop some of the most \negregious practices of credit card issuers while also ensuring that \nfuture generations have the information to make financial decisions.\n  Many American adolescents are inadequately prepared for the complex \nfinancial world that awaits them. In 2004, almost two-thirds of the \nstudents who took a personal finance survey failed the test.\n  The causes for this failure are largely due to the lack of high \nschool finance courses available to teenagers combined with \ninsufficient parental mentoring. Statistics show that while a large \nmajority of both college and high school students rely on their parents \nfor financial guidance, only 26 percent of 13- to 21-year-olds reported \ntheir parents actively taught them how to manage money. Public \neducation has not filled this void as only about one in five students \nbetween the ages of 16 and 22 say they have taken a personal finance \ncourse in school.\n  Credit card companies are exploiting this financial inexperience of \nyoung Americans with an aggressive marketing strategy designed to \nmaximize enrollment and profit, with little regard for a potential \ncustomer's ability to pay. As a result, over 20 percent of children \nbetween the ages of 12 to 19 have access to a credit card.\n  This credit card marketing blitz further intensifies once an \nindividual enters college. During the first week college freshmen \narrive on campus, they are barraged by an average of eight credit card \noffers. Students actually double their average credit card debt, and \ntriple the number of credit cards in their wallets, from the time they \narrive on campus until graduation. This large number of new credit card \nowners combined with the lack of financial illiteracy of high school \ngraduates leads to high levels of debt amongst undergrads.\n  Credit card companies have actually encouraged this rise in credit \ncard debt through increasing the median balance for undergraduates. As \na result, 21 percent of undergraduates that have credit cards, have \nhigh-level balances between $3,000 and $7,000.\n  The Protection of Young Consumers Act will protect people, especially \ncollege students and other young people, against skyrocketing consumer \ndebt and the barrage of credit card solicitations that lead to it. The \nbill will do so by building on the current opt-out program for pre-\napproved credit card solicitations by requiring young consumers under \nage 21 to proactively opt-in to receive solicitations from credit card \ncompanies. This proposal will also establish a financial literacy and \neducation program in elementary and secondary schools to help prepare \nyoung people to be financially responsible consumers.\n  In addition to targeting high school and college students, credit \ncard companies have become very adept at increasing their profits \nthrough hidden fees and deceptive advertising, taking advantage of \nAmericans of all ages.\n  The Credit Card Reform Act will protect consumers against hidden fees \nand excessive interest rates. It does so by: 1) prohibiting ``universal \ndefaults'' that I mentioned earlier, 2) banning unilateral changes in \ncredit card agreements without written consent, and 3) requiring that \nthe fees charged by creditors are ``reasonably related'' to the cost \nincurred by the issuer.\n  The bill will also establish standards that would prohibit unfair or \ndeceptive acts or practices, while tightening regulations on credit \ncard companies to ensure that they are not offering credit to high-risk \ncardholders without verifying their ability to pay.\n  I would like to be clear that I am not trying to remove the \nobligation for consumers to behave responsibly. Every individual must \ntake responsibility for their own actions, but at the same time it is \nthe obligation of the companies who are earning billions in profits \nfrom credit cards to behave ethically as well.\n  This Credit Card Bill of Rights will help ensure that New Jersey \nconsumers and consumers across the country are given a fair chance at \nbeing responsible consumers who will enjoy economic security as well as \neconomic opportunity in their futures.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BOND (for himself and Mr. Leahy):\n  S. 2658. A bill to amend title 10, United States Code, to enhance the \nnational defense through empowerment of the Chief of the National Guard \nBureau and the enhancement of the functions of the National Guard \nBureau, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Armed Services.\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, today I join my friend and fellow cochair of \nthe Senate National Guard caucus, Senator Pat Leahy, in introducing \nbipartisan legislation to strengthen one of our Nation's most important \nmilitary and civilian resources--the National Guard.\n  The Guard has a long and proud history of contributing to America's \nmilitary away game, while providing vital support and security to civil \nauthorities in the home game. Since September 11, 2001, our citizen-\nsoldiers have taken on greater responsibilities and risks from fighting \nthe war on terror to disaster assistance.\n  Today, the Guard supports the Nation's military strategy overseas, \nfunctions as a primary line of defense here at home, and helps local \nresponders deal with overwhelming natural disasters.\n  We have seen the tremendous value of Guard forces as they confront \nterrorists in Afghanistan, Iraq, and other hotspots, and as they \nprovide water, food, and health supplies to victims of Hurricane \nKatrina and other natural disasters.\n  More than 1,300 guardsmen from my home State of Missouri were \ndeployed in less than 72 hours following Hurricane Katrina, providing \nmedical, transportation, airlift, military police, engineering, and \ncommunications capabilities. For example, the 139th Airlift Wing \nevacuated 23 critically ill young patients from Children's Hospital in \nNew Orleans and brought them to Children's Mercy Hospital in Kansas \nCity for the high-level care they needed.\n  Stories such as this were repeated all over the country in most if \nnot all our States.\n  Why was the Guard successful when other elements of the Katrina \nresponse were not? Quite simply, the Guard is the entity best organized \nand trained to initiate and coordinate a civil response to any disaster \non the scale of Katrina.\n  In addition, more than 200,000 Guard troops have left their homes, \ntheir\n\n[[Page S3594]]\n\njobs, and their families to participate in another critical mission: \nthe global war on terror. The National Guard has provided as much as \nhalf the combat force and 40 percent of the total force in Iraq.\n  I point out that the Guard is a tremendous value for the capabilities \nit provides. It gives 40 percent of the total military force for around \n4.5 percent of the budget. Whether at home or abroad, the men and women \nof the Guard are performing their duties with honor and valor, often at \ngreat sacrifice to their families and their own lives. As they \nwillingly make these sacrifices to preserve American lives and \nfreedoms, we have a responsibility to support them as they carry out \ntheir unique dual mission.\n  While serving abroad, National Guard troops serve under Air Force and \nArmy commands under title 10 status. But when the Guard operates at \nhome, they serve under the command and control of the Nation's \nGovernors in title 32 status.\n  There is a lot more we can do to make this work more smoothly.\n  Despite their importance on the street, as it were, the Guard is \noften given short shrift back at Pentagon headquarters, which has \nproposed repeatedly to cut Guard personnel and equipment budgets.\n  The Guard will play a critical role in response to another terrorist \nattack or natural disaster, but the Pentagon has allowed its equipment \nlevels to sink to dangerously low levels. Currently, the National Guard \nhas only about 35 percent of the equipment it needs. In Missouri, only \none of two engineering battalions that were requested to assist with \nKatrina could respond because the other one did not have the equipment \nthey needed.\n  With the support of 75 of my colleagues, Senator Leahy and I led an \neffort to increase equipment funding for the Guard by almost $1 \nbillion. We are going to continue that fight this year to ensure the \nGuard has equipment it needs to carry out both missions.\n  Just a few months ago, the Army proposed significant cuts to Guard \ntroop strength. Three-quarters of the Senate again joined us in a \nletter opposing this, and I thank all of our colleagues who joined us.\n  We need to do more to empower the Guard. We need to give the Guard \nmore bureaucratic muscle. Time and again, the Guard has had to rely on \nCongress, not its total force partners in the active duty, to provide \nand equip fully the resources it needs to fulfill its missions.\n  That the Guard is left out of the Pentagon decisionmaking process is \nbeyond dispute. In the most recent Quadrennial Defense Review, during \nthe BRAC review process of 2004 and 2005, when the Army and Air Force \nreduced National Guard force structure in 2005, and when equipment \nlevels of the Army and National Guard reached the dangerously low \nlevels of 35 percent, Congress has had to step in.\n  To remedy this, the legislation we introduce today to strengthen the \nGuard consists of three central planks.\n  One, we will allow the National Guard Bureau to establish more formal \nrelationships with the Secretary of Defense and the Joint Chiefs.\n  We will give the Guard more muscle in existing relationships, \nelevating the Chief of the National Guard Bureau to a four-star \nposition and providing a seat for him on the Joint Chiefs of Staff.\n  It goes without saying that to be a part of a big decision, you have \nto be at the table. Having a four-star Guard general providing advice \nto the SECDEF instead of a two-star major general will give our \ngovernors and 450,000 citizen-soldiers and airmen access to the highest \nlevel of the DOD and ensure key policy decisions are heard and taken \ninto account.\n  To put things in perspective, the Active-Duty Army has 12 four-star \ngenerals and 46 lieutenant generals. The Air Force has 13 four-star \ngenerals and 35 lieutenant generals. The National Guard, which \nrepresents over 40 percent of the entire force structure, is \nrepresented by three lieutenant generals and zero four-star generals.\n  Can anyone tell me with a straight face how the Guard one four-star \ngeneral and an additional three-star will endanger our national \nsecurity? The only element endangered would be the Pentagon status quo \nwhich is outdated.\n  Facts are stubborn things. Clearly, the facts demonstrate a glaring, \ndisproportionate number of three- and four-star generals in the Army \nand the Air Force when compared with the Guard.\n  Second, we will ensure that the Deputy Commander of the Northern \nCommand is a member of the Guard, a new command with the mission of \ncoordinating responses to emergencies within the United States.\n  The Guard is the entity best suited to respond to major incidents, \nand they need that capability. With both the Guard and NorthCom's \nmissions being defense of the homeland, it only makes sense to have \nsubstantive input through a lieutenant general as deputy commander.\n  Finally, we must ensure the Guard plays a role in identifying and \nfilling any gaps between civilian emergency response capabilities and \nthose of the military. Current DOD policy prohibits procurement of \nsupplies or equipment for providing military support to civilian \nauthorities during emergencies except with the permission of SECDEF. \nThat policy is outdated. It will give the National Guard Bureau, in \nconsultation with the State adjutant generals, the budgetary power to \nresearch, validate, and make those equipment purchases.\n  Neither the homeland support nor the military support missions of the \nGuard are likely to diminish. They are needed more now than ever. But \nwe must strengthen the decisionmaking capability of Guard leaders \nwithin the Department of Defense.\n  As we heard today from General Blum, Chief of the National Guard \nBureau, before the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee when he was \nasked questions by Senator Inouye, he responded with a football \nanalogy. When we asked him if he was in the huddle, he said he was \n``not in the huddle'' during the QDR.\n  This legislation would empower the Guard to respond in the \naffirmative the next time it is asked, ``are you in the huddle'' on \nthis major decision.\n  I thank my colleagues for their past support. I ask for their support \nof this legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that congressional findings \nregarding National Guard Forces be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                         National Guard Forces\n\n       (a) Congressional Findings.--The Congress finds that--\n       1. The Constitution of the United States recognizes a well-\n     regulated militia is a necessity to the security of a free \n     state.\n       2. The United States continues to face a wide spectrum of \n     threats at home and abroad, including terrorism, natural \n     disasters, proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and \n     other emerging perils. In meeting these threats, the United \n     States relies heavily on the men and women of the National \n     Guard.\n       3. At no time in America's history has the National Guard \n     played so critical a role in the security of our homeland and \n     in our Nation's military objectives abroad.\n       4. The National Guard is a vital part of this Nation's \n     security, and this country relies on the exemplary service \n     provided this Nation by the members of the Guard, their \n     families, their employers and their communities.\n       5. The National Guard is a critical component of the \n     Department of Defense's contribution to the security of our \n     Nation and has been key to the Department's accomplishments \n     at home and abroad. Much of the success DOD has had would not \n     have been possible without the participation of National \n     Guard forces.\n       6. The National Guard's response to our Nation's \n     emergencies in the post 9/11 world has been unparalleled.\n       7. Within hours of the attacks on the World Trade Center, \n     1,500 New York National Guard troops reported for duty. \n     Within 24 hours of the attacks, over 8,000 New York National \n     Guard Soldiers and Air men and women were on active duty \n     supporting New York State's security needs. These troops \n     provided not just a calming presence on the streets of New \n     York during unsettling times; they provided New York's first \n     responders with critical perimeter security support, \n     refueling for civilian emergency vehicles, emergency \n     lighting, power generation, communications, emergency \n     transportation, engineering assets and other logistical \n     support.\n       8. At the request of the President, State Governors \n     supplemented the security of the Nation's airports with \n     National Guard personnel. Their missions encompassed over 400 \n     airports in 52 States and territories. National Guard troops \n     along the northern and southern borders were used to support \n     the U.S. Custom Service, the Immigration and Naturalization \n     Service, and the Border Patrol in the heightened post 9/11 \n     security posture.\n\n[[Page S3595]]\n\n       9. In contrast to Hurricane Andrew (1992) in which National \n     Guard forces constituted 24 percent of the military response, \n     National Guard forces represented more than 70 percent of the \n     military force for Hurricane Katrina.\n       10. The response to Hurricane Katrina proved that the \n     National Guard is the Nation's first military responder and \n     that the overwhelming majority of forces that respond to \n     disasters in the United States will be National Guard who \n     will be on the scene before the Department of Defense is \n     requested to respond.\n       11. More than 9,700 National Guard soldiers and airmen were \n     in New Orleans by August 30. National Guard deployed over \n     30,000 additional troops within 96 hours of the storms \n     passing. In wake of the Hurricane Katrina devastation, the \n     National Guard mobilized over 50,000 personnel in support of \n     hurricane relief in the largest and fastest domestic \n     deployment since World War II, saving over 17,000 lives. The \n     Air National Guard flew nearly 3,500 flights and over 12,000 \n     tons of cargo in support of all Hurricane relief in the last \n     year.\n       12. The National Guard Bureau will be a part of any large-\n     scale emergency response. As demonstrated during the \n     Hurricane Katrina response, the National Guard Bureau is a \n     significant joint force provider for homeland security \n     missions.\n       13. The National Guard is continuously on active duty \n     supporting State security missions, Federal security missions \n     under Operation Noble Eagle and overseas military operations \n     as part of Operation Enduring Freedom, Iraqi Freedom and more \n     are engaged in regularly scheduled training and operational \n     requirements around the Nation and the world. Under Title 32, \n     counter-drug activities are a daily operational mission of \n     the National Guard, fortifying a longstanding successful \n     relationship with civil authorities.\n       14. The Department of the Army and the Department of the \n     Air Force could not fulfill current Title 10 responsibilities \n     without the Army and Air National Guard. In 2005, National \n     Guard units at one time made up 50 percent of the combat \n     forces in Iraq.\n       15. The National Guard has mobilized over 300,000 soldiers \n     and 36,000 airmen supporting the Global War on Terror since \n     September 11, 2001. (Need NGB confirmation)\n       16. Since September 11, 2001, 85 percent of the Army \n     National Guard has been mobilized. Since September 11, 2001, \n     the Air National Guard has flown over 206,000 sorties \n     accumulating over 620,000 flying hours. These deployments \n     abroad have created a battle hardened and seasoned force of \n     experienced veterans ready for the challenges of the 21st \n     century.\n       17. National Guard forces have provided: 55 percent of the \n     Army's combat capability; 55 percent of the Air Force's \n     airlift capability; 50 percent of the Army strategic and \n     tactical manpower; 45 percent of all in-flight refueling \n     missions; 33 percent of all aircraft in Operation Iraqi \n     Freedom; 100 percent of Operation Enduring Freedom A-10 \n     missions; 66 percent of Operation Iraqi Freedom A-10 \n     missions; 45 percent of all F-16 fighter missions; 86 \n     percent of Operation Iraqi Freedom tanker sorties; 94 \n     percent of Strategic Air Defense Alert; and 75 percent of \n     all domestic combat air patrols in the Global War on \n     Terror.\n       18. The National Guard offers unique efficiencies between \n     State and Federal, and domestic and overseas missions, \n     operating under three different command relationships: \n     Federal funding and Federal control; Federal funding and \n     State control; and State funding and State control.\n       19. National Guardsmen and women are their State's primary \n     emergency response force, providing support in their \n     communities and to civil authorities and first responders \n     throughout their States.\n       20. The National Guard is invaluable to civil support \n     mission, homeland defense and emergency preparedness. The \n     National Guard has an undeniable record of military \n     assistance to civilian authorities since the birth of this \n     Nation, responding heroically and meeting every mission asked \n     of them, particularly in times of crisis--terrorism, natural \n     disasters, plane crashes, blizzards, wildfires, floods.\n       21. There must be strong agreement between State and \n     Federal leadership as to the operational objectives during \n     emergencies. State concerns about maintaining sovereignty \n     must be respected. Governors, who are most intimately \n     familiar with and better understand the National Guard's \n     unique capabilities, must retain the ability and authority to \n     deploy their National Guard troops in times of crisis.\n       22. Governors using State-to-State emergency mutual \n     assistance compacts are an integral part of the use of \n     National Guard resources in responding to emergencies at \n     home.\n       23. The National Guard and State Adjutants General are \n     invaluable nexus of coordination between Federal and State \n     planning, exercising and response to emergencies and \n     disasters. Over 50 percent of State Adjutants General are \n     also State Emergency Managers offering unparalleled \n     integration of planning, preparation and response \n     capabilities in emergencies.\n       24. National Guard forces are also uniquely positioned to \n     engage within the U.S. and its territories by virtue of their \n     geographic dispersal and relationships to State and local \n     governments.\n       25. The National Guard is familiar with the local area and \n     local culture. The National Guard has close ties with first \n     responders such as local and State law enforcement, fire \n     departments, and other emergency service providers. The local \n     community relies upon the National Guard because they are \n     part of the community. National Guard personnel are more \n     likely to have more experience working with local \n     responders than the active component.\n       26. WMD Civil Support Teams are a specialized homeland \n     security capability based entirely in the National Guard.\n       27. As America prepares for an influenza pandemic, the \n     National Guard has more domestic response training and \n     decentralized capabilities than any other military \n     organization and ready to respond in a moment's notice.\n       28. The National Guard Bureau has proved its ability to \n     plan for and respond to natural and man-made events with the \n     establishment of Joint Force Headquarters-State, Joint Task \n     Force State, CBRNE Enhanced Response Force Packages, CERFP, \n     National Guard Reaction Force, NGRF, and the current \n     development of Joint CONUS Communications Support \n     Environment, JCCSE.\n       Congress finds that despite the contributions of the \n     National Guard to the United States--\n       1. The Department of Defense has not adapted to the \n     significant role of the National Guard in this nation's \n     security.\n       2. The Department of Defense, the Department of the Army \n     and the Department of the Air Force have not sufficiently \n     integrated the National Guard into planning, procuring or \n     decision-making processes.\n       3. The Department of Defense, the Department of the Army \n     and the Department of the Air Force do not have a long-term \n     strategy to equip the National Guard at a high level of \n     readiness for overseas or domestic missions.\n       4. The Department of Defense does not adequately resource \n     or equip the National Guard for its current operational \n     missions. Currently the National Guard receives only 4.5 \n     percent of the Department of Defense's budget.\n       5. The Army National Guard has been equipped at less than \n     war-time readiness levels and is forced to transfer equipment \n     to deploying units. Army National Guard units that have \n     returned from overseas deployments have also left behind many \n     equipment items for use by follow on units. Army officials do \n     not track and develop plans to replace Guard equipment.\n       6. Army and Air National Guard forces are generally \n     expected to perform homeland defense and civil support \n     missions only with equipment supplied for their war-fighting \n     mission or equipment supplied by the States.\n       7. In the current budget, the Department of the Air Force \n     does not fund the Air Sovereignty Alert mission of the Air \n     National Guard at full capacity.\n       8. During the BRAC process, the Air Force failed to \n     adequately solicit input of Air Guard leadership and State \n     Adjutants General.\n       9. When developing Future Total Force Strategy, the Air \n     Force failed to adequately consult Air Guard leaders and \n     State Adjutants General.\n       10. The Department of Defense does not have adequate \n     knowledge of the role of the National Guard at home or \n     incorporated the National Guard's significant capabilities \n     into plans for homeland defense or security.\n       11. Left unchecked, the Department of Defense will continue \n     to ignore the Federal requirements of the National Guard to \n     perform homeland defense and civil support missions.\n       12. The Department of Defense has not recognized the value \n     of including State Adjutants General in all homeland defense \n     and military support to civilian authority planning.\n       13. The Department of Defense has not recognized that \n     governors will rely on National Guard manpower and equipment \n     before relying on Federal forces.\n       14. Although DOD has a Strategy for Homeland Defense and \n     Civil Support, which recognizes the National Guard's critical \n     role in Federal and State missions, the strategy does not \n     detail what the Army or Air National Guard's role or \n     requirements will be in implementing the strategy.\n       15. The Department of Defense and Northern Command have not \n     articulated specific requirements or capabilities that \n     National Guard forces need during major homeland disasters. \n     Without formal requirements, equipment deemed necessary for \n     the National Guard to assist civilian authorities in Katrina \n     had not been purchased by the Department of the Army and the \n     Department of the Air Force.\n       16. The readiness of the National Guard to perform homeland \n     missions that may be needed in the future is unknown because \n     the National Guard's roles in these missions has not been \n     defined and requirements for manpower, equipment and training \n     have not been established; and preparedness standards and \n     measures have not been developed by the Department of \n     Defense. The Department of Defense does not require the \n     purchase of equipment specifically for military assistance to \n     civilian authorities for the National Guard.\n       17. WMD Civil Support Teams' face challenges in personnel, \n     equipment acquisition and facilities under current Department \n     of Defense and service budgets.\n       18. The lack of coordination of National Guard and active \n     duty forces hampered the military response to Katrina. \n     Advance planning between active-duty personnel and the Guard \n     is vital during emergencies. The Department of Defense and \n     the National Guard\n\n[[Page S3596]]\n\n     must plan and exercise together to prepare for events in the \n     homeland.\n       19. The National Guard leadership and State Adjutants \n     General are not adequately involved in Department of Defense \n     planning guidance developed at Northern Command, including \n     concept of operations plans and functional plans for military \n     support to civilian authorities.\n       20. There was a lack of coordination of Joint Task Force \n     Katrina and the National Guard headquarters in supporting \n     States.\n       21. The Department of Defense has not adequately \n     incorporated or funded the National Guard to participate in \n     joint exercises in military assistance to civil authorities, \n     which would have allowed for a more effective response to \n     Hurricane Katrina and other homeland emergencies.\n       22. Northern Command does not have adequate insight into \n     State response capabilities or adequate interface with \n     governors, which contributed to a lack of mutual \n     understanding and trust during the Katrina response.\n       23. There is an unresolved tension between the Department \n     of Defense and the States regarding the role of the military \n     in emergency response that could be resolved if the \n     Department of Defense and the Department of Homeland Security \n     adopted and made NIMS a priority for emergency management.\n       24. The National Guard lacked communications equipment \n     during Hurricane Katrina, suggesting that the Pentagon does \n     not assign homeland defense and military assistance to \n     civilian authorities a sufficiently high priority.\n       25. The Department of the Army decided to reduce end-\n     strength without substantive consultation with Guard leaders \n     and the Air Force has decided to reduce end-strength without \n     substantive consultation with National Guard leaders.\n       26. The Department of the Army currently plans to scale \n     back the Army National Guard to 324,000 soldiers from \n     350,000. The Department of the Air Force plans to scale back \n     the Air National Guard by 14,000 airmen and women. To cut \n     Guard manpower in this time of increased homeland need, and \n     the fluxation of current Department of Defense transformation \n     policies affecting the Army and Air National Guard, sets up \n     an undeniable risk to this country.\n       27. National Guard force structure cuts could result in the \n     closure of over 200 National Guard community-based facilities \n     throughout the U.S.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n       1. The National Guard is a force essential to the Nation's \n     security and safety.\n       2. The National Guard brings to bear significant \n     capabilities for contingencies at home or abroad.\n       3. The National Guard is no longer a strategic reserve, but \n     an operational reserve.\n       4. States and governors are not adequately represented at \n     the Department of Defense.\n       5. The role of the National Guard Bureau as chief \n     communicator between the Department of Defense and the \n     Department of Homeland Security and the States needs to be \n     enhanced.\n       6. The men and women of the National Guard have earned the \n     right to be represented at the highest levels of the \n     Department of Defense.\n       7. The National Guard leadership needs to be integrated \n     into the highest offices in the Department of Defense, the \n     Department of the Army and the Department of the Air Force.\n       8. The National Guard Bureau plays a critical role in \n     planning for and responding to future terrorist attacks in \n     the U.S.\n       9. The National Guard Bureau is in a unique position to \n     understand and create requirements for the National Guard for \n     missions in support of states and other civilian authorities.\n       10. The National Guard Bureau plays a critical role in the \n     development of requirements for military assistance to \n     civilian authorities.\n       11. NORTHCOM lacks knowledge of its theater of operations, \n     specifically State emergency plans and resources, and \n     knowledge of National Guard resources. NORTHCOM needs to be \n     reformed to include increased National Guard leadership and \n     participation in all levels of its operations.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr President, I am pleased today to join my friend and co-\nchair of the Senate National Guard Caucus, the Senator from Missouri, \nSenator Bond, in introducing far-reaching legislation that will \nstrengthen our Nation's defense and the National Guard, which is an \ninextricable part of the bedrock of our security. The National Defense \nEnhancement and National Guard Empowerment Act of 2006 would empower \nthe National Guard.\n  It offers the Guard new authorities and a greater and more fitting \nvoice in policy and budgetary discussions that is more line with the \nreliance that we place on this force of proud men and women.\n  The Nation asks the Guard to provide a large part of the ground \nforces in Iraq, but then we give the force no say in strategic planning \nand budget discussions. In fact, there have been recent efforts within \nthe armed services to cut the force precipitously.\n  Anyone who has watched recent events knows that the role of the Guard \nis dramatically changed as we come into this century.\n  We ask the Guard to carry out missions at home in response to \ndisasters and possible domestic attacks, but then give the force no \nreal ability to develop new equipment for this unique mission. And, in \na crunch, our senior defense leaders--including the President--turn to \nthe Chief of the National Guard for guidance in addressing and \nresponding to emergencies within the domestic United States, yet those \nsame senior Guard leaders receive only mediated and filtered advice at \nother points. This gap between the Guard's real world missions and its \ninstitutional position is simply unacceptable. It is not efficient, and \nit is not smart. It violates basic notions of logic, and it hinders our \nability to get the full potential out of the National Guard.\n  Our legislation will take them from the 19th and 20th century \nstructure into the 21st century's reality.\n  Our legislation directly addresses this troubling missions-to-\nauthorities gap in three very specific ways. First, the National \nDefense Enhancement and National Guard Empowerment Act of 2006 would \nelevate the Chief of the National Guard to the rank of General with \nfour-stars, also installing this senior officer on the Joint Chiefs of \nStaff. The Joint Chiefs is the highest military advisory body to the \nPresident and the Secretary of Defense. Without a Guard representative \nat the four-star level, the Secretary and the President receive only \nfiltered advice from the Chiefs of Staff of the Army and the Air Force \nabout National Guard matters.\n  The Army and the Air Force chiefs can provide keen insights about the \nGuard's role as a prime military reserve to the active components. \nHowever, they are not responsible for, and therefore are not experts \non, disaster relief and homeland security functions that the Guard \ncarries out at the State level, often under the command-and-control of \nthe Nation's governors. Placing a National Guard General on the Joint \nChiefs offers the fullest and most sensible guidance to our leaders on \nall aspects of the Guard, and this arrangement would give the Nation's \ngovernors a straight line to the Joint Chiefs and the President on \nmilitary matters.\n  Creating a Guard senior advisor to the Secretary of Defense and the \nPresident streamlines and formalizes an arrangement that already arises \nin real emergencies. During the darkest early days of Katrina, for \nexample, the current National Guard Bureau Chief General Steven Blum \nwas by the side of the Secretary of Defense and the President. A \npermanent Guard presence on the Joint Chiefs ensures that this advisory \nrelationship is in no way last-minute and ad-hoc.\n  The second way that this legislation puts the National Guard's \nauthorities more in line with its real-world missions is by giving the \nforce more budgetary authority. The Act gives the National Guard the \nability to research, develop and procure equipment that is peculiar to \nits unique mission in the realm of homeland security.\n  This authority would be similar to the authority of the Special \nOperations Command, given under the Nunn-Cohen legislation of the mid-\n1980s, to develop unique equipment for the special forces.\n  Last year, Congress appropriated almost $1 billion for the National \nGuard to procure equipment that has application for homeland security. \nThis legislation establishes more formal structure for the Guard to \nrefine such equipment requirements and work in close coordination with \nthe states to ensure an adequate force structure--fully adequate in \ndomestic emergencies--is in place.\n  The final way that this legislation brings realistic authorities to \nthe Guard is by ensuring that the Deputy Commander of Northern Command \nis a three-star general from the National Guard. This Command is \ncharged with planning for the active military's response to federal \nemergencies, as well as coordinating the response with other federal \nagencies and civilian authorities. Any military response in the \ndomestic United States will surely include the National Guard, in many \ncases with the State governor overseeing the effort.\n  Currently, there are few if any senior Guard officers at the highest \nreaches of\n\n[[Page S3597]]\n\nthe Command, and the legislation would ensure expertise on the force \nexists there.\n  There has been a lot of discussion already about this legislation \nafter Senator Bond and I last month expressed our intention to pursue \nit. To clear up any confusion, let me say what this legislation does \nnot do. This legislation does not affect the National Guard's role as \none of the primary military reserves to the Air Force and the Army, \nwhich we believe is beneficial for the country.\n  It also does not inflate the size of National Guard headquarters here \nin Washington. We put a firm cap on the size of the Guard Bureau in \nthis legislation. The legislation further does not create any new \ngeneral office positions beyond the four-star Joint Chiefs position. It \nonly ensures that the adequate seats of representation is in place in \nkey positions; in fact, the legislation actually removes a less \ninfluential Major General officer slot on the Joint Staff.\n  What this bill does do--and with great intensity--is to give the \nNational Guard the institutional muscle commensurate with the Guard's \nmissions. With this bill, we can ask the Guard to do all that it does, \nbut then say that, yes, it can have a seat at the table during key \ndiscussions involving the Guard's missions and readiness. With this \nbill, we can tap into the Guard for situations like the war in Iraq and \nthe response to Hurricane Katrina and tell these proud men and women \nthat we take are committed to taking real steps to keep the size of \nthis force steady and improve its stock of available equipment.\n  With this bill, we can ensure that our senior leaders--the Secretary \nof Defense and the President--are making decisions about the National \nGuard based on the best available information.\n  With this bill, we strengthen the National Guard, the military chain-\nof-command, and the Guard's ability to effectively serve each of the \nStates and the entire Nation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. AKAKA (for himself and Mr. Inouye):\n  S. 2659. A bill to amend title 38, United States Code, to provide for \nthe eligibility of Indian tribal organizations for grants for the \nestablishment of veterans cemeteries on trust lands; to the Committee \non Veterans' Affairs.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce an important \npiece of legislation for our Native American veterans. The Native \nAmerican Veterans Cemetery Act of 2006 would provide tribal \norganizations eligibility for Department of Veterans Affairs grants to \nestablish veterans cemeteries on trust lands. Currently, VA does not \nhave the authority to make such grants.\n  Native American veterans have a long and proud history of military \nservice on behalf of this Nation. Per capita, Native Americans have the \nhighest percentage of people serving in the U.S. Armed Forces. Native \nAmericans have honorably served in every war fought by the United \nStates. After completion of their service, many Native American \nveterans return to their communities on trust lands. Passage of this \nlegislation would provide them the option of veterans cemetery burial \nin a location convenient for their families and loved ones.\n  Throughout my tenure in Congress, I have always fought for the rights \nof our indigenous peoples. The Native American Veterans Cemetery Act \nof2006 is another step forward in helping native peoples. The \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs supports enactment of this legislation \nand estimates it to be budget neutral. It is my hope that the Senate \nwill expeditiously proceed to the consideration of this important bill.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the bill be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2659\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Native American Veterans \n     Cemetery Act of 2006''.\n\n     SEC. 2.

A bill to amend the National Security Act of 1947 to require \nnotice to Congress of certain declassifications of intelligence \ninformation, and for other purposes; to the Select Committee on \nIntelligence.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I introduce today legislation to \nrequire the White House to notify Congress when it declassifies \ninformation. This bill will both enhance Congress's oversight abilities \nand ensure that intelligence is not used for political gain.\n  This legislation recognizes that as the head of the executive branch, \nthe President has the authority to declassify any information he so \nchooses. It does not place any conditions or procedures on that \ndeclassification process, it only requires that the Congress be \nprovided with notice so that it can meet its own constitutional \nresponsibilities.\n  Information is usually declassified because the public's need to know \noutweighs the security risks to intelligence sources and methods. In \nsuch cases, it is important for the Congress to be informed so that \nSenators and Representatives can discuss the issues with the American \npeople.\n  And if the President declassifies information so that his \nsubordinates can discuss intelligence with reporters, Congress should \nbe alerted so that the intelligence committees can ensure that national \nsecrets are not being used for political purposes.\n  According to court filings and media reports, the Vice President's \nchief of staff, I. Lewis Libby, acting on the direction and \nauthorization of the President and Vice President, disclosed \ninformation in the 2002 National Intelligence Estimate on Iraq's \nweapons of mass destruction to select journalists. This was not done to \nprovide the American people with a fuller understanding of the pre-Iraq \nwar intelligence; the Estimate was fully and publicly declassified \nshortly afterwards in a more appropriate manner. Rather, the selective \ndeclassification and leak was intended to stem a tide of bad press and \ndiscredit an administration critic through a subtle campaign of media \nmanipulation.\n  According to the prosecutor in Mr. Libby's case, Libby provided \ninformation on Iraq's purchase of uranium from Niger to New York Times \nreporter Judith Miller. The Niger claim was not a ``key judgment'' of \nthe NIE, meaning that it was not deemed by the intelligence community \nto be a priority. It was included in the body of the report ``for \ncompleteness,'' according to the primary author. At the time, the \nDepartment of State's intelligence office found the Niger uranium claim \nto be ``highly dubious,'' and the intelligence community downplayed the \nNiger connection afterwards:\n  The CIA had deleted a reference to Niger from the President's October \n7, 2002 speech in Cincinnati;\n  Two senior intelligence officials had downplayed the assessment in \ntestimony to the Senate Intelligence Committee;\n  The International Atomic Energy Agency had denounced the claim as \nbeing based on forged documents; and\n  The intelligence community had retracted the intelligence.\n  Let me say that again: the intelligence community had retracted this \npiece of intelligence. None of this additional information, apparently, \nwas provided by Mr. Libby.\n  Had the Senate and House intelligence committees been informed of \nthis declassification, as would be required by this legislation, \nMembers could have corrected the public record.\n\n[[Page S3598]]\n\nI would hope that with this reporting requirement, administrations of \nboth political parties will be deterred from improper use of \nintelligence.\n  In addition to stemming the politicization of intelligence, the bill \nI introduce today also notes the importance of keeping the full \nintelligence community informed of declassifications. If the President \nchooses, for whatever reason, to declassify information, the \nintelligence agency that had been responsible for those secrets has to \ntake steps to protect intelligence sources and methods.\n  Similarly, the National Archives are to be informed upon a \nPresidential declassification so the Nation's records can be \nappropriately maintained. As has been highlighted again today with the \nrelease of the Archives audit over the reclassification of \nintelligence, the Archives play an important role in providing \ndeclassified intelligence to the public. To do so, it must be informed \nwhen information enters the public domain.\n  It should be made clear that there are more traditional procedures by \nwhich individual intelligence agencies declassify information on a \nregular basis, when the release of that information is seen as no \nlonger damaging the national security. This is done thousands of times \na week throughout the intelligence community.\n  It is important that the public have access to as much information on \nits government's activities as possible. To that end, I look forward, \nthrough this legislation and otherwise, to working with my colleagues \nand the executive branch to ensure that declassification is done as \nextensively and as quickly as possible without risking our national \nsecurity.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2660\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. SANTORUM submitted an amendment intended to be proposed \nby him to the bill H.R. 4939, making emergency supplemental \nappropriations for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2006, and for \nother purposes; which was ordered to lie on the table; as follows:\n\n       On page 253, between lines 19 and 20, insert the following:\n\n\n               DEMOCRACY PROGRAMS AND ACTIVITIES IN IRAN\n\n       Sec. 7032. (a) Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The people of the United States have long demonstrated \n     an interest in the well-being of the people of Iran, dating \n     back to the 1830s.\n       (2) Famous Americans such as Howard Baskerville, Dr. Samuel \n     Martin, Jane E. Doolittle, and Louis G. Dreyfus, Jr., made \n     significant contributions to Iranian society by furthering \n     the educational opportunities of the people of Iran and \n     improving the opportunities of the less fortunate citizens of \n     Iran.\n       (3) Iran and the United States were allies following World \n     War II, and through the late 1970s Iran was as an important \n     regional ally of the United States and a key bulwark against \n     Soviet influence.\n       (4) In November 1979, following the arrival of Mohammed \n     Reza Shah Pahlavi in the United States, a mob of students and \n     extremists seized the United States Embassy in Tehran, Iran, \n     holding United States diplomatic personnel hostage until \n     January 1981.\n       (5) Following the seizure of the United States Embassy, \n     Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, leader of the repressive \n     revolutionary movement in Iran, expressed support for the \n     actions of the students in taking American citizens hostage.\n       (6) Despite the presidential election of May 1997, an \n     election in which an estimated 91 percent of the electorate \n     participated, control of the internal and external affairs of \n     the Islamic Republic of Iran is still exercised by the courts \n     in Iran and the Revolutionary Guards, Supreme Leader, and \n     Council of Guardians of the Government of Iran.\n       (7) The election results of the May 1997 election and the \n     high level of voter participation in that election \n     demonstrate that the people of Iran favor economic and \n     political reforms and greater interaction with the United \n     States and the Western world in general.\n       (8) Efforts by the United States to improve relations with \n     Iran have been rebuffed by the Government of Iran.\n       (9) The Clinton Administration eased sanctions against Iran \n     and promoted people-to-people exchanges, but the Leader of \n     the Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the Militant \n     Clerics' Society, the Islamic Coalition Organization, and \n     Supporters of the Party of God have all opposed efforts to \n     open Iranian society to Western influences and have opposed \n     efforts to change the dynamic of relations between the United \n     States and Iran.\n       (10) For the past two decades, the Department of State has \n     found Iran to be the leading sponsor of international \n     terrorism in the world.\n       (11) In 1983, the Iran-sponsored Hezbollah terrorist \n     organization conducted suicide terrorist operations against \n     United States military and civilian personnel in Beirut, \n     Lebanon, resulting in the deaths of hundreds of Americans.\n       (12) The United States intelligence community and law \n     enforcement personnel have linked Iran to attacks against \n     American military personnel at Khobar Towers in Saudi Arabia \n     in 1996 and to al Qaeda attacks against civilians in Saudi \n     Arabia in 2004.\n       (13) According to the Department of State's Patterns of \n     Global Terrorism 2001 report, ``Iran's Islamic Revolutionary \n     Guard Corps and Ministry of Intelligence and Security \n     continued to be involved in the planning and support of \n     terrorist acts and supported a variety of groups that use \n     terrorism to pursue their goals,'' and ``Iran continued to \n     provide Lebanese Hizballah and the Palestinian rejectionist \n     groups--notably HAMAS, the Palestinian Islamic Jihad, and the \n     [Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General \n     Command]--with varying amounts of funding, safehaven, \n     training and weapons''.\n       (14) Iran currently operates more than 10 radio and \n     television stations broadcasting in Iraq that incite violent \n     actions against United States and coalition personnel in \n     Iraq.\n       (15) The current leaders of Iran, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei \n     and Hashemi Rafsanjani, have repeatedly called upon Muslims \n     to kill Americans in Iraq and install a theocratic regime in \n     Iraq.\n       (16) The Government of Iran has admitted pursuing a \n     clandestine nuclear program, which the United States \n     intelligence community believes may include a nuclear weapons \n     program.\n       (17) The Government of Iran has failed to meet repeated \n     pledges to arrest and extradite foreign terrorists in Iran.\n       (18) The United States Government believes that the \n     Government of Iran supports terrorists and extremist \n     religious leaders in Iraq with the clear intention of \n     subverting coalition efforts to bring peace and democracy to \n     Iraq.\n       (19) The Ministry of Defense of Iran confirmed in July 2003 \n     that it had successfully conducted the final test of the \n     Shahab-3 missile, giving Iran an operational intermediate-\n     range ballistic missile capable of striking both Israel and \n     United States troops throughout the Middle East and \n     Afghanistan.\n       (b) Congress declares that it should be the policy of the \n     United States--\n       (1) to support efforts by the people of Iran to exercise \n     self-determination over the form of government of their \n     country; and\n       (2) to actively support a national referendum in Iran with \n     oversight by international observers and monitors to certify \n     the integrity and fairness of the referendum.\n       (c)(1) The President is authorized, notwithstanding any \n     other provision of law, to provide financial and political \n     assistance (including the award of grants) to foreign and \n     domestic individuals, organizations, and entities that \n     support democracy and the promotion of democracy in Iran. \n     Such assistance includes funding for--\n       (A) the Broadcasting Board of Governors for efforts to \n     cultivate and support independent broadcasters that broadcast \n     into Iran;\n       (B) cultural and student exchanges;\n       (C) the promotion of human rights and civil society \n     activities in Iran; and\n       (D) assistance to student organizations, labor unions, and \n     trade associations in Iran.\n       (2) It is the sense of Congress that financial and \n     political assistance under this section be provided to an \n     individual, organization, or entity that--\n       (A) opposes the use of terrorism;\n       (B) advocates the adherence by Iran to nonproliferation \n     regimes for nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons and \n     materiel;\n       (C) is dedicated to democratic values and supports the \n     adoption of a democratic form of government in Iran;\n       (D) is dedicated to respect for human rights, including the \n     fundamental equality of women;\n       (E) works to establish equality of opportunity for people; \n     and\n       (F) supports freedom of the press, freedom of speech, \n     freedom of association, and freedom of religion.\n       (3) The President may provide assistance under this \n     subsection using amounts made available pursuant to the \n     authorization of appropriations under paragraph (7).\n\n[[Page S3619]]\n\n       (4) Not later than 15 days before each obligation of \n     assistance under this subsection, and in accordance with the \n     procedures under section 634A of the Foreign Assistance Act \n     of 1961 (22 U.S.C. 2394-l), the President shall notify the \n     Committee on Foreign Relations and the Committee on \n     Appropriations of the Senate and the Committee on \n     International Relations and the Committee on Appropriations \n     of the House of Representatives.\n       (5) It is the sense of Congress that in order to ensure \n     maximum coordination among Federal agencies, if the President \n     provides the assistance under this section, the President \n     should appoint an individual who shall--\n       (A) serve as special assistant to the President on matters \n     relating to Iran; and\n       (B) coordinate among the appropriate directors of the \n     National Security Council on issues regarding such matters.\n       (6) It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (A) support for a transition to democracy in Iran should be \n     expressed by United States representatives and officials in \n     all appropriate international fora;\n       (B) representatives of the Government of Iran should be \n     denied access to all United States Government buildings;\n       (C) efforts to bring a halt to the nuclear weapons program \n     of Iran, including steps to end the supply of nuclear \n     components or fuel to Iran, should be intensified, with \n     particular attention focused on the cooperation regarding \n     such program--\n       (i) between the Government of Iran and the Government of \n     the Russian Federation;

The Accords, however, \n     precluded the 52 American hostages or their families from \n     bringing suit against Iran for their seizure, detention, \n     torture, and injuries;\n       (3) on December 29, 2000, the 52 American hostages and \n     their spouses and children filed suit in the United States \n     District Court for the District of Columbia, pursuant to the \n     Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (Public \n     Law 104-132);\n       (4) on August 6, 2001, the District Court entered a default \n     judgment against Iran after certifying the case as a class \n     action;\n       (5) the United States Department of State intervened in the \n     case of the former American hostages and their families, and \n     successfully moved to vacate the decision against Iran by \n     invoking the Algiers Accords;\n       (6) the former American Hostages and their families have \n     been denied the rights given every other American citizen to \n     prosecute their claims against a state sponsor of terrorism \n     pursuant to the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act \n     of 1996; and\n       (7) a common fund should be established to recognize these \n     American heroes.\n       (b) Common Fund for Hostages.--\n       (1) In general.--Not later than 90 days after the date of \n     the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of the Treasury, in \n     consultation with the Secretary of State, shall commence \n     payments to a common fund to be established and administered \n     by the certified class representatives for the former \n     American hostages in Iran and their survivors (as identified \n     in case number 1:00CV03110 (EGS) of the United States \n     District Court for the District of Columbia).\n       (2) Administration.--The common fund shall--\n       (A) be administered to pay claims to the Americans held \n     hostage in Iran and to members of their families, and the \n     estates of those hostages and family members who have since \n     died, who were identified as class members in case number \n     1:00CV03110 (EGS) of the United States District Court for the \n     District of Columbia; and\n       (B) be administered for the purpose of satisfying such \n     claims, as approved by the certified class representatives \n     identified in that case number.\n       (c) Funding.--Payments to the common fund under subsection \n     (b) shall be derived from the liquidation of blocked assets \n     (as defined in section 201(d)(2) of the Terrorism Risk \n     Insurance Act of 2002 (Public Law 107-297; 28 U.S.C. 1610 \n     note) with respect to Iran, and from amounts in the Iran \n     Foreign Military Sales Fund account within the Foreign \n     Military Sales Fund. The Secretary of the Treasury may use \n     the interest in the Iran Foreign Military Sales Fund account, \n     the principal in the account, or liquidate assets for \n     purposes of this subsection.\n       (d) Amount.--The Secretary of the Treasury shall make \n     payments into the fund in amounts equal to--\n       (1) for each former hostage identified as a class member \n     under subsection (b)(1), $1,000 for each day of captivity;\n       (2) for each spouse and child identified as a class member \n     under subsection (b)(1), $500 for each day of captivity of \n     the former hostages; and\n       (3) interest on each amount under paragraph (1) and (2), \n     calculated at the historical daily prime rate, as published \n     by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, for \n     the period from the date of the release of the hostages until \n     the date of payment under this section.\n       (e) Taxes.--Payments to the former American hostages and \n     their family members pursuant to this section shall be exempt \n     from Federal taxes.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 3650.

Congress makes the following findings:\n\n[[Page S3622]]\n\n       (1) Not all the wounds caused by war are physical.\n       (2) In July of 2004, the New England Journal of Medicine \n     reported that one of every six combat veterans in Iraq and \n     Afghanistan showed symptoms of major depression, anxiety, or \n     post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).\n       (3) A more recent study in the Journal of the American \n     Medical Association found that 19.1 percent of returning \n     veterans from Iraq, and 11.3 percent of veterans returning \n     from Afghanistan, reported mental health problems.\n       (4) Historic experience reveals that soldiers will return \n     from war having to cope with a range of emotional issues, \n     regardless of whether or not they are diagnosed with post-\n     traumatic stress disorder.\n       (5) Care for veterans is an ongoing cost of war.\n       (6) The New Hampshire National Guard pioneered a new \n     approach to meeting the mental health and readjustment needs \n     of its soldiers.\n       (7) The New Hampshire model stipulates that as part of a \n     comprehensive return and readjustment program, members of the \n     National Guard receive individual counseling with counselors \n     from Vet Centers who specialize in treating war trauma and \n     related readjustment issues.\n       (8) The counseling is both mandatory and confidential, \n     destroying any stigma associated with seeking help for \n     emotional mental health problems.\n       (9) Of the first 810 soldiers to pass through the screening \n     process, nearly 200 have received counseling.\n       (10) Counselors at Vet Centers are highly trained in \n     readjustment counseling. Sixty percent of the counselors in \n     Vets Centers are veterans themselves, 40 percent are combat \n     veterans, and all are very experienced with helping veterans \n     and their families deal with the challenges of readjustment.\n       (11) The greatest obstacle to the adoption of the New \n     Hampshire program nationwide is the lack of resources \n     available to Vet Centers.\n       (12) In fiscal year 2004, Vet Centers served 125,859 \n     veterans in more than 1,000,000 visits.\n       (13) Even without the war in Iraq, Vet Centers were already \n     overloaded with cases.\n       (14) In fiscal year 2005, Vet Centers were expected to \n     provide services to nearly 14,000 veterans of Iraq and \n     Afghanistan in almost 44,000 office visits, and more than \n     3,800 of these veterans had post-traumatic stress disorder.\n       (15) As of the end of February 2006, Vet Centers provided \n     services to 70,547 veterans of operations in Iraq and \n     Afghanistan in 2006.\n\n\n                            medical services\n\n       For an additional amount for ``Medical Services'', \n     $100,000,000, for the Readjustment Counseling Services of the \n     Department of Veterans Affairs to expand transition programs, \n     increase screening for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), \n     and expand resources available for treatment of post-\n     traumatic stress disorder: Provided, That the amount provided \n     under this heading is designated as an emergency requirement \n     pursuant to section 402 of H. Con. Res. 95 (109th Congress), \n     the concurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal year 2006.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 3655.

Mr. President, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oregon [Mr. Wyden] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 3665.\n\n   (Purpose: To prohibit the use of funds to provide royalty relief)\n\n       On page 253, between lines 19 and 20, insert the following:\n\n\n      PROHIBITION OF FUNDS FOR OIL AND NATURAL GAS ROYALTY RELIEF\n\n       Sec. 7032. (a) No funds made available under this Act or \n     any other Act for any fiscal year for royalty and offshore \n     minerals management may be used by the Secretary of the \n     Interior to provide relief from a requirement to pay a \n     royalty for the production of oil or natural gas from Federal \n     land during any period in which--\n\n[[Page S3633]]\n\n       (1) for the production of oil, the average price of crude \n     oil in the United States is greater than $55 a barrel; and\n       (2) for the production of natural gas, the average price of \n     natural gas in the United States is $10 per 1,000 cubic feet \n     of natural gas.\n       (b) In administering funds made available for royalty or \n     offshore minerals management, the Secretary of the Interior \n     may waive or specify alternative requirements if the \n     Secretary of the Interior determines that royalty relief is \n     necessary to avoid oil or natural gas supply disruptions as a \n     consequence of hurricanes or other natural disasters.\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, the oil companies are supposed to pay \nroyalties to the Federal Government when they extract oil from Federal \nlands. Now, in order to stimulate production of oil in our country, the \nFederal Government over the last decade has been discounting these \nroyalty fees. These discounts now amount to billions of dollars. It \nappears that the royalty relief that is given to the oil companies is \nnow the granddaddy of all of the subsidies.\n  We have been talking considerably on the floor of this body over the \nlast few days about tax breaks for oil companies. The President, it \nseems to me, to his credit, over the last few days has indicated that \nhe understands that these tax breaks are no longer needed. I was very \npleased to see that because when the energy executives came to the \ncommittee, I literally went down the row and asked them if they \ncontinued to need all of these tax breaks. They don't, but Congress has \ncontinued to ladle them out. But on top of these record profits, record \nprices, and record tax breaks, there is now record amounts of royalty \nrelief granted to the oil companies as well.\n  Now that the prices have shot up, I don't see how anybody can justify \nthis multibillion-dollar subsidy. The point of this amendment is to say \nthat we are going to get rid of these special oil company discounts, \nthe special breaks that amount to billions of dollars, unless the price \nof oil comes down, or unless the Bush administration indicates that \nroyalty relief is necessary to avoid supply disruption.\n  Mr. President, it is astounding that there is a tremendous chorus now \nof support, saying that royalty relief is needed. Yet nobody seems to \nbe doing anything concrete to roll back these unnecessary subsidies.\n  For example, to show the bipartisan interest in this, not long ago, a \ndistinguished member of the other body who chairs the resources \ncommittee, Richard Pombo, said in a newspaper interview that there is \nno need for this particular incentive. That is not the head of some \nconsumer group; that is the distinguished chairman of the resources \ncommittee, Mr. Pombo, from California. He has said there is no need for \nthis kind of royalty relief. Mr. Michael Coney, a lawyer for the Shell \nOil Company, said the same thing. He basically said that in this kind \nof climate you cannot make a case for this particular kind of \nmultibillion-dollar subsidy.\n  The architect of the program, our former colleague, Senator Bennett \nJohnston, has said that what has taken place with respect to the \nroyalty relief program isn't anything close to what he had in mind when \nhe developed this program.\n  So what you have is a Democratic Member of the Senate saying let's \nroll back these subsidies unless the Bush administration certifies they \nare needed to avoid disruption or unless the price goes down, and let's \ndo it because there is a bipartisan consensus that this Royalty Relief \nProgram is completely out of whack.\n  By the way, Mr. President, I know you have had great interest in the \neffort to target these subsidies. You and I have talked about it on a \nnumber of occasions. Consistently what we find is the way these \nmultibillion-dollar subsidies find their way on to our tax rolls and \nGovernment programs is on a bipartisan basis somebody messes up. \nSomebody isn't watchdogging the way these dollars fly out the door, and \nthat was certainly the case with the Clinton administration.\n  Previously, there had been a particular provision in the Royalty \nRelief Program that said when the oil prices shot up, when they went \nabove a certain level--then it was considered about $34 a barrel--the \ncompanies would have to, once again, start paying these royalties. But \nthe Clinton administration just wasn't watching the store, wasn't \nwatchdogging this program as they should have, and so they didn't put \nthat particular clause--the clause that protects the taxpayers--into a \nnumber of these royalty relief agreements. What has happened is we just \nhad a litigation derby with scores and scores of lawsuits.\n  Now the General Accountability Office estimates that at a minimum, \nthe Federal Government is going to be out $20 billion. This is the \nbiggest subsidy of them all, and given all of the litigation that has \ntaken place, this subsidy could go up and up.\n  Under the Energy bill signed into law last summer, the oil companies \nwere given new subsidies in the form of reduced royalty fees for the \noil and gas they extract from Federal land, including offshore drilling \nin the Gulf of Mexico. This particular new subsidy was signed into law \nwhen the companies were already reporting these extraordinary profits. \nWe were already seeing the consumer taking a shellacking at the gas \npump. It would have been the ideal time for the U.S. Congress to do \nwhat colleagues such as Congressman Pombo in the other body are talking \nabout, lawyers for the Shell Oil companies tell the newspapers, what I \nand others and a bipartisan group who have been interested in this have \nsaid for a long time: It doesn't pass the smell test to be dispensing \nbillions and billions of dollars of royalty relief to the oil companies \non top of everything else they already receive from the taxpayers' \nwallet. So what I hope we will be able to do here is roll back this new \nsubsidy.\n  By the way, the program was useful back when prices were low. For \nexample, it significantly helped in the Gulf of Mexico at a time when \nprices were low. That is not the case now. As our colleague in the \nother body, Mr. Pombo, notes, they sure don't need any incentives when \nthe marketplace is providing all the incentives anybody could possibly \nask for.\n  Government subsidies, sure, when the price is low, when we have to \nstimulate production, when our economy needs a shot in the arm. But \nbillions of dollars of royalty relief for oil companies in this kind of \ntime? I don't get it, and tomorrow I hope a majority of the Senate will \nshare my view and will share the view of other colleagues who have \ntaken a good look at this particular program.\n  It seems to me this is a time when the Congress ought to say: Let's \nlook carefully at all of these various subsidies and breaks. As the \ndistinguished Senator from Oklahoma has said, let's shine some light on \nit, let's take a sharp pencil out and really make some concrete \njudgments about what is in the taxpayers' interest.\n  At a time when consumers are already paying more at work, they are \npaying more at home, they are paying more when they drive everywhere in \nbetween, we ought to be giving them a break in their personal energy \nbills before we give breaks to the oil companies on the amounts they \nowe for drilling on our Nation's lands.\n  With oil selling for more than $70 a barrel, $15 a barrel higher than \nthe price that the President said incentives were not needed, Congress \nshould not be giving away more taxpayer money for more unnecessary \nsubsidies that benefit profitable energy interests.\n  Let me highlight that particular point and explain why it is so \npivotal in this discussion for royalty relief for oil companies.\n  The President of the United States said that he doesn't see the case \nfor additional incentives and Government benefits to encourage \nproduction when oil is over $55 a barrel. Now we are talking about oil \nat $70 a barrel. We are talking about billions of dollars of new \npayments to the companies at a time when the General Accountability \nOffice says the minimum tab will be $20 billion. And all I am saying to \nthe Senate tonight is I want to cut off those payments unless one of \ntwo things happens: If the price of oil comes down, you bet, let's go \nback and say we need some incentives for production. If the President \nof the United States, the Secretary of the Interior, the people who are \nin the administration who know a lot about the oil business say that we \nhave to have these multibillion-dollar discounts in order to encourage \nproduction, my amendment doesn't apply.\n\n[[Page S3634]]\n\n  In effect, the President of the United States can say we have to have \nthe Royalty Relief Program in order to get the oil industry moving \nagain in our country. But with prices high and no argument for these \nbreaks, not on the basis of my judgment but on the basis of what the \nPresident has said in the past, I want to cut off these particular \nbreaks.\n  I hope my colleagues will want to save our taxpayers money and \npromote fiscal responsibility. This is a program which is completely \nout of control. This is a program which has lost its moorings. You \ncannot defend this, in my view, in front of any group of our citizens. \nThat is why a variety of leaders and individuals in the private sector, \nmany of them coming from the oil industry itself, have said there is no \nlogical argument for royalty relief at this particular time.\n  Certainly there are going to be some who will say it is never enough. \nThere is litigation going on now where some companies are in court \ntrying to secure additional information. I am looking at a recent \narticle in the press authored by Edmund L. Andrews headlined: ``General \nAccounting Office Sees Loss in Oil Royalties of at Least $20 Billion.''\n  We know that the Government Accountability Office isn't an \norganization with any ax to grind. They are our nonpartisan \ninvestigators. Those are the people who take out the sharp pencil and \nare given the job of actually looking to see if taxpayer money is being \nused wisely. They have essentially said recently--this year, just \nmonths ago--that billions of dollars are going to be wasted with this \nRoyalty Relief Program.\n  The Interior Department has indicated that they know they are going \nto lose billions of dollars in royalty payments. I don't see anybody \nsaying that the price of oil is going to fall precipitously anytime \nsoon. If it does, the President and the Department of Energy can \nessentially waive my amendment. We explicitly say that if the price of \noil goes down, if there are any national security questions, any \ndisruptions that threaten supply, the amendment can be set aside.\n  It is time to rein in these costs that are going through the \nstratosphere. The Royalty Relief Program is the granddaddy of all \nsubsidies. I hope tomorrow, when the Senate has an opportunity to vote, \nwe will say that we ought to prohibit further royalty relief, unless \nprices go down or we face a disruption, and save our citizens' hard-\nearned tax dollars for more worthy causes.\n  Mr. President, I hope my colleagues will support this amendment.\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coburn). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I am going to propound a unanimous consent \nrequest for wrap-up momentarily. I will also note, as I have been \nspeaking on this amendment to forego some royalty relief for oil \ncompanies, that when we go back in at approximately 10 o'clock, I will \ncontinue a discussion regarding this amendment and hopefully have a \nchance to hear from colleagues on both sides of the aisle.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/04/26/senate-section/article/S3634-1", "month": "04", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3634]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            ORDER FOR FILING\n\n  Mr. WYDEN.
