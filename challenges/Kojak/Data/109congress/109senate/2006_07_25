Mr. President, this morning we will return to executive \nsession for the consideration of the nomination of Jerome Holmes to be \nU.S. circuit judge for the Tenth Circuit. There are 2 hours remaining \nfor debate on this judicial nomination, and therefore, if all that time \nis necessary, we will vote just before 12 noon today. We will be \nrecessing from 12:30 to 2:15 today to allow for our weekly policy \nmeetings. When we resume business at 2:15, we will begin consideration \nof the child custody protection bill under an agreement that we reached \nlast Friday. There are up to four amendments that can be considered \nbefore we proceed to passage of that bill. We will stay in session this \nafternoon and evening in order to finish the child custody protection \nbill, and I hope some of that debate time will be yielded so we can \nfinish that bill at an earlier hour.\n  I remind everyone again that there will be a cloture vote on the \nmotion to proceed to the consideration of the Gulf of Mexico Energy \nSecurity Act tomorrow morning. That vote will occur sometime around 10 \na.m. so that we can conclude that vote before we go to the scheduled \njoint meeting. We will proceed to the House of Representatives in order \nto hear the 11 a.m. address by Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki of Iraq.\n  The vote will be sometime around 10 a.m. tomorrow, and a little after \nthat we will convene here in preparation for going to the House of \nRepresentatives.\n  We have had a very productive few weeks since the Fourth of July, \naddressing the issues surrounding the alternative stem cell technology \nbill, the fetal farming prohibition bill, the child protection bill, \nHomeland Security appropriations, the Voting Rights Act \nreauthorization, the Water Resources Development Act, and confirmed \nfour judges.\n  We have made great progress over the last few weeks, but we have a \nlot to do--most immediately the Child Custody Protection Act--today, \nand then we will move to the deep sea energy exploration issue. \nPensions is currently on the way to conference, and I am very hopeful \nthat the conference will be completed at some point in the near future. \nAnd we need to address the DOD appropriations bill. So these are very \nbusy times.\n  The House of Representatives will be going out this week, and we will \nbe here through next week before the recess.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/07/25/senate-section/article/S8137-7", "month": "07", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8137-S8151]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n NOMINATION OF JEROME A.

Under the previous order, the \nSenate will proceed to executive session to resume consideration of \nCalendar No. 764, which the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read the nomination of Jerome A. Holmes, of \nOklahoma, to be United States Circuit Judge for the Tenth Circuit.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. There will be 2 hours of debate \nequally divided between the Senator from Pennsylvania, Mr. Specter, and\n\n[[Page S8138]]\n\nthe Senator from Vermont, Mr. Leahy, or their designees.\n  The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, before the Senate this moment is the \nnomination of Mr. Holmes to be a judge in the Federal court system. I \nsee the Senator from Oklahoma is here. I am sure he will speak to this \nnomination. I am not going to address the nomination but put a \nstatement in the Record relative to my vote, which will be in \nopposition to Mr. Holmes.\n  I have reviewed his record, as many members of the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee have, and there are many positive things to be said, as the \nSenator from Oklahoma has mentioned in our committee deliberations. I \nam concerned, though, about some of the statements that have been made \nby Mr. Holmes in relation to his nomination on the issue of affirmative \naction. I am concerned about whether he will truly come to this \nimportant lifetime appointment with the type of objectivity and open \nmind that we hope for when we give people this opportunity to serve \ntheir Nation.\n  I am also concerned that the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights \nyesterday made it clear that they oppose his nomination. It is an \nimportant factor, in my judgment, in my decision, and I am sorry that I \nwill not be able to support this nomination as a result of that.\n  I also want to make it clear that the job of a Federal judge is a \nvery important one. It relates to issues that affect us every single \nday. Just last week we had an extensive debate on the floor of the \nSenate about stem cell research--those issues relative to life and \ndeath in medical research that come before the courts. Judges have to \nmake decisions. I have no idea what Mr. Holmes's position is on this \nissue. I don't know what statements he has made relative to it. What I \nam about to say does not reflect on him at all.\n  But I do want to say I am very concerned about what I read in this \nmorning's newspaper about stem cell research. We know what happened \nlast week. President Bush used his first Presidential veto to stop \nmedical research--the first time in the history of the United States \nthat a President has made a decision that we will stop Federal funding \nof medical research. He made that decision 5 years ago and said that no \nFederal funds would go to the use of these embryonic stem cells.\n  We know how these stem cells are created. They are created in a \nperfectly legal medical process where a man and a woman having \ndifficulty in conceiving a child expend great sums of money, effort, \nand anguish to try to create this new baby in a petri dish, a glass \ndish, in vitro in glass. It is the fertilization process in the \nlaboratory that usually takes place between a man and a woman in their \nmarried life. It is a miracle that it works, that this process leads to \nhuman life and people who have been praying for a baby finally have \nthat moment when they are told, yes, it worked, in vitro fertilization \nworked, and you are going to have that baby you dreamed of and love the \nrest of your life.\n  But in the process, there are created other embryos which are not \nused. One is used to impregnate the woman. The others are left open, \nextra, surplus. What happens to them? They can be preserved at extreme \ncold temperatures for long periods of time. But, ultimately, if they \nare never used by the couple, they are thrown away. They are discarded.\n  The question we had before us was, Is it better to take those \nembryonic stem cells that would be cast away and discarded and use them \nfor medical research to find cures for diabetes, Parkinson's, \nAlzheimer's and Lou Gehrig's Disease? Is it better to use them for that \npurpose?\n  That was the vote. And it was a bipartisan vote, 44 Democrats and 19 \nRepublican Senators. Sixty-three voted in favor of stem cell research, \nreflecting America's feelings. Seventy percent of American people say \nwe should go forward with this research; that these embryonic stem \ncells that will be thrown away, it is far better to use them to find \ncures to relieve human suffering.\n\n  That is what most Americans believe. That is what a bipartisan \nmajority of the Senate believed. The magic number in the Senate is not \n63 when it comes to this issue. The important number is 67. Why? That \nis the number of Senators it would take to override a Presidential \nveto, a veto of the stem cell research bill. We fell four votes short.\n  It became an operative issue when the President of the United States \ndecided to use his first Presidential veto to stop this medical \nresearch.\n  On Saturday, I went back to Chicago. I met with a group of people. I \nwish the President could have been there. I wish he could have been \nstanding with me out there in Federal Plaza by the Federal Building. I \nwish he could have walked over to the wheelchair of Danny Pedroza, who \nis suffering from a terrible neurological anomaly which has created a \nburden I can hardly describe on his parents to keep him alive. I wish \nthe President could have heard his mother say: Every morning when I \nwalk into his bedroom, before I approach him, I look to see if he is \nbreathing. That is the struggle which she will face every single day. \nAll she wants the President to consider is the fact that this research \nmay give her little boy or other little boys and girls who face that a \nchance.\n  I wish the President could have been there to see the victims of \nParkinson's, slightly embarrassed by the tremors which come, and stand \nbefore the microphones and talk about their lives today.\n  I wish he could have been there to meet the mother of this beautiful \nlittle girl who suffers from juvenile diabetes. Her mother--I know her \nwell by now, and I will not use her name on the Senate floor; I have \nused it before--gets up every night twice in the middle of the night to \ngo over and take a blood sample from her daughter to make sure there is \nno imbalance. Every night, twice a night. Think about that for a \nmoment.\n  I wish the President could have been there to see the Lou Gehrig's \ndisease victim that I saw at a round-table meeting in Chicago a few \nmonths ago. He looked like a picture of health and strength. Here was a \nman who was sitting in a wheelchair, immobile. He couldn't move any of \nhis limbs. He couldn't speak. His wife spoke for him and talked about \nhow stem cell research was their last prayer; that maybe, just maybe, \nit could help him but certainly help others. As she spoke, he sat in \nthe wheelchair with tears coming down his cheeks.\n  You think to yourself: Mr. President, these are real life stories. \nThese are people who get up every single day and night in their battle. \nThese are mothers and fathers whose lives have changed dramatically and \nwill never be the same because of their love for their child or that \nhusband or that wife. These are people who counted on you to sign this \nbill, to give them a chance.\n  What do we learn this morning? We learn that there was a little \napology from the White House about the language that was used about the \nstem cell veto. I would like to read some of this into the Record \nbecause I think it really reflects on what we were considering on the \nfloor of the Senate last week.\n  This article in this morning's Washington Post says:\n\n       President Bush does not consider stem cell research using \n     human embryos to be murder, the White House said yesterday. \n     Reversing its description of its position just days after he \n     vetoed legislation to lift Federal funding restrictions on \n     the hotly disputed area of study, White House Press Secretary \n     Tony Snow said yesterday that he ``overstated the President's \n     position.''\n\n  It went on to say the President rejected the stem cell research bill \n``because he does have objections with spending Federal money on \nsomething that is morally objectionable to many Americans.''\n  So the standard now is not that the President vetoed the bill because \nusing these embryonic stem cells is somehow taking human life or \nmurder. No. The standard is, according to Mr. Snow speaking for the \nPresident, that this is an issue that is ``morally objectionable to \nmany Americans.''\n  We know that 70 percent of Americans support stem cell research. We \nknow that on any given issue, whether it is the war in Iraq, or \nvirtually any expenditure of Federal funds on a controversial issue, \nthere will be many Americans who object to it and oppose it. The \nPresident is now saying he is not going to the heart of the issue as to \nwhether this process is immoral; rather, he is saying it was \npolitically unpopular and objectionable to many Americans.\n\n[[Page S8139]]\n\n  It wasn't objectionable to the families of the victims I met with on \nSaturday. What was objectionable was the President's veto. What was \nobjectionable is the fact that he would turn his back on this \nopportunity for medical research.\n  When the President vetoed this bill, he had with him what are known \nas snowflake babies. I met some of them, the most beautiful kids you \ncan imagine. These so-called snowflake babies are beautiful little \nchildren. They were outside in the lobby. These were children who were \nonce these frozen embryos we talked about, and now are babies, smiling, \ngurgling, jumping up and down. The President had many of them with him \nat his veto of the stem cell research bill.\n  I think the total number of these babies in America is about 200. It \nis an amazing act of love and courage for these families who want a \nbaby so badly they will go to the expense of this process. I am sure \nthese children will be loved the rest of their lives. They are lucky \nkids. We are lucky to have them on this Earth. There are 400,000 frozen \nembryos. It is not likely there will be so many families coming forward \nto adopt or to create the life through a frozen embryo.\n  The answer to the President is this: There is room for both. We can \nuse embryos to create life for the couple who comes to the laboratory, \nfor those who want to adopt the embryo. There is ample opportunity for \nthat. But there is also an opportunity to use these embryonic stem \ncells to save lives and to spare people from suffering. That is the \npoint the President missed. That is what this election is all about.\n  Last week, the House and the Senate voted on embryonic stem cell \nresearch. The next vote on the issue will be on November 7. That is \nwhen the American people will vote on stem cell research. That is when \nthey will have a chance to decide whether they want different \nleadership in this Congress. That is when they will have a chance to \ndecide whether they want to give the Senate the four more votes we need \nto override President Bush's veto. That is when they have to decide \nwhether we can bring this issue up after the 1st of next year, pass it \nin the House and Senate and, if the President persists in his veto \nposition, override that veto in the House and the Senate.\n  That is what elections are all about. That is what this Government is \nabout. That is why it is important, for those who follow the stem cell \nresearch debate, to understand it is not over. It has just begun. We \nwill continue the battle to fight for stem cell research. We will do it \non a bipartisan basis. We will try to find the Senators on both sides \nof the aisle who support it. We beg those across America who think it \nis important to move forward on stem cell research to understand now it \nis in their hands. On November 7, across America, in congressional \nelections for the House and the Senate, voters have a chance to ask the \ncandidates: Where do you stand on this? How will you vote? Will you \nvote to override another veto by President Bush if it is forthcoming? \nThat is what the process is all about.\n  Today we debate a Federal judge. As I said, my remarks are not meant \nto reflect on him personally at all because I don't know his position \non this issue nor would I even presume it at this moment in time. But \nit is to put into context the decisions we make in the Senate, not just \non judges but on issues that affect real lives in America. Sadly, this \nSenate has been derailed and diverted from the important issues people \ncare about. Do you know what issue we are going to next? After this \njudicial nominee, we are going to be embroiled, at least for hours--and \nI hope that is all we take of the time of the Senate on an issue that \nis so peripheral it has never ever been raised to me by anyone in the \nState of Illinois--on a question about people who would transport their \nchildren or young people across a State line for an abortion situation, \na tragic decision to be made, for sure, but we are going to take up the \ntime of the Senate to deal with that when, in fact, there is no \ncontroversy or issue that has been brought to my attention by anyone in \nmy State about this matter.\n  What else could we be doing in the Senate? How about something on \ngasoline prices for Americans who are now facing $3 a gallon, gasoline \nthat might go to $4 a gallon if we are not careful? How about a \nnational energy policy? Wouldn't that be a good debate in the Senate? \nWouldn't it be worth our time to spend a few moments changing the Tax \nCode to help ordinary families pay for college education expenses for \ntheir kids? Think about students making it into good schools and \ngraduating with a mountain of debt. Wouldn't it be interesting if the \nSenate found time to debate ways to help those families with tax \ndeductions? Wouldn't that be time well spent? Or perhaps a little time \ntalking about health insurance? Forty-six million Americans have no \nhealth insurance and this Senate does not want to take up an issue to \noffer American businesses the same kind of health insurance that is \navailable for Members of Congress. Why aren't we considering that? \nShouldn't we be considering the minimum wage across America? It has \nbeen 9 years since we have increased the minimum wage--it is $5.15 an \nhour--and during that same period of time, Members of Congress have \nvoted themselves an increase in salaries of $31,000. For 9 years we \nhave said to the hardest working, lowest paid Americans, you get no pay \nraise. That has been our position. Shouldn't we change it? Shouldn't we \ntake the position the Democrats have taken, if we can't raise the \nminimum wage, we are not going to increase congressional pay, period? \nShouldn't we also be considering legislation that deals with some of \nthe serious problems facing people with pensions across America who \nwork for a lifetime with the promise that they will be taken care of, \nyet when they finally reach their golden years they find out that \nthrough some corporate sleight of hand or a merger or bankruptcy, they \nare left holding the bag? Why don't we do something to help those \nfamilies? Or change the Tax Code that rewards companies that send jobs \noverseas? Why would we reward an American company with a tax break for \nexporting jobs? Why don't we consider any of those issues I have just \nlisted as a priority?\n\n  No, what we are doing is dwelling on this debate relative to those \nextreme narrow issues that appeal to the base of the Republican Party \nvote. We went through Constitutional Amendment Month--that was June--\nwhere we said we are going to address a major problem across America, \nthat is flag burning, but it turns out there have only been a handful \nof instances in America in the last year. Has anyone even reported to \nhave burned a flag in this country? And we decided we are going to \nchange the Bill of Rights because of our concern over this major, \ndominant issue?\n  Then, of course, the issue of gay marriage, a divisive issue. To \nthink we want to amend the Constitution--thank goodness they could not \neven rally a majority of 100 Senators to vote for that constitutional \namendment which was clearly a political experiment, a political project \nby the Republican side.\n  We cannot seem to find the time to get to the real issues of an \nenergy policy, a health care policy, doing something about paying for \ncollege expenses for families. We cannot find the time for that. No, we \nhave to go after these divisive issues relative to abortion and other \nmatters such as that. That is the agenda and those are the priorities \nof the Republican leadership in the Senate.\n  It is the reason why an overwhelming majority of Americans have said, \nit is time for a change in Washington. They have taken a look at this \nRepublican Congress and they say it is time for a significant change, \nto move us back toward an agenda that truly will make a difference and \nmove this country in a new direction.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I don't know quite where to begin. If you \nare sitting out in America today and you heard what you just heard, \nwhat you heard was, I am going to point out how bad you are. Here is \nwhat is wrong, here is the choice. What you heard was\n\n[[Page S8140]]\n\na partisan rant about the situation we find ourselves in today rather \nthan a constructive hand that says, let's work together to get things \ndone.\n  We heard a debate about stem cells so it could be used politically. \nWe heard a lot of words that were interchanged, stem cells versus \nembryonic stem cells. We heard words that President Bush does not care \nabout people with illnesses, Republicans do not care about people with \nillnesses. We heard words that 70 percent of Americans support stem \ncell research. The fact is when you as Americans are asked, do you \nthink your taxpayer dollars ought to be used to destroy embryos for \nembryonic research, that number changes to 38 percent.\n  Half truths are just that. The time we are supposed to be using is on \nthe nomination of a great American by the name of Jerome Holmes. What \nwe saw is, Members are going to vote against him because they have a \nlitmus test. That is what is going to drive our country farther apart \nrather than bring us together. If you don't match up and you don't pass \nthe litmus test, then you can't be voted for.\n  The problem is, that works both ways. If the Senate is going to \nchange its approach to judicial nominees, and you have to match either \na liberal or conservative dogma, what will happen to our courts? What \nwill happen to our country?\n  The fact is Jerome Holmes is a man of absolute character, impeccable \ncredentials, and has integrity that nobody questions. Except by a \nsleight of hand and backhanded inference that he doesn't care about \nminorities, even though he is African American, he does not care about \nminorities because he happens to have published a difference of opinion \non the legal basis for affirmative action, that is the litmus test. \nThat is why he is not going to be voted on.\n  Here is a man who grew up in less than ideal circumstances, graduated \ncum laude, went to Georgetown University, has advanced degrees from \nHarvard, has been a prosecutor, has been a defender, has been an \nadvocate for those who are less fortunate, and will be the first \nAfrican American ever to be on the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals.\n  Yet as we heard, he measures up in everything except one thing: He \ndoesn't buy into what some want him to buy into on one issue. Who \nbetter to question his own opinion--not his legal opinion but his own \npersonal opinion? Is it the fact that you can't have a personal opinion \nabout anything and become a judge in this country? How would we know \nanything about them?\n  It takes great courage for an African American, a lawyer, to say, I \nthink there are some things that are wrong with the affirmative action \nplan.\n  He did not say: I don't think we should have equality. He did not \nsay: I don't think we should make up for past deeds that have not been \nrectified. What he said was: Here is what the Supreme Court did. I \nthink they should have gone a little further. And on that basis alone \nhe does not meet the absolute litmus test that is going to be required.\n  Well, think what happens if every judge who is conservative has to be \npro-life. Do they have to be pro-life? No. We have to get away from \nthis idea that you have to fit a certain mold politically before you \ncan be a judge in this country. And, if we do not, we are going to \ndestroy this country.\n  What we want is people of integrity who understand the limited role \nof a judge; and that is not to put your personal opinions in but to, in \nfact, take the Constitution, take the statutes, and take the treaties, \nfollow Supreme Court precedent, and make sure everybody who comes into \nyour courtroom gets a fair chance, given what those rules are. They are \nnot to make new law. They are not to put their opinions in. They are \nnot to change based on what they feel rather than what the law says.\n  The only way we can have blind justice is to make sure those litmus \ntests are not a part of the selection. And what we heard today was the \nopposition--wouldn't go into details--come and aggressively tell us why \nyou do not want Jerome Holmes to be an appellate judge on the Tenth \nCircuit. We are not going to hear that. We are not going to hear that \nat all. Instead, we are going to hear a political debate about the \npolitics of division in our country rather than the healing hand of \nreconciliation that should be about the leadership in this body and \nCongress. How do we reconcile our differences to move the country \nforward instead of divide? How do we gain advantage in the next \nelection by making somebody look bad.\n  That is what we just heard. How do we make somebody look bad? It is \neasy to make somebody look bad. It is a lot harder to build them up and \nsay, in spite of our differences, we can walk down the road together to \nbuild a better America for everybody. We did not hear that this \nmorning. What we heard was the politics of division. First of all, I \nthink it is improper to do that when we are considering the nomination \nof such a great American as Jerome Holmes.\n  I want to comment a minute on the stem cell debate. I am a physician. \nI think it is so unfortunate that we are gaming this. All of us, as \nfamilies and members of this society, have members in our families who \nhave diseases for which future research is going to unlock wonderful \nand magnificent cures. There is no question about that. But there is a \nquestion about an embryo. I personally believe to destroy an embryo is \nto take a life. That is my personal belief. You can have a different \nposition than that, and it does not make you a bad person. It just \nmeans we have different positions. It does not make you incapable of \nmaking good decisions in the future if you have a different position \nthan I do.\n  But there are some facts that are not out, and I would hope the \nAmerican public would listen to them. Embryonic stem cells have \ntremendous potential. There is no question about it. But they also have \npotential tremendous danger. And there will be no cure that will come \nfrom embryonic stem cells that does not come along with potential \ndanger, and that is called rejection because it will not be your \ntissue, it will be the tissue of a clone, which will still have foreign \nDNA in it that is foreign to you. So any cure that comes out of \nembryonic stem cell research will be faced with a lifelong utilization \nof medicines to keep you from rejecting that treatment.\n  Now, the difference between an embryonic stem cell and a cord blood \nor adult stem cell or an amniotic membrane stem cell or chorionic stem \ncell is that it is your tissue, there is no rejection. There is no \npotential for rejection if you use your own stem cells to treat \nyourself so you do not have to have a lifelong utilization of \nmedicines. And the complication of those medicines is tremendous.\n  The other thing we did not hear today, which is the most promising \nfor everything that we have in terms of research, is called germ cell \nstem cells, that have absolutely all the potential of embryonic stem \ncells with none of the downside and none of the rejection and none of \nthe carcinogenesis or teratogenesis, which means the forming of \ntumors--has none of the downside--so, in fact, we now have in front of \nus, in the last 9 months, in this country an ethical alternative that \nsolves all the problems associated with embryonic stem cells and gives \nus all the potential. But we did not hear a thing about that today.\n  We did not hear it because we were creating a wedge issue for the \nelections rather than solving the problems of health care in this \ncountry. We did not hear about the fact that you can take a stem cell \nfrom the duct of the pancreas and recreate beta islet cells to have \npeople--children and adults--who are insulin dependent today have \nreproduction of their insulin on their own from their own cells. We did \nnot hear that. What we heard was division rather than reconciliation.\n  I think it is highly unfortunate that we take time when we should be \ntalking about the merits of what do we want in our judges. I do not \ncare if a judge is liberal or conservative. I do not care if a judge is \na Republican or a Democrat. What I do care about is do they buy the \nfact that they have a limited role? Do they understand what that role \nis, that they are there to follow stare decisis, precedent set by the \nSupreme Court, and the only books they get to look at is what the law, \nthe Constitution, and the treaties say? That is what they get to decide \nit on, and the facts of the case.\n  It should not matter what their political affiliation is. It should \nnot matter what their philosophy is of life.\n\n[[Page S8141]]\n\nWhat should matter is, how do they see their role? Jerome Holmes is a \nman who understands the role of a judge. He will make a fine judge. \nThere is not anybody who knows this man who has come forward, in any of \nthe testimony or any of the history, who has raised an issue about his \nintegrity, his competence, or his character. But we have one issue. He \nhas written his real opinion.\n  If we say judges cannot have an opinion outside of their job, then we \nare going to have terrible judges--terrible judges. And if we use only \npolitical marks--you have to line up on all the politically correct \nstuff from my viewpoint or somebody else's viewpoint to be a judge--we \nare going to have terrible judges. But, more importantly, we are going \nto have a divided country.\n  What we need in our country today is leadership that brings us \ntogether, not leadership that divides us. We need leadership that looks \nat a vision of America as to what we need 30 years from now, and what \ndo we do today to get there, rather than to concentrate on our \ndifferences today so we can have a political advantage in the next \nelection. The American people understand that. They can be manipulated. \nWe saw that today.\n  But America is great when America embraces its heritage. And that \nheritage is self-sacrifice and service for the next generations. It is \nnot about, how do I make myself better today; how do I create an \nadvantage for me politically today. It is about putting me second and \nour country first. It is about putting my party second and our country \nfirst. It is about creating a future for the very lives we are saying \nwe want to cure with stem cells so they have something to look forward \nto.\n  Those who vote against Jerome Holmes do not have that vision for \nAmerica. They have a vision of alienation, of division, of failure for \nour country.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, what is the parliamentary situation?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Holmes nomination is pending.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Is there a time agreement?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Yes, there is.\n  Mr. LEAHY. How much time is available to the Senator from Vermont?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Forty minutes thirty seconds.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I thank the Chair. Mr. President, today, the Senate \nconsiders the nomination of Jerome A. Holmes for a lifetime appointment \nto the Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit. Just last week we \nconfirmed another nominee to the Tenth Circuit, the fifth to be \nappointed by this President. This progress comes in stark contrast to \nthe seven years in which a Republican-led Senate failed to confirm a \nsingle new judge for that court. Indeed, when I moved forward with the \nnominations of Harris Hartz of New Mexico, Terrence O'Brien of Wyoming, \nand Michael McConnell of Utah, it broke a longstanding partisan \nbarricade that had been maintained by Republicans. Among the victims of \nthe Republican obstruction were outstanding lawyers President Clinton \nnominated such as James Lyons and Christine Arguello, who were never \neven granted hearings by the Republican majority. Judge Lyons was among \nthe many Clinton nominees voted unanimously ``Well Qualified'' by the \nAmerican Bar Association who were never granted hearings, and Ms. \nArguello is a talented Hispanic attorney whose nomination had \nsignificant, widespread and bipartisan support from her community and \nState. They were among the more than 60 qualified, moderate judicial \nnominees of President Clinton that Republicans ``pocket filibustered'' \nand defeated without hearings or votes of any kind.\n  Just last Thursday, Democratic Senators joined in the confirmation of \nJudge Gorsuch, an extremely conservative nominee, and three others. \nWorking together we confirmed two circuit court nominees and two \nFederal trial court nominees in a matter of minutes. We brought the \ntotal number of judicial nominees confirmed during this President's \nterm to 255, which exceeds the total for the last 5\\1/2\\ years of the \nClinton administration. It brought the total number of judges confirmed \nover the last 18 months to 50. Of course, during the 17 months I \nchaired the Judiciary Committee the Senate confirmed 100 lifetime \njudges, twice as many in less time. Last week's success demonstrates \nagain how we can make progress in filling vacancies by working \ntogether. Senator Salazar's support for Judge Gorsuch was a critical \nfactor in our ability to act swiftly. Senator Lincoln's and Senator \nPryor's support for confirming Judge Shepherd to the Eighth Circuit \nlikewise made a real difference.\n  Regrettably, this nomination we consider today is not without \ncontroversy and concern. Mr. Holmes initially was nominated to fill a \ndistrict court seat in Oklahoma. The White House withdrew that \nnomination and renominated him to the circuit court after Judge James \nH. Payne asked the President to withdraw his nomination. That \nwithdrawal came after public reports that Judge Payne had ruled on a \nnumber of cases in which he had a conflict of interest. While the \ncommittee never had a chance to hear directly from Judge Payne about \nthe reported conflicts, these types of conflicts are a violation of \nFederal law as well as canons of judicial ethics and have no place on \nthe Federal bench. Certainly, they should not be rewarded with a \npromotion.\n  Before Mr. Holmes' hearing, I raised concerns about the many \ncontroversial letters and columns he has written on such topics as \njuror racial bias, affirmative action, discrimination, and school \nvouchers. In these writings, Mr. Holmes derided opposing points of view \nand those who held them. I asked Mr. Holmes to address my concerns \nabout how he might rule on civil rights issues and how he would treat \nlitigants as a judge. Regrettably, Mr. Holmes' stock answers to my \nquestions that he would follow Supreme Court precedent have not \nreassured me that he would be the kind of judge who understands the \ncritical role of the courts as a protection of individual rights and \ncivil rights.\n  In one column, Mr. Holmes described certain allegations of racial \nprejudice at criminal trials as ``harmful'' because it ``bolster[s] the \ncynical view that jurors vote along racial lines,'' which ``undermines \npublic confidence in the fairness of the criminal justice system.'' In \nfact, Mr. Holmes suggested that it is the focus on the problem of \nracial bias in jury selection--as opposed to the racial bias itself \nthat--harms the criminal justice system. He wrote that focusing on \nracial bias ``may actually give the green light to jurors to exercise \narbitrary power in the jury box when their racial number allow it.''\n  The Supreme Court has long recognized that racial bias in jury \nselection undermines constitutional guarantees to a fair trial, \nestablishing in the landmark 1986 decision Batson v. Kentucky that \nstriking jurors on the basis of race is unconstitutional. In contrast \nto Mr. Holmes' statement that accusations of racial bias are merely \n``cynical,'' Batson was based on evidence showing patterns of race \ndiscrimination in jury selection. It has been reaffirmed repeatedly \nduring the last 20 years in sharp contrast to the views of Mr. Holmes. \nI gave Mr. Holmes every opportunity to admit error and indicate not \nonly that he had learned of the Supreme Court's precedent but that he \nhad adopted that view of the law and accepted the prohibitions against \nracial discrimination as just, but received no such reassurance. \nInstead, the nominee begrudgingly acknowledged that he would have to \nfollow Supreme Court precedent when expressly bound by it.\n  In another column Mr. Holmes wrote after the Supreme Court's landmark \naffirmative action decision, Grutter v. Bollinger, he criticized the \nHigh Court for missing an ``important opportunity to drive the final \nnail in the coffin of affirmative action'' and said that the ``court \ndid not go far enough: Affirmative action is still alive.'' In \naddition, he described affirmative action scholarship programs as \ninvolving classifications that are ``constitutionally dubious and \nmorally offensive.''\n  This was a landmark case and in it Justice Sandra Day O'Connor spoke \nfor the Supreme Court and the Nation. Justice O'Connor, a conservative \nappointed by President Reagan, considered the facts and the law \ncarefully. She took into account the brief from 65 leading U.S. \ncorporations that noted\n\n[[Page S8142]]\n\nthe importance of a diverse workforce and the brief of a highly \nrespected group of former military officers that the military needed a \nracially diverse and highly qualified corps of officers. She built upon \nthe Supreme Court's Bakke decision when she upheld the University of \nMichigan Law School's use of race as a factor in law school admissions \nand affirmed the important interest in diversity. She proclaimed: \n``Effective participation by members of all racial and ethnic groups in \nthe civic life of our nation is essential if the dream of one nation, \nindivisible, is to be realized.'' She went on to note that she hoped \nand expected that consideration of race might no longer be necessary in \nanother 25 years. Even after the decision, Mr. Holmes chose to \ncriticize Justice O'Connor's pragmatic, principled and practical \nresolution of what had become an ideological dispute. Sadly, Mr. Holmes \nseems to continue to want to take sides, and in my view, he is on the \nwrong side.\n  Just last week, the Senate unanimously extended the expiring \nprovisions of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 for another 25 years. We \nall hope that such special provisions will no longer be necessary after \nanother 25 years of growth and progress. But they are needed now.\n  Last week, we also heard the President, who has nominated Mr. Holmes, \nacknowledge that slavery and racial discrimination ``placed a stain on \nAmerica's founding, a stain that we have not yet wiped clean.'' In his \nfirst-ever address to the NAACP national convention during his time in \noffice, the President said racial discrimination remains a ``wound'' \nthat ``is not fully healed.'' I will not soon forget President Bush \nspeaking to the nation from Jackson Square in New Orleans and \nacknowledging that ``poverty has roots in a history of racial \ndiscrimination, which cut off generations from the opportunity of \nAmerica.''\n\n  Such powerful words inspire hope for change. But that change only \noccurs when those words are followed by action. During his address to \nthe NAACP, the President lamented the Republican Party's loss of \nsupport among many African Americans in our country today. He called it \na ``tragedy'' that the party of Abraham Lincoln could disenfranchise \nthe African-American community. It is not difficult to understand why. \nDespite his eventual support for the reauthorization of the Voting \nRights Act, this President's priorities, his polices--and indeed his \nnominees do not demonstrate any sort of meaningful commitment on the \npart of this administration to confront the very real racial and \neconomic disparities that continue to persist today.\n  When considering a nominee to a lifetime appointment on the Federal \nbench, a chief consideration of mine has always been whether all \nlitigants would get a fair hearing in that nominee's courtroom. That is \nwhy I have been, and remain, concerned about the tone and stridency of \nMr. Holmes' writings. In answering my questions about the tone of his \ncriticisms of those with whom he disagrees on issues, Mr. Holmes seeks \nto make a distinction between ``the role of the opinion-article \nwriter'' and the role of a judge. The fact that Mr. Holmes took part in \nhard-edged debate on public issues should not be disqualifying. It \nappears, however, that those opinions are what earned him this elevated \nnomination and what his proponents expect he will deliver from the \nbench.\n  Mr. Holmes has been an outspoken critic not only of affirmative \naction programs and efforts to combat race discrimination, but of \nAfrican-American civil rights leaders who support them, calling them \n``ideologically bankrupt.'' He has called into question the sincerity \nof civil rights organizations opposed to school vouchers by describing \nthem as having ``longstanding ties to school employee labor unions, \nwhich view vouchers as a dangerous threat to the educational status \nquo, in which teachers bear little or no accountability for their \nstudents' educational failures.'' When the convention of the NAACP \nreacted negatively last week to President Bush's advocacy for vouchers, \nit was not because they were under the sway of any teachers' union. It \nwas because they know how important public education is to the futures \nof so many from minority communities.\n  In a letter to one publication, Mr. Holmes criticized claims of race \ndiscrimination based on forced assimilation, characterizing a doctor's \ncomplaint that his colleagues had ``negative reactions to his \ndreadlocks'' as ``naive.'' In another article, he described a defense \nattorney's concerns about racial bias in jury selections as \n``philosophically offensive.'' Mr. Holmes' comments belittling those \nconcerned with the persistence of race-based barriers in this country \nleave me with little assurance that he has the ability to maintain \nobjectivity when applying constitutional and statutory remedies for \nrace discrimination and concerned that he will not have an open and \nfair mind as a judge.\n  Mr. Holmes membership in the Men's Dinner Club of Oklahoma City, \nwhich restricts its membership to men, also concerns me about his \nability to have an open mind. He did not resign his membership until \nFebruary 2, 2006, less than 2 weeks before his initial nomination to be \nUnited States District Judge for the District of Oklahoma, presumably \nonly after he had been notified that he would be nominated. When I \nasked him about why he said in his response to the committee's \nquestionnaire that he did ``not perceive the club as practicing \ninvidious discrimination,'' he did not respond directly. Instead, he \ndeclared in a self-serving conclusion that he would ``not knowingly be \na member of any organization that harbored or expressed any bias \nagainst women, or any other groups on the basis of immutable \ncharacteristics.'' I am left to wonder what it is that Mr. Holmes would \nconsider the kind of discrimination with which he would not want to be \nassociated and why he was not troubled by the Men's Dinner Club. It was \na place for social and professional advancement for him and he seemed \nnot at all concerned with its restrictive policies. The fact that Mr. \nHolmes did not resign until the eve of his nomination because ``some \nmight perceive the Men's Dinner Club as being an improper \norganization'' is troubling.\n\n  I worry that even before I announced any opposition to Mr. Holmes' \nnomination, we had already begun to hear the whispers of criticisms \ntaken from the pages of the playbook of extreme right-wing groups. \nThese groups marked a new low a few years ago by launching a scurrilous \ncampaign to inject religion into the debate over judicial nominations. \nThese smears were fabricated as a calculated weapon to chill proper \nconsideration of candidates nominated for significant judicial \npositions. Similar, baseless accusations of other forms of \ndiscrimination serve only to inflame and distract from the fair and \ndeliberate consideration of judicial nominations.\n  The Senate has confirmed 255 of this President's nominee including \n100 who were approved during the 17 months that Democrats made of the \nSenate majority. The first confirmation when I became chairman was of \nan African-American circuit court nominee on whom Republicans had \nrefused to vote. For that matter, it was Republican Senators who \ndefeated the nominations of Justice Ronnie White, Judge Beatty, Judge \nWynn, Kathleen McCree Lewis and so many outstanding African-Americans \njudges and lawyers who they pocket filibustered.\n  I was surprised when we debated Mr. Holmes' nomination in the \nJudiciary Committee that those defending Mr. Holmes' nomination \ncriticized any expression of concern about his troubling writings in \nthe area of civil rights. I appreciated when the Senator from Oklahoma \napologized to me after that debate. The Senators from Oklahoma are \nwithin their rights in supporting this nomination. In fact, I consider \ntheir support as a weighty factor in considering this nomination.\n  That support is not universal. This is a controversial nomination. A \nnumber of leading organizations concerned with civil rights, including \nthe NAACP, MALDEF, and many others, raised ``grave concern'' about Mr. \nHolmes' record. The Leadership Conference on Civil Rights, the \ncountry's oldest, largest civil rights coalition has opposed the \nconfirmation of this nomination. Having reviewed the record, I share \nthose concerns.\n  In the last several months, as we have worked to reauthorize and \nrevitalize the Voting Rights Act, I have been thinking about the civil \nrights movement, what progress we have\n\n[[Page S8143]]\n\nmade, and what distance we still have to go. The new law is named for \nCoretta Scott King among others. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. knew that \nour judges and our courts were important to securing civil rights. It \nwas not the Congress but the Supreme Court that moved the Nation \nforward in its Brown v. Board of Education decision in 1954. It is \nworth recalling Dr. King's call for the political branches to join the \ncourts in protecting the fundamental rights of all. In his 1957 \naddress, ``Give Us the Ballot,'' Dr. King said, ``[s]o far, only the \njudicial branch of the government has evinced this quality of \nleadership. If the executive and legislative branches of the government \nwere as concerned about the protection of our citizenship rights as the \nFederal courts have been, then the transition from a segregated to an \nintegrated society would be infinitely smoother.'' Dr. King knew how \nimportant fairminded judges were to the realization of equality. Dr. \nKing's view and that expressed by Mr. Holmes appear to be in sharp \ncontrast.\n  I take no pleasure today in doing my duty. I have considered this \nnomination on its merits and, in good conscience, I cannot support it. \nBased on Mr. Holmes' own writings and his responses to our questions, I \nwill vote no. I hope that Mr. Holmes will prove my concerns unfounded \nand be the kind of judge that Dr. King would have admired, a judge in \nthe mold of Thurgood Marshall, William Hastie or A. Leon Higginbotham, \nJr.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a letter raising grave concerns from the \nLeadership Conference on Civil Rights regarding Mr. Holmes' nomination \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                             Leadership Conference\n\n\n                                              on Civil Rights,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 14, 2006.\n     Hon. Arlen Specter, Chairman,\n     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy, Ranking Member,\n     Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Specter and Ranking Member Leahy: On behalf \n     of the undersigned organizations, we write to express our \n     grave concern regarding the nomination of Jerome Holmes to \n     serve on the Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit. Mr. \n     Holmes has been a longstanding and outspoken critic of \n     affirmative action. His criticism of affirmative action \n     raises serious questions about whether litigants could expect \n     him to rule impartially and fairly on claims that turn on \n     legal principles of affirmative action, and about Mr. Holmes' \n     approach to antidiscrimination laws more broadly, if he is \n     confirmed.\n       Many civil rights organizations, including the Leadership \n     Conference on Civil Rights (LCCR), the Leadership Conference \n     on Civil Rights Education Fund (LCCREF), and the other \n     signatories to this letter, worked to persuade the U.S. \n     Supreme Court to uphold the University of Michigan's \n     affirmative action programs. In the closely watched decision, \n     the Supreme Court reaffirmed that universities may take race \n     into consideration as one factor among many when selecting \n     incoming students. In a 5 to 4 opinion written by Justice \n     O'Connor, the Supreme Court in Grutter v. Bollinger \n     specifically endorsed Justice Lewis Powell's view in 1978's \n     Regents of the University of California v. Bakke that student \n     body diversity is a compelling state interest that can \n     justify using race in university admissions. The Supreme \n     Court thus resolved a split among the lower courts as to \n     Bakke's value as binding precedent.\n       Both before and after the Court spoke in Grutter, Mr. \n     Holmes has been openly hostile to affirmative action, \n     expressing his deeply held beliefs regarding the matter. To \n     that end, Holmes has penned several articles widely \n     publicizing these views. In one article, Holmes referred to \n     affirmative action as a vehicle to ``[sow] the seeds of \n     racial disharmony.'' As the Court decided the University of \n     Michigan affirmative action cases, Holmes stated that, \n     ``[t]he court did not go far enough . . . the court upheld \n     the affirmative action policy of the university's law school. \n     And in so doing, it missed an important opportunity to drive \n     the final nail in the coffin of affirmative action.'' With \n     regard to minority scholarships, Mr. Holmes has written that, \n     the ``shelving [of] race-based scholarship programs . . . \n     takes us one step closer to a time when constitutionally \n     dubious and morally offensive racial classifications will no \n     longer impede the progress of any citizen toward full \n     achievement of the American dream.''\n       Affirmative action is a tool to provide qualified \n     individuals with equal access to opportunities. Affirmative \n     action programs, including recruitment, outreach, and \n     training initiatives, have played a critical role in \n     providing African-Americans and other minorities and women \n     with access to educational and professional opportunities \n     they would otherwise have been denied despite their strong \n     qualifications.\n       Although progress has been made over the last 30 years, \n     ensuring equal opportunity for African-Americans and other \n     minorities and women remains an elusive goal. Continued use \n     of affirmative action is necessary to help break down \n     barriers to opportunity and ensure that all Americans have a \n     fair chance to demonstrate their talents and abilities. \n     Therefore, we have no choice but to express our deepest \n     concerns regarding Mr. Holmes' nomination.\n       If you have any questions or need further information, \n     please contact Nancy Zirkin, LCCR deputy director or Richard \n     Woodruff at the Alliance for Justice.\n           Sincerely,\n         Alliance for Justice; American Federation of State, \n           County and Municipal Employees; Feminist Majority; \n           Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law; \n           Leadership Conference on Civil Rights; Legal Momentum; \n           Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund; \n           NAACP Legal Defense & Educational Fund, Inc.; National \n           Association for the Advancement of Colored People \n           (NAACP); National Partnership for Women & Families; \n           National Urban League; National Women's Law Center; \n           People For the American Way; The American Association \n           for Affirmative Action; YWCA USA.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY.

He is dedicated to the \n     highest standards of intellectual service and performed his \n     work for our court as my clerk with complete impartiality and \n     compassion for the people whose cases were before the court. \n     I am convinced he will give extraordinarily fine service as a \n     fair minded and industrious judge of the Tenth Circuit Court \n     of Appeals if his nomination is confirmed.

Holmes.\n\n     Hon. Arlen Specter,\n     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Specter: I write in support of the nomination \n     of Jerome A. Holmes to the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals. \n     After a distinguished career in the Office of the United \n     States Attorney for the Western District of Oklahoma, in \n     August, 2005, Jerome joined our firm as a director. Jerome \n     has already assumed firm leadership positions as the chair of \n     both our Diversity and Business Development Committees.\n       Jerome is thoughtful and principled in all that he does. \n     The other directors of this firm quickly learned to respect \n     and rely upon him. Jerome has been able to represent the \n     clients of the firm and become an integral part of our firm \n     through his outstanding analytical abilities and his \n     excellent temperament.\n       In fact, Jerome Holmes is a paradigm for the judicial \n     temperament and discretion that we expect of a judicial \n     officer. He is the most articulate and well spoken attorney I \n     have had the opportunity to work with, and is easily able to \n     ponder multiple sides of complex issues and arrive at a \n     thoughtful analysis.\n       Jerome has long been active in both the Oklahoma Bar \n     Association and the Oklahoma County Bar Association and is \n     now serving our profession as the vice president of the \n     Oklahoma Bar Association. He has earned the respect of the \n     legal community, both bench and bar, in this city and tate.\n       Jerome Holmes will fill the role as a member of the Tenth \n     Circuit Court of Appeals with distinction and the highest \n     level of professional integrity. I take, great pleasure in\n\n[[Page S8144]]\n\n     sending my highest recommendation of Jerome Holmes for this \n     important judicial position.\n           Yours truly,\n                                                 Brooke S. Murphy,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n         Riggs, Abney, Neal, Turpen, Orbison & Lewis, Attorneys \n           and Counselors at Law,\n                                  Oklahoma City, OK, May 26, 2006.\n     Re recommendation of Jerome A. Holmes, U.S. Court of Appeals \n         for the Tenth Circuit.\n\n     Hon. Arlen Specter,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator: Please accept this letter as an enthusiastic \n     endorsement of Jerome A. Holmes for a position on the U.S. \n     Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit. Although I often find \n     myself in disagreement with Senators Inhofe and Coburn on a \n     variety of policy issues, I have a great deal of respect for \n     Jerome and must commend the Senators for endorsing his \n     nomination for this important judicial position. I \n     respectfully request that you move Jerome's name forward for \n     confirmation.\n       Jerome is an experienced trial lawyer, working on civil and \n     criminal matters. He recently entered private practice at one \n     of the largest law firms in Oklahoma, after a distinguished \n     11-year career as a federal prosecutor in the U.S. Attorney's \n     Office for the Western District of Oklahoma. During his time \n     in the U.S. Attorney's Office, Jerome primarily prosecuted \n     cases involving white collar and public corruption offenses. \n     He also worked for almost one year on the prosecution team \n     that brought charges against the perpetrators of the Oklahoma \n     City Bombing.\n       Jerome received his Juris Doctor from Georgetown University \n     Law Center, where he served as Editor-in-Chief of the \n     Georgetown Immigration Law Journal. He received a B.A. degree \n     from Wake Forest University, graduating cum laude. In \n     addition, Jerome earned a Master in Public Administration \n     degree from Harvard University's John F. Kennedy School of \n     Government, where he was a John B. Pickett Fellow in Criminal \n     Justice Policy and Management.\n       Jerome is licensed to practice law in three jurisdictions, \n     including Oklahoma. He also has been admitted to practice \n     before the Bars of the U.S. Supreme Count and the U.S. Courts \n     of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit and the District of Columbia \n     Circuit.\n       Jerome is a leader in his profession, currently serving on \n     the Oklahoma Bar Associations's Board of Governors (BOG) as \n     Vice President. He is the first African American in the \n     history of the Oklahoma Bar Association to occupy an \n     officer's position on the BOG.\n       Jerome's long-standing concern for the economically \n     disadvantaged is evident in his professional and civic \n     activities. Jerome serves on the ABA's Commission of \n     Homelessness & Poverty and is Chair of the Board of one of \n     the largest providers of shelter to Oklahoma's homeless, City \n     Rescue Mission. Jerome also is committed to ensuring that the \n     doors of the legal profession are open to underrepresented \n     racial and ethnic minorities. He is Chair of his law firm's \n     Diversity Committee and has devoted numerous hours to working \n     with minority high school students in a mock trial program.\n       Jerome enjoys widespread support among Oklahoma Democrats \n     and Republicans alike. In Oklahoma legal circles, Jerome has \n     a very strong reputation. He is a dedicated professional who \n     would be committed as a judge to fairness and justice, rather \n     than ideology. I heartily endorse Jerome's nomination for the \n     Tenth Circuit position without reservation. Please help all \n     Oklahomans by moving Jerome's name forward for confirmation \n     as soon as possible.\n           Sincerely,\n     Michael C. Turpen.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                         Jim Roth,\n\n\n                                 Oklahoma County District One,\n\n                                          Oklahoma City, Oklahoma.\n     Re: nomination of Jerome Holmes, 10th Circuit Court of \n         Appeals\n\n     Hon.

Patrick Leahy,\n     Ranking Member, U.S. Senate, Judiciary Committee, Washington, \n         DC.\n       Dear Distinguished Senators: It is truly an honor to offer \n     this Letter of Recommendation for your consideration on \n     behalf of Jerome Holmes, a nominee for the lOth Circuit Court \n     of Appeals.\n       I have known Jerome Holmes for several years, both \n     professionally and personally, as I am also a member of the \n     Oklahoma Bar Association. I know him to be a person of \n     Integrity and Character and I have always appreciated Mr. \n     Holmes' fairness in our dealings. What's more, I have \n     witnessed Mr. Holmes' efforts in our local community to \n     improve the lives of those around us; all people regardless \n     of where they live, what they look like or how much money \n     they have. He has an altruistic spirit that makes him a \n     standout in this world.\n       I serve Oklahoma County as one of three elected County \n     Commissioners, am a proud Democrat and consider Jerome Holmes \n     to be a principled leader who demonstrates mutual respect for \n     all people. In particular, he is respectful of views that \n     differ from his own and he enjoys tremendous bipartisan \n     support and respect.\n       If I can provide any further information or perspective, \n     please do not hesitate to contact me at your convenience.\n           Respectfully yours,\n                                                         Jim Roth,\n     County Commissioner.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                   Holy Temple Baptist Church,\n\n                                      Oklahoma City, June 21, 2006\n     Hon. Arlen Specter,\n     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Specter and Leahy: I am writing in reference \n     to the nomination of the Honorable Mr. Jerome A. Holmes, \n     Esq.'s judicial appointment. I appreciate the concern that \n     has been expressed about his nomination based upon his \n     writings and positions on affirmative action. In all honesty \n     I stand in a position that is contrary to the interpreted and \n     most likely actual personal stance of Mr. Holmes, yet my \n     relationship with him moved me to write and to express my \n     support for him.\n       I have known Mr. Holmes for many years and believe that he \n     does have a high regard for the views of those who maybe \n     different from his own. That in and of itself is enough for \n     me to believe that he would ``hear'' fairly. In addition, Mr. \n     Holmes has displayed a level of integrity in all his dealings \n     that I have been aware and has shown in our personal \n     conversation willingness to listen and respect differing \n     views. I trust Mr. Holmes and so in light of our differences \n     I support his nomination.\n       I do realize the responsibility that is upon me as a \n     Pastor, Community Leader and a concerned citizen. This is no \n     light matter for me, indeed it is with much prayer and \n     struggle that I searched out the right words to convey the \n     right tone to reinforce my message. As a member of the NAACP, \n     Urban League and many other organizations that fight for the \n     rights of minorities, I am moved to ask your continued \n     approval of this nomination.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              George E. Young, Sr.\n     Pastor.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                                June 19, 2006.\n\n     Re recommendation of Jerome A. Holmes, U.S. Court of Appeals \n         for the Tenth Circuit.\n\n     Hon. Arlen Specter,\n     U.S. Senator,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Specter: As Governor of the State of Oklahoma, \n     and as a former Chair of the State Senate Judiciary \n     Committee, I have had a lot of experience in the selection of \n     judges. In our modified Missouri system of appointment of \n     judges, the Governor plays a key role when judicial vacancies \n     occur. Not only does the Governor appoint members to the \n     Judicial Nominating Commission, but he or she also is \n     forwarded the final three names of judicial applicants for \n     gubernatorial selection. I take this responsibility very \n     seriously, and I have personally interviewed every single \n     candidate forwarded to me.\n       I have come to know and respect Mr. Jerome Holmes, a \n     nominee for the Tenth Circuit vacancy created by the \n     retirement of my friend, Judge Stephanie Seymour. Jerome is a \n     highly qualified candidate, a superb lawyer with a reputation \n     for fairness, ethics and integrity. Indeed, I recently \n     appointed his former supervisor, Judge Arlene Johnson, to our \n     court of last resort on criminal matters, the Oklahoma Court \n     of Criminal Appeals. When Arlene was Chief of the Criminal \n     Division of the U.S. Attorney's office in the Western \n     District of Oklahoma, Jerome was her chief deputy. Their \n     division was considered a model division of the U. S. \n     Attorney's office. Jerome handled this difficult task with \n     competence and honor, and he was part of the prosecution team \n     that brought charges against the perpetrators of the Oklahoma \n     City federal building bombing.\n       I have also come to know Jerome on a personal basis through \n     the Oklahoma Symposium, a sort of ``think tank'' gathering of \n     top Oklahomans that meets formally once a year, and \n     informally in small groups from time to time. It is an honor \n     to be invited to join the Symposium, and Jerome was among the \n     first to be invited for membership.\n       Jerome is uniquely qualified for this position. He served \n     as a law clerk for Federal District Judge Wayne Alley and \n     then for the then-Chief Judge of the Tenth Circuit Court of \n     Appeals, the honorable Judge William Holloway. Jerome then \n     practiced for several years in civil litigation before \n     devoting himself for eleven years to the U.S. Attorney's \n     Office in Oklahoma City. For several months, he has been \n     practicing at Crowe & Dunlevy, one of the largest and most \n     respected law firms in Oklahoma. In short, I do not think you \n     could have a candidate more highly qualified and regarded \n     than Jerome Holmes.\n       I hope you will see fit to appoint this remarkably talented \n     young man to this important position. I know of the Tenth \n     Circuit, as well, because my cousin, Judge Robert Henry, will \n     become the Chief Judge of that Circuit in 2008. I know he \n     shares my high regard for Jerome, as he has told me of \n     Jerome's excellent professional appearances before that \n     court.\n       I continue, Senator, to appreciate the very important work \n     that you do. Please do not\n\n[[Page S8145]]\n\n     hesitate to contact me if I can be of service, or, of course, \n     if you should come to Oklahoma.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                       Brad Henry,\n     Governor.\n                                  ____\n\n                                          Ryan, Whaley & Coldiron,\n\n\n                              Attorneys and Counselors at Law,\n\n                                 Oklahoma City, OK, June 21, 2006.\n     Re: nomination of Jerome A. Holmes to the Tenth Circuit.\n\n     Hon. Arlen Specter,\n     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Specter and Senator Leahy: I am writing in \n     support of the nomination of Jerome A. Holmes for the United \n     States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit.\n       I am a lifelong Democrat. For six years I was fortunate to \n     work on the United States Senate staff of Senator David Boren \n     and the Senate Agriculture Committee. During this time I met \n     Senator Leahy and personally witnessed his leadership as a \n     committee chairman. I was the Democratic nominee for an \n     Oklahoma congressional race in 1994. I later became a federal \n     prosecutor and eventually served as the United States \n     Attorney for the Western District of Oklahoma, first through \n     appointment by Attorney General Janet Reno and then through \n     nomination by President Clinton.\n       I have known Jerome Holmes for over ten years through our \n     work together in the United States Attorney's Office and now \n     in private practice. I believe his intellect, experience and \n     character make him an excellent choice for a position on the \n     appellate court. I saw these qualities firsthand as Jerome \n     carried out his many responsibilities as a prosecutor. One of \n     the most important duties he performed was that of the \n     office's legal ethics and professional responsibility \n     counselor. Jerome acted ably in this capacity during a time \n     of heightened scrutiny for federal prosecutors following the \n     passage of the Hyde Act and the McDade Amendment. Since both \n     of you are former prosecutors, I trust that you can \n     appreciate the degree of confidence in Jerome's abilities and \n     integrity that were required in order to be given such an \n     assignment by me and other United States Attorneys.\n       Jerome's nomination has apparently triggered concern from \n     groups that have focused on his writings on affirmative \n     action. In this regard, I can offer three observations. \n     First, I have known Jerome to be open-minded and respectful \n     of different views. More importantly, I know Jerome to be \n     respectful of the role of the courts, as opposed to the role \n     of the advocates, and I believe this understanding to be \n     partly the result of his three years of service as a law \n     clerk for federal appellate and district judges. Finally, as \n     noted above, I know Jerome to be a person of unwavering \n     integrity. Therefore, when Jerome states under oath that he \n     will put his personal views aside and follow the law, I \n     believe he will do just that.\n       I hope these observations are helpful as you consider \n     Jerome's nomination, which I hope you will act upon \n     favorably. I respectfully request that this letter be made \n     part of the committee record regarding his nomination. If I \n     can be of further assistance or if you or your staff have any \n     questions, please do not hesitate to contact me.\n           Sincerely,\n     Daniel G. Webber, Jr.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                     Oklahoma Bar Association,\n\n                                 Oklahoma City, OK, July 21, 2006.\n     Re: confirmation of Jerome A. Holmes, Nominee for Judicial \n         Appointment to Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals.\n\n     Hon. James M. Inhofe,\n     Russell Center Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Inhofe: As president of the Oklahoma Bar \n     Association, I am writing in support of the nomination of \n     Jerome A. Holmes, Esquire to the United States Court of \n     Appeals for the Tenth Circuit.\n       I've had the pleasure of serving with Jerome for the last \n     2\\1/2\\ years, in various official capacities with the \n     Oklahoma Bar Association. I selected Jerome to serve as my \n     Vice President for this year. He has served in that capacity \n     with exceptional skill, talent and knowledge of a vast \n     breadth of issues.\n       I have enjoyed working with Jerome as I find him to be an \n     intelligent lawyer and an extremely thoughtful leader who \n     excels in everything that he does. I believe that Jerome \n     should be entitled to bipartisan support because he displays \n     the demeanor, work ethic and outstanding capacity to reach an \n     appropriate decision under our constitution. Jerome will be \n     an outstanding jurist who will follow the law and not his \n     personal views or beliefs.\n       Again, I appreciate your consideration of my support for \n     the confirmation of Jerome Holmes to the United States Court \n     of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit by the full Senate. Please \n     feel free to contact me if you have any questions regarding \n     his qualifications.\n           Very truly yours,\n                                                 William R.

Grimm, President,\n                                         Oklahoma Bar Association.\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I want to take a few moments to discuss \nthe comments we just heard. I will go back to the litmus test.\n  My belief is there is no way Jerome Holmes could have given an answer \nin response to questions that were asked by Senator Leahy that would \nhave met with Senator Leahy's approval. We had a hearing on Mr. Holmes. \nThe great concerns we have heard on the floor, nobody came to ask any \nof those questions. No one showed up other than myself and two other \nMembers to hear Jerome Holmes' response, both in terms of his comments \nand beliefs about affirmative action, but also about the beliefs he \nhas. This is a man who has experienced racial discrimination. This is a \nBlack man who rose to heights without the assistance of anyone else \nother than his sheer will and great effort on his part and the \ncharacter instilled in him by his parents.\n  There are multiple allegations that have been raised. I will hold \nback on answering those specifically with Mr. Holmes' responses.\n  I yield to the senior Senator from Utah 20 minutes. If he needs \nadditional time, I will be more than happy to yield that to him. Would \nthe Chair please notify us when we have 10 minutes remaining?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Yes.\n  The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I thank my colleague and I appreciate his \nleadership on the floor. This is an exceptional nominee for the court.\n  I rise to voice my strong support for the nomination of Jerome A. \nHolmes of Oklahoma to be a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the \nTenth Circuit. With this nomination, we see an all-too-familiar \npattern. Mr. Holmes is a highly qualified nominee, a man of integrity \nand character who knows the proper role of a judge, someone who is \npraised by those who know him and attacked by some who do not.\n  Let me review each element of this familiar pattern in turn.\n  First, Mr. Holmes is a highly qualified nominee. After receiving his \nlaw degree from Georgetown University in 1988, where he was editor in \nchief of the Georgetown Immigration Law Journal, Mr. Holmes returned to \nOklahoma and began an impressive legal career. He clerked first for \nU.S. District Judge Wayne Alley of the Western District of Oklahoma, \nand then for U.S. Circuit Judge William Holloway of the Tenth Circuit. \nBoth judges have since taken senior status, and I can only imagine how \nproud they must be to see their former clerk now nominated to the \nFederal bench himself. And in the case of Judge Holloway, I truly hope \nthat Mr. Holmes will soon have the privilege of calling his former boss \na colleague.\n  After 3 years of private practice with the highly regarded law firm \nof Steptoe & Johnson, Mr. Holmes entered public service. While an \nAssistant United States Attorney serving the Western District of \nOklahoma, Mr. Holmes prosecuted a wide range of cases and was that \noffice's anti-terrorism coordinator. No doubt among his most vivid\n\n[[Page S8146]]\n\nmemories from that time was his experience on the prosecution team \nregarding the Oklahoma City bombing. Somehow, Mr. Holmes also completed \na master's degree in public administration from Harvard University's \nKennedy School of Government. Currently, after more than a decade as a \nprosecutor, Mr. Holmes is back in private practice as a director of \nCrowe & Dunlevy, a prominent law firm in Oklahoma City, where he chairs \nthe firm's diversity. committee. He has also served as Vice President \nof the Oklahoma Bar Association. This is an exceptional man.\n  Second, Mr. Holmes is a man of integrity and character. We hear now \nand then about the need for judges who are well-rounded individuals, \nwho are good people as well a good lawyers. Well, during his years in \nprivate practice and public service, Mr. Holmes has also served his \ncommunity. In addition to chairing the Oklahoma City Rescue Mission, \nMr. Holmes has been a director of the Oklahoma Medical Research \nFoundation and a trustee of the Oklahoma City National Memorial \nFoundation.\n  Third, Mr. Holmes understands the proper role of judge in our system \nof Government. He has testified under oath that he knows judges must \nseparate their personal views from what the law requires. He has \nrepeatedly affirmed his commitment to follow applicable Supreme Court \nprecedent in cases that will come before him. This means, as he put it \nin answers to questions following his hearing, an even-handed \napplication of legal principles in all areas.\n  Fourth, Mr. Holmes is praised and supported by those who know him. \nThis includes Democrats in Oklahoma. Daniel Webber, appointed by \nPresident Bill Clinton to be U.S. Attorney in Oklahoma, has written the \nJudiciary Committee in support of Mr. Holmes' nomination. He has known \nthis nominee for more than a decade and urged confirmation based on Mr. \nHolmes' intellect, experience, and character. Reaffirming that the \nnominee before us today knows the proper role of a judge, Mr. Webber \nwrote us that Mr. Holmes is ``respectful of the role of the courts. . . \n. When Jerome states under oath that he will put his personal views \naside and follow the law, I believe he will do just that.''\n  Oklahoma Governor Brad Henry, a Democrat, also wrote the Judiciary \nCommittee to support this nomination. Governor Henry said that Mr. \nHolmes is ``a highly qualified candidate, a superb lawyer, with a \nreputation for fairness, ethics and integrity. In short, I do not think \nyou could have a candidate more highly qualified and regarded than \nJerome Holmes.'' A superb lawyer with a reputation for fairness, \nethics, and integrity. It seems to me that is exactly the formula we \nshould consistently be looking for in nominees to the Federal bench.\n\n  So far, so good. The fifth element of this familiar pattern, however, \nis that Mr. Holmes is being attacked and opposed by some who do not \nknow him. Mind you, they have not suggested that Mr. Holmes is not \nqualified to sit on the Federal appellate bench. They have not disputed \nhis character or integrity. Nor have they offered anything to cast \ndoubt on what seems to be universal acclaim from those who know Mr. \nHolmes and have worked with him. In yet another familiar element of \nthis pattern, Mr. Holmes' critics find fault not with his experience, \nhis qualifications, his integrity, or his character, but his politics.\n  In particular, the critics take issue with Mr. Holmes' opposition to \nGovernment-imposed racial preference policies. Let me emphasize what I \nmentioned a few minutes ago, that Mr. Holmes helped create and chairs \nhis law firm's diversity committee. In the private arena, he works to \nrecruit and retain qualified lawyers of various racial and ethnic \nbackgrounds. He also believes that race-based policies were once \nnecessary to address the effects of past discrimination. Mr. Holmes \nwould be the first African-American judge on the Tenth Circuit. At the \nsame time, like two-thirds of Americans, Mr. Holmes opposes current \nprograms that condition admission to public universities on race, not \nto address past discrimination but to create future diversity.\n  My liberal friends can, of course, disagree with Mr. Holmes on this \nissue. But by suggesting that his opinion on this issue somehow \ndisqualifies him from serving on the Federal bench, they are treading \non very dangerous ground. Mr. Holmes is hardly the first judicial \nnominee to have taken a clearly defined stand on a controversial issue. \nI could chronicle some of the more prominent examples, judges \noverwhelmingly confirmed by this body. Are my liberal friends saying \nthat we should instead be looking to be judicial nominees individuals \nwho have no opinions on issues of the day, who have done nothing, said \nnothing, and thought nothing? Or are they suggesting that if nominees \nhave thought about and have opinions on controversial issues, only \nliberal opinions are acceptable?\n  The issue is not whether a nominee is liberal or conservative, \nDemocrat or Republican, but whether he is committed to basing his \njudicial decisions on the law. The evidence from him and those who know \nhim is that Mr. Holmes will do just that, and there is not a shred of \nevidence to the contrary.\n  Not only that, but Mr. Holmes' supporters--again, those who know him \nbest--also stress his willingness to listen and to respect those with \ndiffering views. Oklahoma County Commissioner Jim Roth, another \nDemocrat, wrote the Judiciary Committee calling Mr. Holmes ``a \nprincipled leader who demonstrates mutual respect for all people. In \nparticular, he is respectful of views that differ from his own and he \nenjoys tremendous bipartisan support and respect.'' That is from a \nDemocrat. How can you ask for a better statement from anybody?\n  Specifically on the issue that has so captivated Mr. Holmes' critics, \nPastor George Young, Sr., who supports affirmative action, writes that \n``Mr. Holmes has displayed a level of integrity in all his dealings \nthat I have been aware and has shown in out personal conversation \nwillingness to listen and respect differing views.''\n  Perhaps my liberal friends are taking out their litmus paper to judge \nMr. Holmes' personal views because they believe that is precisely what \nshould drive judicial decisions. Mr. President, I reject that notion \nout of hand and I invite those who take such an ideological, \npoliticized view of what judges do to try and sell that to the American \npeople.\n  Mr. President, personal views or political positions are the wrong \nstandard for evaluating judicial nominees. It distorts the fundamental \ndifference between advocates and judges, between opinion and law. And \nit misleads the American people about what judges do and the important \nplace they occupy in our system of Government. I am convinced that Mr. \nHolmes understands far better than his critics that judges must be \nneutral arbiters, that they must follow the law, that they must set \naside personal views or opinions. I am convinced that Mr. Holmes will \ndo just that on the Tenth Circuit.\n  Mr. President, we have been here before. Nominees of obvious \nqualification and experience, unquestioned integrity and character, and \nsolid bipartisan support, are nonetheless attacked and maligned because \nof their personal views or political opinions. It has happened before \nand, sadly, I expect it will happen in the future. The proper standard, \nhowever, looks at qualifications, integrity, and commitment to the \nproper role of judges in our system of Government. Judged by this \nproper standard, Mr. Holmes will be a fine member of the court he once \nserved as a law clerk.\n  Let me close with the words of one of the judges Mr. Holmes served as \na law clerk. Judge William Holloway was appointed to the Tenth Circuit \nin 1968 by President Lyndon Johnson. He wrote the Judiciary Committee \nthat Mr. Holmes ``performed his work for our court as my clerk with \ncomplete impartiality and compassion for the people whose cases were \nbefore the court. I am convinced he will give extraordinarily fine \nservice as a fair minded and industrious judge.''\n  Excellence, fairness, integrity, impartiality, compassion, and a \nwillingness to listen. That is what the evidence shows, Mr. President. \nJerome Holmes is a fine lawyer and a good man. He will make a great \njudge.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sununu). The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I believe under the agreement I have 15 \nminutes; am I correct?\n\n[[Page S8147]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is no time agreement. The Senator is \nrecognized and may proceed.\n  Mr. COBURN addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I think I have the floor.\n  Mr. COBURN. Will the Senator yield for an inquiry of the Chair?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Yes.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, it is my understanding that we are under a \nunanimous consent agreement. There is a time agreement, and it is \nlimited on both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is correct. There is \n2 hours equally divided. We are operating under a time agreement, but \nthere is no specific consent to limit the Senator from Massachusetts to \n15 minutes.\n  Mr. COBURN. Will the Chair advise the amount of time left on either \nside? I thank the Senator for yielding.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority has 32 minutes remaining and the \nminority has 22 minutes remaining.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, the Senate's exercise of its advice and consent power \nwhen it considers nominees to the Federal bench is one of our most \nimportant constitutional responsibilities. We are conferring on men and \nwomen the power to interpret and apply our laws for the rest of their \nlives. It is the last opportunity any of us have to sit in judgment of \nthem.\n  Our task is not to evaluate a nominee based on politics but, rather, \nto consider other important criteria. We start with the essential \nelements of professional excellence and personal integrity, but we must \nalso evaluate the likelihood that nominees will be fair and openminded \njudges who bring compassion and understanding of the history and \nfundamental values of America to the bench.\n  In considering a nomination to our Federal courts of appeals, we must \nexercise special care. The Supreme Court accepts few cases out of the \nthousands of cases it is asked to hear every year. The Federal \nappellate courts are almost always litigants' last hope for justice \nfrom our legal system. For those who seek relief from race and sex \ndiscrimination at work or at school, for criminal defendants who have \nbeen wrongfully deprived of their liberty or sentenced to death, or for \nthose who seek to protect our liberties, the circuit courts of appeals \nare almost always their last hope for justice.\n  The record of Jerome Holmes demonstrates that he is not a nominee we \ncan afford to entrust with the judicial power of the United States. His \nprofessional qualifications are not in dispute, but he has taken \nextreme public stances on issues that regularly come before our courts. \nThese stances suggest that he will not approach these issues with an \nopen mind or fairly apply the law in these areas.\n  Perhaps most troubling are Mr. Holmes' strong and repeated statements \ndenouncing affirmative action. Just last week, this body reauthorized \nthe Voting Rights Act, one of America's greatest achievements in the \neffort to overcome centuries of racial oppression. During that debate, \nnumerous Senators had the occasion to revisit the legacy of racially \nmotivated violence, discrimination, and disenfranchisement that \noppressed so many in this country. We had the occasion to reflect on \nthe need for strong and complete remedies for those centuries of \ndiscrimination that would eliminate it root and branch.\n  Affirmative action is an effective and necessary remedy that must be \navailable if we are to provide opportunity for all, by breaking down \npersisting barriers and making it possible for all Americans to \ndemonstrate their abilities and fulfill their potential. Yet Mr. Holmes \nhas repeatedly denounced affirmative action as both immoral and \nunlawful.\n  Shortly after the Supreme Court struck down the University of \nMichigan's affirmative action program for undergraduates but upheld the \nlaw school's program, Mr. Holmes wrote:\n\n       The court did not go far enough: Affirmative action is \n     still alive.\n\n  He lamented that the Court ``missed an opportunity to drive the final \nnail in the coffin of affirmative action.'' He called affirmative \naction a ``quota system'' and accused it of perpetuating a society in \nwhich ``race unfortunately still matters.'' He referred to scholarships \nfor minority students as ``constitutionally dubious and morally \noffensive.''\n  We know that race does still matter in our society, which is the very \nreason lawful affirmative action programs are needed. They guarantee \nopportunity for minority students who, because of discrimination and \nits legacy, might otherwise never be able to excel. We all hope for the \nday that individuals will not be denied opportunity because of race, \nbut until we reach that day, affirmative action programs are part of \nthe solution, not the problem.\n  Mr. Holmes' extreme statements make it impossible to believe that he \nwill approach affirmative action cases with an open mind. He says he \nwill fairly apply our Nation's affirmative action laws, which have \nhelped--and continue to help--women and racial minorities overcome \ncenturies of discrimination, but his bland assurances are far from \nsufficient to overcome his record.\n  His views on our criminal justice system are also disturbing. He has \nput on a set of ideological blinders to ignore the invidious racial \ndiscrimination that persists in criminal trials and sentencing. When a \ndefense lawyer in Oklahoma had the courage to suggest that African \nAmericans accused of committing crimes against Whites in Oklahoma City \ncould not receive a fair trial, Mr. Holmes delivered a swift rebuke. \nNot only did he dismiss the effect of racial bias, he also chastised \nthe defense lawyer for even raising the issue, contending that he had \nundermined the public's confidence in the judicial system. The problem \nof racial bias in juries is an important issue in the criminal justice \nsystem that merits discussion and recognition that we should be seeking \neffective remedies, not blaming the messenger.\n  By approving this nominee, the Senate would send a message that we \ndon't care about the racial disparities in our criminal justice system. \nIf we confirm an appellate judge who ignores the realities of such \ndisparities, we cannot expect the public--especially minorities--to \nbelieve that they will get a fair day in court. The fact that Mr. \nHolmes stated these views while serving as deputy criminal chief of a \nU.S. attorney's office only reinforces my concern about his ability to \nseparate his extreme personal ideologies from his actions as a judge if \nwe confirm his nomination.\n  Mr. Holmes' aggressive support for the death penalty raises special \nconcern. He said that the statement society sends through the death \npenalty ``is not materially diminished by the fact that . . . mistakes \nare made'' in imposing the death penalty. Unlike Mr. Holmes, most death \npenalty supporters appreciate the severity of a death sentence. It is \nirreversible punishment, which means that we must do everything in our \npower to reduce the possibility of mistakes. Many death penalty \nadvocates have supported expanded use of DNA testing and other tools to \navoid mistakes in capital punishment cases.\n  Taking an extreme position yet again, Mr. Holmes has no respect for \nthese concerns. He is more interested in the symbolism of the death \npenalty than the fact that an individual life will end. Because the \nSupreme Court hears so few death penalty cases, appellate courts often \nhave the final word on the life and death of criminal defendants. We \nshould not support the confirmation of a Federal judge who has so \nlittle respect for this grave responsibility.\n  The Senate has supported the overwhelming majority of President \nBush's judicial nominees. I have voted for the confirmation of dozens \nof judges with whom I have ideological differences. However, the \nnomination of Jerome Holmes is different. I do not believe that he will \nserve on the Federal bench with a fair and open mind. I, therefore, \ncannot support the confirmation of Jerome Holmes to the Tenth Circuit, \nand I urge the Senate to oppose his nomination.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, it is amazing the way things get twisted. \nI want to read exactly what Jerome Holmes said in his comments about \nracial bias. The Senator from Massachusetts just stated that he would \nignore\n\n[[Page S8148]]\n\nreality. Here is what he said in his article.\n\n       One need not doubt the lingering effects of racism in our \n     society to reject the above claims. Harvard law professor \n     Randall Kennedy and other scholars remind us that racial \n     prejudice still exists in the jury box.\n\n  He didn't deny it. He said it did. You just heard the opposite of \nthat. What he said is: As an African American, I am among the first to \ncondemn it.\n  We did not hear any of that. And what was just said about what Jerome \nHolmes wrote, he condemns it. He can't be trusted. That was what we \njust heard. What you just heard was a litmus test that if he doesn't \nagree down the line with those who have a completely different \npolitical philosophy, he is unqualified. Here is a Black man who has \nbeen discriminated against tons in his life. It makes no intuitive \nsense that he would oppose a jury system that ferreted out racial \ndiscrimination. So that is unfounded.\n  His comments on the death penalty, Judge Holmes said we should use \nDNA but that should come through the legislature as direction, as a \ndirective of the legislative bodies in terms of creating parameters, \nalso, which you would say is to his credit because what he said is: I \nrecognize the limited role of the judiciary in how we make decisions. \nWe should be dependent in certain areas on directions from the \nlegislative body. In other words, what we rule on is the laws of this \ncountry which the legislative body and the executive branch determine. \nSo all he is doing is deferring. It has nothing to do with whether DNA \nshould be used to protect the life of somebody wrongly convicted and \nunder threat of the death penalty.\n  The other quote we heard is it is impossible for him to have an open \nmind because he disagrees with the Senator from Massachusetts on an \nissue. Well, if we use that standard in this body, nothing would ever \nhappen. If we disagree, then we can't have an open mind, we can't \nlisten, we can't learn.\n  He won't come unbiased to the court. There is not one judge anywhere \nin this country who does not have biases. The question is can they \nseparate their biases through the commitment of their oath of office to \nsay: Here is our function. Here is how we function. Here is how we \ncarry out our obligations.\n  Nobody meets the standard that the Senator from Massachusetts just \nset up. There would be nobody with whom I might have a philosophical \ndifference that I could not raise that same example.\n  I am hopeful that the Members of this body will overwhelmingly \nendorse Jerome Holmes, the first African American to be appointed to \nthe Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals. For the very reasons that Senator \nKennedy raised, Jerome Holmes disproves every one of those arguments.\n  It gives me great pleasure to yield to the senior Senator from \nOklahoma at this time and to thank him in the process and to also \nrecognize and thank the President for the nomination of Jerome Holmes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, first, let me thank the junior Senator \nfrom Oklahoma for the time he spent on the floor and the time he spent \ndefending this man, not that he should ever need any type of defense \nagainst some of the accusations. I didn't realize that there is an \narticle referred to where he stated: There are other ways to get \nminority students on college campuses besides handing out benefits \nbased solely on skin color.\n  I am proud of it. I am also proud of the fact that I have known \nJerome Holmes for some 5 years. Frankly, prior to this nomination, I \nmade recommendations to the President that he consider this man because \nhe is so incredibly qualified. We all agree he is a man of great \ncharacter and undeniably fit for the bench. He has connections with \nboth Oklahoma City and throughout Oklahoma, as well as the District of \nColumbia, a family history that goes back.\n  He was one of the prominent figures in the Oklahoma City bombing that \ntook place 11 years ago. He was on the Oklahoma City bomb prosecution \nteam, and I believe it was his distinguished service as assistant U.S. \nattorney that really began to set him apart in the legal field.\n  When asked about Mr. Holmes, most lawyers in Oklahoma begin their \ncompliments with his work as U.S. assistant attorney in some public \ncorruption cases in our State. He is someone who is willing to get in \nthere and criticize and open up things other people aren't, a great \ncharacteristic and I think very important. But if I were to single out \nanother one, I would say his chairmanship of City Rescue Mission in \nOklahoma. This is their mission statement:\n\n       Serving the homeless both with help, hope, and healing in \n     the spirit of excellence, under the call of Christ.\n\n  I have certainly made my position known for quite some time \nconcerning him and how he limits his opinions to the facts, the \nlitigants, and law before him in any case. At a time when our Nation is \nfaced with the onslaught of judicial activism, he is a breath of fresh \nair and I believe he is a man of character and principle; that he will \nrule justly within the parameters of the law.\n  We have a resolution from the Oklahoma Bar Association. I have the \nformer president of the American Bar Association, the president-elect \nof the local Federal bar association, I have the deans of all three of \nthe Oklahoma law schools praising him in the highest of terms.\n  Judge Holloway, currently sitting on the Tenth Circuit, noted Mr. \nHolmes's compassion for people whose cases were before the court. John \nRichter, the U.S. attorney for the Western District of Oklahoma, who \nworked with Mr. Holmes, can speak from the prosecutor's perspective and \nhas said that Mr. Holmes is a man of integrity and character and \npossesses a rock-solid work ethic.\n  Mike Turpen is someone with whom Senator Coburn is very familiar. I \ndon't believe in the years I have known Mike--and we have one of these \nvery honest relationships. He is a very partisan Democrat. I don't \nthink he has ever said anything nice about a Republican in his life \nexcept Jerome Holmes. Dan Webber--we have all these Democrats who are \nlined up without anyone dissenting from the idea that this guy is the \nperfect nominee to be confirmed to the Tenth Circuit.\n  Judge Ralph Thompson--I was elected to the State legislature with \nJudge Thompson. I considered him not just one of my closest personal \nfriends, but he is certainly a judge of distinction in Oklahoma and has \nbeen for over 30 years. He ought to know a thing or two about judges. \nHe said:\n\n       Mr. Holmes is dedicated completely to the rule of law, the \n     proper role of the judiciary and to applying and interpreting \n     the law without regard to personal views on given issues.\n\n  I don't think there is any judge, any Federal judge in the history of \nOklahoma, who is more highly regarded than Judge Thompson. He also went \non to affirm Mr. Holmes's honesty and compassion.\n  I have a letter from Pastor George Young, a member of the NAACP and \nthe Urban League, who showed great character in voicing his support for \nMr. Holmes. He said: I trust Mr. Holmes, and so in light of our \ndifferences I support his nomination. Now, he is one who doesn't agree \nwith everything, every statement that Jerome Holmes has made, and yet \nhe supports his nomination. He is for him. He is supporting him, head \nof the NAACP and the Urban League.\n  I talked with various attorneys in the State, and they all have good \nthings to say about him. What I want to do, Mr. President, is submit \nfor the Record a list of letters, if this has not been done by my \ncolleague from Oklahoma.\n  It has been done, so it is already in the Record.\n  I thank my colleague for the time he spent in the Chamber. It happens \nI am on the Armed Services Committee, and we have a critical meeting \nthat is going on even right now, so I haven't been able to be here, but \nmy absence from the floor is no indication that I don't hold this \nperson in the highest regard.\n  I worked hard in getting his name to the President, made that \nrecommendation early on, and I believe he will be confirmed and history \nwill reflect later on that he would be one of the greatest circuit \njudges, and I certainly encourage my colleagues to support his \nnomination to the Tenth Circuit.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I am very pleased to support the \nnomination\n\n[[Page S8149]]\n\nof Jerome Holmes to be a judge on the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals. \nDue to a scheduling conflict, I am unable to be here to vote for Mr. \nHolmes, though I would have cast my vote to confirm him. In any event, \nwith his stellar qualifications, I doubt my vote will be needed. \nPresident Bush made a great choice in nominating Mr. Holmes, and I look \nforward to great things from him during his tenure on the Tenth \nCircuit.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I will vote ``no'' on the nomination of \nJerome M. Holmes to be a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the \nTenth Circuit, and I would like to take a minute to explain why I \nreached this decision.\n  This is an important nomination and should receive close scrutiny. \nJudges on the court of appeals have enormous influence on the law. \nWhereas decisions of district courts--a position Mr. Holmes has never \nheld--are subject to appellate review, the decisions of the courts of \nappeals are in almost all cases final, as the Supreme Court agrees to \nhear only a very small percentage of the cases on which its views are \nsought.\n  I believe in certain longstanding touchstones of the qualifications \nneeded for judicial nominees: legal competence, fairness, and the \nability to approach issues with an open mind. We sometimes short-hand \nthese qualities into a single phrase--a judicial temperament. In \nevaluating a nominee's judicial temperament, our goal is to have an \nevenhanded judiciary that hears the case before it and applies the law \nfairly and uniformly, rather than letting strong personal convictions \noverride the facts or the law. We do this for a simple but fundamental \nreason, namely, that we want a highly qualified and independent \njudiciary that can command the respect and admiration of the American \npeople.\n  In the nomination of Mr. Holmes, we have a nominee to one of our \nhighest courts who has never served as a judge before. President Bush \noriginally nominated Mr. Holmes to be a Federal district judge in \nOklahoma earlier this year. Prior to this nomination, Mr. Holmes had \nbeen an assistant U.S. attorney in Oklahoma and in private practice. \nThe Judiciary Committee was ready to consider that initial nomination--\nto determine the merits of Mr. Holmes serving in his first judicial \nposition as a Federal district judge, a position with substantial \nresponsibility.\n  But for some reason Mr. Holmes' nomination was upgraded to the U.S. \nCourt of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit. Placing a nominee with no \njudicial experience on an appellate court makes it hard to evaluate the \nnominee's judicial temperament--his capacity to be fair and impartial.\n  With no judicial record to illuminate his views, we are left only \nwith Mr. Holmes' words as a window into his judicial temperament. Those \nwords are troubling and could lead a reasonable person to question his \nobjectivity and temperament. After the Supreme Court's nuanced \naffirmative action ruling, Grutter v. Bollinger, Mr. Holmes derided the \nCourt for missing the ``opportunity to drive the final nail in the \ncoffin of affirmative action,'' and complained that ``[t]he court did \nnot go far enough: Affirmative action is still alive.'' He has referred \nto scholarship programs targeted at minority children as ``morally \noffensive.'' He has called African-Americans leaders, on various \noccasions, ``ideologically bankrupt'' and suggested that their \nopposition to school vouchers is insincere. In a letter to a \npublication, Mr. Holmes flippantly dismissed a doctor's complaint that \nhis colleagues had ``negative reactions to his dreadlocks'' as \n``naive.'' He has even gone so far as to claim that efforts to address \nracial bias in jury selection actually harm the criminal justice \nsystem.\n  Mr. Holmes has even dismissed problems with the administration of the \ndeath penalty. In a 2004 speech, he said: ``The statement society is \nsending--that certain conduct and the perpetrators of it deserve to die \nis not materially diminished by the fact that in the implementation of \nthe death penalty mistakes are made.'' In response to my written \nquestions regarding whether executing an innocent person was an \nacceptable mistake, Mr. Holmes responded by saying that ``the criminal \njustice system should be administered in a manner that eliminates \nmistakes--to the extent it is humanly possible--and yields accurate \noutcomes.'' I do not think this is an acceptable answer to a fairly \nsimple question. His statements suggest a rather cavalier approach to a \nvery significant issue in contemporary criminal law.\n  Mr. Holmes' dismissive comments about affirmative action, school \nvouchers, and the death penalty were not offhand remarks, or \nimpassioned advocacy on behalf of a client. Nonetheless, Mr. Holmes, of \ncourse, urges us to set his earlier statements aside, and look to his \nassurances of his future impartiality as a judge. But Mr. Holmes did \nlittle to actually address the concerns of many members of the \nJudiciary Committee. Rather than discuss his previous comments openly \nand candidly--and take the opportunity to show why those comments might \nnot reflect his actual thinking--he provided stock and unconvincing \nanswers that he considers racism to be a ``negative influence'' in \nsociety and that he would follow Supreme Court precedent.\n  Mr. Holmes' actions in connection with his membership in the Men's \nDinner Club of Oklahoma also suggest, rather than candor, a strategy of \nsimple image control. Mr. Holmes, having been a member of this club \nthat excludes women from membership, resigned from its membership on \nFebruary 2, 2006 just 2 weeks prior to his initial nomination to be a \ndistrict court judge. Mr. Holmes has defended this institution as, to \nhis knowledge, not ``practicing invidious discrimination.'' So what \naccounts for his resignation? His explanation--that ``some might \nperceive the Men's Dinner Club as an improper organization''--suggests \nnot a principled decision but a pure political and image calculation. \nClearly, Mr. Holmes wishes to make this nomination as palatable as \npossible--and we should therefore take his assurances and stock answers \nwith a grain of salt.\n  Mr. President, I am saddened that President Bush has once again \nproposed a judicial nomination that I cannot support, especially \nbecause Mr. Holmes would be the first African American to serve on the \nTenth Circuit. But he has never served as a judge either on the Federal \nor State level--and his statements on a broad range of topics suggest \nconcerns about his ability to provide impartial justice. And, by \nfailing to explain his statements and views with candor, he missed a \nchance to show the Judiciary Committee that he has the deliberative and \nimpartial reasoning needed to serve on an appellate court. We want a \njudiciary that the American people respect and admire as impartial. \nWith no judicial record to examine and a history of troubling \nstatements, Mr. Holmes has not shown that he will apply the law fairly. \nI will therefore vote ``no.''\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I will oppose the nomination of Jerome \nHolmes to the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals. Although I do not \nquestion the integrity or qualifications of Mr. Holmes to be a Federal \ncircuit court judge, I do have serious questions about his ability to \nbe an impartial jurist.\n  While all judges have and are entitled to their personal views and \nphilosophies, a judge's decisions should not be controlled by an \ninflexible ideology. When a nominee's personal views will determine or \ndominate their judgements, such a nominee should not be put in a \nlifetime position on the Federal bench.\n  I am concerned by statements that he has made indicating insufficient \nsensitivity about the irreversible errors in the implementation of the \ndeath penalty. For example, in a presentation given by Mr. Holmes, he \nsaid that:\n\n       Like any human endeavor, there is a possibility of error . \n     . . But the statement society is sending--that certain \n     conduct and the perpetrators of it deserve to die--is not \n     materially diminished by the fact that in the implementation \n     of the death penalty mistakes are made.\n\nMr. Holmes' statement demonstrates a lack of understanding and concern \nabout the death penalty and the way that erroneous convictions \nundermine a legal system.\n  Mr. Holmes has also sharply criticized affirmative action programs \nboth before and after the Supreme Court rulings and those hardline \nviews exhibited a lack of adequate respect for Supreme Court precedent. \nAlthough he told members of the Judiciary Committee that he would \nfollow precedent,\n\n[[Page S8150]]\n\nhe was vocal in his opposition to the Supreme Court's decision in \nGrutter v. Bollinger, criticizing the Court for missing an ``important \nopportunity to drive the final nail in the coffin of affirmative \naction''.\n  Because Mr. Holmes' statements do not reflect the objectivity \nnecessary to serve in a lifetime appointment on the Federal bench, I \ncannot vote to confirm his nomination.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, Jerome Holmes has made some troubling \nstatements about affirmative action and the use of race in our society. \nHe has said:\n\n       [Affirmative action] policies necessarily divide us along \n     racial lines, and establish a spoils system based upon skin \n     color. . . .\n       [t]he [Supreme] court upheld the affirmative action policy \n     of the university's law school [in the 2003 Michigan case]. \n     And in so doing, it missed an important opportunity to drive \n     the final nail in the coffin of affirmative action. . . .\n       [r]ace-based scholarship programs . . .

As long as Jackson and company can \n     successfully portray African-Americans as victims to the \n     public at large, they'll be able to wring concessions out of \n     educational institutions like Harvard University and \n     corporate \n     America. . . .\n\n  Mr. Holmes didn't make just an occasional comment against affirmative \naction. He has written over a dozen columns and op-ed pieces expressing \nhis views on race and affirmative action.\n  I understand and accept that people in good faith can disagree about \nissues of race and the merits of affirmative action. It is a hard issue \nfor many people and it stirs passions on both sides. But Mr. Holmes' \nstatements are those of an ideological soldier. When it comes to \naffirmative action, Mr. Holmes seems to have open hostility, not an \nopen mind.\n  In its letter of opposition to the Holmes nomination, the Leadership \nConference on Civil Rights wrote: ``Mr. Holmes has been a longstanding \nand outspoken critic of affirmative action, and his views raise serious \nquestions about whether he would rule impartially and fairly in cases \ninvolving affirmative action.''\n  I asked Mr. Holmes a simple question: Would you be willing to recuse \nyourself in all cases involving affirmative action?\n  Section 455 of title 28 of the United States Code states: ``Any \njustice, judge, or magistrate judge of the United States shall \ndisqualify himself in any proceeding in which his impartiality might \nreasonably be questioned.''\n  This seems like a simple standard, and I share the belief of the \nLeadership Conference on Civil Rights that Mr. Holmes presents a clear \ncase of someone whose impartiality would be questioned when it comes to \naffirmative action.\n  But Mr. Holmes doesn't see it that way. He said he would not recuse \nhimself in affirmative action cases. He said he would be able to put \nhis personal views aside and rule fairly on this issue. I doubt it. He \nharbors such hostility to affirmative action and such disdain for those \nwho promote it--that I believe he will not have an open mind on this \nissue.\n  We have seen judicial nominee after judicial nominee come before this \ncommittee and pledge to put their personal views aside. But they rarely \ndo. Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Samuel Alito said they would \nput their personal views aside before they were confirmed, but they \nhave not done so.\n  Just in the last 2 months, Chief Justice Roberts and Justice Alito \nhave voted to limit the scope of the Voting Rights Act. They have voted \nto strip whistleblower protections for prosecutors. They have voted to \nrestrict the right to privacy so that can police officers can enter a \nhome without knocking. They have voted to expand the death penalty and \nto reduce the rights of the criminally accused. They have voted to roll \nback 30 years of environmental protection under the Clean Water Act. \nAnd in the case Hamdan v. Rumsfeld, Justice Alito embraced the view \ntaken by John Roberts in the appellate court that the President should \nhave unchecked power when it comes to using military commissions for \nenemy combatants.\n  There are very real and serious consequences when it comes to \nconfirming judicial nominees.\n  I also think Mr. Holmes lacks good judgment because he didn't answer \nseveral questions that I asked him during the nomination process.\n  For example, I asked him if be believed the Supreme Court cases of \nRoe v. Wade, Brown v. Board of Education, and Miranda v. Arizona are \nconsistent with the notion of ``strict constructionism.'' Mr. Holmes \nrefused to answer. He said: ``it would be inappropriate for me to offer \nmy personal views as to whether these decisions are consistent with a \nparticular school of judicial decision-making.''\n  Well, tell that to Deborah Cook. She was a nominee to the U.S. Court \nof Appeals for the Sixth Circuit a few years ago, and I asked her the \nsame question. She answered it. I appreciated her candor, and I voted \nto confirm her.\n  I also asked Mr. Holmes to explain a statement he made about his \njudicial philosophy. In his Senate questionnaire, he wrote: ``The \njudiciary should not . . . issu[e] rulings that go beyond the \nresolution of the dispute before the court to impose wide-ranging \nobligations on societal groups.'' I asked Mr. Holmes to provide some \nspecific examples of what he meant by this. He refused to do so.\n  I do not believe Jerome Holmes deserves a lifetime position on the \nsecond highest court in the country.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the vote on \nthe confirmation of Jerome Holmes be at 11:45 a.m. today with the \nremaining time under the majority.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. COBURN. I thank the Chair. I will not take all the time. I want \nto go back to what we said earlier this morning. If we are going to do \na litmus test on judges, if we are going to say a judge cannot have an \nopinion outside of his role of a judge, we will destroy this country, \nwhether it is a conservative litmus test or a liberal litmus test.\n  The fact is, as to Jerome Holmes, there have been very few \nappointments or nominees for this position at the appellate level that \ncompare to the qualifications of Mr. Holmes. He also has the life \nexperiences that will make him even more valuable on the court in terms \nof his compassion. He has experienced discrimination as an African \nmale. He has risen to heights on his own, struggled--advanced degrees \nfrom Harvard, law degree from Georgetown, cum laude from his alma \nmater. There are very few people who will measure up to him.\n  Now, does he fit every litmus test? No, he doesn't fit every litmus \ntest that I might have for a judge, but that is not the basis under \nwhich we should be considering judges.\n  He does, in fact, have the one key characteristic that is necessary, \nand it has been attested to by the people who know him. It has been \nattested to if you just heard him in the hearings. But of all those who \nhave come to the floor to oppose him, members of the Judiciary \nCommittee wouldn't even come and confront him with concern. They didn't \ncome to the hearing. They didn't hear what he had to say. They had \ntheir minds made up.\n  The fact is, this is an excellent nomination. It is someone of whom \nwe in our country should be proud, who recognizes the diversity of our \ncountry, and despite what the Senator from Massachusetts said, he can \nbe entrusted with the future of this country, our Constitution, and the \nlimited role of a judge in applying the law.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of our time and \nsuggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask that the Senate now proceed to S. \n403 under conditions of the consent agreement from last week.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 403) to amend title 18, United States Code, to \n     prohibit taking minors across State lines in circumvention of \n     laws requiring the involvement of parents in abortion \n     decisions.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada is recognized.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I rise to discuss the Child Custody \nProtection Act which will protect the rights of our Nation's parents \nand their children's well-being. Speaking as a father of three young \nchildren, including a daughter, I understand how difficult the \nchallenge of raising children can be. In most schools across the \ncountry, our children cannot go on a field trip, take part in school \nactivities, or participate in sex education without a signed permission \nslip. An underage child cannot even receive mild medication such as \naspirin unless the school nurse has a signed release form. Some States \neven require parental permission to use indoor tanning beds. Nothing, \nhowever, prevents this same child from being taken across State lines \nin direct disobedience of State laws for the purpose of undergoing a \nsurgical, life-altering abortion.\n  The bill before us, the Child Custody Protection Act, makes it a \nFederal offense to knowingly transport a minor across a State line for \nthe purpose of an abortion in order to circumvent a State's parental \nconsent or notification law. It specifies that neither the minor \ntransported nor her parent may be prosecuted for a violation of this \nact.\n  It is important to note that this legislation does not supersede, \noverride, or in any way alter existing State parental involvement laws. \nIt does not impose any Federal parental notice or consent requirement \non any State that does not already have a parental involvement law in \nplace. This bill merely addresses the interstate transportation of \nminors, sometimes by a predatory older male or his parents, in order to \ncircumvent valid existing State laws that require parental notification \nor consent. This bill goes a long way in strengthening the \neffectiveness of State laws designed to protect parents and their young \ndaughters from the health and safety risks associated with secret \nabortions.\n  An overwhelming number of States have recognized that a young girl's \nparents are the best source of guidance and knowledge when making \ndecisions regarding serious surgical procedures such as abortion. \nForty-five States have adopted some form of parental notification or \nconsent, proving the widespread support for protecting the rights of \nparents across America. The people who care the most for a child should \nbe involved in these kinds of health care decisions. If there is \naftercare needed, the parents should be fully informed in order to care \nfor their young daughter.\n  An overwhelming majority of Americans support parental consent laws. \nIn fact, most polls show that consent is favored by almost 80 percent \nof the American people. These numbers do not lie. By the way, these are \npeople who call themselves pro-choice and pro-life. Well over a \nmajority of even pro-choice people support parental notification or \nparental consent laws. The American people agree that parents deserve \nthe right to be involved in their minor children's decisions. In many \ncases, only a girl's parents know her prior medical and psychological \nhistory, including allergies to medications and anesthesia.\n  The harsh reality is our current law allows for parents to be left \nuninformed about their underage daughter's abortion which can be \ndevastating to the physical and mental health of their child. Take the \ncase of Marcia Carroll from Pennsylvania. On Christmas Eve 2004, her \ndaughter informed her she was pregnant. After listening to her \ndaughter's story, Ms. Carroll assured her that they would handle \nthis as a family and would support any decisions she decided to make. \nThey scheduled appointments with both doctors and counselors and \ndiscussed all options available. Ms. Carroll purposely allowed her \ndaughter to speak alone with the professionals so that her daughter \nfelt comfortable to speak her mind. After all the advice and counsel, \nher daughter decided to have the baby and to raise it, a decision which \nthe family fully supported.\n\n  Following her decision, despite their knowledge of her family's love \nand support, her boyfriend's family began to harass her and threaten \nthat she could not see her boyfriend unless she had an abortion. Ms. \nCarroll was so concerned about their behavior, she called the police \nand even went so far as to contact a nearby abortion clinic to ensure \nthat parental consent would be required before an abortion would be \nallowed. Pennsylvania's law requires that anyone under the age of 18 \nhave consent of a parent before an abortion can be performed. \nUnfortunately, other States nearby do not have the same protections.\n  Shortly after, Ms. Carroll sent her daughter off to school, thinking \nshe would be safe. Imagine yourself in the same position. Instead, her \nboyfriend and his family met her at the bus stop, bought them a train \nticket, and sent the children to New Jersey, where other family members \npicked them up and took them to an abortion clinic. Despite her tears \nand desires to keep the baby, her boyfriend's family coerced her by \ntelling her they would leave her in New Jersey with no way to get home. \nThey planned, paid for, and threatened her into agreeing to an \nabortion. After the abortion, they dropped her off blocks from her \nhouse with no regard to her mental or physical well-being. Ms. Carroll \ncalled the local police department only to be told that there was \nnothing that could be done. This poor young girl, whose family was \ncommitted to loving her and respecting her decision, had her life \nforever altered by adults who never considered her wishes or the \nconsequences such a decision would have on her life.\n  Parental notification serves another vital purpose: ensuring \nincreased protection against sexual exploitation of\n\n[[Page S8152]]\n\nminors by adult men. All too often, our young girls are the victims of \npredatory practices of men who are older, more experienced, and in a \nunique position to influence the minor's decisions. According to the \nAmerican Academy of Pediatrics, almost two-thirds of adolescent mothers \nhave partners older than 20 years of age. Rather than face a statutory \nrape charge, these men or their families use the vulnerability of the \nyoung girl against her, exerting pressure on the girl to agree to an \nabortion without talking to her parents. We all know how easy it is to \ninfluence teenagers, boys or girls. In fact, in a survey of 1,500 \nunmarried minors having abortions without their parent's knowledge, 89 \npercent said that a boyfriend was involved in the decision, and the \nnumber goes even higher the younger the age of the minor. Allowing \nsecret abortions does nothing to expose these men and their heinous \nconduct.\n  Such is the case with Crystal, the 12-year-old daughter of a \nPennsylvania woman, who was intoxicated and raped by a local teenager 6 \nyears her senior. Crystal's mother did not even know she was pregnant \nuntil Crystal went missing from school and it was discovered that her \nrapist's mother had taken her across State lines into New York where, \nscared and confused, she received an abortion. When Crystal developed \ncomplications from the incomplete abortion, the clinic physician \nrefused to supply the medical records to her mother. Crystal's mother, \na loving and responsible parent, was not even given the option to care \nfor her daughter. Rather, the decision was made for her by an unknown \nadult.\n  There is overwhelming agreement that parents and parental \nnotification laws and consent laws are important tools that enable \nparents to help protect their daughters from this kind of abuse. In \n1998, Dr. Bruce Lucero, an abortionist who performed some 45,000 \nabortions, wrote of his support for the Child Custody Protection Act to \nthe New York Times. In the article, Dr. Lucero pointed out that \n``dangerous complications are more likely to result when parents are \nnot involved in these out-of-state abortions.'' He goes on to say that \nparental involvement is the best guarantee that a minor will make the \nbest and most safe decision. This is an abortionist doctor talking.\n  In the unfortunate instance of abuse or where there is rape or incest \ninvolved within a family, minors may be afraid to go to one of the \nparents--and rightfully so. In response, judicial bypass laws have been \nwritten across the country to protect the minor.\n  This legislation is a commonsense solution to defeat the legal \nloophole that currently results from parents being denied the right to \nknow about the health decisions of their minor daughters.\n  The Child Custody Protection Act in no way imposes a parental \ninvolvement law on a State that does not already have a functioning law \nin place. It does not invalidate any State law, nor does this act \ncontradict Supreme Court precedent dealing with minors and abortion.\n  In fact, the Supreme Court made it clear in Planned Parenthood v. \nCasey that it is the State's right to declare that abortion should not \nbe performed on a minor unless a parent is consulted.\n  Mr. President, is it time for the adjournment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, it is.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Since my colleague has spoken for 10 or 15 minutes----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Eleven and a half minutes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I would like to have 5 minutes to respond. I thought we \nwere going to start the debate after the luncheons. Upon his \nconclusion, perhaps in the next minute or so, may I have a few minutes \nto open?\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 30 more \nseconds and 5 minutes for my colleague.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. In fact, the Supreme Court made it clear in Planned \nParenthood v. Casey that it is the State's right to declare that an \nabortion should not be performed on a minor unless a parent is \nconsulted.\n  This is not an argument on the merits of abortion. Rather, this is a \ndebate about preserving the fundamental rights of parents to have \nknowledge about health decisions of their minor daughters.\n  Let me conclude with this. This is one of the biggest moral issues of \nthe day, the right to have an abortion or not. It splits America. The \nemotions are high. There are good people on both sides of the debate. \nWe need to look for common ground, where we can come together and at \nleast have some reasonable restrictions on abortion. I believe this \nbill is one of those reasonable restrictions on abortion that I think \nall of us should come together on.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Nevada. I rise \nto speak as a mother and a grandmother--a mother of a daughter and a \nson, a grandmother of a grandson, and a Senator who has been here now \nfor three terms, and I served over in the House for many years--to say \nthat my friend from Nevada is right that this is not a parental consent \nbill at all.\n  Some States have parental consent laws, some don't. In my particular \nState, it has been voted down because my people feel that if you ask \nthem do they want their kids to come to their parents, absolutely. But \nif you ask them should you force them to do so, even in circumstances \nwhere there could be trouble that comes from that, they say no.\n  I respect those States that have parental consent laws, and perhaps \nwe will have a law that is drafted in California that the voters will \napprove. So far, we have not seen that.\n  It is true it is not a partisan issue. When we voted down those laws, \nwe did it regardless of political party. But the reason is unintended \nconsequences in the way certain bills are drafted. I want to speak to \nthat because I believe this bill is well-intentioned.\n  This bill emanates from a desire that our children come to us when we \nhave family matters, when our children are in trouble, that they not be \nfearful, that they not be afraid that they disappoint us, that they be \nopen with us and loving toward us, and we toward them. This is what we \nwant to have happen.\n  The question is: Can Big Brother Federal Government force this on our \nfamilies? That is where we will differ.\n  I have to tell you, as I look at this bill coming before us now, I \nhave to ask the question: why are my colleagues on the other side of \nthe aisle who run this place, who run the House, who run the White \nHouse, putting so much effort into this bill, having killed stem cell \nresearch, which all of our families are desperate to have--talk about \n80 percent of America, it is 90 percent who want to find cures to \nAlzheimer's and all the rest. Oh, no, instead of getting another chance \nto pass that bill and convince the President, who is now backing off a \nlittle bit in his rhetoric, to sign a stem cell research bill, or to \nprevent teen pregnancies, which is so important, we don't have that. We \nhave this bill that impacts very few people. Instead of improving the \nhealth of women and girls, we are spending precious time on a bill \nthat, in essence, protects incest predators. This bill, as it is \nwritten, protects fathers who commit incest. Can you imagine? It allows \nthem to drive their daughter across State lines. Unbelievable. We are \ngoing to try to fix this problem with an amendment. I hope my \ncolleagues will support that, and it will improve this bill.\n  Right now, imagine, a father retains parental rights if he has \ncommitted rape on his daughter. This is supposed to be a warm and fuzzy \nbill? I don't think so. It also throws grandmothers in jail.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mrs. BOXER. When I am finished.\n  This bill, as it is drafted, will throw a grandmother in jail. Say \nthe father committed incest on the daughter and she is hysterical. The \nfirst place she goes is not some judge but to her grandma, who she \nadores and who gives her unconditional love, or to her priest or rabbi, \nand says please help me out of this. That incestuous father, as the \nbill is written, can sue that caring adult who takes her over the line.\n  My friend is going to offer an amendment that goes part of the way on \nthe incest provision. It will say the father cannot sue. I am so happy \nbecause I will join him in that. I hope we have a 100-to-0 vote. But I \nam shocked that we\n\n[[Page S8153]]\n\ncannot reach agreement on that. Talk about finding common ground. Even \nwith the Ensign amendment that says a father cannot sue, he can still \ntake the daughter across State lines. And the Federal Government can \nstill sue the grandmother or the clergy.\n  This debate is just beginning. The Senator from Nevada and I are \nfriends, but we will have a tough debate. I hope we will vote for the \nDemocratic amendment to improve this bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/07/25/senate-section/article/S8153-1", "month": "07", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8153]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, the amendment I am offering gets to \nthe heart of the issue this bill purportedly means to address; that is, \nreducing the number of abortions. The best way to reduce the number of \nabortions is to prevent teen pregnancies in the first place. It is that \nsimple.\n  The amendment I am offering, along with Senators Menendez, Clinton, \nSchumer, Kennedy, Kerry, and Feinstein, is aimed at dramatically \nreducing teen pregnancy rates in the United States. This amendment will \nassist efforts by nonprofit organizations, schools, and public health \nagencies to reduce teen pregnancy through awareness, education, and \nabstinence programs.\n  The root problem we are talking about today is not abortion, it is \nteen pregnancy. If we do nothing about teen pregnancy, yet pass this \npunitive bill, then it proves that this exercise is only a political \ncharade and not a serious effort to combat the problem.\n  The U.S. teen pregnancy rate is the highest by far among developed \ncountries, and here is some of the evidence we use to prove this.\n  In Germany, the teen pregnancy rate is 16 per 1,000. The U.S. rate is \n84 per 1,000. I ask my colleagues to look at this chart which shows \nseveral countries teen pregnancy rates compared with the U.S. This is \nteen pregnancy rate for ages 15 to 19, among developed countries per \n1,000 persons. In Sweden, it is 25 young women per 1,000; in France, it \nis 20 young women per 1,000; in Canada, 46; in Great Britain, 47; and \nhere we are. Are we the winners in this contest? I hardly think so. We \nhave 84 unintended teenage pregnancies per 1,000 persons.\n  I mentioned before that Germany has a teen pregnancy rate of 16 per \n1,000, and again, I mention the rate in the United States is 84 per \n1,000. So it tells us that there is something terribly wrong about the \nway we do things here.\n  I look further at Belgium, which has a teen pregnancy rate of 14 per \n1,000; the Netherlands, 12 per 1,000; and ours is 84 per 1,000. We \ncannot continue to ignore facts such as these. We can pass all the \nabortion restrictions we can think of, but unless there are fewer teen \npregnancies, the results will be tragic for thousands of young women.\n  In many cases, teen pregnancies result in abortion, but that is not \nthe extent of the problem. We know that children of teenage mothers \ntypically have lower birth weight deliveries, are more likely to \nperform poorly in school, and are at greater risk of abuse and neglect \nthan other children. The sons of teen mothers are 13 percent more \nlikely to end up in prison, while teen daughters are 22 percent more \nlikely to become teen mothers themselves.\n  Each year in the United States, approximately 860,000 young women \nbecome pregnant before they reach the age of 20. Eighty percent of \nthese pregnancies--80 percent of 860,000. That is over 600,000 young \nwomen are unintended, and 81 percent of these young women are \nunmarried.\n  So what are we doing differently in the United States that is \nseparating us from the rest of the developed world? The answer is \nsimple: the other countries promote full, comprehensive sex education \nprograms, and in the United States--would you believe it--we don't \nallow funding for comprehensive sex education. I repeat that because \nsome people may think they misheard me. The Federal Government will not \nfund comprehensive sex education programs despite the fact that 90 \npercent of parents polled say that in addition to abstinence, sex \neducation should cover contraception and other forms of birth control. \nBut the Federal Government currently will not fund any programs that \neven mention contraception and restricts all of its funding to \nabstinence-only programs.\n  I want to be clear, I am not against abstinence programs. In fact, \nour amendment will also fund abstinence programs. I think they can be \neffective at times. But the Federal Government's current policy of \nrestricting funding to abstinence-only programs is producing the wrong \nresult. Just look at how poorly our teenage pregnancy rates compare \nwith other nations.\n  We need to dedicate our scarce Federal resources toward medically \naccurate, age-appropriate education that includes information about \ncontraception as well as abstinence. In many cases, particular types of \ncontraception can help avoid sexually transmitted diseases. Isn't that \na good objective as well? We have to be realistic about the hope that \neach and every teenager is going to abstain from premarital sex. Saying \n``Don't do it'' may work at times but not all the time.\n  Look at another problem--youth smoking, for instance. Kids are \nbombarded with warnings not to smoke. These messages have cut teen \nsmoking rates dramatically, but 1,500 kids a day still start smoking. \nSo it needs intensity of education, comprehensive education.\n  We remember First Lady Nancy Reagan's ``Just Say No to Drugs'' \ncampaign. It worked for some kids but obviously not for others. For \nthose teenagers who already are sexually active or who do become \nsexually active, we fail them if we don't teach them about \ncontraception. If we are serious about reducing the number of \nunintended pregnancies, almost half of which tragically end in \nabortion--we have to implement programs that work so that our teenagers \nhave the knowledge they need to bring about a positive future for \nthemselves with the opportunity to pursue their dreams. We create a \nhuge number of abortions as a result of the ignorance of what the facts \nare, about sex and young people.\n\n  This year, the Federal Government will direct $176 million of \ntaxpayers' money to abstinence-only programs. Some of these programs \ncan be effective but often don't get the job done because many \nteenagers need to understand something about contraception and other \naspects of a comprehensive sex education program. Research has shown \nthat the most effective programs are the ones that encourage teenagers \nto delay sexual activity but also provide information on how they can \nprotect themselves. What is more, research shows that teenagers who \nreceive sex education which includes discussion of contraception are \nmore likely to delay sexual activity than those who receive abstinence-\nonly messages.\n  There was an interesting article in this Saturday's Wall Street \nJournal about a sex education program in Bamberg County, SC. The \narticle said:\n\n\n[[Page S8154]]\n\n\n       More than a quarter of the families--\n\n  In this county--\n\n     live below the poverty line. Nearly half have only one parent \n     living at home . . .\n       If ever there was a place to expect a wave of teen mothers, \n     it would be . . . among the flat farmlands of South \n     Carolina's Allendale and Bamberg Counties. Yet while teen \n     pregnancies are numerous on the Allendale side--\n\n  That is the other side of the county line--\n\n     adolescent girls on the Bamberg side have one of the lowest \n     pregnancy rates in the State. The county's rate has fallen \n     faster than the rate in most of the U.S.\n\n  It is a startling revelation because, again, this is a county where \nso many people are below the poverty line, where typically teenage \npregnancies occur, and in the neighboring county, which is better off, \nthey have a far greater number than does Bamberg County.\n  Why does that happen? This is an area which has had historically high \nteen pregnancy rates, but they decided to take bold action to improve \ntheir teen pregnancy prevention efforts. Bamberg County initiated a \ncomprehensive sex education program in 1982. Since that time, the \ncounty's teen pregnancy rate has fallen by nearly two-thirds. If our \nobjective here is to reduce abortions, then this is one exceptionally \neffective way to do it.\n  Adjacent to Bamberg County, as I said, is Allendale County which has \nsimilar demographics, but Allendale County has not taken a \ncomprehensive approach. Allendale restricts its programs to abstinence \nonly. What is the result? Allendale County's teen pregnancy rate is \nmore than twice as high as Bamberg's. In 2004, there were 24 \npregnancies per 1,000 girls between the ages of 10 and 19 in Bamberg \nCounty. In Allendale County, there were 54 pregnancies per 1,000--more \nthan twice the rate.\n  Abortion is a divisive issue, a tough issue, but we should all be \nable to agree that the best way or an effective way to reduce the \nnumber of abortions is to reduce the number of unwanted pregnancies, \nespecially among unwed teenage girls. And the proven way to reduce the \nnumber of teen pregnancies is to provide youth with comprehensive sex \neducation.\n  When it comes to our children, we should do everything within our \npower to protect them. We can and we must help America's young people \nto do better, to make better choices and have brighter futures.\n  So what we come down today is that this argument is not exclusively \nabout abortion because if that were the case, then we would be giving \ncomprehensive sex education wherever we have a young audience across \nthe country and not saying as a Government: OK, we will give you the \nmoney, but you can't talk about an effective way to stop a pregnancy; \nwe will not fund anything that tells you about contraception, about \nbirth control, about thinking about how you plan your family.\n  We are looking at raw politics here, Mr. President. What we are \nlooking at is a way to compel young people to go through with unwanted \npregnancies, and I think the way to stop that is to prevent these \npregnancies in the first place.\n  The way to prevent them is through knowledge.\n  I urge my colleagues to think this thing through thoroughly so we can \neffectively control the number of abortions that are done every year in \nthis society and not only think of the punishment we render by jailing \npeople who assist in helping young women get abortions, about \npenalizing families, about forcing young women who might have been \nvictims of incest to carry on and find subversive, secret ways to end \ntheir pregnancies. That is not the way to do it. The way to do it is to \npresent young people with knowledge about how they do not get \nthemselves in a position where they want to consider an abortion.\n  I hope my colleagues will think this problem through thoroughly as we \ndebate this issue and recognize that the alternative is strictly a \npunitive one and should not be dictated. I hope they will support this \namendment.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, the Democratic leader and the Republican \nleader had a unanimous consent agreement on this bill, and during that \ntime--the way the Senate operates--amendments were exchanged and \nlanguage was handed to each side. We were prepared to debate amendments \nbased on text we were given, and in a highly unusual move, the Senator \nfrom New Jersey has brought forward language that is different than \nwhat was provided to us in the unanimous consent agreement. At this \ntime, having to go through the amendment to see what all the \nconsequences of those differences are, I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, that time will be taken off my colleague's \ntime.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I have a parliamentary inquiry. I ask that \nthe quorum be suspended so I can make a parliamentary inquiry.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate is in a quorum call.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I ask unanimous consent and I would like to make a \nparliamentary inquiry.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Nevada for \ngetting through the process. It is not unusual for Senators to be \npermitted to modify their amendments. However, at this point I yield up \nto 15 minutes to my colleague from New Jersey.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I thank my distinguished senior Senator \nfrom New Jersey for yielding time and for his leadership on this issue.\n  I rise in opposition to the Child Custody Protection Act in support \nof a real solution to the problem of teen pregnancy. I don't support \nthe legislation because it is nothing more than a misguided election-\nyear ploy based on a false premise.\n  Instead of punishment, we should be focused on prevention. Instead of \nputting people in jail, we should be preventing teens from getting \npregnant in the first place. That is why I am joining my fellow Senator \nfrom New Jersey in offering a comprehensive approach to prevent teen \npregnancy. Our amendment will help prepare young people with the \nknowledge and skills to make responsible decisions and offer them an \nopportunity to succeed in life.\n  In a Senate filled with many different views on the right path for \nour country, it is refreshing to recognize we can all agree that we \nneed to reduce the number of teenage abortions. But there is still \ndisagreement about how to achieve that goal.\n  Many in this Senate believe the answer is to criminalize caring \nadults and threaten innocent youth. I cannot disagree more. The \nsolution to this problem does not lie in the courtroom but rather in \nour classrooms and afterschool programs.\n  Don't take my word for It. Look at this past weekend's Wall Street \nJournal--not a bastion of liberalism. In an article ``Winning the \nBattle on Teen Pregnancy'' the Wall Street Journal examines a \ncomprehensive sex education program in rural South Carolina and \ncompares two similar neighboring counties. One has a very intensive, \ncomprehensive sex education program, the other does not.\n  The findings show that between 1982 when the Teen Life Center Program \nbegan and 2004, the county's estimated pregnancy rate among girls age \n15 to 19 fell by nearly two-thirds, making its teen pregnancy rate \namong the lowest in the State. By contrast, the neighboring counties, \nwhich did not have such a program, had one of the highest teen \npregnancy rates in the State, about 2\\1/2\\ times their neighbor's rate.\n  The article cites Douglas Kirby, a sex education expert:\n\n       The Teen Life Center has played a major role over the years \n     in reducing teen pregnancy in the community it serves.\n\n\n[[Page S8155]]\n\n\n  Also:\n\n       I do think it's one of the most promising approaches.\n\n  He notes the program devotes an unusual amount of time in the regular \nschool curriculum to comprehensive sex education. As this case study \nshows, we clearly need to be putting more resources into preventing \nteen pregnancy, not punishing pregnant teens.\n  Rather than invest in proven programs such as the Teen Life Center, \nthe Bush administration continues to insist on a narrow-minded, \nmisguided approach of abstinence-only education. As this chart \ndemonstrates, abstinence only simply does not cut it. The Bush \nadministration invested almost $600 million for abstinence-only \neducation between 2001 and 2005. Not only did we not see a reduction in \nthe number of teens having sex, we actually saw a slight increase. What \na rate of return. With a rate of return like that, any reasonable \ninvestor would have already fired their investment adviser long ago. \nThe American taxpayers deserve a better rate of return on their \ninvestment, particularly one that is so critical on this subject.\n  The amendment Senator Lautenberg and I are offering takes a \ncomprehensive approach to preventing teen pregnancy by providing \nmedically and scientifically accurate sex education programs and \nfunding important afterschool programs--such as 21st Century Community \nLearning Centers, Trio, and GEAR UP, and the Carol White Physical \nEducation Program--that build life skills, put teens on a path to \ncollege, and ultimately help open the door of opportunity for young \npeople. And our amendment also includes a demonstration program to \nencourage new approaches to reducing teen pregnancy.\n\n  It is time to do something more than criminalize grandmothers, \ntrusted confidants, and clergy. It is time we do something to actually \nreduce the number of teen abortions. But, once again, the \nadministration and this Congress have demonstrated their misplaced \npriorities by bringing this bill to the floor instead of meaningful \nlegislation to prevent teen pregnancy.\n  Instead of debating comprehensive sex education, which is supported \noverwhelmingly by 94 percent of parents in our country, the Bush \nadministration has continued to pursue its unproven abstinence-only \nprograms, which have the support of only about 15 percent of parents. \nAnd instead of working in a bipartisan manner to prevent teen \npregnancy, the Senate leadership is continuing to pursue their \nmisguided proposal to limit the options for young women.\n  When the New Jersey Supreme Court struck down a law that would have \nrequired parental notification, they considered the effect that \nnotification laws have had on other States. Their conclusion was the \nsame as mine, and I quote:\n\n       [A] law mandating parental notification prior to an \n     abortion can neither mend nor create lines of communication \n     between parent and child.\n\n  For example, in Texas, a pregnant 16-year-old explained why she could \nnot tell her mother she was pregnant. She said:\n\n       My oldest sister got pregnant when she was 17. My mother \n     pushed her against the wall, slapped her across the face and \n     then grabbed her by the hair, pulled her through the living \n     room, out the front door and threw her off the porch. We \n     don't know where she is now.\n\n  Furthermore, the underlying bill does nothing to protect a young \nwoman whose father rapes her. Despite such a despicable violation, he \nwould still be allowed to make parental decisions on her behalf. \nInstead of punishing him, we would punish grandmothers or clergy who \nactually have to try to protect her from such an abusive relationship.\n  Now, these are horrible situations, but they are real life \nsituations, and by forcing a minor to ask an abusive, violent parent \nfor permission, we are only adding to the abuse.\n  Now, as a father of a beautiful and bright daughter and fabulous son, \nI would hope that my children would feel comfortable talking to me \nabout their serious life decisions. And because I am blessed to have a \ngreat, open relationship with my children, I believe they would be \ncomfortable bringing these issues to me. Unfortunately, our Government \ncannot legislate positive family relationships in every home, and not \nall families function like yours or mine. Sadly, not every parent can \nbe their daughter's best advocate.\n  Further, the New York Times analyzed six States that recently passed \nparental consent laws and discovered that these laws have done little \nto reduce the number of teen pregnancies or the number of abortions.\n  As a matter of fact, look at this chart. You can see that the United \nStates has the highest rate of teen pregnancy among all westernized \ndeveloped countries. Despite what you hear from the Bush administration \nand some of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, abstinence-\nonly programs and restrictions on a woman's right to choose are not the \nway to solve this problem. Clearly, we need a different direction.\n  Our amendment offers a real, proven solution to this problem--not \njust a hallowed, base-building effort. We need to make sure we are \nstanding up first and foremost for the health and safety of our \nchildren. The time has come to reduce the number of teen pregnancies, \nand thus teen abortions, in this country, and our commonsense amendment \nwill do just that.\n  We need to invest in our school, community, and faith-based \norganizations so they can teach scientifically and medically accurate \nfamily life education. We need programs that encourage teens to abstain \nfrom sexual activity. We need to educate young men and women about the \nresponsibilities and challenges associated with parenting. We need to \nencourage parents to communicate with their teens about sex. We need to \nteach young people how to make responsible decisions. And we need to \nfund afterschool programs that will enrich their education and replace \nunsupervised hours that can lead to destructive behavior with \nconstructive activities and positive role models.\n  We know afterschool programs reduce risky adolescent behavior. \nTeenage girls who play sports, for instance, are more likely to wait to \nbecome sexually active, which means they are less likely to become \npregnant.\n  We know teen pregnancy has serious consequences for young women, \ntheir children, and communities as a whole. Too-early childbearing \nincreases the likelihood that a young woman will drop out of high \nschool and that she and her child will live in poverty.\n\n  Unfortunately, this administration has done nothing to support these \ninitiatives that reduce the number of teen pregnancies. Instead, the \nadministration has brought a politically charged debate to the floor in \nthe name of politics, while the real solutions for our teenagers are \nbeing ignored.\n  Instead of preparing future generations with the important \ninformation they need to make responsible decisions, this \nadministration keeps young people in the dark about medically and \nscientifically accurate sex information.\n  Instead of funding important afterschool programs that will build \nlife skills and put teens on the road to college, this administration \nis shutting the door of opportunity on young people.\n  Instead of breaking the cycle of daughters of teen moms becoming teen \nmoms themselves, this administration has made it harder for young \nmothers to go back to school and raise their children.\n  Instead of ending the trend of sons of teen moms ending up in prison, \nthis administration has increased the number of unsupervised hours and \ndecreased the number of positive activities and role models in a teen's \nday.\n  Let's join together to recommit ourselves to continuing to decrease \nthe incidence of teen pregnancy and recommit ourselves to offering \nfamily life education and positive afterschool programs that will \nfoster responsible young adults and responsible decisions.\n  The time is now to invest in our teens. As all parents know, we place \noverwhelming pressure on ourselves to make sure we raise our children \nwell. The decisions we make--and they make--will affect them for the \nrest of their lives. We cannot afford to let the doors close on them. \nInstead, we must continue to open that door of opportunity.\n  I urge my colleagues to join us in supporting this important \namendment. We have an obligation to stand up and do the right thing. It \nis time to stop talking about putting people in jail,\n\n[[Page S8156]]\n\nand time to start creating real opportunities for future generations. \nThis amendment does that.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time and \nyield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nMassachusetts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, one of the principal obligations of \ngovernment should be to enable families to grow and prosper and bring \nnew life into the world. Our policies and our actions should be aimed \nat helping all families thrive in this great land of opportunity. \nSurely, we can agree that Congress should do all it can to help young \nwomen make choices that will help them be part of such thriving \nfamilies.\n  In this land that cherishes individual rights and liberties, a woman \nhas the constitutional right to make her own reproductive decisions, \nand I support that right. But abortion should be rare, as well as safe \nand legal. For that reason, being pro-choice also means helping women \nchoose whether to become pregnant and providing them with support so \nthey can make choices about their pregnancy that are not determined by \ntheir inability to afford or care for a child.\n  Congress and the administration can take a number of constructive \nsteps to enhance choice and help to reduce the number of abortions. \nUnfortunately, time and time again, this Republican Congress and this \nRepublican administration have turned their backs on women who need our \nhelp.\n  If Congress were serious about reducing abortions, we would be \nexpanding family planning. But the administration and the Republican \nCongress have refused to increase funding for these important programs.\n  A serious effort to create a true culture of life would also include \nproviding additional options to teenagers who become pregnant, such as \nby supporting adoption and foster care. But last year this Congress \nlimited the number of children eligible for foster care and reduced \nassistance to States for their foster care systems.\n  Another way to reduce abortions is to promise a pregnant teenager \nthat she and her child can rely upon some basic minimum of health care. \nFor a third of all mothers and babies in America, that means Medicaid. \nMedicaid also provides the prenatal and pediatric care that children \nneed to be healthy. But earlier this year, the administration proposed \n$13.5 billion in budget cuts to Medicaid.\n  A further source of help to young women who are pregnant is through \nthe maternal and child health services block grant, which serves 27 \nmillion women and children. Here, too, an administration that calls \nitself pro-life should be doing all it can to provide services to \ninfants. But the President's budget proposes only $693 million for a \nprogram that was funded at $730 million just 3 years ago.\n  If the administration wanted to reduce abortions, it would promise \nwomen that their infants will not go hungry. But President Bush has \nproposed cuts to the WIC Program that would reduce services across the \nprogram and cut out of the program entirely as many as 850,000 mothers \nand children.\n  Abortions would be rarer if young mothers could depend upon \nchildcare. This Congress has underfunded childcare by $10.9 billion. \nThe result is that 600,000 fewer children will have their childcare \nsubsidized.\n  In short, there are many constructive steps that Congress could take \ntoday to reduce teenage pregnancy and promote a true culture of life. \nInstead, the Republican leadership has decided to play politics with \nthe health of young women. The bill we are debating today does nothing \nto stand by young women in their time of need. It does nothing to \nprevent unwanted pregnancies. It does nothing to reduce abortions by \nletting women know that their infant will be fed, have good health \ncare, and be cared for. It does not even prevent minors from crossing \nState lines to obtain an abortion. Instead, it threatens prison time to \nanyone who helps them to do so, even if the person providing assistance \nis a compassionate grandparent or aunt or uncle or even a member of the \nclergy.\n\n  Congress ought to have higher priorities than turning grandparents \ninto criminals. I believe parental involvement is extremely important \nto teenagers' lives, and never more so than when a minor must make an \nextraordinarily difficult decision. But the Federal Criminal Code is \nnot the right tool to improve communication and trust between parents \nand their daughters.\n  Constructive steps that would actually work to make abortion rare are \ncontained in the Menendez-Lautenberg amendment on teenage pregnancy \nprevention. It calls for comprehensive sex education, not misleading \nabstinence-only programs. It increases the authorization for \nafterschool programs that encourage academic achievement, such as Trio, \nGEAR UP, and 21st Century Community Learning Centers that help keep \nteenage girls out of trouble. It increases funding for the Carol White \nProgram, which encourages young women to become involved in sports, \nsince we know that young women who participate in sports are far less \nlikely to become pregnant.\n  Why aren't we spending our time helping young women succeed instead \nof denying them help in their time of need? The answer is that real \nsolutions would unite us at a time when Republicans want to divide us.\n  I urge all of those who want to make abortion rare to rethink our \nshopworn slogans and pat answers. The way to foster a culture of life \nis not through a culture of war.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coleman). Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, we all agree that teenage pregnancy is a \nproblem in the United States. And there are various views on the best \nway to deal with teenage pregnancy and how to prevent it and lower the \nrate of teenage pregnancies.\n  The Lautenberg-Menendez amendment is an attempt to do that. I think \nit is a misguided attempt. Let me point out some of the problems that I \nthink are present in this amendment. Let's talk a little bit about what \nthe amendment does.\n  First, sex education decisions have long been left to parents and \nlocal communities. When communities offer sex education programs in \npublic schools, parents are typically heavily involved in deciding the \nscope of that education. Parental and local control of this issue is \nappropriate because the issues involved are uniquely related to \nparents' cultural, religious and moral values, and attitudes, as well \nas those of the community. The Menendez-Lautenberg amendment would send \n$100 million into localities in an effort to override the parents' and \nlocal community's decisions about how to raise their children. It is a \nprescriptive amendment about how these programs are to be set up.\n  These grants would require recipients to conduct sex education \nprograms and would prohibit the recipients from providing abstinence-\nonly education. All recipients of grant moneys would be required to \nteach children about all contraceptives, including condoms, the pill, \nand plan B emergency contraceptives. The amendment also reauthorizes \nand increases appropriations for a variety of other programs. I will \ntalk about that in a moment.\n  Under this amendment, none of the authorized moneys would be \navailable for programs focusing on abstinence only or for programs that \nrefuse to discuss controversial contraceptives such as plan B, which \nmany Americans view as an abortion pill.\n  There is a program out there called Best Friends. Under this program, \nteenagers are 6\\1/2\\ times less likely to have sex than their \ncounterparts, about two times less likely to drink alcohol than their \npeers, eight times less likely to use drugs, more than two times less \nlikely to smoke. Under this amendment, Best Friends would not qualify \nfor grant monies available through this amendment.\n  While the authors of this amendment have offered it in good faith it \nis misguided.\n  Dr. Coburn and I got to know each other very well, when we served in \nthe House together. He has been out there on the front lines, actually \ndelivering babies. He talks to a lot of young girls and boys about \ntheir involvement or lack of involvement in sexual activities when they \nare young.\n\n[[Page S8157]]\n\n  I yield Senator Coburn 10 minutes to speak on the bill and this \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, this is a philosophical debate. There are \ntwo questions we ought to ask ourselves: How many people think it is in \nthe best interests of our young people to be sexually active outside of \nmarriage? Is there anything positive that ever comes from that? Is \nthere positive self-esteem? Is there disease? Are there consequences to \nthe fact that when our young people make a decision to become sexually \nactive, almost always there is a negative downside?\n  Everybody in this body desires the best for our children. We desire \nthe best for one another's children. We desire the best for every \nchild. I have delivered over 4,000 babies. Most of those were Medicaid \nor teenage moms. I have been doing that for 23 years. I know the \nattitudes. I know what is going on. I can see.\n  I have also seen every complication that can come about when we take \nthe parents out of the loop, when we rationalize, well, if the parents \naren't going to do it, the Government is going to do it for them. What \nwe do is divide. We make division between children and parents. We do \nsomething out in the dark.\n  I will never forget, I was in Stigler, OK, a small community. A \nfarmer comes in there crying, with a bag in his hand. This was when I \nwas a Congressman. He said: Congressman, how did this happen? My 13-\nyear-old last night came home from the health department. She went with \na friend. She came home from the health department with contraceptives \nand condoms, oral contraceptives and condoms. He said: How is it that I \ncan pay my taxes and I am undermined by the local health department in \nwhat my child gets? She wasn't even going for her as an appointment. \nBut she is sold on the fact that she needs to do this. She had good \nenough training that she came to her parents with that and said: Here \nis what happened to me.\n  The point is, as a practicing physician, I use every tool I can with \nyoung women to make sure they are well informed. But there is a tipping \npoint about what the best medical advice is. This is debatable. But I \nwould tell you the best medical advice we could give our young men and \nwomen, the best absolute medical advice is to stay abstinent until you \nare in a married relationship. Everybody in this body probably agrees \nwith that.\n  If that is true, if risk avoidance is the best message, why do we \nturn around and give 1200 percent more money to risk reduction than we \ndo risk avoidance? For every dollar we spend on abstinence education, \nwe spend $12 on teaching people how to lower the risk. What is the \nmessage we are sending with that? We are going to spend $600 million \nthis year on what this amendment does already. That is what we are \ngoing to spend. If you add up everything associated with this \namendment, we are going to spend another $600 million. First, where are \nwe going to get the money? We don't have it so we are going to borrow \nit from the very children we say we want to protect to do this.\n  No. 2, we are winning the war in this country on teenage pregnancy. \nWe are winning the war. We have the highest level of virgin 16-year-\nolds we have had in 30 years in this country, both men and women, both \ngirls and boys. I don't know if 1200 percent more of that is because we \nhave comprehensive sex education or whether 100 percent of it is \nbecause of abstinence. I don't know that. But what I do know is, I am \nnot going to vote for anything that destroys relationships as I have \nseen in my practice for young women for years.\n\n  Does that mean somebody who can't get available maternal child health \nshould be denied it? No. Does that mean somebody who seeks out the \nright guidance should be denied it? No. This isn't a debate about not \ndoing what we are already doing. We are already doing it. The question \nis, should we do more? Should we penalize the best medical advice that \nis out there, which is to abstain? The consequences of that would be \ndisastrous.\n  The moral rationalization is if you make a mistake, there are no \nconsequences. I have seen the consequences. Condoms on teenagers work \nabout 50 percent of the time, if you add up all the studies. The STD \nrate for teenagers, even when used perfectly, for human papilloma virus \nis still 38 percent, the No. 1 cause of cervical cancer. We can \nrationalize our moral principle away or we can say: Here is where we \nshould go. We are not talking about changing anything.\n  The President was widely attacked that he hadn't increased moneys for \nall this. We don't have money to increase anything in this country. We \nare fighting a war. We have had Katrina. We are running a $350 billion \ndeficit. We don't have money. So if we are going to do this, what \nprogram are we going to cut? Or are we going to offer another $600 \nmillion? By the way, the title X program hasn't been authorized in 16 \nyears and we are still appropriating moneys.\n  There is a difference in philosophy. It doesn't mean I am right or \nwrong. It doesn't mean those who oppose me are wrong or right. But what \nI have seen from experience is when we honor virtue, when we mentor \nintegrity, when we encourage the right choices, what we get is right \nchoices, honor, and integrity. When we rationalize the consequences of \nviolating principles that are for a healthy productive life, we get a \nconsumption of errors.\n  I have so many stories I would love for this body and the American \npeople to know about the people I have cared for, the consequences of \nwhen we rationalize a moral principle of being pure until you are in a \nmarried relationship. Is that prudish? Does it happen? It happens a lot \nmore than we give credit for.\n  The question we ought to ask ourselves is, would it happen more if we \nset the example, if we didn't glorify the other position, if we didn't \nrationalize the position?\n  I am opposed to the amendment on three grounds. One, we are already \nspending a ton of money on comprehensive sex education. I am not \nopposed to that. I teach condoms. I teach barrier methods. I also teach \nthe consequences and the failure rates. I teach the consequences of \noral contraceptives. We only have about 10 kids a year die in this \ncountry because they are given birth control pills that the parent \ndidn't even know about and they have a thromboembolic event because \nthere is a family history that was never related. So it is OK to \nsacrifice those 10 young girls because we didn't want their parents, \nwho could have made a decision, to know. We could have done that, but \nwe are not going to do that. We are going to rationalize the behavior \nof something that is not as good for our children, that is not the best \nmedical advice, and we are going to sacrifice those lives. I am going \nto oppose it because we are already doing it, No. 1.\n  No. 2, we already have a markedly distorted ratio against the best \nmedical advice on which we all agree, the best thing our kids could do \nis not be sexually active outside of a monogamous, long-term \nrelationship. We all agree to that. There is not anybody who disagrees \nwith that.\n  And finally, why is it here? Why is it on this bill? It is because we \ndon't want this bill. Some of us don't want this bill to pass.\n  I will relate to you a story about a gal. I will call her Julie \nbecause I can't mention her name. Julie is dead. Julie was 16 years of \nage. Her parents didn't know she had a termination to her pregnancy. \nWhen I saw her in the ER at 2 o'clock in the morning, she had a fever \nand a little bit of bleeding. She had a botched abortion with an \ninfection developed, what is called disseminated intravascular \ncoagulation. And basically 3 days later, despite all the heroic events, \nshe died. Why did she die? She died because we separated the choices \nthat she made from her parents without their involvement. Would she \nhave died if somebody had cared to know what her immediate post-op \nfollowup condition was? No. Had she had intervention earlier, would she \nhave died? No. Her parents will never get over the fact that they \nweren't there. They blame themselves.\n  I oppose this amendment and hope other Members will do so as well.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I yield 8 minutes to my colleague from \nNew York State.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n\n[[Page S8158]]\n\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I have great deal of respect for the \nexperience of my colleague from Oklahoma. I believe he has served his \npatients in a conscientious, caring manner for all those 20-plus years \nhe has been practicing medicine as an OB/GYN. He comes to the floor \nwith his own experience. It is entitled to great weight because it is \nhis experience. He has very passionately set forth his strong beliefs. \nI come from a different perspective. I have been a lawyer for a number \nof years. I was a law professor running a legal aid clinic at the \nUniversity of Arkansas in Fayetteville not far from the Oklahoma border \nwhen one day in my office I got a call from one of the local judges \ntelling me he had assigned me to a case. That was pretty common.\n  I said: Judge, what kind of case is it?\n  He said: Well, I want you to represent this man who has been accused \nof raping a 12-year-old girl he is related to.\n  I said: Judge, I don't really want to do that.\n  He said: Professor, you are going to do it because I am signing the \norder right now.\n  So I did. I got into the details of this sordid crime and how this \nman who was related to this family had abused this child. And the \nfamily, to be charitable, wasn't really all that attentive or caring. \nThey were people of very modest means. They lived a pretty disorganized \nlife, and they didn't watch out for their children. There wasn't what \nwe would call the kind of relationship and dialog and discussion that \nevery one of us wants to have with our own children and would hope to \nnurture in others.\n  So I did my duty and I represented this man. But I often wondered \nabout that little 12-year-old girl. About a year later, my phone rings \nagain. This time, it is the prosecuting attorney. He said: Well, \nProfessor, we have another case for you.\n  I said: I have done my part.\n  He said: We need you. We want you to represent a father who is \naccused of impregnating both of his daughters. The older daughter has \nhad her baby and she is about 14. The younger daughter is now pregnant. \nThe older daughter has come to us and said that it was the father, and \nshe is desperate for us to take her younger sister away from this \nenvironment.\n  I said: You know, Mr. Prosecutor, find somebody else to do this.\n  He said: Well, you did such a good job in that bad case last year, we \njust need you to do this.\n  I said: I really don't want to do it.\n  He said: Well, I am having the judge sign the order.\n  I got deeply into the family dynamics of this perverse, incestuous \nfamily. I met the 14-year-old who already had a baby, and I met the 12-\nyear-old who was now pregnant with her father's baby. And my heart just \nbroke. Who was that child supposed to talk to? Where was that child \nsupposed to go? The sister was trying to help her younger sister. If \nshe had a driver's license, she might have driven her to where she \ncould have gotten medical care.\n  A couple years later, I was practicing law in Little Rock, and \nArkansas had a parental consent law with a judicial bypass. People were \ncalled by judges whenever this occurred and were asked to come and \nrepresent the young girl who was appearing before the court. I got \ncalled one day, as I was on the list as a practicing lawyer. So I went \nand met my client, a 15-year-old girl. She had been raped by her \nmother's boyfriend and was pregnant. Her mother could have cared less. \nMaybe her mother should have cared. Lord knows, I wish she had cared. \nBut she didn't want to disrupt the relationship with the boyfriend. So \nthe girl needed to come to court and get a judge to give her permission \nbecause there was no parent. There may have been a biological parent, \nbut there wasn't a parent in any sense of the word other than biology.\n  By that time, I had my own daughter and I thought, what a tragedy. \nYou know, life isn't always the way we wish it would be. Sometimes \ntragedies happen and sometimes families are not just negligent but \nabusive. Sometimes young girls are taken advantage of by members of \ntheir family, people in whom they should be able to trust.\n  So I just have to say that when we talk about experience, we can all \nbring experience to the floor of the Senate. We can talk about the many \ninstances where things worked out, parents did do the right thing; they \ngave their children the right values, gave them the appropriate \neducation to know how to take care of themselves, to respect \nthemselves. But I have lived long enough to know that is not everybody. \nI wish it were. But in the meantime, we are going to sacrifice a lot of \ngirls' lives. I think that is unfortunate, to say the least.\n  We now know, because we have research to prove it, what works. We \nknow that in South Carolina--for example, in a Wall Street Journal \narticle recently was a story about small, impoverished towns that had a \nhigh rate of teenage pregnancy, and they decided they wanted to do \nsomething and they got help. They had one-on-one coaching sessions for \nparents who would come and participate. They preached abstinence, but \nthey also taught about contraception and they made it clear what they \nwanted their children to do, how they expected them to behave to try to \nprevent irresponsible sexual activity and pregnancy. They tried to make \nboth the young women and the young men accept responsibility for their \nactions.\n  I know, too, in my State, we have a lot of grandmothers and aunts who \nare raising children. The Child Custody Protection Act would put any \nfamily member--a sister, aunt, or grandmother--in jail for helping a \nteenager deal with one of the most difficult decisions that any person \nhas to make. I don't believe that these young women should make those \ndecisions alone. Certainly, we are complicating the lives of everyone \ninstead of doing our duty as parents, as family members, and as \nleaders, which is to inculcate and pass on values but to recognize that \nreality is messy. I have championed kinship care, and I know how many \ngrandparents are raising children, and I know from my own personal \nexperience how many older relatives who are faced with very difficult \nsituations would be criminalized if they tried to reach out and help a \nyoung girl who asked them for that kind of assistance.\n  The Child Custody Protection Act, while seeking to criminalize what a \nteenager does once she is pregnant, fails to address the issue of teen \npregnancy in this country, the root of the problem.\n  To address only how teenagers should behave once they become pregnant \nwithout any resources on the front end to prevent a pregnancy is \nshortsighted, to say the least.\n  One of the most important initiatives I worked on as First Lady and \nam proud to continue to champion in the Senate is the prevention of \nteen pregnancy.\n  In 1996, we worked with the National Campaign To Prevent Teen \nPregnancy to set a goal to reduce teen pregnancy by one-third within a \ndecade, and I am proud to say that we met that goal.\n  But we did not do it overnight. We invested over a period of time. We \ninvested in different programs and initiatives, recognizing that this \nissue could not be solved with a one size fits all approach. And \naccording to the National Campaign To Prevent Teen Pregnancy, between \n1991 and 2004, the teen birth rate fell 33 percent to a record low for \nthose aged 15 to 19.\n  And while we are all pleased that the teen pregnancy rate has dropped \nsince 1991--as I am that in my home State of New York, it's come down a \nfull 10 percent--we also recognize that this is just a drop in bucket \nif we are truly going to get to the root of the problem and eliminate \npregnancy among girls and boys who are far too often too young and \nunprepared, emotionally and financially, to be mothers and fathers.\n  Sadly, even with this decrease, the United States continues to have \nthe highest rate of teen pregnancy and births in the Western \nindustrialized world.\n  Today, 34 percent of young women become pregnant at least once before \nthey reach the age of 20, and that results in about 820,000 teen \npregnancies a year. Eight in ten of these pregnancies are unintended.\n  We also have an overwhelming body of evidence about the repercussions \nof teen parenting. Children born to teen moms begin life with the odds \nagainst them; they are more likely to be born\n\n[[Page S8159]]\n\na low birth weight baby, which is connected to a host of long-term \nhealth problems.\n  They are 50 percent more likely to repeat a grade and significantly \nmore likely to be victims of abuse and neglect.\n  In addition, girls who give birth as teenagers face a long, uphill \nbattle to economic self-sufficiency and self-esteem, with only 32 \npercent of teenage mothers who begin their families before age 18 ever \ncompleting high school.\n  For all these reasons, I urge my colleagues to support the \nLautenberg-Menendez amendment that seeks to increase funding to \ncritical programs that are helping to decrease teen pregnancy in our \ncountry.\n  Last week, CNN highlighted in a story what research has consistently \nshown: Teenagers who receive comprehensive sex education that includes \ndiscussion of contraception are more likely than those who receive \nabstinence-only messages to delay sexual activity and to use \ncontraceptives when they do become sexually active.\n  And this past Saturday, a Wall Street Journal article featured how \nsmall, impoverished towns in South Carolina are showing the lowest teen \npregnancy rates in the country. Both places owe their success to \ncomprehensive sex education. From one-on-one coaching sessions for \nparents and teens to teaching about contraception, the towns are \nproactive in making kids more aware of the dangers that are out there \nif they don't practice safe sex.\n  This further reinforces the need to implement policies that support \nand educate young women about all of the facts, so that they do not \nbecome pregnant in the first place.\n  Teenagers need to be educated that abstinence is the best defense \nagainst an unwanted pregnancy, and they also need to be educated and \nencouraged to exercise cautious decisions about sex.\n  We should not have a cookie cutter approach to preventing teen \npregnancy. In instances where young people are sexually active and are \nlikely to remain so, we need to ensure that they are encouraged to use \ncontraception consistently and carefully.\n  As policymakers, we need to recognize what works and what doesn't \nwork, and to be fair, the jury is still out on the effectiveness of \nabstinence-only programs. I don't think this debate should be about \nideology. It should be about facts and evidence. We have to deal with \nthe choices young people make, not just the choice we wish they would \nmake. We should use all the resources at our disposal to ensure that \nteens are getting the information they need to make the right decision \nand that we remain a part of the solution by supporting programs and \npolicies that deal with all the layers of this issue, not just a one \nsize fits all approach.\n\n  Sadly, instead of putting resources into this important fight to \nprevent teen pregnancy, we are adding more penalties for those who try \nto help teens during their time of crisis.\n  The Child Custody Protection Act would put any family member--a \nsister, aunt, grandmother--in jail for helping a teen cross State lines \nto obtain an abortion.\n  I don't believe that any young woman should have to make this \ndecision alone. Research actually shows that in most cases, young women \nalready involve one or both parents when faced with an unintended \npregnancy, without being required to do so by law. But, tragically, not \nevery family is perfect. There are some instances in which a young \nwoman simply cannot involve her parents, including rape, violence or \nincest; and for some in this body to pretend that those instances \nshould not be considered in this debate is unconscionable. The Child \nCustody Protection Act glosses over these complicated situations, \nmaking criminals out of grandparents, clergy and other adults who try \nto act in good faith.\n  Instead of criminalizing other caring adults in a teenager's life, we \nshould do more to educate and involve parents about the critical role \nthey can play in encouraging their children to abstain from sexual \nactivity. Teenagers who have strong emotional attachments to their \nparents are much less likely to become sexually active at an early age.\n  I am disappointed that this bill does not provide any exemptions for \nadult relatives or clergy who seek to provide guidance and support to \nyoung women seeking abortions.\n  In the Senate, I have championed the Kinship Care Act which supports \nthe many family members in New York and in America who are raising \nchildren who would otherwise be in the foster care system.\n  The reality is, not every child is fortunate enough to be raised by \ntheir biological parents. Nationwide, more than six million children--1 \nin 12 children--are living in households headed by grandparents. In \nNew York City alone, there are over 245,000 adolescents already living \nin grandparent households.\n\n  It's important to note that for many families, but these families in \nparticular, the legal guardian who has physical custody and who \nprovides a young woman with support and guidance are not one in the \nsame.\n  This bill fails to acknowledge the importance of close family members \nsuch as grandmothers and aunts, who often raise their relatives or play \na significant role in their lives.\n  In doing so, this bill creates a strong incentive for young women to \nseek risky alternatives she wouldn't have considered if permitted to \nseek counsel from her family and community. Major medical and public-\nhealth organizations, including the American Medical Association, the \nAmerican Academy of Pediatrics and the American Public Health \nAssociation oppose governmental parental-involvement laws because of \nthe risk to women's health.\n  While we all hope that young women will involve their parents in \nthese decisions, mandating parental consent has the serious potential \nto do more harm than good. In fact, during congressional testimony, Dr. \nWarren Seigel, an expert in adolescent medicine, stated that \nlegislation mandating parental involvement ``represents bad medicine \nand places politics before the health of our youth.''\n  The Child Custody Protection Act is a reflection of the misdirected \npriorities out there when it comes to truly doing something about \nunintended pregnancy. Rather than criminalizing family members and \nclergy who are trying to provide guidance to these young women in \ncrisis, we should be working to reduce the rate of teen pregnancy in \nthis country. There are far better ways to prevent pregnancy than \nputting people in jail. We could start by supporting family planning \nservices and making sure we're providing medically accurate information \nin sex education classes that includes contraception.\n  That is why my good friend Harry Reid and I have long championed the \nPrevention First Act here in the Senate which, among other important \nmeasures, ensures that Government-funded sex education programs provide \nmedically accurate information about contraception.\n  And that is also why I rise today to encourage all of my colleagues \nto support the Lautenberg-Menendez amendment because we need policies \nthat support and educate our young women about the importance of \nprevention now more than ever.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, just a quick response to our colleague \nand friend from Oklahoma. The fact is, there are certainly different \nviews than this well-trained physician offered on the floor of the \nSenate. Parents all across the country--some 90 percent of the parents \nof high school students--insist that they would prefer to have \ncomprehensive sex education available for their children.\n  The fact that this country of ours doesn't permit anything except \nabstinence only until marriage to be taught is outrageous. Where is the \nfairness? Where is the equity?\n  In New Jersey, we have a different view about people's choice than \nthey do in Oklahoma. That doesn't mean that Oklahoma is totally wrong \nor that New Jersey is totally right. But the fact is, it is not sinful \nconduct and we ought to encourage people to give the young women a full \nunderstanding about sex education so they know there are alternatives \nto exposing themselves to an unwanted pregnancy.\n  It is outrageous that we want to close down the minds and \nopportunities for people to make a choice about what they do with their \nhealth and with their families.\n\n[[Page S8160]]\n\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada is recognized.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I would like to make a few very brief \nremarks in relation to this particular amendment. There is one term \nused in this amendment that is of particular concern. The proponents \nsay that they want a ``teen-driven'' approach to sex education. This is \none of the things they want to encourage. I don't know about what kind \nof teenagers the rest of my colleagues were when they were teenagers, \nbut when I was a teenager and if such a program was driven by me, that \ntype of sex education program would look a lot different than one that \nwould be driven by me as an adult and as a parent. I think focusing \nsuch a program in a manner that is ``teen-driven'' is just asking for \nproblems, as far as what kind of mindset we want our sex education \nprograms to contain. It is a minor example of a problem that is in this \nparticular amendment.\n  Mr. President, because we don't know how much debate we are going to \nhave on the underlying bill, I will talk for a couple minutes about the \nbill itself. First, I want to respond to something Senator Clinton said \nwhen she spoke of the two sisters who were both raped by their father. \nThat is a horrible, unimaginable situation. I applaud Senator Clinton \nfor her efforts in that family situation. The Senator talked about the \nolder sister who wanted to help the younger sister because the older \nsister, had herself, been impregnated. Senator Clinton had said the \nolder sister would have gotten in trouble if she would have gone across \nState lines to help her younger sister obtain an abortion.\n  What Senator Clinton pointed out is the exact purpose of this bill. \nThe older sister had to get the judiciary involved to remove her sister \nfrom the abusive situation. Guess what. If the older sister would have \ntaken her sister across State lines for an abortion, the legal \nauthorities never would have been involved to take the child out of the \nabusive situation, and the younger sister would have been returned to \nan unsafe home where she would have been subjected to continued sexual \nabuse.\n  That is the whole point of this legislation, Mr. President. The \njudicial bypass for parental consent or notification that is required \nin most States is the only instances in which this bill actually \napplies. So the bill, I believe, would be consistent with what I \nunderstand that Senator Clinton wanted for this girl: to get her out of \nan abusive situation.\n  Mr. President, will the Chair remind me when I have 5 minutes \nremaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, incest is a terrible act, a terrible \ncrime. We should not be protecting the people who perpetrate these \ncrimes. But at the same time, if there is incest involved we, as a \nsociety, must take steps to protect the young victims. Imagine a young \ngirl who has had this terrible act committed against her and now \nsomebody else with good intentions wants to take her across State lines \nto get an abortion. There are several problems raised by this scenario. \nIf the judiciary can be involved, at least some of these crimes can be \naddressed. But if the crime remains secret from the parents and there \nis no judiciary involved, this girl will be forced to just goes back \nhome, with the abortion hidden, to face continued victimization. The \nsecond concern that I have relates to the potential medical \nconsequences that a young girl might face following an abortion. She \nmight encounter a postsurgical infection, or complications if the \nabortion is performed with inaccurate or an incomplete medical history \nof the young girl, like administering some kind of medication or \nanesthesia to which the girl has an allergy. The young girls parents \nmay not know to watch for postsurgical complications. Each of these \nmedical concerns become life threatening when friends or a member of \nthe clergy are involved rather than the young girl's parents or the \nauthorities.\n  That is why I think some of the amendments coming up are ill-\nconceived and why this bill is so important to enact. I hope that as \nthis debate goes forward we can bring out more of these points. I know \nthe leaders are trying to work out differences right now.\n  I yield whatever time is remaining on this amendment to the Senator \nfrom South Carolina, Mr. DeMint.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina is recognized.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I come to the floor today proud that \nRepublicans are working to build a future of hope, by securing our \nhomeland, securing our prosperity, and securing our values.\n  I believe today's debate over the Child Custody Protection Act cuts \nto the heart of who we are as a people. The ideas this bill is built \non--preserving life, protecting our children, and upholding the rule of \nlaw--have defined the American character and shaped our society for \nover 200 years. Our commitment to protecting the most vulnerable among \nus is the surest test of our shared values and the key to our hope for \na better future for our children and grandchildren.\n  There are very few who would disagree that the teenage years are a \nvulnerable and formative time of life. Peer pressure and the anxiety it \ncan bring are sometimes overwhelming. From decisions about where to \nattend college, or to understand the negative impacts of things like \ndrug and alcohol abuse, parental communication and support are vitally \nimportant as these young people make these decisions that will \ndetermine the course of the rest of their lives. Parents need to be \ninvolved. So it puzzles me that those who oppose this bill would \nessentially give a green light to those who would circumvent State laws \nand rob parents of the chance to give their young daughters the \nphysical care and the psychological support they so desperately need.\n\n  Those who oppose this legislation claim that it would endanger teens \nfacing truly abusive parents. So they want to strip the overwhelming \nmajority of good parents of their rightful role and responsibility \nbecause of the misbehavior of a few.\n  Let's be clear: No one wants to place these vulnerable girls, many of \nwhom have already been victimized by older men, into a situation that \ncreates more fear than they are already experiencing. That is why \nStates have built careful safeguards into their laws to provide \nrecourse to those who have genuine reasons to fear an abusive parent.\n  I can imagine that the thought of facing any parent, no matter how \nloving, with the news of an unplanned pregnancy is a scary thing. But \nas a father of two daughters, I believe I speak for most parents in \nsaying that the health and well-being of my girls is more precious to \nme than anything else in the world. Much worse than hearing of a \npregnancy would be the news that a daughter was suffering from \ninfertility or any of the other severe medical and emotional \ncomplications often associated with abortion--complications that, in \nmany cases, might not be caught until it was too late if the parent was \nunaware of the procedure.\n  Other critics argue that this bill would add complicated consent \nregulations or that it would somehow be unconstitutional. Nothing could \nbe further from the truth. This legislation does nothing to override \nexisting State laws or enforce any kind of Federal mandate on States. \nIt simply strengthens the idea that the will of the people of each \nState, as expressed by their elected State officials, should not be \ncircumvented for major surgical procedures that have such profound \nmoral and medical implications. Furthermore, this bill is designed to \nuphold only those State laws which have been drafted carefully enough \nto pass constitutional muster.\n  I am disappointed that this legislation has only attracted one \nDemocratic cosponsor, but I am hopeful that my Democratic colleagues \nwill not cave to pressure from the well-funded, profit-driven abortion \nindustry, which includes Planned Parenthood and its lobbyist allies at \nEmily's List and NARAL. While they may provide significant sources of \ncampaign funds, no amount of money can justify their ``abortion at any \ncost'' mentality, especially when that cost is the health and well-\nbeing of teenage girls and the rights of parents who most want to \nprotect them.\n  An overwhelming majority of Americans understands that taking a minor \nacross State lines to obtain an abortion without her parents' knowledge \nis\n\n[[Page S8161]]\n\nnot consistent with our shared values. The Child Custody Protection Act \nis a well-crafted, balanced piece of legislation, and I urge my \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle to join the American people in \nsupporting it. It is an important step toward protecting our families, \nsecuring our values, and building hope for a better future for all \nAmericans.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of the time.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the vote in \nrelation to the Lautenberg amendment No. 4689 be at 4:05 p.m., with the \nremaining time between now and then equally divided between the \nproponents and opponents of this bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, have the yeas and nays been ordered?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. They have not been ordered.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Nevada.\n  There is a lot of interest in this bill. People want to do something \nfor our young people. People want to avoid these horrible situations. \nMy friend cited the case of a young woman who was raped by her father, \nyet in this bill, the father retains all rights to take her over a \nState line. Can you imagine, to sign a parental consent form, a father \nwho raped his daughter? So we want to correct these problems.\n  I yield 5 minutes to Senator Patty Murray and then 2\\1/2\\ minutes to \nSenator Lautenberg at the close of the debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator only has 5 minutes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I was told we have until 5 after, equally \ndivided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank the Chair. It is the first time all day I have \nbeen correct.\n  I yield to Senator Murray 5 minutes and then, at the end of the \ndebate, Senator Lautenberg for 2\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the so-called \nChild Custody Protection Act. This is yet another one of those divisive \nbills with a deceptive title and a dangerous impact on women.\n  Today, many Americans are upset about the direction in which our \ncountry is moving. One would think that the Republican majority would \nfinally start addressing the real issues that affect working families \nevery day--issues such as access to healthcare, high energy prices, \nfixing the prescription drug program, and protecting our ports.\n  But instead, we are seeing yet another debate on election year \ngimmick. Last month, Republicans rolled out a constitutional amendment \non gay marriage just so they could energize their base. Then they \nbrought up a constitutional amendment on flag burning. Now we have a \ndivisive bill that threatens the health of women and undermines our \nrights.\n  It is no wonder that Americans are so frustrated with the Republican \nmajority.\n  Today families are facing real challenges, and once again, what we \nsee here is the Republican leadership is playing election year games. \nTo me, this is just the latest example of how Republicans have the \nwrong priorities.\n  With a war overseas, painful cuts to education at home, veterans \nbeing denied healthcare, soaring energy costs, and mounting debt, the \nRepublican majority is saying this is the most important issue we could \nbe debating today.\n  They should stop wasting time on divisive election year politics and \nstart focusing on the real challenges facing the American people.\n  We should be talking about pressing needs, not a dangerous and \nmisguided bill that threatens the health of our Nation's young women.\n  Today's debate comes in the context of a series of attacks on women's \nrights.\n  Since 1994, we have seen a consistent and aggressive effort in \nCongress to limit a woman's right to choose.\n  There have been more than 170 antichoice votes taken in Congress \nsince 1994. This bill follows that troubling pattern.\n  The legislation is not about protecting young women, or improving \ncommunication within families, or stopping sexual predators.\n  Instead, it is just another attempt by Republicans to chip away at a \nwoman's right to safe and legal reproductive health care.\n  Let me turn to the substance of the bill.\n  This legislation could criminalize a grandparent, aunt, or adult \nsibling, for responding to a request for help from a young woman in a \ncrisis pregnancy situation.\n  If any of these caring adults accompany a young woman across State \nlines to obtain reproductive health services, and the woman's home \nState has a parental-involvement law, then those caring adults could be \ncriminally prosecuted.\n  Today, an amendment will be offered to exempt grandparents and clergy \nfrom this onerous bill. It is the least we can do to minimize the harm \nof this legislation.\n  But this law doesn't stop at turning caring adults into criminals. It \nwould also criminalize anyone who transports a pregnant minor across \nany State line.\n  Imagine a young woman living in a rural area with no reproductive \nhealth service providers and the nearest facility is in a large city \njust over the State line. If that young woman boards a bus or takes a \ntaxi to the city to get an abortion, the person who drives her could be \ncriminally liable under this law and sued by the parents.\n  I think we all agree that a young woman facing a crisis pregnancy \nshould be encouraged to talk to her parents. According to a study by \nStanley Henshaw and Kathryn Kost, in the vast majority of these \nsituations, the young woman does involve her parents. But tragically, \nin situations where women don't tell their parents, one-third of the \nyoung women are victims of abuse.\n  In an ideal world, every young woman would take to her parents, but \nwe don't live in an ideal world.\n  The reality is that a young woman cannot always turn to a parent. We \nare not talking about a young woman who is afraid her parents will be \nashamed or shun her. We are talking about serious situations where the \nyoung woman may be a victim of incest or abuse.\n  A young woman who has an abusive home situation often accurately \npredicts the danger of telling a parent about a pregnancy. This bill \nwould punish those young women if they seek the support and help of \nother family members or clergy.\n  We live in a time when we have a lot of families who don't fit the \ntraditional two-parent model. More and more grandparents are raising \ntheir grandchildren. Divorced parents are getting remarried, and young \nwomen can develop close relationships with their stepparents.\n  In these families, the caring adult who is responsible for the day-\nto-day care of a young woman would be criminally liable and could even \nbe sued by an absentee parent.\n  We also know that some young women have no other alternative but to \ngo to another State to obtain reproductive health services. Access to \nthese services all across our country is severely limited--87 percent \nof counties have no providers.\n  There are States, such as Mississippi, that have only one provider. \nOur laws should reflect the reality that for some women, these services \ncannot be found locally.\n  Unfortunately, the only thing this bill does do is ensure that young \nwomen who are intent on seeking reproductive health services ``go it \nalone.''\n  If a young woman thinks that bringing a caring adult or supportive \nfriend will get that person in trouble, she will make the trip on her \nown.\n  You wouldn't want your children to drive home from the hospital after \nhaving surgery, but this legislation will result in young women driving \nthemselves after having a medical procedure.\n  How can my colleagues say that this bill is about the safety of young \nwomen when it actually endangers them more?\n\n[[Page S8162]]\n\n  Proponents claim that the ``judicial bypass procedure'' is an \nadequate protection for young women who feel they can't involve their \nparents. That is not the case.\n  A young woman would have to go to a courthouse, get a hearing, tell \nthe judge and anyone else in the courtroom her situation, and wait for \na judge to rule.\n  Now imagine that this happens in a small town where the judge is \nfriends with her parents. Whether it is a big city or a small town, a \nyoung woman who has never been to court could find the whole process \nintimidating and overwhelming.\n  This bill doesn't even have an exception to protect the health of \nyoung women. That raises huge constitutional questions.\n  Since Roe v. Wade, every constitutional Federal law restricting a \nwoman's right to choice has contained a health exception, and many laws \nhave been struck down because they lack one.\n  Should we really be saying that a young woman's health does not count \nwhen she faces a crisis pregnancy?\n  Is this Senate ready to tell young women that their health and safety \ndo not matter?\n  This bill doesn't care about a young woman's health--and it barely \neven cares about her life. That is because the bill's exception for a \nlife-threatening situation is very narrow and very limited.\n  In addition, according to experts who have studied it, this bill \ncould effectively nullify the laws of States that allow physicians to \nprovide confidential medical services to minors, such as my home State \nof Washington.\n  The people of my State have twice affirmed a woman's right to choose. \nThat is the settled position of our State. This bill could reach into \nmy home State and effectively eliminate those protections.\n  No matter how one feels about this bill, I think everyone should be \nconcerned that Federal intervention could undermine the ability of \nStates to set their own laws on this difficult subject.\n  The House version goes even further, potentially making criminals out \nof Washington State physicians who follow the laws of Washington State.\n  Proponents of this bill claim that it is needed to prevent sexual \npredators from taking pregnant young women across State lines to obtain \nreproductive health services against their will. But that is not how \nthe bill is written.\n  If it were truly meant to prevent sexual predators from harming young \nwomen, why would it criminally prosecute a young woman's family \nmembers, including grandparents, aunts, or adult siblings? Why is the \nscope of this bill so broad that it includes clergy members and even \nunknowing taxi drivers?\n  Every one of us wants to reduce the numbers of abortions that occur.\n  Instead of forcing the Government deeper into sensitive and personal \nfamily relationships, we should focus on preventing teen pregnancies.\n  Mr. President, to summarize, across the country today, Americans are \nvery worried about what is going on, whether it is access to health \ncare, high energy prices, prescription drug programs, or protecting our \nNation's security. But instead what we are seeing this afternoon is an \nelection year gimmick.\n  Last year, we saw a constitutional amendment on gay marriage to \nenergize their base, and then they brought up a constitutional \namendment on flag burning, and now we are having a debate, instead of \non the issues which are on the front burner for every American family, \nabout the health of women and how we are going to undermine their \nrights. I find that very sad.\n  Let me talk a few minutes about the substance of this bill. As my \ncolleague from California said, this is a bill which is going to \ncriminalize a grandparent or an aunt or an adult sibling for simply \nresponding to a request for help from a young woman who is in a crisis \npregnancy situation. We will see later an amendment to exempt \ngrandparents and clergy from this onerous bill. I hope we do that. It \nis the least we can do.\n  But I think what we should all agree on is that a woman who is facing \na crisis pregnancy should be encouraged to talk to her parents. In \nfact, we have seen studies by Stanley Henshaw and Kathryn Kost that in \nthe vast majority of situations, a young woman does involve her \nparents. But tragically, in situations where women don't tell their \nparents, one-third of those young women are victims of abuse. Those are \nthe women we are going to be affecting by legislation such as this.\n  In an ideal world, the young woman would talk to her parents, but too \noften, too many young women do not live in an ideal world today. They \ncannot turn to a parent. We need to make sure they have the \navailability of health care for their needs, and this bill takes that \naway.\n  Unfortunately what this bill really does is ensure that young women \nwho are intent on seeking reproductive health services go it alone. If \na young woman thinks that bringing a caring adult or supportive friend \nwill get that person in trouble, she will make that trip on her own. \nYou wouldn't want your children to drive home from the hospital after \nhaving surgery, but this legislation is going to result in young women \nforced to drive themselves home after a medical procedure.\n  I don't see how my colleagues can say this bill is about the safety \nof young women when it actually endangers them more. This bill doesn't \neven have an exception to protect the health of young women, and that, \nfrankly, raises huge constitutional questions about which we have \nheard.\n  This bill doesn't care about a young woman's health, it barely cares \nabout her life, and that is because the bill's exception for a life-\nthreatening situation is very narrow and very limited and, according to \nexperts who studied it, this bill will effectively nullify the laws of \nStates such as mine that allow physicians to provide confidential \nmedical services to minors.\n  For that reason, I will oppose this bill, but I do commend the \nSenator from New Jersey, Mr. Lautenberg, who is offering an amendment \nthat we will be voting on that is a comprehensive approach to \nreproductive health care for our teenagers. It will help reduce teen \npregnancy, and that is its goal. That amendment would be a good step \nforward, but even that addition is not going to save this flawed bill.\n  We should be working on ways to reduce the number of crisis \npregnancies among teens and women alike. That is why, on issues such as \nemergency contraceptives, I fought so hard to make sure the FDA makes \nits decision based on science on whether that drug is safe or \neffective.\n  Unfortunately, the bill we have in front of us today is just another \nploy for the majority to get their base excited in an election year \nand, frankly, I am deeply concerned that women's lives are being used \nas pawns in a political debate. I believe women's rights should never \nbe traded away in a ploy for votes.\n  I hope we send a message that we know our country is facing serious \nchallenges and we are going to spend our very limited time addressing \nthose challenges and fighting for all of our families.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote against this dangerous, divisive, and \nmisguided bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, the Senator from California said twice \ntoday that this bill protects a father who commits incest with his \ndaughter. In other words, he can commit a crime and still take her \nacross State lines to get an abortion.\n  That argument is illogical. Obviously, a father is a parent. In a \nState with a parental consent law, he is a parent with rights under \nState law. If he wants his daughter to have an abortion, to cover up \nhis own crime, he can freely give his consent to allow his daughter to \nhave the abortion in their State of residence. That father doesn't have \nto take his daughter across State lines. As a result, this bill does \nnot affect such an outcome one way or the other. His abuse of his \ndaughter in that situation is not only morally wrong, it is illegal. \nThis bill doesn't affect that situation one way or another. So to say \nwe are protecting a father's right to go across State lines--it is an \nargument, frankly, that just doesn't hold water. It just doesn't. This \nbill doesn't have anything to do with what the Senator was saying.\n  Let's just talk about what the bill does. This bill says that if a \nState has\n\n[[Page S8163]]\n\nenacted a parental consent or a parental notification law and if a \nteenage girl in that State gets pregnant and somebody besides her \nparents wants to take that child across State lines to avoid those \nparental consent or parental notification laws in direct violation of \nwhat the people of that State want, in direct violation of what the \nparents would want, that act, transporting a child across state lines, \nis a Federal offense. And that crime is punishable with time in prison.\n  Look at the consequences of not having this bill. I would point out, \nin order to put this in its proper context for my colleagues, that over \ntwo-thirds of the girls who have been taken across State lines for an \nabortion have boyfriends who are over 20 years of age. So typically, \nyou would have a teenage girl with a boyfriend who is significantly \nolder than her. And in the context of that relationship, the young girl \nbecomes pregnant. Sometimes that pregnancy is the result of a forcible \nrape, where the girls does not consent; in most cases, it is at least \nstatutory rape. This legislation will help law enforcement stop adult \nmen from preying upon underage girls and violating the law with respect \nto the crime of rape--statutory or otherwise. Which is the right thing \nto do. This bill makes it a further crime if that male takes this young \ngirl across State lines to get an abortion to cover up his tracks, \nbasically to try to eliminate the evidence of his crime. Without this \nbill, the man who has already taken advantage of a young girl can \nfurther endanger her, by forcing her to have an abortion, with \npotential emotional scarring beyond what she has already gone through \nand potential physical scarring. In an abortion, some women actually \nbecome sterile because of the procedure, because of complications from \nthe procedure.\n  The parents of most children in the United States are responsible. To \ntake away their ability to be involved in something that is so \nimportant, so potentially life-altering with this teenager I believe is \njust wrong, and I think that is why 80 percent of the American people \nsupport this legislation.\n  In polls I have seen, 60-plus percent of people who call themselves \npro-choice support this legislation.\n  We are in a society that is so deeply divided over moral issues, and \nnone more divided than this issue--the issue of whether you call \nyourself pro-life, or pro-choice, or anti-choice, or pro-abortion, or \nwhatever names that are tossed around. I believe reasonable people can \nat least come together on some restrictions on abortion. This is one of \nthose reasonable restrictions. That is why over 80 percent of the \nAmerican people support this legislation.\n  It is only constitutional when--and this law only applies when--the \nStates have judicial bypass. For those people who are concerned about \nwhether in the case of incest the girl is going to be subjected to some \nkind of further abuse, it is reasonable that the judicial bypass is \nthere and the reason the courts have recognized that for the parental \nconsent cases. We are not forcing States to do anything as far as their \nlaws are concerned. We are upholding the intent of the people of each \nState by saying don't circumvent the laws of our State by taking a \nminor outside of our State. The people of that State have spoken. I \nthink we should at this point in time try to respect the laws the \npeople of that State have enacted. Most importantly, we protect the \nparents' rights and the health and the lives of children across the \nUnited States.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, before we yield the 2\\1/2\\ minutes, this \nissue of incest is extraordinary. The bill as written ``protects the \npredators on our children who have committed incest.'' All you have to \ndo is read it. These parents, these fathers, retain their parental \nrights in the bill. And even under the Ensign amendment it says they \ncannot sue a friendly person for helping their daughter. The government \nunder this bill can still go after a grandma, or a clergyman who says \nto a young child, Let me help you, your father raped you. Those vicious \ncriminals retain all their rights. It is an absolute outrage.\n  The point is, why I am in favor of the Lautenberg amendment is the \nLautenberg amendment says let us take a step back, let us prevent these \npregnancies. And if people want to vote against teen pregnancy \nprevention, I guess they have a right to do that. How they would \nexplain it is beyond me. We are talking 800,000 teenagers who get \npregnant, and in about 18 percent it was not intended.\n  I thank Senator Lautenberg and yield to him the remaining time before \nthe vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey is recognized. The \nSenator has 1 minute.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, how incomprehensible it is that we \nhave a position on the one hand that refuses to acknowledge in this \nbody there are other ways to control teenage pregnancies than \nabstinence. We are not against abstinence. There are funds provided in \nthe President's budget for 2007 for abstinence--$204 million. This \namendment asks for additional funding to supply comprehensive \neducation. We heard from the Senator from South Carolina saying that he \ndescribes our values as shared values. But we are not sharing values \nwith the people in South Carolina from Bamberg County who had the \nlowest rate of teenage pregnancies after they started a program for \ncomprehensive education in South Carolina. The Senator from South \nCarolina said we had to have shared values on these things. But these \nare shared values.\n  I hope our colleagues will look at this fairly, and think about the \nwomen who are hurting because they are prevented from getting an \neducation and vote ``no'' on this bill and ``yes'' on my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, one last point related to instances where \na father has raped his daughter and whether his rights are protected \nunder this bill. We have an amendment that will address the concerns \nraised with respect to that issue. The Senator from California \nmentioned that the grandfather could be sued under this bill, could be \nprosecuted under this bill if he took his granddaughter across State \nlines to get the abortion. In that circumstance, the grandparent should \nbe calling the local authorities. If it is a clergy, a friend, whoever \nit is that has knowledge of a crime against a child, that person should \nbe calling the local authorities so that young child can be removed \nfrom that awful situation that she is forced to live in. The \nauthorities should be involved, and in those cases where pregnancy \nresults, the young girl, with the help of her grandparent, clergy \nmember or other adult can seek a judicial bypass. I am confident that a \njudge hearing that case would allow an abortion under judicial bypass. \nBut if the grandparents or the clergy truly care about, or the friend \ntruly cares about that young girl who has been a victim of incest, then \nthat adult should contact the local authorities. That is how an adult \nwould be acting in the best interests of the child. Otherwise, all the \nadult is doing is taking her across State lines for an abortion, \nbringing her back to her home state, and returning her into the same \nvery harmful situation that she was in before.\n  I yield the remainder of time. I call for the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. CHAFEE). The question is on agreeing to \nthe amendment. The yeas and nays have been ordered. The clerk will call \nthe roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from California (Mrs. \nFeinstein) is necessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \ndesiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 48, nays 51, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 214 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--48\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Byrd\n     Cantwell\n     Carper\n     Chafee\n     Clinton\n     Collins\n     Conrad\n     Dayton\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Feingold\n     Harkin\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     Menendez\n     Mikulski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Obama\n     Pryor\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Rockefeller\n     Salazar\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Smith\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stabenow\n     Wyden\n\n[[Page S8164]]\n\n\n\n                                NAYS--51\n\n     Alexander\n     Allard\n     Allen\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Burr\n     Chambliss\n     Coburn\n     Cochran\n     Coleman\n     Cornyn\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     DeMint\n     DeWine\n     Dole\n     Domenici\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Frist\n     Graham\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Hatch\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Isakson\n     Kyl\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     Martinez\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Murkowski\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Roberts\n     Santorum\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Stevens\n     Sununu\n     Talent\n     Thomas\n     Thune\n     Vitter\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n\n                             NOT VOTING--1\n\n       \n     Feinstein\n       \n  The amendment (No. 4689) was rejected.\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Martinez). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that for the next \n20 minutes, the first 10 minutes be taken by the Senator from Illinois, \nMr. Durbin, and then the 10 minutes following that would be allotted to \nSenator Santorum from Pennsylvania.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, this is a difficult issue for most \nAmericans, the issue of abortion. There are strongly held feelings on \nboth sides and the American people are conflicted. When you probe and \nask them what they think about abortion, first, they would rather not \ntalk about it. I think that is a natural human reaction because we know \nit is a delicate and difficult issue. Secondly, they basically say: \nWell, I don't want to criminalize someone who goes out for an abortion, \nbut is there any way to reduce the number of abortions in this country? \nI think that is a natural reaction by most, that we should keep \nabortion legal, not a crime, but reduce the incidents of abortion in \nour country.\n  So we have a bill before us today which deals with one aspect; and \nthe aspect is, what do we do about the fact that some States have laws \nthat require parental consent before a person who has not reached \nadulthood would have an abortion performed and some States do not have \nthose laws? What if you move from one State to the other? What law will \napply?\n  Senator Ensign of Nevada brings us his bill and suggests that if you \nknowingly remove a person across one border where parental consent is \nrequired to another State where it is not required, the person who took \nthat minor to that abortion clinic in the State without parental \nconsent is going to be liable not just for a civil lawsuit that can be \nfiled against them by the parents but also for a crime.\n  Their idea is to reduce the likelihood that young people will be \ntaken across a State line to a State without parental consent by \nimposing new civil penalties and criminal penalties on those who would \ntransport them.\n  Senator Boxer of California has come before us and pointed out some \nreal problems with this bill. What about the situation where the young \ngirl we are talking about has been a victim of incest? Would the father \nthen have the right to bring a lawsuit against someone who took the \ndaughter he abused across the State line? Nobody wants to talk about \nthis issue. This is not the kind of thing you wake up in the morning \nand say: I hope the debate today will be about abortion and incest. But \nthat is what we face. We are talking about writing the laws of the land \nin a way that is sensible. You say: That has to be a rare situation. \nYes, it is. I am sure it is. But for that life and that person and that \ncrime, it could be the most important and tragic event that ever \nhappened in their lives. That is why we have to take this very \nseriously. We have to write these amendments very carefully.\n  The thing that troubles me about this debate is evidenced in the vote \nwe just took. Senators Lautenberg and Menendez came to the floor and \nsaid: If we are truly going to reduce the number of abortions, then we \nhave to deal with the reality of family planning and sex education, \nother issues that politicians don't jump forward to speak about. They \nsuggested we start creating programs that have been proven to be \neffective, that will help educate young people so they will avoid \nunwanted pregnancies and avoid the diseases and problems that may \nresult therefrom.\n  What happened on this vote? What happened on a vote where we were \ntalking about sex education as part of our approach? It was defeated. \nThe approach which is dominant now is not to deal with the reality of \nyoung people and their knowledge of what they face if they make the \nwrong decision but, rather, punishment, to suggest to them that what \nthey have done is not only morally wrong but could be criminal.\n  My wife and I have raised three children, two daughters. I know that \nto be a parent is to be countercultural. So many times we would say: We \ndon't want you to go to that movie or look at that book; you can't \nwatch this television show. Parents do that all the time in the hopes \nthat you instill in your kids values they can live by and that they \nwill make the right decisions. I never felt at any point that ignorance \nwas a virtue. I felt with our kids, as many parents do, you have to be \nhonest with them about the realities of life and what they will face.\n  The question of abstinence comes up on the floor. It is brought up by \nmany. That is the first thing we told our kids: Stay away from sexual \nactivity. This is something you shouldn't do. That is the best advice \nfrom a parent to a child. But beyond that, what more should you tell \nthem? Senator Lautenberg suggests you should tell them more in certain \ncircumstances, and it was rejected 48 to 51.\n  You might ask why we are debating this issue this day. I think it is \nimportant for us to reflect on why this happens to come to the Senate \nfloor today. This issue is before the Senate today for two or three \nreasons. One reason is many Republican Senators who traditionally vote \nagainst abortion voted for stem cell research last week. This is a \nmake-good vote. This is so some of them can remind their antiabortion \nconstituencies they are still in their corner. I understand that.\n  Secondly, it is a way to kill time in the Senate rather than address \nthe real issues the American people care about. This debate over this \nissue is taking time away from any debate on gasoline prices, on health \ninsurance, on jobs.\n  Third, of course, it fires up a political base on the Republican side \nfor the upcoming election.\n  A Gallup poll asked 1,000 Americans this open-ended question: What do \nyou think is the most important problem facing this country today? They \nasked 1,000 Americans a few months ago. The top vote getters: The war \nin Iraq, gasoline prices, immigration, health care, and the economy. \nWhere did the issue of abortion show up on this list? It tied for No. \n33. Less than one half of 1 percent of people said abortion was the \nmost important problem facing America today. But it is the most \nimportant issue in the mind of the Republican leadership that we should \nbe debating on the floor of the Senate.\n  I hope we are able to work out an amendment to deal with the reality \nof the issue of incest, which is part of the debate, sadly. Perhaps the \nmost egregious part of this bill is the fact that there is no exception \nfor the case of incest. It empowers the parent who may be guilty of the \ncrime to file a lawsuit and recover money because someone else took the \nvictim across a State line. That is hardly where we want to go. Many \nincest victims are understandably frightened and don't want to tell \ntheir parents anything for obvious reasons.\n  Listen to the words of Sharon from New Hampshire, raped by her father \nat the age of 17:\n\n       Imagine being 17, pregnant after being raped by your \n     father, alone, isolated, afraid to tell anyone for fear your \n     parents would find out and that, if they did, you would be \n     further humiliated, harassed and abused. . . . I felt and \n     feared these things.\n\n  Consider the case of Spring Adams, a 13-year-old girl from Idaho, \nraped by\n\n[[Page S8165]]\n\nher father and impregnated. A private organization learned about the \ngirl, made arrangements to take her to the nearest abortion clinic 6 \nhours away to have an abortion. The night before Spring was to leave, \nher father discovered it. When Spring went to sleep that night, her \nfather went into her room and shot her to death with a rifle.\n  These aren't isolated incidents. One study showed that 30 percent of \nthe minors who had an abortion without telling their parents had \npreviously experienced violence or threats of violence in their family. \nThat is the real world. We should deal with the real world when we \nwrite these laws.\n\n  I think Senator Ensign understands changes have to be made to this \nbill. I hope we will make them. Let us all agree on this: We need to \nfind ways to reduce the incidence of abortion. We need to find ways \nthat are sensible and sensitive. Merely telling people you can't do it, \nyou shouldn't do it, may not be enough. Education may be part of it as \nwell. It is unfortunate the Senate has rejected the Lautenberg \namendment which would have moved us closer to the point where that \nwould have been available in some areas where good family planning \ninformation would have been available. It was rejected by the Senate.\n  Now we come before the Senate with this bill that is subject to \namendment. We are hoping we can find a reasonable compromise on a very \ndifficult and divisive issue.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I am happy to yield.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I want to go back to the Lautenberg-Menendez amendment. \nIt is extraordinary to me; when we try to talk about common ground on \nthe issue of pregnancy prevention, doesn't my colleague believe one \narea we ought to all come together on, regardless of whether we call \nourselves pro-choice or anti-choice, would be preventing pregnancies \namong teens?\n  Mr. DURBIN. That ought to be the starting point. Shouldn't we all \nagree on that? If we are going to reduce the incidence of abortion, one \nof the things we should do is make sure young people are aware of \nconsequences. We should stress abstinence. The Lautenberg amendment put \nthat as the highest priority. But then have family planning information \navailable so young people know that there are ways to protect \nthemselves. I think that was a reasonable starting point. We had a few \nfrom the other side of the aisle join us with that amendment but \nclearly not enough.\n  Mrs. BOXER. If my friend will further yield, is my friend aware there \nare 800,000 pregnancies among young women and that we could prevent \nthese unwanted pregnancies and all of the attendant upset among \nfamilies and that we had an opportunity to do that?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired. Mrs. BOXER. I \nask unanimous consent for 30 additional seconds and for Senator \nSantorum to have an additional 30 seconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Here we had a chance to do something to prevent these \nunintended pregnancies. This bill focuses on a small number of cases. \nIt seems to me by two votes we lost that vote. It is an issue, wouldn't \nmy friend say?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I would say we have to find very common ground on a \ndivisive issue. That was a good starting point. Unfortunately, it did \nnot prevail today. We will go on with this debate, but I hope those of \nus who look at this issue and worry over how to reduce the number of \nabortions can work to find some common bipartisan ground to help \nstrengthen families and educate their children about the consequences \nof their actions, to promote abstinence but not to promote ignorance.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the Child \nCustody Protection Act. I congratulate the majority leader for \nscheduling time for this important piece of legislation, as well as \nSenator Ensign for the terrific work he is doing in managing the \nlegislation as the author of the bill.\n  This is very important legislation. It has been described many times \nso I won't go into detail. What we are trying to do is protect children \nfrom being taken across State lines to avoid parental involvement laws. \nAs a father of six children, two daughters, I believe parents should be \ninvolved in the health care decisions of minor children. I am not alone \nin that regard. The vast majority of Americans believe in parental \nconsent laws when it comes to having abortion procedures done on \nminors, that parents should be involved in that decision.\n  The Senator from Illinois described situations that are certainly the \nexception rather than the rule. When those exceptions arise, in all of \nthe States there is a judicial bypass. The Senator from Illinois \ndescribed some pretty horrific circumstances of incest or rape. Here \nyou have a situation where if we don't have this law, the rapist or the \nperson who committed the incest against this minor child could take \nthat child across State lines, never report it to the police, have the \nabortion done, and the parents never know about it. Nobody knows about \nit, and the child is back in the home and potentially in the same \nthreatening environment the child was in in the first place. At least \nunder our parental consent laws and with this statute, if we are \nsuccessful, the court can get involved. We can remove that child from \nthe dangerous situation.\n  I don't know why allowing someone surreptitiously to avoid state \nparental consent laws is a benefit to the child. If anything, it is the \nopposite. That is not a rational reason for objecting to this statute.\n  Again, I suggest the American public overwhelmingly feels the same \nway. Parents deserve and should have the ability to be consulted and \nnotified or give consent, depending on the State, to a medical \nprocedure as severe and serious as an abortion.\n  If you look at the poll question, do you agree or disagree that a \nperson should be able to take a minor girl across State lines to obtain \nan abortion without her parents' knowledge--this isn't consent, it is \njust knowledge--15 percent agree, 15 percent agree with that statement \nthat she should be able to be transported across State lines; 82 \npercent disagree. They said people should not be able to take a child \nacross State lines without the knowledge of their parents. Seventy-five \npercent strongly disagree with the current state of the law which is \nyou can transport children across State lines in order to circumvent \nstate parental involvement laws.\n  In Pennsylvania, all of the surrounding states but the State of Ohio \nhave weaker laws on parental involvement than the State of \nPennsylvania. So a child in the northwestern part of our State can go \nup to New York or, in the eastern part of the State, New Jersey or \nDelaware or, in the southern part of our State, Maryland, West \nVirginia, all of which have laws that are not as favorable to parents \nand children as Pennsylvania with respect to consent.\n  This is, unfortunately, not a hypothetical for those of us in \nPennsylvania. There are cases, unfortunate cases of children being \ntaken by a boyfriend or his family members across State lines and the \nhorrible consequences that result.\n  We also have abortion clinics from other States that advertise in \nPennsylvania. There are a couple of ads I will put up on the board. \nThis is northeastern Pennsylvania. Scranton is there, up near the New \nYork border. Here in the Scranton Yellow Pages is the All Women's \nHealth and Medical Services in White Plains, NY, a toll free number; \n``We are here if you need us.'' This is, again, advertising in White \nPlains, NY, which is not that close to Scranton. It is at least 50 \nmiles away. And it talks about no consent, no waiting period. There is \na parental consent provision in the Pennsylvania statute that was \nupheld as constitutional back in 1992. There is a 24-hour waiting \nperiod. Again, the clinic is advertising no consent, no waiting period, \ndirectly aimed at minors in Pennsylvania urging them to come and have \nabortions at their clinic across the State line.\n  Here is another one. This is at the other end of the State, the \nsouthern part of our State. This is the Yellow Pages in Lancaster. \nAtlantic Women's Medical Services, Inc., no parental consent, 16 years \nand older. The Pennsylvania law is 18 years of age. So if you are 16, \n17, they require no consent; again, directly targeted at a State, \nencouraging women and others to bring\n\n[[Page S8166]]\n\nyoung women across the State line for abortions. They advertise \nabortions to 24 weeks, the abortion pill, low fees, all trying to make \nsure these young girls know that abortions are available without \nconsent.\n  This is not a hypothetical. This is direct marketing to minors, \ndirect marketing in the Yellow Pages to minors who are desperate and, \nin many cases, afraid and feel alone. They are marketing to these \nvulnerable children to get them to not talk to their parents but to \ncome and get an abortion out of State, against their State laws. This \nis, again, not just a hypothetical but a real-life situation. And which \nI will share a case.\n  We had a case in Lancaster, PA, which began on Christmas Eve, 2004. A \n14-year-old told her mother she was pregnant. The parents were prepared \nto be supportive, to help that child in whatever decision she made and \nin scheduling appointments with doctors, counselors, and other programs \nthat could help this child get through this very difficult situation. \nThe daughter chose to have the baby and raise it with the love and \nsupport of her family.\n  But the boyfriend's family didn't like the young girl's decision and \nbegan to harass and coerce the girl and her family in order to \nintimidate her into getting an abortion. The mother called the local \npolice for advice and even called an abortion clinic to see how old you \nneeded to be to have an abortion in Pennsylvania because she was afraid \nthat her daughter might be pressured toward an abortion. She was told \nthe daughter needed to be 16 though that was actually incorrect because \nshe needed to be 18 to have an abortion without consent. Therefore, her \nmother thought she was protected.\n  That wasn't the case. In mid-February, she sent her daughter off to \nschool, but the daughter never made it there. Her boyfriend's family \nmet her and her boyfriend down the road, put them in a cab and then on \na train, and then a subway to New Jersey, where his family met them and \ntook them to an abortion clinic where one of them had made an \nappointment. The young girl had second thoughts, but she was told they \nwould leave her in New Jersey if she didn't undergo an abortion.\n  After the abortion, the family of the boyfriend, who may have been \nattempting to conceal the evidence of his statutory rape, drove her \nback to Pennsylvania. Again, this left the young woman completely \nunprotected with the state not being able to go after this young man \nand his family for taking her across state lines for an abortion. That \nis what it seems was behind the parents trying to get rid of this \nchild. This is a situation which should not happen. We have State laws \nthat protect children and parents and their rights to be able to \nnurture and help their children along the way.\n  This was a difficult circumstance, and as I said before, there are, \nunfortunately, others. We even have in the State of Pennsylvania \norganizations outside of these legal clinics that are trying to give \nadvice and help to minor children on evading the parental consent laws. \nThere is an organization called the Women's Law Project. It says here \nin their publication, ``Is it legal for teen-aged women to cross State \nlines to get an abortion?'' This is a document which is handed out and \ngiven to young women to help them avoid the State laws that are in \nplace for parental consent. It says:\n\n       Yes. However, the adult may risk a charge of interfering \n     with the custody of a minor. Adults who are accompanying \n     young women under 14 to out-of-State abortion providers \n     should contact a lawyer for the Women's Law Project.\n\n  So if you are over 14 years of age, they assure you that you can go \nto an abortion clinic out of State. If you are under 14, your \naccompanying adult may have to call our lawyers to take care of the \nsituation.\n  This is a real-world situation, a problem we are confronted with in \nthis country. All we are trying to do is let the State laws, the \ncollective wisdom of the people of Pennsylvania, have effect, have \nefficacy; that the laws which are put in place are there to protect \nchildren and the rights of parents. The only one that can stop others \nfrom getting around those protections and avoiding State laws is the \nFederal Government, by stopping the interstate transportation of these \nchildren for the purpose of abortion.\n  So this is a vitally important piece of legislation for the \nCommonwealth of Pennsylvania. This is one in which I am hopeful that 75 \nor 80 percent of the Senate will agree with when it is all said and \ndone because it is vitally important, for the health of our children \nand for the stability of families, to give families and children this \nlegal protection. That is what we are doing. That is what these States \nhave done--given legal protection from further abuse of minors who find \nthemselves in a situation where they are pregnant and under, obviously, \na horrible situation in their lives. They need their parents. Where the \nparents are the problem or a threat to them, there is a judicial \nbypass. We have in place safeguards where parents are the problem, \nwhich, again, is a minority of situations. We do have protections in \nplace.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Yes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. The bill creates a civil cause of action the parents can \nbring. Does the Senator from Pennsylvania believe that in one of those \nrare, tragic cases of incest and the father is the reason for the \nincest, he should be allowed to bring a civil cause of action against \nthe person who has transported the victim?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. The Senator from Nevada has an amendment which is going \nto take care of that situation. I will defer to him, if he would like \nto answer that question on how the amendment would work to preclude \nthat problem.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator from Pennsylvania has \nexpired.\n  The Senator from Nevada is recognized.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, to answer the Senator from Illinois, we \nare going to fix that. We realized we needed to fix that problem, and \nwe have an amendment. The Senator addressed this, and that will be one \nof the amendments that is coming up.\n  I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from Kansas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas is recognized.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Nevada, and I \nthank the leadership for bringing up this topic. It is commonsense and \npro-family legislation. I hope we pass it in an overwhelming fashion \nthrough this body and that it arrives on the President's desk once we \ngo through conference committee and get it back here and that it can \nbecome the law of the land.\n  The bill has been described in many different iterations. I believe \npeople understand the concept of what is being put forward about \ninvolving the family. I believe this is a significant pro-parent, pro-\nchild, pro-life piece of legislation. It is a bill that everybody knows \nis to help to preserve this role by making it illegal for somebody to \ntake a child across State lines for an abortion, thereby circumventing \nparental rights laws in the State where the child resides. That is all \nwell known. The issue I wish to deal with briefly, if I could, is the \ncommonsense feature of this legislation.\n  Everybody has talked about the examples of how you cannot get an \naspirin in school without the parents' permission. You virtually cannot \ndo any medical procedure without the parents' permission, except an \nabortion. Everybody looks at that, and they are quizzical and wonder \nwhy there is this exception.\n  I wish to talk about the commonsense feature of this. Why is it that \nwe don't give aspirin to children at school? Why is it that we require \nthat parents are involved in the medical decisions of their children? \nThe reason, I think--and most people look at it as common sense--is \nthat there are consequences to this. If this happens, if the child has \na response to the aspirin or if the child has some reaction to a minor \nsurgery, the parent needs to be involved. Something might happen, so \nthe parent needs to know. We need to take care of the child. The \nparents have the role of being entrusted with that child's life and \nworking with that child and therefore needs to be actively engaged in \nknowing what is going on with the child.\n  We have held hearings in the Senate and in the House of \nRepresentatives, and many States have held hearings on\n\n[[Page S8167]]\n\nthe impact of abortion on women. There are groups that are formed about \nthe impact of abortion on women, both physically and psychologically. \nWe have had expert witnesses present and testimony about how abortion \nimpacts and harms women physically and psychologically. There have been \nbooks written on this topic. Some people say: We don't think it has as \nbig an impact as you say it has. Others say: I think it has a bigger \nimpact. That debate can be taken, I suppose, to any medical procedure \non a child.\n  The point of the issue is that we have the parents there to help them \nhelp the child, and they decide. That is who is making the decision. \nThat is who is making the decision on whether the child gets minor \nmedical care at the school. You want the parents involved. They are the \nguardians, the ones who are responsible.\n  Here is a situation where, clearly, you have a physical impact on the \nchild. I believe clearly that you have a psychological impact on that \nchild. I think that has been documented. Others question whether that \nhas been fully documented. Clearly, on a number of women who have \nabortions, there is a psychological impact. Isn't it simply common \nsense that parents would be involved in such a monumental decision that \nis going to impact this child for the rest of their life and that \nparent would be involved in helping the child to process what is the \nwise decision, the right thing to do, the appropriate thing, what the \noptions are and the sorts of things they can do? Particularly at a time \nwhen the child is going to have to process this in a difficult \nemotional situation, the parent needs to be involved and should be \ninvolved to give that wise counsel, prudent counsel, to the child \ninvolved in this particular circumstance.\n  Parents can and do help present all of the health facts to their \nchildren and help them make a prudent decision. That is just basic \ncommon sense. It is the right thing that we ought to do. Parents can \nhelp to spot abusive situations which might not otherwise be evident to \nthe child. Without parental involvement, abortion can be forced upon a \nyoung woman by, in some cases, an abusive male figure in order to cover \nup a crime.\n  The role of parents in protecting children is essential. This cannot \nbe delegated to any other person. Yet in this law, we even provide for \nthe judicial bypass procedure. Especially when a daughter is facing an \nunintended pregnancy, parents need to be involved. We talk a lot on the \nSenate floor and have worked over the years to try to build more and \nstronger family units. One of the key ways to do that is to have the \nparents more involved in the decisionmaking of the child, particularly \nwhen health consequences are there. This is one on which that should \ntake place.\n  When a child is undergoing this procedure, it does clearly terminate \na young life growing in the mother's womb. That has an impact on the \nchild psychologically, if in no other fashion. Parents need to be \ninvolved in helping to process how that is going to be handled for the \nchild.\n  I believe this legislation is a step in the right direction. It would \ngo some distance toward helping protect parents' rights and children's \nhealth. It would help integrate and build that relationship between the \nparent and child.\n  I urge my colleagues to pass this legislation. I hope, as a message \nto the country, we can pass it in a large bipartisan fashion and send a \nsignal to people that this makes good sense. It is appropriate for us \nto do.\n\n  It is not simply that you are pro-life or you are pro-choice; \ntherefore, we are going to split on those lines. Rather, we should look \nat this as parents, as we virtually all are on this floor, and saying \nas a parent, whether I am pro-life or pro-choice, I would want that \nsort of information for my child, and I would want to be able to have \nthat information to process as a parent, and that I would say to my \nlegislators I am one way or the other on the abortion debate, but as a \nparent I believe it is my duty to know this. This is my duty to be \ninvolved in this type of decisionmaking for my child.\n  I think that is why, while we have a lot of debate about the issue of \nabortion in the country, this is so strongly supported by people \nbecause so many people look at this outside the abortion debate, and \nthey look at it much more as a parental debate, as to how they observe \nand they deal and they want to deal with this particular issue. I urge \nmy colleagues to look at it that way as well. Take it out of the grid \nof the abortion debate and put it into the decisionmaking grid of a \nparent. I think if we do that, we will pass this in a strong bipartisan \nfashion.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brownback). The Senator from California is \nrecognized.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I yield myself time off the bill. How many \nminutes is remaining on our side on the general debate on the bill?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 25 minutes remaining.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I have not yet had a chance to lay out my \nobjections to this bill. I would like a chance to do that and, of \ncourse, those objections have just been elevated given the fact that by \njust two slim votes, we failed to adopt teen pregnancy prevention \nlegislation, which is, of course, one of the most important issues we \nface in our society today. We have 800,000 young women whose \npregnancies could have been prevented if they had such education.\n  Here we are dealing with a bill that seems to come back before the \nSenate every election for reasons that the other side can explain. \nInstead of tackling the issues of health care for our young people, \ninsurance for our young people, pregnancy prevention for our young \npeople, we are dealing with an issue that impacts just a few people. \nBut so be it.\n  The good news is, we have had a debate on teen pregnancy prevention. \nThe whole country got to see it, and they got to see where the votes \nlined up. It is pretty clear.\n  The other good news is that we had a debate on stem cell research, \nand we saw a very similar situation where we picked up a few votes on \nthe other side but not enough votes. The President vetoed stem cell \nresearch. You want to talk about a health issue, you want to talk about \nhelping the health of our young people who have juvenile diabetes or \nthose who are paralyzed because of an accident; if you want to talk \nabout helping people with Alzheimer's or Parkinson's. But oh no, the \nPresident vetoed that. Another four or five votes in this Chamber could \nhave made the difference between having stem cell research and not. But \nnow we are not going to have it.\n  Frankly, in my State, we took matters into our own hands, and \nRepublicans and Democrats together voted for stem cell research, and we \nhave a $3 billion program. This isn't a partisan issue in my State. But \noh boy, it is a partisan issue here. It just shows how far to the right \nwe have come in the national debate.\n  So instead of doing something to improve a lot of our people, we are \nlooking at this small issue. We are looking at a bill that, as it is \nnow drafted, protects incest predators. We are working on that, hoping \nto come to some joint approach that can stop that problem, or part of \nit anyway.\n  As drafted, this bill throws grandmothers in jail and violates our \nConstitution. I would say this bill has a problem.\n  Again, we tried to make it better, but even our amendments did not go \nfar enough. We did not have an exception for rape. If a young girl gets \nraped and she runs to the most trusted adult she knows, perhaps her \ngrandma, and her grandma takes her into her loving arms because she is \ntoo scared to go to her parents for whatever reason. We have situations \nand I will share those with you where girls were so fearful, so \nfrightened, and with good reason, that they couldn't go to their \nparents. So they go to a loving grandmother. And guess what? Under this \nbill, the parents can sue the grandmother. Unbelievable. That is Big \nBrother all right. Talk about family values interfering straight in. It \nis unbelievable.\n  We tried to fix the thrust of this bill to add on a Teen Pregnancy \nPrevention Act. We couldn't do it.\n  So this bill, at the end of the day, focuses on a small number of \nyoung women crossing State lines with an adult to get an abortion and \nignores 800,000 pregnancies which could have been prevented.\n  We had our chance. We had our chance, but, oh no, it is going to be\n\n[[Page S8168]]\n\nabout political correctness. It is going to be about rightwing \nideology. Oh no, we can't do that.\n  This bill does nothing to increase communications between parents and \nteens. It does nothing to stop sexual predators. Most young women who \nbecome pregnant already turn to their parents for help.\n  This is a wonderful country. We have loving families, for the most \npart, loving open families who say to their kids, as I certainly did to \nmine, and my husband did: Anything you have on your mind, you just come \nto us. You feel free to tell us. That is how it should be.\n\n  When I was a child, my mother said I could tell her anything, and I \ndid. I told her anything. She loved me unconditionally and helped me \nthrough whatever problem I might have had.\n  With my own children, I tried to emulate my mother. I hope and I \nthink I did that. They are now grown. They take care of me.\n  But what about young people who don't have that warm feeling in their \nfamilies? What about the millions of victims of violence and abuse? \nThis bill, as it is drafted, hurts just those victims. It doesn't mean \nto. That is not the purpose of it. But we have found out in our lives \nthat some bills have unintended consequences, and this one sure does.\n  As this bill is drafted, a father who commits incest and takes his \ndaughter over a State line--we are trying to fix it, and we hope we can \nfix it--that father has rights under this bill. It is an outrage.\n  Nearly half of pregnant teens who have been abused or assaulted are \nfound to be abused and assaulted by a family member. That is the sad \ntruth. Thirty percent of minors who don't tell their parents have \nexperienced violence in the home. In other words, they are too fearful \nto go to the home where they have suffered violence. They fear violence \nor they worry that, in a rage, their parents will kick them out if they \ntell them they have become pregnant.\n  Don't we want them to be safe and secure? Don't we want them to have \nhelp from a caring adult? I would hope so. But under this bill, a \nclergy member who really cares about the family could be sued by \nparents who abuse their children. A loving grandma or a loving aunt \ncould be sued. Oh, there are no exceptions allowed.\n  Senator Feinstein, unfortunately, is suffering from the flu and \ncannot be here today. She had an amendment--she cannot offer it--that \nwould have exempted caring clergy and caring relatives. She couldn't be \nhere.\n  This bill is so imperfect that I cannot begin to count the ways.\n  In my State, as I mentioned previously, parental notification laws \nhave been voted down. In general, we all want to have adult consent. I \nbelieve it is important to help guide a young person through such a \ndecision. But when we look at some of the unintended consequences of \nthese bills and the fine print of these bills, we find that they are \ngoing to have the opposite effect of what we want. Instead of helping \nthe minor, it puts her at risk.\n  We know some specific cases: A 12-year-old whose pediatrician \ndiscovered she was pregnant. It turned out the rapist was her \nstepfather and the mother wasn't living with the girl. The doctors \nrecommended that her Aunt Vicki bring her to a specialist in a \nneighboring State. She was only 12 years old, the aunt said. It is bad \nenough to go through incest, but then to have a child from that incest. \nWe should all agree that only the father should go to jail, not the \ncaring relative, Aunt Vicki.\n  I know it is very difficult to talk about this topic, but some very \nsick people do rape. Fathers do rape, uncles do rape and even \nimpregnate their daughters.\n  Look at these newspaper stories from around the country.\n  ``An American Tragedy.'' This is from The Oregonian:\n\n       A 13-year-old girl in Idaho whose father had impregnated \n     her. . . . the morning she was supposed to have an abortion, \n     her father, who admitted his guilt, walked into her room with \n     a rifle . . . shot her in the head and then he shot himself.\n\n  How does this bill prevent that? This bill will frighten a girl, make \nher more alone because she can't go to a caring adult because a caring \nadult could be sued by a parent. So she is scared. She gets in a car. \nShe drives over the State line by herself. She is all alone. The father \nfinds out, grabs her. She has no protection. He shoots her, shoots \nhimself.\n  What are we doing here? Why don't you look at what you are doing. Why \ndon't you look at the practical impact of what you are doing?\n  Here is another: ``Teen Accuses Father of Rape,'' The Journal News, \nWestchester County, NY.\n\n       . . . man was arrested and charged with first degree rape \n     of his teenage daughter. The man tried to force his daughter \n     to take an unknown pill to cause a miscarriage because he \n     believed she was pregnant.\n\n  This happens too often.\n  ``Father Sentenced for Raping Daughters,'' Newark Advocate:\n\n       Man convicted of raping his two daughters. . . . the girls \n     were 13 and 17 at the time of the crimes.\n\n  ``Man Charged with Incest is Arrested in North Carolina'':\n\n       Police said a father raped and impregnated his 16-year-old \n     daughter and raped his step-daughter who is mentally and \n     physically disabled.\n\n  The way this bill has come to us from the committee protects the \nfather. Senator Ensign and I are working hard--and I hope we can reach \nagreement--to solve the problems of this bill. But the way the bill \npassed the other body, they didn't pay any attention to this. \nWonderful, we pass a bill that protects fathers who rape their \ndaughter. It is basically a bill that, all of that incest aside, really \nwill wind up in a young woman getting into a car on her own, frightened \nto death to tell her parents, and driving alone.\n  ``Ordeal Ended/Dad's Arrest Ends Years of Rape for Teen,'' Newsday.\n\n       For years, a convicted child sex offender used his Bronx \n     home as a pornographic movie studio for sex videos of himself \n     and his young daughter. The girl had tried at least once to \n     alert someone--her mother . . . her mother took no action.\n\n  ``Her mother took no action.'' As Senator Ensign and I try to reach \nan agreement on an incest amendment, let me be clear: We are not going \nto reach that mother. I, if I go along with this, am giving up a lot of \nmy amendment. This is still an imperfect bill, and I will show you in a \nchecklist my amendment versus the Ensign amendment and what we try to \ndo in our amendment.\n  The Ensign amendment, as was originally proposed--we support it--\nstops a father who has raped his daughter from suing the trusted adult \nwho helped his daughter end the resulting pregnancy. We applaud that \namendment, and that amendment will hopefully be adopted.\n  But we don't stop with that because the Ensign amendment doesn't go \nfar enough. We want to stop a father who has raped his daughter from \nexercising any parental consent rights. We want to stop all criminal \nprosecution or jail time for a trusted adult who helps a victim of \nincest.\n  Imagine under this bill a child goes running to a nextdoor neighbor \nwhom she loves, a kind of an aunt to her, and she says: Please help me, \nplease help me. I am pregnant. My father raped me. I can't go in that \nhouse. I can't tell my mother. My mother won't believe me. The nextdoor \nneighbor helps her. Under this bill the mother and the father can sue. \nWe have to fix that. We are not going to fix it today. We can't reach \nall of what I am trying to do because I can't get agreement on the \nother side. It is still going to be an awful problem.\n\n  We also stop a father who has raped his daughter, or any other family \nmember who has committed incest against a minor, from transporting her \nacross State lines to obtain an abortion.\n  We don't want these perpetrators of incest to take their victims \nacross the State line. We are working hard under the parameters of this \nbill to address the issue of incest.\n  At the end of the day, if our negotiations go well, we will have \ntaken care of two of the five Boxer provisions. Will I be happy that \nthese three provisions are not taken care of? No. I am not happy. It is \noutrageous that we can't get it all done. So be it. Let the people \njudge. But we will do as much as we can to improve this bill.\n  This bill as written protects the rights of brutal fathers. There are \nnot many out there, but there are some.\n  There is only one thing that we can do to make matters worse than \nparental consent: that is giving these sexual predators more power over \ntheir children to keep on perpetrating these acts\n\n[[Page S8169]]\n\nand then saying they know how to handle it. They can handle it. Just \ntake a child in the car and go.\n  The bill as written actually forces some young incest victims to get \npermission from their rapist fathers to get an abortion. Can you \nimagine? We have to fix that. And it allows the predator fathers to \ntake their daughters across State lines.\n  We are trying hard to reach an agreement to take care of this \nproblem. I am grateful that we may get two-fifths of the way there on \nmy amendment.\n  I will work hard if this bill becomes law to fix this bill. I will \nintroduce legislation to fix this bill. I will also prepare legislation \nthat goes further than this and says if someone is a victim of rape and \nthey are fearful of telling their parents, that parent, adult, or \ngrandma can't be sued.\n  We really have a long way to go. This bill has many problems. It \nsends a message to young girls: Go it alone. Avoid all of this. Get in \nyour car and go it alone. Don't take anyone with you. If you get in \ntrouble at your moment of need, this bill says go it alone. She can go \nacross the State line on her own. This bill doesn't do anything about \nit--only if she has a parent with her to help her.\n  I believe this bill is unconstitutional. The Supreme Court has been \nclear that abortion restrictions must not impose an undue burden on \nwomen, and they must include a health exception. There is no health \nexception in this bill. If a doctor takes a girl across State lines \nbecause he worries about her health, and if she doesn't get an abortion \nright away and faces paralysis or faces infertility, there is no \nexception in this bill. The doctor can be sued.\n  What kind of message are we sending to young women? Go it alone. What \nkind of message are we sending to fathers who commit incest or mothers \nwho turn a blind eye to it? Oh, don't worry. You are protected. Maybe \nBoxer will get two of her provisions, but we are not going to give you \nthe five. I thought it was one nation under God, indivisible.\n  I didn't think when we cross over State lines we are going to have \nthe pregnancy police look in our cars. This is unconstitutional. You \ndon't have to carry the laws of your own State on your back. If you go \nthrough another State and there is a speed limit that is different than \nthe one you live in, you obey the laws of the State you are in. That is \nthe law you carry on your back, not the State you left. No one could go \ngambling in Nevada if we said: If you live in Tennessee and no gambling \nis allowed, you can't go gamble in Nevada because you will be arrested \nby the police at the border.\n  There are different criminal acts and different penalties in \ndifferent States. Some have tough laws. We know that. States have \nrights.\n  We find it interesting how someone only supports the States when they \nagree with them. But if they don't agree with that State's law, then \nthey try to force another State's law onto the State with which they \ndisagree. I don't know of any other law in history, with the exception \nof the Fugitive Slave Act, that has required citizens to carry the laws \nof their own State on their backs. That was back in the days of \nslavery. If you ran away to another State, you were still stolen \nproperty until the court said no.\n  If you look at the constitutionality issue, if you look at the fact \nthat victims of rape are left in deep trouble, as are victims of \nincest, if you look at the fact that good, kind, loving people like \ngrandmas and grandfathers could go to jail for helping their \ngranddaughter--no matter how you look at this bill, I believe you \nshould come to the conclusion that this bill has major problems.\n  Parental consent--you know something, Senator Ensign is right. People \nsupport the idea that a parent should be contacted by their child and \ntalked to when a child has an unintended pregnancy. We want that so \nmuch. I want that so much.\n  I also want kids to know they could talk to their grandma, they could \ntalk to their grandpa, they could talk to their clergy, they could get \nhelp when they need it.\n  I don't believe the American people support throwing grandma in jail \nbecause she embraced her granddaughter and said: My God, I am worried \nthat your parents, your dad might hurt you if you tell the truth. She \nthrows her arms around the granddaughter and protects her and helps her \nthrough a crisis.\n  I believe stopping an abortion is worth preventing a teen from having \na lifetime of paralysis, infertility, or worse, and yet there is no \nhealth exception in this bill. I think people want us to stop using \nthis issue as a political football.\n  I know who brought this up. It is brought up by the other side of the \naisle every time we have an election.\n  I hope we can join hands to stop teen pregnancies. We had a chance to \ndo it. But no, we had a vote and we lost that vote. It is unreal. We \ngot a couple of Republicans, but not enough.\n  I hope the American people are watching this debate. If our goal is \nto help our young people--and that is the stated goal--there are a lot \nof ways we could help rather than scaring them to death and making them \ngo it alone in a desperate situation, making criminals of their \ngrandmas and their grandpas and their clergy.\n  I am sad that the Teen Pregnancy Prevention Act didn't pass as part \nof this bill. It would have made this bill better. I am glad that we \nare going to have some coming together on the incest amendment, \nalthough as I said, it is only going to take care of two of the five \nproblems we have relating to the bill. But at least we are making a bit \nof progress.\n  The bill, to me, is blatantly unconstitutional. It violates our core \nprinciples of federalism. It puts caring adults in jail and endangers \nthe health and lives of our most vulnerable teens. On that basis it \nought to be defeated.\n  I believe this bill will pass. I also believe our incest amendment \nwill pass. I think that is important. We should have two votes on that. \nI think it is important to have those recorded votes so that the \nmessage goes to the House that their bill blatantly helps the \npredators. I call it the ``Incest Predators Protection Act.'' Thank you \nvery much. I know my time is up. I yield the remainder of my time at \nthis time.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I yield 15 minutes to the Senator from \nSouth Dakota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Nevada, Mr. \nEnsign, for his leadership on this issue and for yielding time and for \nbringing this important matter before the Senate.\n  My colleague from California mentioned that this is an election year \nploy. But I think the last time this was voted on in the Senate was in \n1998. That was a cloture vote. I don't know that there has ever been an \nup-or-down vote in the Senate. It has been voted on in the House.\n  I think most people see this particular provision as something that \nis a commonsense approach to this issue. Obviously, there are a lot of \nlabels that are thrown around in this very contentious debate in our \ncountry. But when it comes to this particular issue, the courts have \nlaid out some parameters under which States can operate when it comes \nto statutes that they adopted that impose conditions and restrictions \non abortion. The undue burden requirement that came out of the Planned \nParenthood v. Casey decision many years ago created this scenario where \nif there is not an undue burden, that statutes enacted by States can \nimpose restrictions. And many States have done that.\n  One that many States have adopted is the issue of parental consent or \nparental notification. In fact, there are about 37 States to date that \nhave adopted in some fashion that particular legislation. Thirty-seven \nStates have enacted statutes imposing legal obligations on pregnant \nminors to notify or gain the consent of their parents before getting an \nabortion. S. 403, which we are debating today, does not supercede or \notherwise alter any of those laws, nor does it impose any parental \nnotice or consent requirement on any State. These are States that \nadopted these laws. The bill would only give effect to a State's \nparental involvement law if that law is constitutional. Therefore, any \nState parental consent law given effect under this bill must contain a \njudicial bypass provision which allows the minor girl to petition a \njudge to waive the parental notification requirement.\n  Just to give you an example of States that have enacted these types \nof laws,\n\n[[Page S8170]]\n\nmy State of South Dakota, for example, requires that a minor under the \nage of 18 have the consent of one parent or judicial bypass to obtain \nan abortion. States in my region and neighboring States such as North \nDakota, require the same thing, only it requires two parents' consent \nor judicial bypass. Nebraska requires essentially the consent of one \nparent or judicial bypass. Iowa requires that a minor must have the \nconsent of one parent or grandparent or judicial bypass. Wyoming \nrequires that a minor under the age of a eighteen must have the consent \nof one parent or judicial bypass. In Minnesota you must have the \nconsent of two parents or judicial bypass. Montana, again, one parent \nor judicial bypass.\n\n  My point very simply is that the States and State legislatures have \nfound, within their purview, ways that are constitutional to address \nwhat is a very gripping issue for the country, one that has created a \ngreat deal, obviously, of debate for the past 30 some years, and I \nsuspect will continue to be debated not only here in legislative bodies \nbut in front of the courts.\n  The courts have laid out a framework, a set of parameters. States \nhave acted accordingly. All this simply does is reinforce those State \nlaws and allow parents to be involved in probably what, without \nargument, has to be one of the most consequential decisions a teenager \nwill ever make. As a parent of two teenage daughters, we talk about \neverything. We talk about where our children want to go to college. I \nhave a teenager who is starting college this year. We talk about who \nthey hang out with on a regular basis. We talk about what they wear, \nobviously, their apparel. We talk about who they date. We talk about \nwho they associate with, all the decisions that they make in their \nlives on a daily basis. We try to stay very involved and engaged in \ntheir lives, for obvious reasons, because that is important as a \nparent.\n  I have a 16-year-old who will be a junior in high school. Ironically, \nin 27 States in this country, my 16-year-old can't get a tattoo without \nthe permission of a parent. In 27 States, my 16-year-old cannot get her \nbody pierced without permission of a parent. Yet we would allow what, \narguably, would be the most consequential decision that child could \never make to go without consultation with a parent. It seems to me that \ncommon sense dictates, and I think most people around this country \nwould agree, whatever side of this issue they find themselves on, this \nis a very common sense way to proceed. Allowing someone to essentially \nbypass a parent and take a minor, a teenager, across the State line to \nhave an abortion is something that crosses not only State lines but \ncrosses the lines of what most Americans would concede makes common \nsense when it comes to the way we raise our children and the kind of \nculture we want to have in our country.\n  I have to say I sure as heck as a parent would not want some other \nperson taking one of my daughters somewhere to have this procedure when \nthe emotional, the health, the medical ramifications of that decision \ncould be so consequential in terms of my daughters, or any daughter, \nany teenager or any minor's future. I cannot imagine that this does not \nmeet the common sense threshold, the test that most Americans would \napply--again, irrespective of what side they find themselves on this \nparticular issue.\n  If you look at this bill, and ultimately what it is designed to do, \nthere are several things that would happen. I believe, if this act \npassed, it would substantially cut down on the number of minors who \nobtain abortions. It has been shown that parental involvement laws can \ndecrease abortions among minors by 8 to 9 percent. Furthermore, Senate \nbill 403 will likely magnify that effect since minors often cross State \nlines to evade their home State laws. The bill does not infringe on \nStates' rights. It merely gives teeth to existing State laws. In fact, \nthe Federal Government will prosecute individuals in violation of this \nact. Senate bill 403 does not mandate individual States to enforce laws \nwhich they have not passed.\n  Additionally, this legislation does not criminalize doctors or the \nyoung women who obtain abortions. It prosecutes only those who take \nminors across State lines in an effort to evade parental involvement \nlaws. In States that do not have parental notification laws, nearly 40 \npercent of minors keep their pregnancies secret. Since abortion is a \nmajor surgical operation, I believe parents need to know if their \ndaughters undergo an abortion so they will be able to help them with \nany potential complications, including both the physical, emotional, \nand mental complications that can arise from the procedure. In cases \nwhere this would be inappropriate because of an abusive relationship, \nthe judicial bypass is still an option.\n  Senate bill 403 will help parents keep their daughters out of \ninappropriate and/or predatory relationships. The American Academy of \nPediatrics Committee on Adolescents estimates that almost two-thirds of \nadolescent mothers have partners over the age of 20. Additionally, in \n58 percent of cases where a daughter does not notify her parents of her \npregnancy, her boyfriend is the one who accompanies her for the \nabortion.\n  Combining those two statistics suggests a substantial number of \nabortions are obtained in an attempt to avoid statutory rape laws. \nUnderage children cannot obtain an aspirin at school without parental \nconsent, but nothing prevents a minor from being transported from her \ncurrent State where parental consent is required to another State where \nshe can legally obtain an abortion without any parental consent. That \nis what this legislation intends to correct. Abortion clinics in States \nwhere there are no parental consent laws actually advertise in States \nrequiring parental consent by using ``no parental consent required'' \nads.\n  This legislation is not unreasonable. As I said earlier, 27 States \nrequire a minor, a person under the age of 18 today, to obtain parental \nconsent to get a tattoo. Essentially, 27 States also require minors, \npersons under the age of 18, to get parental consent to get piercings, \nincluding ear piercings.\n\n  It seems to me, again, as a parent of two teenage daughters, as well \nas someone who is observing the debate we have in this country over \nthis particular issue, this is a reasonable, commonsense approach, a \nmeasure that has been discussed and debated, the constitutionality of \nit addressed.\n  My colleague from California, Senator Boxer, said this is \nunconstitutional. As I said before, the courts have said as long as it \ndoes not impose an undue burden, these types of restrictions fit within \nthe parameters of what is constitutional. Furthermore, under the \nCommerce Clause, the way this particular bill is worded fits within \nthat constitutional framework. I don't think that is a valid argument.\n  One of the arguments that was made, as well, by my colleague from \nCalifornia had to do with the issue of incest. A judge found Arizona \nPlanned Parenthood negligent for failing to report to Child Protective \nServices an abortion performed on a 13-year-old girl in foster care. \nThis girl's case dates back to 1998 when she went in for an abortion at \na Planned Parenthood abortion facility accompanied by her 23-year-old \nfoster brother with whom she was having a sexual relationship. Planned \nParenthood did not notify authorities until the girl returned 6 months \nlater for a second abortion, according to court records.\n  There are lots of examples that can be used, obviously, to support \nwhat this legislation attempts to accomplish. As I said before, this \nissue has not been debated in the Senate for some time, although I will \nsay it has been acted on by the Congress--not in the Senate but by the \nHouse of Representatives. The House earlier this year passed this bill \nby 270 to 157 or something like that, and had voted in 1998, 1999, and \n2002. I was a Member of the House during those years and in every case \nthis legislation passed the House and passed it by very sizable \nmargins.\n  It would make sense that the House, having acted on it this year, \nhaving gotten approximately 270 votes in support, that we have a debate \nin the Senate and have an up-or-down vote on this legislation which, as \nI said earlier, I believe is a reasonable, commonsense approach to \ndealing with what is a very controversial, contentious issue in the \ncountry today.\n  Most Americans would agree that parental notification, parental \nconsent, allowing parents to have involvement,\n\n[[Page S8171]]\n\ninput, consultation, with a teenager who was pregnant and is \nconsidering having an abortion, rather than having that teenager taken \nacross State lines in a way that contradicts the will of the parents, \nmakes a lot of sense. Again, it is an affirmation of parental \ninvolvement, parental rights, an affirmation of States rights, for that \nmatter, too, if you look at all the States that have enacted laws. \nThirty-seven States have enacted, in some form, this kind of \nrequirement. Whether it is notification of one parent and judicial \nbypass or two parents and judicial bypass, but, clearly, there is \nprecedent with all the States that have taken steps. This does not \ncircumvent in any way those State laws. It simply affirms those laws in \nmany respects because the States that have acted in a way that would \nrequire this kind of a notification, this kind of consent, this kind of \ninvolvement on a parental level.\n  Right now, people who are going around that requirement and going \nacross State lines to have abortion procedures are getting around State \nlaws. This is simply a way of drawing parents into the debate and \nmaking sure that, regarding teen abortions in this country, the States \nhave acted accordingly and have adopted statues that require some kind \nof consent, notification, consultation, that those laws are respected, \nand, again, that parents' rights are asserted in this process.\n  I simply add, in closing, my State of South Dakota has this kind of \nlaw on the books. This is something a vast majority of South Dakotans \nwould be very supportive of. As someone who is raising teenage \ndaughters, who on a daily basis is conferring and consulting and \ndiscussing the decisions they make, the day-to-day decisions they make, \nI cannot imagine, for the life of me, not having some input, some \nopportunity to weigh in on an issue of this consequence, that would \nhave the kind of long-term effects--health and emotional effects--on a \nyoung girl.\n  This is about the health of our young girls. It is about the rights \nof parents. It is about States that have acted in accordance with what \nthe courts have given them authority to do and making sure we are \nstanding behind those States and making sure their laws are enforced.\n  I hope when we vote on this--and, again, I appreciate the Senator \nfrom Nevada for his leadership on this issue--we will get a big vote in \nthe Senate. It is the right vote. It has been a lot of years--8 years. \n1998 was the last time we had this debate in the Senate. At that time, \nwe got to a cloture vote, but we did not have an up-or-down vote on the \nunderlying bill.\n  The substance of this bill needs to be voted on. I hope it will be \nvoted on today, that it will be a big vote coming out of the Senate, \nand we can put this on the President's desk and have it signed into \nlaw, which I believe is what a vast majority, I know a vast majority of \nSouth Dakotans would believe, and I believe also a vast majority of \nAmericans.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  (At the request of Mr. Reid, the following statement was ordered to \nbe printed in the Record.)\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to oppose the Child \nCustody Protection Act, which imposes criminal penalties on those who \nhelp transport a minor across State lines to obtain an abortion if she \ndoes not first meet the parental involvement requirements of her home \nState.\n  My primary concern with this legislation is that it unnecessarily \nputs minors' health and well-being in danger. In addition, the language \nis so broadly written that it has the effect of harshly punishing those \nadult family members and loved ones who try to help a young woman in a \ntime of need.\n  In addition to criminalizing the actions intended to assist a young \nwoman with a difficult decision, this bill would create a new civil \naction where parents can file a lawsuit against the individual \nassisting the minor this means relatives, teachers, other trusted \nadults as well as potentially the doctor, nurse or clinic staff all \ncould face civil court action.\n  As a mother and a grandmother, I would argue that, in a perfect \nworld, young women and their parents should communicate openly about \nall major decisions, including whether to terminate a pregnancy. And, \nin fact, many young women do involve a parent in these decisions. \nHowever, the reality is that not all young women live in a household \nwhere they can turn to their parents. Some young women face physical, \nsexual or emotional abuse from their parents; some families do not have \nopen, supporting relationships. For these young women, they may be more \ncomfortable confiding in an older sister, aunt, or a grandparent. Yet \nthis bill would turn these trusted relatives into criminals if they \nhelped her seek an abortion. An unplanned pregnancy is upsetting at any \nage, and this legislation would deprive young women of support when \nthey most need it.\n  First and foremost, this bill flies in the face of accepted legal \nprecedent. While it reflects a great deal of concern for potential \nharms and the violation of parents' rights, it ignores the legal rights \nof young women to choose safe medical care that protects their health.\n  The legislation lacks an essential, constitutionally required \nexception in cases where the restriction it places on the ability of a \nyoung woman to get an abortion endangers her health. I am very \nconcerned that once again language is being proposed that would omit \nthis essential protection for women and girls.\n  The bill provides some limited exceptions to its criminal and civil \nliability by allowing a sister, aunt, grandmother, or friend to help a \ngirl cross a State border to get an abortion if her life was in danger. \nBut it does not protect actions taken if her health was in danger.\n  First of all, the Supreme Court has repeatedly affirmed that there \nmust be protection for both the life and health of the mother.\n  The Supreme Court has ruled time and again from Doe v. Bolton, 1973, \nto Planned Parenthood v. Casey, 1992, to Stenberg v. Carhart, 2000, \nthat any law restricting access to abortion must contain an exception \nto protect a woman's health.\n  Most recently, three Federal courts in California, New York, and \nNebraska declared the partial birth abortion ban, which was passed by \nCongress and signed into law in 2003, unconstitutional and permanently \nenjoined its enforcement.\n  All three courts concluded that the law was unconstitutional because \nit lacked an exception to protect a woman's health.\n  This measure before the Senate today ignores these precedents and \ndemonstrates a complete disregard for the health of young women.\n  Secondly, in addition to being unconstitutional, this is bad public \npolicy. If a girl turns to her sister to ask for help because she is \nhaving complications with a hidden pregnancy how are either of them \ngoing to know whether the complication is life threatening or not? Do \nwe really want to create a situation where a girl's sister, aunt, \ngrandmother or friend has to step into the shoes of a doctor and \ndetermine whether complications with a pregnancy are life threatening \nor face criminal and civil charges for helping her? This could occur \neven if the girl wants to continue her pregnancy but because of health \ncomplications cannot.\n  Does Congress really want to say it is the best public policy to have \nyoung women and girls who are in traumatic situations not get medical \nassistance because it could result in an abortion for a non-life-\nthreatening complication?\n  Let's be clear, that is the impact of this legislation. I believe it \nis unconstitutional and bad public policy. A pregnant minor who feels \nshe cannot confide in a parent is already left with few options.\n  She can seek a judicial bypass. But few young women have the tools to \nnavigate our complex legal system. The legal system is very difficult \nfor the average adult to manage let alone a minor in an extremely \ndifficult and vulnerable position. In addition, the legal system has \ndemands that further restrict a girl's access; for instance, court \nhours are usually 9 to 5, requiring a young woman to miss school in \norder to appear in court. And many girls are reluctant to discuss such \na personal decision that could involve traumatic experiences with a \njudge.\n  She may delay her decision. However, an abortion that occurs later in \nher pregnancy will be more dangerous and complicated than one that \noccurs in\n\n[[Page S8172]]\n\nthe early stages of her pregnancy. She may opt to travel out of State, \nalone, undergoing a medical procedure with no family or friends there \nto support her.\n  She may seek a dangerous and illegal abortion. A pregnant minor who \ncannot safely tell a parent about her situation faces enough obstacles. \nWe do not need to criminalize well-intentioned assistance provided to \nher.\n  I am also concerned that it is not only the young women making a \ndeliberate choice not to tell a parent of an abortion who would suffer \nunder this bill. Access to abortion is declining in this country, for \nwomen of all ages. Eighty-seven percent of counties no longer have a \ndoctor who will perform an abortion. For many women, the most \nconvenient provider is across State lines.\n  An older sister or aunt accompanying a minor to the nearest provider \nmay unwittingly become a criminal. Even if neither woman intended to \nevade parental consent laws, this act of family support would be \ncriminalized. A grandmother or sister could have no idea that she is \nviolating a Federal law when she helps a family member access legal \nmedical care.\n  But proponents of this legislation would like you to believe that \nthis debate is not about young women who can no longer find a doctor \nwho will provide full services in their home State. To them, this is \nnot about the young women who, for whatever reason, need to look beyond \na parent for adult support.\n  While supporters of this bill are correctly horrified by stories of \ngirls kidnapped by older boyfriends and forced into having abortions \nthey did not want, this legislation does not create a limited solution \nto fix that problem. In fact, in many cases the actions in these \ncircumstances are already illegal. Laws prohibit kidnapping. Laws \nprohibit statutory rape. Medical ethics require that physicians obtain \ninformed consent from the patient before performing any medical \nprocedure. People who violate these laws can already be prosecuted. I \nwelcome a debate on policies that will crack down further on sexual \npredators who abuse young women.\n  If there is a problem that current laws are not being enforced, then \nlet's address that; if there is a problem that these laws are not \nstrong enough, then let's address that, but let's not criminalize \nbehavior of a loving family member, friend, or confidant who is trying \nto help a young girl in a traumatic time in her life.\n  This bill is not about protecting vulnerable young women from crime. \nIt is about limiting their access to a constitutionally protected \nmedical procedure. This legislation does reflect a great deal of \nconcern for potential harms and the violation of rights--of parents.\n  Under this proposal, a parent has legal recourse if his or her \nsupposed ``right'' to stop their daughter's abortion is violated. \nParents can sue to collect damages.\n  This bill, in fact, could create a situation in which a mother sues a \ngrandmother for helping her granddaughter exercise her right to choose. \nYet it leaves a young woman with no recourse for the violation of their \nright to seek and receive safe medical care of her choice.\n  This legislation also runs counter to basic notions of federalism, \nlinking a young woman to the law of her home State no matter where she \nmay be living. No other State laws follow her to college or summer \ncamp.\n  In this country, State laws do not extend beyond State borders. When \nresidents from my home State of California travel to Nevada for \nvacations, they are allowed to play the slot machines, even though \ngambling is illegal at home. There is no reason why laws should reach \nacross State lines to restrict access to a safe and legal medical \nprocedure.\n  I wish this were a perfect world. I wish we could legislate that \nevery child has a loving and stable parent to guide him or her through \nthe trials of adolescence. I wish we could legislate that every family \ntalk openly and honestly about the risks of sexual activity.\n  But we cannot. Parental consent laws do not create these idealized \nfamilies. Instead, they further burden those that are already troubled. \nA young woman facing an unplanned pregnancy in an unstable situation \nmust be able to turn to another trusted adult--without the fear of \nsubjecting the adult to Federal criminal liability.\n  The very fact that we are having this debate is a clear demonstration \nof the leadership's misplaced priorities. They claim this is a women's \nhealth issue, a family values issue.\n  We have only a few legislative days remaining this year. There are so \nmany other problems we should be addressing.\n  We should be debating ways to prevent these difficult situations from \narising in the first place. We should be discussing policies that \npromote honest information about reproductive health and ready access \nto contraceptives. No teen should face an unplanned pregnancy. Those \nthat do must not face it alone.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in opposing this bill that endangers \nyoung women's health and turns their relatives into criminals.\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, today the Senate considered legislation \nthat proponents claim will reduce the number of abortions. But in \nreality everyone knows this legislation will do little to lower the \nnumber of abortions, and it will do even less to protect the role of \nparents in our society. In a move that is all too typical of the \ncoarsening partisanship of this city and of this Congress, instead of \nbringing before the Senate legislation that could actually reduce the \nnumber of abortions, the Senate Republican leader decided to just check \nanother on the Republican ``To Do'' list before election day this \nNovember.\n  It is sad that the Senate has missed this opportunity to enact \nlegislation to reduce teen pregnancy. Every Senator agrees that we \nshould do more to reduce incidences of teen pregnancy. And yet the bill \ndebated in the Senate today is little more than a political stunt that \nwill do little to reduce the number of abortions.\n  This is not the first time we have faced legislation like this which \nreflects a political calculus, not a policy consideration. In 1998, \njust prior to that year's election, the Republican leadership brought \nforward a similar bill. I opposed that legislation as well, as it \nfailed to take meaningful steps towards reducing abortions and because \nit threatened to endanger victims of rape, incest, or abusive family \nsituations.\n  If the Senate Republican leadership were really serious about \nreducing the number of abortions among young women, they'd get serious \nabout efforts to prevent unwanted pregnancies in the first place. \nResearch shows that reducing unintended pregnancies significantly \nreduces the rate of abortion. And the good news is that we know what \nworks to prevent unwanted pregnancies in the first place. In fact, the \namendment offered by Senators Lautenberg and Menendez earlier today, \nwhich I cosponsored, would take meaningful steps to reduce teen \npregnancy. Communities need to provide education for our children so \nthey understand the serious consequences of their decisions; we need to \nsupport effective, existing after-school programs that provide academic \nenrichment for at-risk kids; and we need to invest in new efforts to \nhelp reduce teen pregnancy.\n  If the Senate leadership were really serious about reducing the \nnumber of abortions, they would get serious about providing support for \nfoster care and adoption. Instead, last year this Congress limited the \nnumber of children eligible for foster care and reduced funding for \nstate foster care systems. What kind of family values does that \nrepresent?\n  If the Senate leadership were really serious about reducing the \nnumber of abortions, we would address the problems that working \nfamilies face in raising their children. We would increase the minimum \nwage and extend the earned income tax credit so that the decision \nwhether to have an abortion is not based on whether there is enough \nmoney to support the child.\n  This is where we should be focusing our energy--on providing families \nwith the tools they need to raise a family; on providing mothers with \nthe care they need to carry out their pregnancies, and on educating our \nteens about the consequences of their actions.\n  But then again, the Child Custody Protection Act isn't intended to \nreduce\n\n[[Page S8173]]\n\nteen pregnancies. In fact, it accomplishes very little except to risk \ntaking a very young victim of rape or incest--a victim of an abusive \nfamily situation--someone who is just plain scared--and putting someone \nthey turn to at risk of criminal prosecution, jail time and fines if \nthey decide to help a minor with one of the most painful decisions a \nperson could be asked to make. It targets the most vulnerable minors--\nthose needing the most help because of poor family relations or even \nserious abuse--and makes it more difficult for them to receive critical \nadvice and support.\n  Is it right to punish a victim of incest by forcing her to get \nconsent from the very person who impregnated her? What rational person \nwouldn't agree that she has been victimized enough already? Is it \nreally smart, or fair, or right to punish and remove the caring adult \nwho a young woman in this situation is relying on to get her through \nsuch an ordeal? Is it right to consider sending a grandparent, a clergy \nmember, a doctor, or a counselor to prison if a terrified young woman \nhas nowhere else to turn?\n  This discussion isn't about most families. If one of my daughters \nwere in a terrible situation, I believe they could and would turn to me \nor to their late mother. I know they could. I think every one of us in \nthe Senate know our children would turn to us in a time of desperation. \nThat is how we raised our kids. Ideally all young women facing an \nunplanned pregnancy will turn to their parents for guidance when faced \nwith this kind of decision. And in most cases they do. In fact, one \nstudy found that the overwhelming majority of parents in states without \nmandatory parental involvement laws knew of their child's pregnancy. \nBut 30 percent of young women who did not tell their parents about \ntheir decision did so out of fear of violence in the family or fear of \nbeing forced to leave home. What does that tell you about these \nsituations? It tells you this bill does not address the real-life \ntragic situations in which awful decisions are being made.\n  This bill is not the way we should be addressing the problem of \nunwanted pregnancies. We should not be criminalizing grandparents or \nclergy or doctors who try to help young women in horrible situations. \nWe should not be criminalizing that small percentage of people willing \nto accompany a minor-in-need to obtain an otherwise legal abortion.\n  Here's the bottom line: If this bill had simply made exceptions for \nyoung women in abusive situations--like rape, or incest--and ensured \nthat children who were endangered if they turned to their parents would \nhave a responsible, caring adult to turn to, I would have voted for it. \nAnd I guarantee so would all of my colleagues. Mr. President, 100 to 0, \nthat's the kind of statement we could have made--but that kind of unity \nwas sacrificed on the altar of Republican wedge-issue politics.\n  Of course, parents should be fully involved in all decisions \nregarding their children, but refusing to take into account possible \nfamily dysfunction, including abuse or incest, would be both \nunconstitutional and unacceptable. It would be dangerous. It would be \nanything but pro-life. Not every child is lucky enough to have a \nsupportive family, and I can't imagine that any person would fail to \nunderstand that it just doesn't make sense for a 16-year-old who has \nbeen raped or abused by a parent to get consent from that abuser. There \nmust be a way to bring a supportive and nurturing adult into that \ndifficult decision. This bill forecloses that possibility.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, just last week the Senate unanimously \napproved landmark legislation that will help protect American children \nfrom violent sexual predators and other such criminals who would do \nthem harm.\n  I proudly cosponsored and worked to strengthen that bill--The Adam \nWalsh Child Protection and Safety Act of 2006 because the States \nneeded, and asked for, the Federal Government's help to detect and \ndeter violent sexual predators. The nationwide sex offender database \nand registration requirements are critical components that help prevent \nviolent sexual predators from slipping underground and out of sight. \nIndeed, the Senate's passage of the Adam Walsh Act was a banner day for \nthe safety of our children.\n  And today, Mr. President, the Senate will consider another important \nmeasure to protect the health and safety of American children--in \nparticular, female minors. I am referring, of course, to S. 403, the \nChild Custody Protection Act. I am proud to join Senator Ensign and a \nbipartisan group of over 40 Senators that have cosponsored this \nlegislation.\n  This long-overdue proposal amends the Federal Criminal Code to \nprohibit the transportation of a minor across State lines--without \nparental consent or notification--in order to obtain an abortion. To \ndate, at least 37 States have laws on the books that require a minor \ngirl who wishes to have an abortion to notify or obtain the consent of \nher parents. But let's be clear: this bill neither establishes a \nFederal parental consent law, nor supersedes existing State laws. It \nmerely reinforces the prerogatives of those States that have enacted \nparental notification and consent laws.\n  So the question before the Senate today is a straightforward one: \nShould Congress safeguard the legislative choice made by those States \nthat have chosen to preserve the role of parents and guardians in the \nhealth and medical decisions of their children--particularly, their \nminor daughters? I believe that we must safeguard State prerogatives by \nprotecting parental rights.\n  If a State has on its books a constitutionally sound parental \nnotification or consent law, parents in that State should not have to \nfear that their minor daughters can legally be driven into a \nneighboring State to receive an abortion.\n  This is not a hypothetical concern. The New York Times reported that \n``Planned Parenthood in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania has a parental \nconsent law] has a list of clinics, from New York to Baltimore, to \nwhich they will refer teenagers, according to the organization's \nexecutive director . . . .''\n  Even more disturbing, there is evidence that abortion clinics in \nStates bordering Pennsylvania--States that don't have parental \ninvolvement laws--will advertise the lack of such requirements and use \nit as a selling point in their advertisements directed at minors in \nPennsylvania.\n  I also worry that interstate transportation of minors to have \nabortions may be used to conceal criminal activity--like statutory \nrape. I, for one, believe that we ought to make it a Federal crime for \nan adult male who impregnates a young girl to transport her out of her \nhome State--without the knowledge and consent of her parents--in order \nto have an abortion. That is just common sense.\n  Mr. President, this legislation is not about abortion rights. It is \nabout protecting the health and safety of children and preserving the \nrole of parents in decisions concerning their child's medical care.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this bill.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, as a cosponsor of the Child Custody \nProtection Act, I am pleased to see that this legislation is finally \nbeing considered and hopeful that it will be passed quickly.\n  S. 403 makes subject to fines or imprisonment up to 1 year anyone who \n``knowingly transports a minor across a State line, with the intent \nthat such minor obtain an abortion, and thereby in fact abridges the \nright of a parent under a law requiring parental involvement in a \nminor's abortion decision, in force in the State where the minor \nresides.''\n  The provision I cite is an admirably clear piece of legislative \nlanguage. It not only makes a salutary change in existing law; it \nprovides an convincing explanation as to why it is needed.\n  Notwithstanding the abortion debate's notoriously divisive character, \nparental involvement statutes constitute an area of near-consensus \naround which pro-life and pro-choice Americans can come together.\n  Forty-five States--including my own--have enacted statutes aimed at \nensuring that parents of minor girls are not deprived of the \nopportunity involved in this most sensitive decision, one with profound \nimplications for their daughters' physical and mental health.\n  Public opinion polls demonstrate overwhelming support for the \nproposition that in all but the most extraordinary circumstances--in \nwhich instances, the State statutes in question\n\n[[Page S8174]]\n\nprovide for a judicial bypass--parents must be involved in decisions \naffecting the health of their minor children.\n  Unfortunately, the public record now provides ample evidence \nsuggesting that these laws are frequently circumvented--often by \nindividuals who by facilitating an abortion may be covering up evidence \nof a crime: statutory rape.\n  When abortionists buy advertisements in the yellow pages directories \nserving communities in neighboring States with parental involvement \nstatutes, and when they adorn the ads with helpful reminders that their \nservices can be obtained without parental consent, both the authority \nof State lawmakers and the sanctity of the parent-child bond are \nmocked.\n  As a father and grandfather, I believe it is vital that the Senate \ntoday draw a line against this egregious manifestation of the abortion \nculture. Colleagues who support a liberal abortion regime but claim \nthat they want the practice to be rare should welcome this opportunity \nto support a unifying commonsense measure that helps give effect to \npublic policies embraced by legislators of both parties in the States.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I will vote in favor of the \nChild Custody Protection Act.\n  I support the Florida law which was enacted after voters approved an \namendment to the Florida Constitution. The law requires that Florida \nparents must be notified prior to their minor child obtaining an \nabortion, and it provides that a judge can grant an exception.\n  This act will help ensure that minors in Florida consult with their \nparents before obtaining an abortion in another State, while also \npreserving the ability of minors to seek a judicial waiver when that \nnotice is not in the best interest of the minor.\n  The ultimate goal must be to prevent teen pregnancy so that none of \nour children find themselves in these difficult situations, and thus I \nalso supported the amendment to provide Federal grants for programs \nthat educate minors on the use of contraceptives and abstinence.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, it has always been my firm belief that \nminors should be required to notify their parents prior to seeking an \nabortion. I cannot help but believe that in nearly every case, young \nwomen do themselves, their babies, and their families well to seek \nguidance from their parents or legal guardians before making such a \nserious decision. Most parents honestly do have their daughters' best \ninterests at heart. Consequently, how can parents not be informed when \ntheir children are confronted with making one of the most critical \ndecisions of their lives, one which carries with it such extraordinary, \nexpensive, and irretrievable consequences?\n  I have a long history of support for parental notification in such \ndifficult circumstances. In 1991, I supported legislation that would \nhave required entities receiving grants under Title X of the Public \nHealth Service Act to provide parental notification in the case of \nminor patients seeking abortions.\n  While I support parental notification, I would also observe that we, \nas a nation, must work harder and do more to ensure that young women \nunderstand the consequences of unwanted pregnancy before they find \nthemselves in such a predicament. We need to return to a time when \nabstinence was respected, not denigrated. A time when young men and \nwomen were praised and rewarded spiritually, emotionally, and \nfinancially--for doing the right thing.\n  Today, little girls are encouraged to become sexual at younger and \nyounger ages by a consumer society that cares more about what it can \nsell than what it can teach. The entertainment culture, with its \n``sleaze'' does all Americans, and particularly young women, a \ndespicable disservice. Repulsive lyrics and morally offensive videos \ndegrade women to the point where little girls as young as 10 or 12 \nyears of age come to believe that their only real value lies not in \nthemselves but in bearing the child of a teen-aged boy. How truly sad.\n  We all recognize that the family is, and has been, in crisis. We \nwould all like to see a reduction in unwanted pregnancies and abortion. \nNo one is pro-abortion. But the question remains, what are we doing to \nprevent these unwanted pregnancies--meaning what are all of us \ntogether, on both sides of the aisle, doing to prevent them? Aren't \nthere more creative ways in which we could be bolstering the self-\nesteem of young women?\n  Let us not forget that the future of humanity passes through the \nfamily, and that each of us must, in our own way, fulfill our duty to \npreserve the family. As John Kennedy once put it so succinctly and so \nbeautifully, ``On Earth, God's work must truly be our own.''\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Child \nCustody Protection Act, which prohibits transporting a minor across \nState lines to obtain an abortion if doing so abridges a parental \nnotification or consent statute in the State in which the minor \nresides. The bill also provides an exception for cases where an \nabortion is necessary to save the minor's life. I am proud to say that \nI am a cosponsor of this bill and I supported it in past Congresses.\n  One of the most important roles of parents is to provide guidance and \ncomfort to their children. Parents are more mature and possess the \nwisdom of experience that children simply cannot possess. In no other \ncircumstance is the need for parental guidance more important than when \na child requires medical care. Who is in a better position to provide a \nchild's relevant medical and psychological history and other valuable \nmedical information than a parent? Not only has the Supreme Court \nrecognized the importance of parental rights with regard to the ``care, \ncustody, and control of their children'' as ``perhaps the oldest of the \nfundamental liberty interests,'' they have also acknowledged the \nimportance of parental guidance and consent when a child is faced with \na difficult decision by stating ``the law's concept of family rests on \na presumption that parents possess what a child lacks in maturity, \nexperience, and capacity for judgment required for making life's \ndifficult decisions.''\n  At a time when a school nurse cannot even administer aspirin to a \nchild with a headache without parental consent, how can we allow a \nchild to have an abortion, a major medical procedure with potentially \ndeadly consequences, without parental consent? I can think of no other \ntime when parental guidance and consent is more important than when \nthat parent's minor daughter is pregnant and contemplating abortion. A \nminor girl, who is undoubtedly under incredible stress, does not have \nthe maturity to make the decision to have an abortion on her own. And, \nit makes matters worse when the girl receives pressure to have an \nabortion from the father, the father's family, or others.\n  As a father, it appalls me to learn that oftentimes older adult males \npressure young mothers to have an abortion without telling anyone and \ntransport these young girls into States without parental consent laws \nto hide instances of statutory rape. Studies show that the majority of \ntoday's teenage mothers are being impregnated by adult men. One study \nof 46,500 schoolage mothers in California found that two-thirds of the \ngirls were impregnated by adult males, with the median age of the \nfather being 22 years old. The fact that many of these adult males \ncould be charged with statutory rape creates an incentive for them to \ntransport young girls across state lines to have an abortion to avoid \ncriminal prosecution.\n  Mr. President, the pro-abortion lobby has come out in full force \nagainst the Child Custody Protection Act saying that it infringes upon \na girl's right to have an abortion. I have two major objections to that \nargument. First, I do not believe that a minor child has the right to \nan abortion without her parents' consent. At a time when children \ncannot even be given aspirin without parental consent, they should not \nbe able to undergo a major medical procedure with potentially deadly \nconsequences without parental consent. Second, the Child Custody \nProtection Act is not about the right to have an abortion; it is about \nprotecting the rights of parents and the well-being of children. It is \ncommonsense legislation that says if one State has established a legal \nprinciple for its residents, neighboring States should not discourage \nthose residents from following that principle. This is hardly a radical \nor\n\n[[Page S8175]]\n\nextreme proposal; rather, it is necessary, constitutional, and it is \ncarefully and narrowly drawn. I hope that my colleagues can support \nthis very important, commonsense legislation, which protects our most \nvulnerable citizens--our children.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, this morning we are continuing our \ndiscussion of the Child Custody Protection Act, S. 403. This is an \nappropriate debate, and it comes at an appropriate time.\n  Last week, the Senate passed the Adam Walsh Child Protection and \nSafety Act. That important bipartisan bill, which the President is \nexpected to sign this week, will empower the Federal Government to step \nup the fight against sexual predators of children.\n  The bill we passed last Thursday is a serious bipartisan achievement, \nand for good reason. Republicans and Democrats alike can agree on the \nneed to protect minors from abuse. That same purpose, the desire to \nprotect children, is what motivates the Child Custody Protection Act, \nand my hope is that we can come together on this bill as well, \nRepublicans and Democrats, and pass this legislation.\n  The American people have spoken. Our States have spoken. Though the \nmedia might not always hear the message, Americans are quite unified, \nand have been for a long time, on the issue of abortion. \nSupermajorities of the American people think that some regulation of \nabortion is appropriate. Nowhere is this more obvious than on the issue \nof parental consent and notification laws.\n  Most Americans understand that a parent or a guardian should be \ninvolved in this decision. The Child Custody Protection Act will give \nFederal support to State laws requiring this involvement, laws that are \ntoo often circumvented when young girls are taken across State lines to \nobtain an abortion, often with the assistance of the predatory men \nresponsible for their pregnancies.\n  These actions are terrible for families and young women. They are a \ndanger to a young woman's health and to her spirit. And, indeed, the \ninvolvement of a parent or guardian is critical when a young woman is \nmaking a choice of this magnitude, and we should do our part to support \nthese parental involvement laws.\n  This bill does so by making it a Federal crime to transport a minor \nacross a State line to obtain an abortion that would not be permitted \nabsent parental involvement in the State where the minor resides. This \nis a limited and a reasonable bill. It specifies that neither the minor \nnor a parent can be prosecuted or sued for violation of the act. It \nalso provides defendants in a prosecution or civil action an \naffirmative defense if they believed the required parental notice or \ninvolvement took place. Finally, it creates a private right of action \nfor the parent or guardian whose rights are violated by a person who \nviolates the act.\n  This is a balanced bill. And my hope is that my colleagues will \nsupport it.\n  Forty-four States have enacted laws that require some level of \nparental involvement in a minor's decision to obtain an abortion. \nParental involvement laws are not a divisive issue. They are reasonable \nregulations. At many middle schools and high schools, you cannot get an \naspirin from the school nurse without permission from your parents. \nWould it really make sense to allow a young girl, perhaps only 14 years \nold, to obtain an abortion without her parents' involvement?\n  The liberal pro-abortion interest groups routinely tell us that women \nmust have completely unfettered access to abortion throughout their \npregnancies. And they typically give two reasons. First, this is a \nprivate, medical decision between a woman and her doctor. And second, \nthis is a moral choice that the woman should be able to make without \nany interference at all. These principles are taken to extremes by \nthese groups. They lead to opposition of almost any regulation of \nabortion, including informed-consent laws, and even partial-birth \nabortion. Parental involvement regulations are commonsense and widely \nsupported by the American people. But the reasoning of these interest \ngroups leads them to a position of abortion absolutism--there can be no \ninterference at any time with the decision to undergo this medical \nprocedure.\n  I disagree with these arguments. Even so, taking these groups on \ntheir own terms leads me to believe that they should actually support \nparental involvement laws. After all, if abortion is a medical \nprocedure, do we really want minors electing invasive medical \nprocedures without a parent or guardian knowing about it? And if the \ndecision to have an abortion is a profound moral choice, do we really \nwant a child to make that choice without consulting with the parents \nwho are responsible for teaching and raising that child? Of course not. \nAnd so the American people have reasonably, and responsibly, endorsed \nwith considerable bipartisan support, the parental involvement laws \nthat exist in 44 States.\n  Recently, my home State of Utah passed its own law. It is a good law. \nAnd it is a careful law. My State requires that before a minor obtains \nan abortion there must be notification of, and consent by, a parent or \nguardian. Our parental consent requirement prohibits a doctor from \nperforming an abortion without first obtaining the written consent of a \nparent or guardian. And consistent with the Supreme Court's requirement \nthat some judicial bypass be included in a parental consent statute, \nUtah allows a minor to obtain an abortion without the consent of a \nparent or guardian if a court finds by the preponderance of the \nevidence that the minor has given informed consent and is mature enough \nto be capable of giving her informed consent or that the abortion would \nbe in the minor's best interest. That is a reasonable balance. The \ninterest groups that oppose any and every restriction on abortion \nalways tell us that this is an important choice. Well, if it is an \nimportant choice, I believe we should require that a minor's choice be \nan informed one.\n  Utah law also requires that a doctor, prior to performing an \nabortion, notify a parent or guardian. Again, this is reasonable. Why \nwould we allow a young woman to undergo a medical procedure without \nfirst notifying those charged with her well-being? We would not allow \nit for a routine checkup, much less any other invasive surgical \nprocedure. And Utah's legislators were careful in the way they went \nabout this. They knew that in certain circumstances, a young woman \nmight not want to notify her parents. For that reason, there are \ngenerous exceptions to this notice requirement.\n  If a medical emergency exists, the notice requirement is waived. If \nthe physician reports to the proper State agency that the pregnancy \noccurred through incest, or if the child is a victim of abuse, the \nparent responsible for the physical or sexual abuse need not be \nnotified. And if the legal parent or guardian has not assumed \nresponsibility for the young girl's upbringing, that parent or guardian \nneed not be notified.\n  Utah's citizens are not unique. As the citizens in most other States \nhave, Utahns have determined that some level of parental involvement in \nthis process is an important one. The interest groups disagree. And as \na result, there is some opposition to this commonsense bill.\n  Here is the bottom-line. Forty-four States have parental involvement \nlaws. In my opinion, some of those State parental involvement laws are \nineffectual, but in 26, parents are effectively guaranteed the right to \nparental notification or consent. Yet with minor children, too often \nthey are being taken across State lines, to a State with a more liberal \nabortion policy, to obtain an abortion without their parents' \ninvolvement. Taking a minor across State lines without her parents' \nknowledge? Most people would call this kidnapping. And in many cases, \nthe actions come close.\n  I want to thank my colleague from Alabama, Senator Sessions, for \nchairing a hearing in the Judiciary Committee on this subject in the \n108th Congress. The hearing was very informative. This is what we \nlearned from the testimony presented there:\n  The American Academy of Pediatrics Committee on Adolescence has found \nthat ``[a]lmost two thirds of adolescent mothers have partners older \nthan 20 years of age.''\n  The National Center for Health Statistics concluded that ``among \ngirls 14 or younger when they first had sex, a majority of these first \n. . . experiences were nonvoluntary. Evidence also indicates that among \nunmarried teenage\n\n[[Page S8176]]\n\nmothers, two-thirds of the fathers are age 20 or older, suggesting that \ndifferences in power and status exist between many sexual partners.''\n  In a study of over 46,000 pregnancies by school-age girls in \nCalifornia, researchers found that ``71%, or over 33,000, were fathered \nby adult post-high-school men whose mean age was 22.6 years, an average \nof five years older than the mothers . . . Even among junior high \nschool mothers aged 15 or younger, most births are fathered by adult \nmen 6 to 7 years their senior. Men aged 25 or older father more births \namong California school-age girls than do boys under age 18.''\n  I could go on, and I want to thank Professor Teresa Collett of the \nUniversity of St. Thomas School of Law for putting these statistics \ntogether in her testimony. They are important. They remain \nuncontroverted by those opposed to this bill. And they tell an \nimportant story.\n  Many thousands of teenage pregnancies are caused by predatory males, \nmany years the girl's senior, who should be prosecuted for statutory \nrape. Let's be clear. Many thousands of teenage pregnancies are caused \nby felonious activity--scared and pregnant young girls; wounded and \nabused by these sexual predators.\n  And parental involvement laws go a long way toward making sure that \npeople become aware of this abuse. Yet currently, it is too easy for \nthese predators to circumvent these laws.\n  We have heard of older men, or their mothers, or their friends, who \ntake these vulnerable young girls across State lines to get an \nabortion, and get rid of the evidence of the crime. And then when these \ngirls are dumped back at home, those who care for them and love them \nare oblivious to what they have been through. This is not only \nphysically dangerous. It is a threat to the spirit of a wounded and \nconfused young woman.\n  This is not some hypothetical situation. In the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee, we heard from Joyce Farley of Dushore, PA. In 1995 her \ndaughter, Crystal, was raped and impregnated by a 19-year-old man whose \nmother then took Crystal for an abortion into the State of New York.\n  This was not a decision for this man, or his mother to make. These \npeople were not interested in making the right decision for Crystal. \nThey were making a decision that was in the best interests of the man \nwho raped this child.\n  The Child Custody Protection Act would protect these young women. It \nwould protect the rights of parents.\n  The decision to obtain an abortion is an important one. It is a \nmedical decision, but it is also so much more. It is a decision that \nwill impact a woman for the rest of her life. And it is a decision that \na minor should, in most cases, make with the involvement of a parent or \na legal guardian.\n  This important bill that my colleague from Nevada, Senator Ensign, \nhas introduced will go a long way toward discouraging the abuse that \noften leads to teenage pregnancy, toward protecting minors from \npredatory males, and toward protecting the constitutionally recognized \nright of States to involve parents in these important decisions.\n  I look forward to this debate. There should be some bipartisan \nconsensus on this issue, and my hope is that we will reach one. This is \na bill that is worthy of our support. It protects the rights of parents \nthat have been recognized by the States that we represent.\n  We should do our best to support those rights. I encourage my \ncolleagues to support this bill.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am disappointed that the Senate is \nbypassing normal procedure to debate a controversial bill on which the \nSenate refused to proceed 8 years ago. That was the last action taken \non this kind of bill. Since then 8 years have passed. Our Constitution \nhas not changed. I am thankful for that. The complex issues and \nfederalism concerns that so many Senators voiced 8 years ago still \nremain. So if anything has changed, it is difficult to know. Instead of \nregular order and allowing the committee of jurisdiction to gather the \nfacts, to consider the legislation, to amend it or reject it, we find \nourselves proceeding almost helter-skelter on what is a very serious \nmatter with important personal, privacy and legal implications.\n  It is a striking contrast that we turn to this bill after last week's \nbipartisan unifying effort in which we took four months to hold nine \nhearings and work with our counterparts in the House to reauthorize key \nprovisions of the historic Voting Rights Act of 1965. If that process \nexemplified the Senate at its best, this proceeding stands in sharp \ncontrast. The press is reporting that the Senate is being required to \nturn to this bill at this time as part of the Republican-designed run \nup to the elections. Having spent time on a constitutional amendment \nthat would have cut back on the Bill or Rights, having wasted precious \ntime seeking to write discrimination into the Constitution, this is \nnext on their campaign checklist of items needed to rev up their voting \nbase. In fact, having just seen the President reject our efforts to \nauthorize Federal funds for vital stem cell research with his first \nofficial veto, they now rush to reopen the abortion debate. I am a \nlittle surprised they are not seeking another vote on some further \nintervention into the circumstances of Terri Schiavo and her family.\n  In fact, the bill before us, like the legislation rushed to the floor \nto intervene in Florida's legal system in the case of Terri Schiavo, is \nanother case of congressional overreaching and of trying to federalize \ndecisions that previously have been left to the States. I unequivocally \nsupport the goal of fostering closer familial relationships and the \nvalue of encouraging parental involvement in a child's decision about \nhow to respond to an unplanned pregnancy. We all do. That is not the \nissue. I thank Senators Boxer, Menendez, Lautenberg, and Feinstein for \nbringing amendments seeking to make this legislative consideration \nworthwhile and beneficial to those in need of government help, rather \nthan an imposition of the heavy hand of government intervention. I \nsupport their amendments.\n  The underlying bill, however, raises challenging issues of federalism \nthat caused many of us to reject it before and will lead me to oppose \nit, again. I find it ironic that many of the same people who insist \nthat fully considered State laws on civil union and civil partnership \nand marriage not be respected, are those who in the context of this \nlegislation insist that State laws be held to bind people even when \nthey travel outside their States, and that Federal criminal law become \nthe enforcement mechanism to ensure that they are binding.\n  The underlying bill does little to strengthen communication and trust \nin families. While I know as a father that most parents hope their \nchildren would turn to them in times of crisis, no law will make that \nhappen. No law will force a young pregnant woman to talk to her parents \nwhen she is too frightened to do so. This bill does not increase the \nperception of choices for such young women. Rather, it is likely to \ndrive young women who are afraid to seek help from their families away \nfrom their families and greatly increase the dangers they face from an \nunwanted pregnancy.\n  The nature of our Federal system revolves around States maintaining \ntheir historically dominant role in developing and implementing \npolicies that affect family matters, such as marriage, divorce, end-of-\nlife choices, child custody and policies on parental involvement in \nminors' abortion decisions. I respect that. I respect each State to \ndefine those family relationships and have resisted Federal intrusion \ninto those matters. Congress should not dictate the nature of family \nrelationships. I had hoped we learned our lesson on this when the \nAmerican people reacted with outrage to the President and Congress \nintervening in the Terri Schiavo matter.\n  Twenty-six States have adopted parental consent or notification laws \nthat are currently enforced and meet the bill's definition of a ``law \nrequiring parental involvement in a minor's abortion decision.'' That \nmeans that the remaining States--the 24 States that include Vermont--\neither have opted for no such law, or have decided on a State law that \nallows for the involvement of adults other than a parent or guardian in \nthe minor's reproductive decision. While I respect the 26 notification \nlaw States, I also respect the 24 other States and the privacy rights \nguaranteed by the Constitution. The direct consequence of this bill\n\n[[Page S8177]]\n\nwould be to federalize the reach of the most constricted notification \nlaws and to override the policies in the remaining States.\n  It is telling that the bill does not expressly establish a Federal \nparental consent requirement. It does not directly override the various \nState laws in this area of traditional State interest. Instead, it \nseeks to do indirectly what it will not and likely could not do \ndirectly. Doing so makes it no less an abuse of Federal power. The \nunderlying bill would use the power and resources of the Federal \nGovernment to force favored States' laws into effect in the other \nStates that have made other legislative choices. It would impose a law \nthat a State has chosen not to adopt on that State, regardless of the \nchoice its people have made through the legislative process. Most \ntroubling of all, it would create a Federal crime as a mechanism for \nsuch Federal interference. It is an affront to federalism and an \nexercise in heavy-handed overcriminalization.\n  Make no mistake: Despite the proponents' contention that this bill \ndoes not attempt to regulate any purely intrastate activities, the \neffect of this bill would be to impose the policies of certain States \non the remaining ones. Just because some in Congress may prefer the \npolicies of certain States over those in the others does not mean we \nshould give those policies Federal enforcement authority across the \nNation. Doing so is not only wrong, it sets a dangerous precedent.\n  An example apart from family law: Should residents of States that \nprohibit gambling not be able to travel to Las Vegas or Atlantic City \nor the many other places that now allow it? It is the nature of our \nFederal system that when residents of a State travel to neighboring \nStates or across the Nation, they must conform their behavior to the \nlaws of the States they visit? When residents of each State are forced \nto carry with them only the laws of their own State, we will have \nturned our Federal system on its ear.\n  Congress has wisely repealed laws in the past that require residents \nof each State to carry with them only the laws of their own State. We \nsaw this when the Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution was passed. \nThat outlawed slavery and repealed article IV, section 2, paragraph 3 \nof the Constitution, which authorized return of runaway slaves to their \nowners. That constitutional authority and such laws as the Fugitive \nSlave Act of 1793 enabled slave owners from slave States to reclaim \nslaves who managed to escape to free States or territories. None of \nus--and certainly not the sponsors of this legislation--would ever \ncondone slavery. Those discredited laws and the infamous Dred Scott \ncase are about the only precedent we have for a bill like this that \nwould use the force of Federal law to enforce a particular State's laws \nagainst people wherever those people may travel.\n\n  I was proud in November, 2004, when the Senate unanimously passed a \nresolution sponsored by Senators McCain, Hatch, Kennedy, and Reid to \nexpress the sense of the Senate that John Arthur ``Jack'' Johnson \nshould be pardoned for his ``crime'' of transporting a white woman \nacross State lines for ``an immoral purpose.'' The injustice done to \nJack Johnson was something we all joined to try to correct many years \nlater. Let us not allow the misuse of Federal power, again.\n  This bill would sweep into its criminal and civil liability reach \nextended family members, including grandparents or aunts or uncles, who \nrespond to a cry for help from a young relative by helping her travel \nacross State lines to terminate a pregnancy. In addition to close \nfamily members, any other person to whom a young pregnant woman may \nturn for help, including health care providers and religious \ncounselors, could be dragged into court and face prison time on \ncriminal charges. Rev. Doctor Katherine Hancock Ragsdale once helped a \nstranger, a 15-year-old girl. The girl feared for her safety if her \nfather learned of her pregnancy, and she had no relative to turn to for \nhelp. She was alone and desperate. Should offering comfort subject \nReverend Ragsdale to Federal prosecution?\n  The purported goal of this bill, to foster closer familial \nrelationships, will not be served by threatening to throw into jail any \ngrandmother or aunt or sibling who helps a young relative. The result \nof this bill will be to discourage young women from turning to a \ntrusted adult for advice and assistance. Instead, these young women may \nbe forced then into the hands of strangers or into isolation.\n  Keep in mind what this bill does not do. It does not prohibit \npregnant minors from traveling across State lines to have an abortion, \neven if their purpose is to avoid their parents. The perverse effect of \nthe bill, if it is to be followed, would be to encourage more young \nwomen to travel alone to obtain abortions. I will not support an effort \nthat may lead back to the days of ``back alley'' abortions. How can \nanyone view these outcomes as desirable or fostering closer familial \nties? Young pregnant women who seek the counsel and involvement of \nclose family members when they cannot confide in their parents--for \nexample, where a parent has committed incest or there is a history of \nchild abuse--would subject those same close relatives to the risk of \ncriminal prosecution and civil suit, if the young woman subsequently \ntravels across State lines to terminate her pregnancy. Is that really \nwhat we want? We should not compound these most difficult circumstances \nby taking actions that if successful will succeed in isolating young \npregnant women, forcing them to run away from home or pushing them to \nseek protection from strangers at a time of crisis.\n  No law will force a young pregnant woman to involve her parents in \nher abortion decision if she is determined to keep that fact secret \nfrom her parents. No law can force a familial connection that does not \nexist. According to the American Academy of Pediatrics, the percentages \nof minors who inform parents about their intent to have abortions are \nessentially the same in States with and without notification laws. The \nPresident remarked just last week that ``governments can't change \nhearts.'' States have found that there are families in which parental \nnotification laws are not effective.\n  While doing nothing to foster familial relationships, this bill would \ndo serious damage to important federalism and constitutional \nprinciples. The underlying bill imposes significant new burdens on a \nwoman's right to choose and impinges on the right to travel and the \nprivileges and immunities due under the Constitution to every citizen. \nPeter J. Rubin of Georgetown University Law Center and Laurence H. \nTribe of Harvard Law School have argued that this language, adopted by \nthe House in 2002, violates both ``the rights of States to enact and \nenforce their own laws governing conduct within their territorial \nboundaries, and the rights of the residents of each of the United \nStates . . . to travel to and from any State of the Union for lawful \npurposes, a right strongly reaffirmed by the Supreme Court.'' These \nleading constitutional scholars contend that the bill as drafted is \nunconstitutional. I will ask that a copy of their analysis be printed \nin the Record, at the conclusion of my statement.\n  For all these reasons--legal, constitutional, practical and \ninstitutional--I will vote against the underlying bill. I urge all \nSenators to respect federalism, the Constitution and families by \nrejecting this attempt to politicize fundamental decisions and family \nrelationships.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the \naforementioned analysis be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                September 5, 2001.\n     To: United State House of Representatives Committee on the \n         Judiciary, Subcommittee on the Constitution\n     From: Laurence H. Tribe, Tyler Professor of Constitutional \n         Law, Harvard University Peter J. Rubin, Associate \n         Professor of Law, Georgetown University\n     Re H.R. 476 and Constitutional Principles of Federalism\n\n                              Introduction\n\n       We have been asked to submit our assessment of whether H.R. \n     476, now pending before the House, is consistent with \n     constitutional principles of federalism. It is our considered \n     view that the proposed statute violates those principles, \n     principles that are fundamental to our constitutional order. \n     That statute violates the rights of states to enact and \n     enforce their own laws governing conduct within their \n     territorial boundaries, and the rights of the residents of \n     each of the United States and of the District of Columbia to \n     travel to and from any state of the Union for lawful \n     purposes, a right strongly reaffirmed by the Supreme Court in \n     its recent landmark\n\n[[Page S8178]]\n\n     decision in Saenz v. Roe, 526 U.S. 489 (1999). We have \n     therefore concluded that the proposed law would, if enacted, \n     violate the Constitution of the United States.\n       H.R. 476 would provide criminal and civil penalties, \n     including imprisonment for up to one year, for any person who \n     ``knowingly transports an individual who has not attained the \n     age of 18 years across a State line, with the intent that \n     such individual obtain an abortion. . . [if] an abortion is \n     performed on the individual, in a State other than the State \n     where the individual resides, without the parental consent or \n     notification, or the judicial authorization, that would have \n     been required by that law in the State where the individual \n     resides.''\n       H.R. 476, Sec. 2 (a) (proposed 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2431(a)(1) \n     and (2)). In other words, this law makes it a federal crime \n     to assist a pregnant minor to obtain a lawful abortion. The \n     criminal penalties kick in if the abortion the young woman \n     seeks would be performed in a state other than her state of \n     residence, and in accord with the less restrictive laws of \n     that state, unless she complies with the more severe \n     restrictions her home state imposes upon abortions performed \n     upon minors within its territorial limits. The law contains \n     no exceptions for situations where the young woman's home \n     state purports to disclaim any such extraterritorial effect \n     for its parental consultation rules, or where it is a \n     pregnant young woman's close friend, or her aunt or \n     grandmother, or a member of the clergy, who accompanies her \n     ``across a State line'' on this frightening journey, even \n     where she would have obtained the abortion anyway, whether \n     lawfully in another state after a more perilous trip alone, \n     or illegally (and less safely) in her home state because she \n     is too frightened to seek a judicial bypass or too terrified \n     of physical abuse to notify a parent or legal guardian who \n     may, indeed, be the cause of her pregnancy. It does not \n     exempt health care providers, including doctors, from \n     possible criminal or civil penalties. Nor does it uniformly \n     apply home-state laws on pregnant minors who obtain out-of-\n     state abortions. The law applies only where the young woman \n     seeks to go from a state with a more restrictive regime into \n     a state with a less restrictive one.\n       This amounts to a statutory attempt to force this most \n     vulnerable class of young women to carry the restrictive laws \n     of their home states strapped to their backs, bearing the \n     great weight of those laws like the bars of a prison that \n     follows them wherever they go (unless they are willing to go \n     alone). Such a law violates the basic premises upon which our \n     federal system is constructed, and therefore violates the \n     Constitution of the United States.\n\n                                Analysis\n\n       The essence of federalism is that the several states have \n     not only different physical territories and different \n     topographies but also different political and legal regimes. \n     Crossing the border into another state, which every citizen \n     has a right to do, may perhaps not permit the traveler to \n     escape all tax or other fiscal or recordkeeping duties owed \n     to the state as a condition of remaining a resident and thus \n     a citizen of that state, but necessarily permits the traveler \n     temporarily to shed her home state's regime of laws \n     regulating primary conduct in favor of the legal regime of \n     the state she has chosen to visit. Whether cast in terms of \n     the destination state's authority to enact laws effective \n     throughout its domain without having to make exceptions for \n     travelers from other states, or cast in terms of the \n     individual's right to travel--which would almost certainly be \n     deterred and would in any event be rendered virtually \n     meaningless if the traveler could not shake the conduct-\n     constraining laws of her home state--the proposition that a \n     state may not project its laws into other states by following \n     its citizens there is bedrock in our federal system.\n       One need reflect only briefly on what rejecting that \n     proposition would mean in order to understand how axiomatic \n     it is to the structure of federalism. Suppose that your home \n     state or Congress could lock you into the legal regime of \n     your home state as you travel across the country. This would \n     mean that the speed limits, marriage regulations, \n     restrictions on adoption, rules about assisted suicide, \n     firearms regulations, and all other controls over behavior \n     enacted by the state you sought to leave behind, either \n     temporarily or permanently, would in fact follow you into all \n     49 of the other states as you traveled the length and breadth \n     of the nation in search of more hospitable ``rules of the \n     road.'' If your search was for a more favorable legal \n     environment in which to make your home, you might as well \n     just look up the laws of distant states on the internet \n     rather than roaming about in a futile effort at sampling \n     them, since you will not actually experience those laws by \n     traveling there. And if your search was for a less hostile \n     legal environment in which to attend college or spend a \n     summer vacation or obtain a medical procedure, you might as \n     well skip even the internet, since the theoretically less \n     hostile laws of other jurisdictions will mean nothing to you \n     so long as your state of residence remains unchanged.\n       Unless the right to travel interstate means nothing more \n     than the right to change the scenery, opting for the open \n     fields of Kansas or the mountains of Colorado or the beaches \n     of Florida but all the while living under the legal regime of \n     whichever state you call home, telling you that the laws \n     governing your behavior will remain constant as you cross \n     from one state into another and then another is tantamount to \n     telling you that you may in truth be compelled to remain at \n     home--although you may, of course, engage in a simulacrum of \n     interstate travel, with an experience much like that of the \n     visitor to a virtual reality arcade who is strapped into \n     special equipment that provides the look and feel of \n     alternative physical environments--from sea to shining sea--\n     but that does not alter the political and legal environment \n     one iota. And, of course, if home-state legislation, or \n     congressional legislation, may saddle the home state's \n     citizens with that state's abortion regulation regime, then \n     it may saddle them with their home state's adoption and \n     marriage regimes as well, and with piece after piece of the \n     home state's legal fabric until the home state's citizens are \n     all safely and tightly wrapped in the straitjacket of the \n     home state's entire legal regime. There are no constitutional \n     scissors that can cut this process short, no principled \n     metric that can supply a stopping point. The principle \n     underlying H.R. 476 is nothing less, therefore, than the \n     principle that individuals may indeed be tightly bound by the \n     legal regimes of their home states even as they traverse the \n     nation by traveling to other states with very different \n     regimes of law. It follows, therefore, that--unless the right \n     to engage in interstate travel that is so central to our \n     federal system is indeed only a right to change the \n     surrounding scenery--H.R. 476 rests on a principle that \n     obliterates that right completely.\n       It is irrelevant to the federalism analysis that the \n     proposed federal statute does not literally prohibit the \n     minor herself from obtaining an out-of-state abortion without \n     complying with the parental consent or notification laws of \n     her home state, criminalizing instead only the conduct of \n     assisting such a young woman by transporting her across state \n     lines. The manifest and indeed avowed purpose of the statute \n     is to prevent the pregnant minor from crossing state lines to \n     obtain an abortion that is lawful in her state of destination \n     whenever it would have violated her home state's law to \n     obtain an abortion there because the pregnant woman has not \n     fully complied with her home state's requirements for \n     parental consent or notification. The means used to achieve \n     this end do not alter the constitutional calculus. \n     Prohibiting assistance in crossing state lines in the manner \n     of this proposed statute suffers the same infirmity with \n     respect to our federal structure as would a direct ban on \n     traveling across state lines to obtain an abortion that \n     complies with all the laws of the state where it is performed \n     without first complying also with the laws that would apply \n     to obtaining an abortion in one's home state.\n       The federalism principle we have described operates \n     routinely in our national life. Indeed, it is so commonplace \n     it is taken for granted. Thus, for example, neither Virginia \n     nor Congress could prohibit residents of Virginia, where \n     casino gambling is illegal, from traveling interstate to \n     gamble in a casino in Nevada. (Indeed, the economy of Nevada \n     essentially depends upon this aspect of federalism for its \n     continued vitality.) People who like to hunt cannot be \n     prohibited from traveling to states where hunting is legal in \n     order to avail themselves of those pro-hunting laws just \n     because such hunting may be illegal in their home state. And \n     citizens of every state must be free, for example, to read \n     and watch material, even constitutionally unprotected \n     material, in New York City the distribution of which might be \n     unlawful in their own states, but which New York has chosen \n     not to forbid. To call interstate travel for such purposes an \n     ``evasion'' or ``circumvention'' of one's home-state laws--as \n     H.R. 476 purports to do, see H.R. 476, Sec. 2(a) (heading of \n     the proposed 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2431) (``Transportation of minors \n     in circumvention of certain laws relating to abortion'')--is \n     to misunderstand the basic premise of federalism: one is \n     entitled to avoid those laws by traveling interstate. Doing \n     so amounts to neither evasion nor circumvention.\n       Put simply, you may not be compelled to abandon your \n     citizenship in your home state as a condition of voting with \n     your feet for the legal and political regime of whatever \n     other state you wish to visit. The fact that you intend to \n     return home cannot undercut your right, while in another \n     state, to be governed by its rules of primary conduct rather \n     than by the rules of primary conduct of the state from which \n     you came and to which you will return. When in Rome, perhaps \n     you will not do as the Romans do, but you are entitled--if \n     this figurative Rome is within the United States--to be \n     governed as the Romans are. If something is lawful for one of \n     them to do, it must be lawful for you as well. The fact that \n     each state is free, notwithstanding Article IV, to make \n     certain benefits available on a preferential basis to its own \n     citizens does not mean that a state's criminal laws may be \n     replaced with stricter ones for the visiting citizen from \n     another state, whether by that state's own choice or by \n     virtue of the law of the visitor's state or by virtue of a \n     congressional enactment. To be sure, a state need not treat \n     the travels of its citizens to other states as suddenly \n     lifting otherwise applicable restrictions when they return \n     home. Thus, a state that bans the possession of gambling \n     equipment, of specific kinds of weapons, of liquor, or of \n     obscene material may certainly enforce such bans against \n     anyone who would bring the contraband items into the \n     jurisdiction, including its own residents returning from a \n     gambling state, a hunting state, a drinking state, or a\n\n[[Page S8179]]\n\n     state that chooses not to outlaw obscenity. But that is a far \n     cry from projecting one state's restrictive gambling, \n     firearms, alcohol, or obscenity laws into another state \n     whenever citizens of the first state venture there.\n       Thus states cannot prohibit the lawful out-of-state conduct \n     of their citizens, nor may they impose criminal-law-backed \n     burdens--as H.R. 476 would do--upon those lawfully engaged in \n     business or other activity within their sister states. \n     Indeed, this principle is so fundamental that it runs through \n     the Supreme Court's jurisprudence in cases that are nominally \n     about provisions and rights as diverse as the Commerce \n     Clause, the Due Process Clause, and the right to travel, \n     which is itself derived from several distinct constitutional \n     sources. See, e.g., Healy v. Beer Institute, 491 U.S. 324, \n     336 n. 13 (1989) (Commerce Clause decision quoting Edgar v. \n     Mite Corp., 457 U.S. 624, 643 (1982) (plurality opinion), \n     which in turn quoted the Court's Due Process decision in \n     Shaffer v. Heitner, 433 U.S. 186, 197 (1977)) (``The limits \n     on a State's power to enact substantive legislation are \n     similar to the limits on the jurisdiction of state courts. In \n     either case, `any attempt ``directly'' to assert \n     extraterritorial jurisdiction over persons or property would \n     offend sister States and exceed the inherent limit of the \n     State's power.' '').\n       The Supreme Court recently reaffirmed this fundamental \n     principle in its landmark right to travel decision, Saenz v. \n     Roe, 526 U.S. 489 (1999). There the Court held that, even \n     with congressional approval, the State of California was \n     powerless to carve out an exception to its otherwise-\n     applicable legal regime by providing recently-arrived \n     residents with only the welfare benefits that they would have \n     been entitled to receive under the laws of their former \n     states of residence. This attempt to saddle these interstate \n     travelers with the laws of their former home states--even if \n     only the welfare laws, laws that would operate far less \n     directly and less powerfully than would a special criminal-\n     law restriction on primary conduct--was held to impose an \n     unconstitutional penalty upon their right to interstate \n     travel, which, the Court held, is guaranteed them by the \n     Privileges or Immunities Clause of the Fourteenth \n     Amendment. See Saenz, 526 U.S. at 503-504.\n       Although Saenz concerned new residents of a state, the \n     decision also reaffirmed that the constitutional right to \n     travel under the Privileges and Immunities Clause of Article \n     IV, Section 2, provides a similar type of protection to a \n     non-resident who enters a state not to settle, but with an \n     intent eventually to return to her home state: ``[B]y virtue \n     of a person's state citizenship, a citizen of one State who \n     travels in other States, intending to return home at the end \n     of his journey, is entitled to enjoy the `Privileges and \n     Immunities of Citizens in the several States' that he visits. \n     This provision removes `from the citizens of each State the \n     disabilities of alienage in the other States.' Paul v. \n     Virginia, 8 Wall. 168, 180 (1869). It provides important \n     protections for nonresidents who enter a State whether to \n     obtain employment, Hicklin v. Orbeck, 437 U.S. 518 (1978), to \n     procure medical services, Doe v. Bolton, 410 U.S. 179, 200 \n     (1973), or even to engage in commercial shrimp fishing, \n     Toomer v. Witsell, 334 U.S. 385 (1948).''\n       Saenz, 526 U.S. at 501-502 ( footnotes and parenthetical \n     omitted).\n       Indeed, Doe v. Bolton, 410 U.S. 179 (1973), which was \n     decided over a quarter century ago, and to which the Saenz \n     court referred, specifically held that, under Article IV of \n     the Constitution, a state may not restrict the ability of \n     visiting non-residents to obtain abortions on the same terms \n     and conditions under which they are made available by law to \n     state residents. ``[T]he Privileges and Immunities Clause, \n     Const. Art. IV, Sec. 2, protects persons . . . who enter [a \n     state] seeking the medical services that are available \n     there.'' Id. at 200.\n       Thus, in terms of protection from being hobbled by the laws \n     of one's home state wherever one travels, nothing turns on \n     whether the interstate traveler intends to remain permanently \n     in her destination state, or to return to her state of \n     origin. Combined with the Court's holding that, like the \n     states, Congress may not contravene the principles of \n     federalism that are sometimes described under the ``right to \n     travel'' label, Saenz reinforces the conclusion, if it were \n     not clear before, that even if enacted by Congress, a law \n     like H.R. 476 that attempts by reference to a state's own \n     laws to control that state's resident's out-of-state conduct \n     on pains of criminal punishment, whether of that resident or \n     of whoever might assist her to travel interstate, would \n     violate the federal Constitution. See also Shapiro v. \n     Thompson, 394 U.S. 618, 629-630 (1969) (invalidating an Act \n     of Congress mandating a durational residency requirement for \n     recently arrived District of Columbia residents seeking to \n     obtain welfare assistance).\n       In 1999, this Committee heard testimony from Professor Lino \n     Graglia of the University of Texas School of Law. An opponent \n     of constitutional abortion rights, he candidly conceded that \n     the proposed law would ``make it . . . more dangerous for \n     young women to exercise their constitutional right to obtain \n     a safe and legal abortion.'' Testimony of Lino A. Graglia on \n     H.R. 1218 before the Constitution Subcommittee of the \n     Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. House of Representatives, \n     May 27, 1999 at 1. He also concluded, however, that ``the Act \n     furthers the principle of federalism to the extent that it \n     reinforces or makes effective the very small amount of \n     policymaking authority on the abortion issue that the Supreme \n     Court, an arm of the national government, has permitted to \n     remain with the States.'' Id. at 2. He testified that he \n     supported the bill because he would support ``anything \n     Congress can do to move control of the issue back into the \n     hands of the States.'' Id. at 1.\n       Of course, as the description of H.R. 476 we have given \n     above demonstrates, that proposed statute would do nothing to \n     move ``back'' into the hands of the states any of the control \n     over abortion that was precluded by Roe v. Wade, 410 U.S. 113 \n     (1973), and its progeny. The several states already have \n     their own distinctive regimes for regulating the provision of \n     abortion services to pregnant minors, regimes that are \n     permitted under the Supreme Court's abortion rulings. That, \n     indeed, is the very premise of this proposed law. But, rather \n     than respecting federalism by permitting each state's law to \n     operate within its own sphere, the proposed federal statute \n     would contravene that essential principle of federalism by \n     saddling the abortion-seeking young woman with the \n     restrictive law of her home state wherever she may travel \n     within the United States unless she travels unaided. Indeed, \n     it would add insult to this federalism injury by imposing its \n     regime regardless of the wishes of her home state, whose \n     legislature might recoil from the prospect of transforming \n     its parental notification laws, enacted ostensibly to \n     encourage the provision of loving support and advice to \n     distraught young women, into an obstacle to the most \n     desperate of these young women, compelling them in the moment \n     of their greatest despair to choose between, on the one hand, \n     telling someone close to them of their situation and perhaps \n     exposing this loved one to criminal punishment, and, on the \n     other, going to the back alleys or on an unaccompanied trip \n     to another, possibly distant state. This Federal statute \n     would therefore violate rather than reinforce basic \n     constitutional principles of federalism.\n       The fact that the proposed law applies only to those \n     assisting the interstate travel of minors seeking abortions \n     may make the federalism-based constitutional infirmity \n     somewhat less obvious--while at the same time rendering the \n     law more vulnerable to constitutional challenge because of \n     the danger in which it will place the class of frightened, \n     perhaps desperate young women least able to travel safely on \n     their own. The importance of protecting the relationship \n     between parents and their minor children cannot be gainsaid. \n     But in the end, the fact that the proposed statute involves \n     the interstate travel only of minors does not alter our \n     conclusion.\n       No less than the right to end a pregnancy, the \n     constitutional right to travel interstate and to take \n     advantage of the laws of other states exists even for those \n     citizens who are not yet eighteen. ``Constitutional rights do \n     not mature and come into being magically only when one \n     attains the state-defined age of majority. Minors, as well as \n     adults, are protected by the Constitution and possess \n     constitutional rights.'' Planned Parenthood of Central \n     Missouri v. Danforth, 428 U.S. 52, 74 (1976). Nonetheless, \n     the Court has held that, in furtherance of the minor's best \n     interests, government may in some circumstances have more \n     leeway to regulate where minors are concerned. Thus, whereas \n     a law that sought, for example, to burden adult women with \n     their home state's constitutionally acceptable waiting \n     periods for abortion (or with their home state's \n     constitutionally permissible medical regulations that may \n     make abortion more costly) even when they traveled out of \n     state to avoid those waiting periods (or other regulations) \n     would obviously be unconstitutional, it might be argued that \n     a law like the proposed one, which seeks to force a young \n     woman to comply with her home state's parental consent laws \n     regardless of her circumstances, is, because of its focus on \n     minors, somehow saved from constitutional invalidity.\n       It is not, for at least two reasons. First, the importance \n     of the constitutional right in question for the pregnant \n     minor too desperate even to seek judicial approval for \n     abortion in her home state--either because of its futility \n     there, or because of her terror at a judicial proceeding held \n     to discuss her pregnancy and personal circumstances--means \n     that government's power to burden that choice is severely \n     restricted. As Justice Powell wrote over two decades ago:\n       ``The pregnant minor's options are much different from \n     those facing a minor in other situations, such as deciding \n     whether to marry. . . . A pregnant adolescent . . . cannot \n     preserve for long the possibility of aborting, which \n     effectively expires in a matter of weeks from the onset of \n     pregnancy.''\n       ``Moreover, the potentially severe detriment facing a \n     pregnant woman is not mitigated by her minority. Indeed, \n     considering her probable education, employment skills, \n     financial resources, and emotional maturity, unwanted \n     motherhood may be exceptionally burdensome for a minor. In \n     addition, the fact of having a child brings with it adult \n     legal responsibility, for parenthood, like attainment of the \n     age of majority, is one of the traditional criteria for the \n     termination of the legal disabilities of minority. In sum, \n     there are few situations in which denying a minor the right \n     to make an important decision will have consequences so grave \n     and indelible.''\n       Bellotti v. Baird (Bellotti II), 443 U.S. 622, 642 (1979) \n     (plurality opinion) (citations omitted).\n\n[[Page S8180]]\n\n       Second, the fact that the penalties on travel out of state \n     by minors who do not first seek parental consent or judicial \n     bypass are triggered only by intent to obtain a lawful \n     abortion and only if the minor's home state has more \n     stringent ``minor protection'' provisions in the form of \n     parental involvement rules than the state of destination, \n     renders any protection-of-minors exception to the basic rule \n     of federalism unavailable.\n       To begin with, the proposed law, unlike one that \n     evenhandedly defers to each state's determination of what \n     will best protect the emotional health and physical safety of \n     its pregnant minors who seek to terminate their pregnancies, \n     simply defers to states with strict parental control laws and \n     subordinates the interests of states that have decided that \n     legally-mandated consent or notification is not a sound means \n     of protecting pregnant minors. The law does not purport to \n     impose a uniform nationwide requirement that all pregnant \n     young women should be subject to the abortion laws of their \n     home states and only those abortion laws wherever they may \n     travel. Thus, under H.R. 476, a pregnant minor whose parents \n     believe that it would be both destructive and profoundly \n     disrespectful to their mature, sexually active daughter to \n     require her by law to obtain their consent before having an \n     abortion, and who live in a state whose laws reflect that \n     view, would, despite the judgment expressed in the laws of \n     her home state, still be required to obtain parental consent \n     should she seek an abortion in a neighboring state with a \n     stricter parental involvement law--something she might do, \n     for example, because that is where the nearest abortion \n     provider is located. This substantively slanted way in which \n     H.R. 476 would operate fatally undermines any argument that \n     might otherwise be available that principles of federalism \n     must give way because this law seeks to ensure that the \n     health and safety of pregnant minors are protected in the way \n     their home states have decided would be best.\n       In addition, the proposed law, again unlike one protecting \n     parental involvement generally, selectively targets one form \n     of control: control with respect to the constitutionally \n     protected procedure of terminating a pregnancy before \n     viability. The proposed law does not do a thing for parental \n     control if the minor is being assisted into another state \n     (or, where the relevant regulation is local, into another \n     city or county) for the purpose of obtaining a tattoo, or \n     endoscopic surgery to correct a foot problem, or laser \n     surgery for an eye defect. The law is activated only when the \n     medical procedure being obtained in another state is the \n     termination of a pregnancy. It is as though Congress proposed \n     to assist parents in controlling their children when, and \n     only when, those children wish to buy constitutionally \n     protected but sexually explicit books about methods of birth \n     control and abortion in states where the sale of such books \n     to these minors is entirely lawful.\n       The basic constitutional principle that such laws overlook \n     is that the greater power does not necessarily include the \n     lesser. Thus, for example, even though so-called ``fighting \n     words'' may be banned altogether despite the First Amendment, \n     it is unconstitutional, the Supreme Court held in 1992, for \n     government selectively to ban those fighting words that are \n     racist or anti-semitic in character. See R.A.V. v. City of \n     St. Paul, 505 U.S. 377, 391-392 (1992). To take another \n     example, Congress could not make it a crime to assist a minor \n     who has had an abortion in the past to cross a state line in \n     order to obtain a lawful form of cosmetic surgery elsewhere \n     if that minor has not complied with her state's valid \n     parental involvement law for such surgery. Even though \n     Congress might enact a broader law that would cover all the \n     minors in the class described, it could not enact a law aimed \n     only at those who have had abortions. Such a law would \n     impermissibly single out abortion for special burdens. The \n     proposed law does so as well. Thus, even if a law that were \n     properly drawn to protect minors could constitutionally \n     displace one of the basic rules of federalism, the proposed \n     statute can not.\n       Lastly, in oral testimony given in 1999 before the \n     Subcommittee on the Constitution, Professor John Harrison of \n     the University of Virginia, while conceding that ordinarily a \n     law such as this, which purported to impose upon an \n     individual her home state's laws in order to prevent her from \n     engaging in lawful conduct in one of the other states, would \n     be constitutionally ``doubtful,'' argued that the \n     constitutionality of this law is resolved by the fact that it \n     relates to ``domestic relations,'' a sphere in which, \n     according to Professor Harrison, ``the state with the primary \n     jurisdiction over the rights and responsibilities of parties \n     to the domestic relations is the state of residence. . . and \n     not the state where the conduct'' at issue occurs. See \n     transcript of the Hearing of the Constitution Subcommittee of \n     the House Judiciary Committee on the Child Custody Protection \n     Act, May 27, 1999.\n       This ``domestic relations exception'' to principles of \n     federalism described by Professor Harrison, however, does not \n     exist, at least not in any context relevant to the \n     constitutionality of H.R. 476. To be sure, acting pursuant to \n     Article IV, Sec. 1, Congress has prescribed special state \n     obligations to accord full faith and credit to judgments in \n     the domestic relations context--for example, to child custody \n     determinations and child support orders. 28 U.S.C. \n     Sec. Sec. 1738A, 1738B. These provisions also establish \n     choice of law principles governing modification of domestic \n     relations orders. In addition, in a controversial provision \n     whose constitutionality is open to question, Congress has \n     said that states are not required to accord full faith and \n     credit to same-sex marriages. Id. at Sec. 1738C.\n       But the special measures adopted by Congress in the \n     domestic relations context can provide no justification for \n     H.R. 476. There is a world of difference between provisions \n     like Sec. Sec. 1738A and 1738B, which prescribe the full \n     faith and credit to which state judicial decrees and \n     judgments are entitled, and proposed H.R. 476, which in \n     effect gives state statutes extraterritorial operation--by \n     purporting to impose criminal liability for interstate travel \n     undertaken to engage in conduct lawful within the territorial \n     jurisdiction of the state in which the conduct is to occur, \n     based solely upon the laws in effect in the state of \n     residence of the individual who seeks to travel to a state \n     where she can engage in that conduct lawfully.\n       The Supreme Court has always differentiated ``the credit \n     owed to laws (legislative measures and common law) and to \n     judgments.'' Baker v. General Motors Corp., 522 U.S. 222, 232 \n     (1998). For example, while a state may not decline on public \n     policy grounds to give full faith and credit to a judicial \n     judgment from another state, see, e.g., Fauntleroy v. Lum, \n     210 U.S. 230, 237 (1908), a forum state has always been free \n     to consider its own public policies in declining to follow \n     the legislative enactments of other states. See Nevada v. \n     Hall, 440 U.S. 410, 421-24 (1979). In short, under the Full \n     Faith and Credit Clause, a state has never been compelled \n     ``to substitute the statutes of other states for its own \n     statutes dealing with a subject matter concerning which it is \n     competent to legislate.'' Pacific Employers Ins. Co. v. \n     Industrial Accident Comm'n, 306 U.S. 493, 501 (1939). In \n     fact, the Full Faith and Credit Clause was meant to prevent \n     ``parochial entrenchment on the interests of other States.'' \n     Thomas v. Washington Gas Light Co., 448 U.S. 261, 272 (1980) \n     (plurality opinion). A state is under no obligation to \n     enforce another state's statute with which it disagrees.\n       But H.R. 476 would run afoul of that principle. It imposes \n     the restrictive laws of a woman's home state wherever she \n     travels, in derogation of the usual rules regarding choice of \n     law and full faith and credit.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I cannot support the Child Custody \nProtection Act. First, I object to the decision to bring this bill \ndirectly to the floor, circumventing the Senate's committee process. I \nremember when this bill came before the Senate Judiciary Committee in \nthe 105th Congress. We held a hearing, debated and voted on amendments, \nand even issued a committee report with minority views. Mr. President, \nthat was in 1998; surely, the factual basis of this legislation has \nchanged since then. I do not see why the Leadership feels that this \nbill no longer deserves the serious consideration that it received \neight years ago.\n  In addition, this bill is an overreach of Federal power that comes at \nthe expense of the health and safety of young women. The notion that \none State may not impose its laws outside its territorial boundaries is \na core federalist principle, and I believe this bill might very well \nviolate the Constitution if enacted. States should retain their right \nto enact and implement appropriate policies within their territorial \nboundaries. The Child Custody Protection Act would preempt these rights \nby allowing the laws of certain States to essentially trump the laws in \nother States.\n  In an ideal world, all young women who face this difficult decision \nwould be able to turn to their parents. But we do not live in an ideal \nworld, and the reality is that there are young women who feel they \ncannot turn to a parent out of fear of physical or mental abuse, \ngetting kicked out of the house, or worse. This bill would deny these \nyoung women the ability to turn to another trusted adult for help. Many \nnational medical and public-health organizations, including the \nAmerican Medical Association, the American Academy of Pediatrics, and \nthe American Psychological Association have expressed grave concern \nabout mandatory parental consent laws for these reasons.\n  Our focus in the Senate should be on ensuring that unintended \npregnancies do not happen in the first place. For these reasons, I \nintend to continue my work in the Senate to ensure that all women have \naccess to the best information and reproductive health services \navailable. If we do that, abortions will become even more rare, as well \nas staying safe and legal.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to speak on the Child \nCustody Protection Act. I support the intent of the act, which seeks to \nprotect the health and safety of pregnant minors, as well as the rights \nof parents to be involved in the medical decisions of\n\n[[Page S8181]]\n\ntheir minor daughters. However, I believe this act might have gone \nfurther in protecting young women in situations of family abuse or \nincest.\n  As a parent of two, I understand the importance and centrality of \nfamily, and an essential element of that: the parent-child \nrelationship. The Supreme Court noted in Planned Parenthood v. Casey \nthat parental involvement laws related to abortions ``are based on the \nquite reasonable assumption that minors will benefit from consultation \nwith their parents and that children will often not realize that their \nparents have their best interests at heart.'' It is important that, to \nthe extent possible, a young woman be able to consult with her family \nbefore making the decision to have an abortion.\n  Unfortunately, some young women, particularly victims of incest or \nfamily violence, cannot safely involve parents in their decision to \nobtain an abortion. In such a circumstance, as my colleagues have \nrightfully pointed out, the minor girl could seek a judicial bypass, \nwhich would allow the girl to petition a judge to waive the parental \ninvolvement law. The bypass is intended for situations of incest or \nfamily abuse, and would allow for the involvement of appropriate state \nauthorities, making it more likely that the minor girl will be removed \nfrom the abusive situation and that the abuser will be brought to \njustice. The bypass option is fundamental to the rights of the minor, \nand exists to protect her safety.\n  Constitutional law requires a parental consent law to contain a \njudicial bypass provision. However, the circuit courts are divided as \nto whether parental notification laws also must contain a judicial \nbypass. I am concerned for those girls who are in an abusive family \nsituation and who reside in states that could enact a parental \nnotification law without a bypass option. I believe something must be \ndone to strengthen the bypass requirements in this bill to ensure the \nprotection of minor girls with abusive families.\n  Given the unanimous consent agreement, I do not have the opportunity \nto amend the Child Custody and Protection Act on the floor in order to \nstrengthen the bypass option in cases of parental notification. I will \nlook to my colleagues in conference to consider adding a provision that \nwould ensure, with respect to parental notification, that minor girls \nin incestuous or family abusive situations be able to seek a bypass, \nwhether it be the judicial bypass or, as in Utah, the medical bypass, \nwhich permits a physician to waive the parental notification \nrequirement in cases of incest or family abuse. The physician must also \nnotify State authorities.\n  It is right to protect pregnant girls and their families from those \nwho do not have the minor girl's best interest at heart. Mr. President, \nI only ask that everything be done to protect the health and safety of \nthose minor girls seeking an abortion who feel they cannot safely turn \ntowards their family.\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, I am the parent of two young daughters. And \nas a parent, it is my sincere hope that my daughters will always feel \nthey can come to me or my wife with any problem. So, even though I \nstrongly believe in a woman's right to choose, I also believe that \nyoung women, if they become pregnant, should talk to their parents \nbefore considering an abortion.\n  But I also know that the reality is different for many young women. \nSome don't live in a traditional two-parent household. Others don't \nhave a parent in whom they are comfortable confiding. For these young \nwomen, the most trusted adult in their life may be a grandparent, an \naunt, or a clergy member.\n  I certainly hope these trusted adults would want to help a young \nperson through a difficult time like a pregnancy. Unfortunately, this \nbill all but eliminates this option for young women. Instead of \nencouraging pregnant teens to seek the advice of adults, this bill \ncriminalizes adults who attempt to help a young woman in need and \nessentially abandons them to confront a difficult issue on their own.\n  In fact, this bill would criminalize adults even if they were not \nattempting to help a young woman in need. Under this bill, if a \ngrandparent gave a young woman a ride across a state line--say from \nSouth Dakota into neighboring Iowa--and that young woman ended up \nseeking an abortion, that grandparent could spend up to a year in \nprison.\n  Now, there are a lot of other problems with the bill: there is no \nhealth exception, no judicial bypass, and the notion that one State's \nlaws can take precedence over another State's laws is unconstitutional \nand unacceptable. But the fundamental flaw with the bill is its \ncriminalization of compassion. At a time when teenagers most need help, \nthis bill would instead force caring and trusted adults--whether it's \nan older sister, an aunt or grandparent, or health professionals, \nsocial workers, or a minister--to stand to the side and watch the young \nwoman go it alone.\n  I wish this bill was an honest effort to confront the real issue \nhere: unwanted teen pregnancies. No one in this body--whether pro-\nchoice or pro-life--wants young women to seek abortions. But this bill \ndoes not address this serious issue. I hope we can work to pass \nlegislation that will provide young people today with the information \nthey need to prevent unwanted teen pregnancies. I regret that I am \nunable to support this bill today.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise today in opposition to the Child \nCustody Protection Act. I oppose this bill for three reasons. The first \nis that it does nothing to promote the health and safety of our \nchildren. The second is that I do not believe it can pass \nconstitutional muster. The third reason I oppose this bill because it \nis just another example of the continual assault on women's \nreproductive freedom.\n  I strongly believe that minors should involve their parents in all \nimportant decisions. This includes the decision to have an abortion. \nResearch shows that most women voluntarily involve their parents when \nmaking this decision. However, I recognize that there are some young \nwomen who cannot talk to their parents about this issue. Some young \nwomen may not live with either of their parents, and instead live with \na grandparent, aunt, or another adult relative. Some young women may be \ngrowing up in households where they experience physical and sexual \nabuse and may be threatened with further abuse should their parents be \naware of a pregnancy. Yet young women facing pregnancy crisis need help \nand support.\n  There are no exceptions in this bill which address the realities of \nwomen's lives. The reality is that some young women come from abusive \nhomes. The unfortunate reality is that sometimes young women are raped \nby their fathers, and this results in a pregnancy. And, the reality is \nthat a young woman may need a trusted adult whether it be a \ngrandparent, older sibling, priest or rabbi, to accompany them if they \nchoose to get an abortion.\n  This bill does not help these young women. In fact, this bill says to \nwomen who cannot involve their parents that they have to go it alone. \nThat is why I voted for the Feinstein amendment which would have \nallowed other trusted adults like grandparents or clergy members to be \nallowed to step in when a young woman could not go to her parents for \nhelp. This amendment was a step in the right direction. It acknowledged \nthat unfortunately some young women cannot talk to their parents about \nthis very important decision.\n  That is why I also voted for the Lautenberg-Menendez amendment. This \namendment addresses the causes of teen pregnancy. The amendment takes \npositive steps to prevent teenage girls from getting pregnant in the \nfirst place. It funds teen pregnancy prevention programs in schools and \ncommunity settings. The amendment provides funding to keep teens out of \ntrouble and on the road to success. It restores budget cuts to after \nschool programs and physical education classes.\n  I also oppose this bill because it does not pass constitutional \nmuster. Not only does it totally ignore cases where a young woman's \nhealth is threatened. That clearly undermines the major holding in \nStenberg v. Carhart which requires any law regulating abortion must \ncontain an exception for a woman's health. Let's be clear: because this \nbill does not contain an exception to protect the health of young women \nit will be ruled unconstitutional.\n  Finally, I oppose this bill because it is yet another assault on \nwomen's reproductive freedom. I strongly support a woman's right to \nchoose and have fought to improve women's health during the more than \ntwo decades I have\n\n[[Page S8182]]\n\nserved in Congress. Whether it is establishing offices of women's \nhealth, fighting for coverage for contraceptives, or requiring Federal \nquality standards for mammography, I will continue the fight to improve \nwomen's health.\n  Today, I will oppose S. 403 because it forces young women who are \ndealing with a crisis pregnancy to go it alone and deprives them of the \nadvice and assistance of a trusted adult. It assumes that every family \nis safe, stable, and supportive. The bill ignores that some minors \ncannot go to mom and dad for help. It does not make our children any \nsafer. I urge my colleagues to vote against S. 403.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I rise today in support of S. 403, the \nChild Custody Protection Act. This bill prohibits transporting minors \nacross State lines to obtain an abortion without parental notice or \nconsent. I have and will continue to fight for the protection of \nchildren in the womb as well as the safety of minors.\n  I believe that life begins at the moment of conception and that \nchildren in the womb deserve the same rights and protection as all \nother human beings.\n  The Child Custody Protection Act will not only help protect these \nchildren in the womb, it will also protect their young mothers and \nfamilies by involving parents who have their best interests at heart.\n  I believe we can all agree that our young girls must be protected, \nand the laws put in place for that purpose must be upheld. Currently, \n45 States have laws that require notification, consent, or some type of \nconsultation with a minor's parent or guardian before she can legally \nhave an abortion. However, there are no laws to prevent a minor from \ncrossing State borders and having an abortion performed in a State \nwithout such laws.\n  This practice disregards abortion policies of individual States, \nimplicates interstate commerce, and endangers young girls by allowing \nthem to have dangerous abortion procedures performed without the \nguidance of their parent or guardian. The Child Custody Protection Act \nprohibits transporting a minor across a State line for the purpose of \nobtaining an abortion if doing so circumvents a parental notification \nor consent statute in the minor's residing State.\n  The Child Custody Protection Act will not change the parental \nnotification or consent laws of any individual State, but will help to \nenforce these laws by helping to prevent minors from being taken out of \na State for an abortion without a parent's knowledge or consent. This \nbill will actually reinforce State policies that are already in place.\n  Sadly, many young girls have been taken out of State by an individual \nother than her parent or guardian to obtain an abortion and have been \nsubjected to unsafe and unlawful abortion procedures that endanger them \nphysically and mentally. Abortion can cause physical and emotional \ncomplications for a young girl, and these dangers are greatly increased \nby taking her away from of the influence of her parents or guardian, \nplacing her in the hands of an individual who does not have her best \ninterests in mind.\n  Crystal Farley Lane was one such victim. When she was 12 years old, \nshe became pregnant after tragically being raped by a 19-year-old man. \nRosa Hartford, the man's mother, then took Crystal from her home in \nPennsylvania, without her mother's knowledge or consent, to New York, \nwhere there were no parental consent laws, to have an abortion. After \nthe procedure, Ms. Hartford abandoned young Crystal, who had serious \nmedical complications, 30 miles from her home. When Crystal's mother, \nJoyce Farley, found out what happened and tried to help by asking the \nabortionist for Crystal's medical records, she was denied. Fortunately, \nMs. Farley was able to help her obtain the medical care she needed in \ntime, despite this obstacle by the abortionist.\n  Crystal's near-death experience could have been prevented had the \nChild Custody Protection Act been in place. Instead, there are \ncurrently no laws to prevent people like Ms. Hartford from taking \nCrystal out of Pennsylvania to obtain an abortion without parental \nconsent.\n  Ms. Farley poignantly testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee \nthat, ``situations such as this are what the `Child Custody Act' was \ndesigned to help prevent. I am a loving, responsible parent whose \nparenting was interfered with by an adult unknown to me.''\n  In another instance, Marcia Carroll's 14-year-old daughter was forced \ninto having an abortion by her boyfriend's family. The family took her \nfrom Pennsylvania to New York without Ms. Carroll's knowledge or \nconsent, left her alone to have an abortion that she did not want to \nhave, and then left her a block from her home in Pennsylvania. This 14-\nyear-old girl had to go through a frightening and painful abortion \nprocedure on her own and was then left to deal with the physical and \nemotional pain from an abortion that she did not want to have.\n  I find it terribly unjust that there are no laws to prevent \nsituations such as these from happening and that families have no \nrecourse against those who are responsible.\n  Very often, adult men, who are on average 6 to 7 years older than \ntheir victims, are the culprits of this violating crime against these \nyoung girls. Two-thirds of these adult men are 20 years of age or \nolder. Additionally, more than half of the time it is a girl's \nboyfriend who takes her to another State to have an abortion without \nher parents' consent. An abortion performed in a jurisdiction that \nprohibits release of the medical records destroys any evidence that \nmight have been used against a perpetrator to prosecute him for \nstatutory rape and leaves him free to continue preying on these young \ngirls without consequence.\n  The incongruity of this status is striking. There are so many \nrestrictions to protect our minors from making bad decisions by \nrequiring parental consent for their actions. They must have parental \nconsent to take medication at school, even an aspirin. They cannot go \non a school field trip without a permission slip signed by a parent. \nWhy, then, can a young girl who cannot take an aspirin without the \nconsent of her parents, cross a State border and have an abortion \nwithout notifying them? And why can an adult be prosecuted for giving a \nchild aspirin but not for taking her to another state to have an \nabortion?\n  By reinforcing State abortion laws requiring parental notification or \nconsent, the Child Custody Protection Act will protect our young \ndaughters from making or being coerced into poor, irreversible, life-\nchanging decisions. I believe we can all agree that action must be \ntaken to prevent the evasion of laws created to protect minors and \ntheir families and help preserve the precious lives of children in the \nwomb. I ask that this Chamber quickly pass this lifesaving legislation.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today in opposition of the Child \nCustody Protection Act, S. 403. This bill is not about reducing the \nnumbers of abortions in America. S. 403 is about politics played at the \nexpense of young women in the United States. S. 403 would make it a \nFederal crime for adults other than guardians to transport a minor \nacross State lines to obtain an abortion. This is not nearly as simple \nas it may sound. S. 403 is another direct attack on the reproductive \nrights of women. It turns its back on young women who do not inform \ntheir parents about their decision to obtain an abortion even if they \nface threats of personal harm. S. 403 would criminalize grandmothers, \nreligious leaders, aunts and uncles, and doctors fighting for the \nhealth and well-being of young women. This bill would take us back to \nthe time before Roe v. Wade where women did not have the right to \ncontrol their own bodies and too often were forced to seek an abortion \nat any cost.\n  The supporters of S. 403 want us to believe that there is a \nsignificant problem with young women being transported involuntarily \nover State lines to receive unwanted abortions without their parents' \nconsent. But this is not what this bill is about. The majority of young \nwomen involve their parents in a vital decision such as this. In fact, \nover 60 percent of young women involve their parents in their decision \nto have an abortion. For adolescents 14 years and younger, the number \nis 90 percent.\n  So what is happening in cases when young women choose not to involve \ntheir parents? Studies show that in one-third of the cases where young \nwomen do not involve a parent, they\n\n[[Page S8183]]\n\nfear family violence or being forced to leave the home. Research tells \nus that almost 50 percent of pregnant young women with a history of \nphysical abuse report that they were hit during their pregnancy. \nUnfortunately, the person they were most often hit by was a family \nmember.\n  The truth is adolescents that are most at risk for teen pregnancy are \nalso the most likely to come from violent homes. Here, they often may \nnot receive the parental guidance they need to make healthy decisions. \nTherefore, many experts tell us that teens at greatest risk for teen \npregnancy also suffer the most from mandatory parental consent laws. \nThese are young women that often do not have access to good parental \nsupport and guidance. They are likely to turn to other adult role \nmodels in their lives--grandmothers, aunts, cousins, or sisters for \nthat guidance and support.\n\n  But S. 403 would send these people--grandmothers, aunts and religious \nfigures--to prison for assisting young women in need. Mr. President, is \nthis the way the Nation should be focusing on as a solution to teen \npregnancy? Why don't we work together to reduce the numbers of \nunintended pregnancies and give people the social supports they need to \nmake healthy choices? Why aren't the administration and the \ncongressional majority talking about finding new pregnancy prevention \nprograms that do not include jails?\n  Instead, this administration and the majority in Congress are \ninitiating programs that are reversing the declines in abortion rates \nthat we saw in the late 1990s. The Bush administration is more \nconcerned with parental notification laws that we know hurt teens and \nwould only affect a minority of cases than with actually preventing \nabortions. On their watch, abortion rates have stopped declining. In \nfact, according to government statistics, 90 percent of the States that \nattract the most out-of-State abortions actually have moderate to \nstrict parental involvement laws. S. 403 will do nothing to keep young \nwomen from having to make a difficult choice--it will only make it \nharder for them.\n  The American Psychological Association has listed studies that show \nthat parental notification laws increase adolescent stress and anxiety. \nThey increase the likelihood of teenage pregnancy. Parental \nnotification laws also make it more likely that teens will turn to \nextralegal and unsafe methods of abortion that could result in serious \ninjury.\n  I wished we lived in a world where parents would always be involved \nin their children's health decisions. I would want any young woman in \nAmerica contemplating abortion to trust her parents enough and feel \nsafe enough to involve them in her decision. Unfortunately, that is not \nthe reality that many of our young women face. They cannot go to their \nparents for fear of abuse and violence. This bill does nothing to \nprotect these young women by including a strong judicial bypass, and \ndoes not take into consideration the difficult situations these young \nwomen face.\n  I cannot even list the numbers of groups that have come out in strong \nopposition of S. 403, but they include the American Civil Liberties \nUnion, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Medical Women's \nAssociation, the National Organization for Women, the National \nPartnership for Women & Families, and the Republican Majority for \nChoice. I am joining those groups in opposition to S. 403.\n  S. 403 is another attempt at curtailing a woman's right to choose--in \nthis case, young women, who are often the most vulnerable to violence \nand abuse from those that are supposed to be protecting them. I ask my \ncolleagues to defeat S. 403.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President. I rise today in support of legislation \nprotecting the most important relationship of all: that of parents and \ntheir children. The family is the fundamental, crucial and \nindispensable building block of our civilization, and parents are at \nits center. Yet, when it comes to one of the most important decisions \nin life, children are being kept from the guidance of their parents. I \nam talking, of course, about the decision whether or not to have an \nabortion.\n  The American people believe that parents should be involved in \ndeciding whether their daughter should undergo an abortion. Statistics \nconsistently show this, and the Supreme Court has upheld this. As the \nCourt noted in the decision of H.L. v. Matheson: ``the medical, \nemotional, and psychological consequences of an abortion are serious \nand can be lasting; this is particularly so when the patient is \nimmature.'' In the case of Parham V. J.R. the Court said ``[t]he law's \nconcept of the family rests on a presumption that parents possess what \na child lacks in maturity, experience, and capacity for judgment \nrequired for making life's difficult decisions.''\n  Convinced of the soundness of this reasoning, at least 48 States have \nenacted laws requiring consent of or notification to at least one \nparent, or authorization by a judge, before a minor can obtain an \nabortion. Unfortunately, this wise policy is being undermined.\n  Thousands of children every year are taken across State lines by \npeople other than their parents to secure secret abortions. As we \nspeak, abortion providers across the Nation, operating in States with \nno parental consent or notification laws, are taking out advertisements \nin phonebooks outside of the State where they operate in order to \nattract underage patients in neighboring States with different laws. \nThey are doing this in my home State of Idaho. They are doing this in \nPennsylvania, blatantly trumpeting the fact that their clinics, outside \nof Pennsylvania, do not require parental notification as Pennsylvania \ndoes. In essence, these abortion providers are encouraging people to \ncircumvent one State's parental notification law by crossing the border \ninto another for a secret abortion.\n  The tragedy is that thousands of non-related adults take this \nsuggestion every year in successful attempts to circumvent the law. In \none highly publicized case, a 12-year-old girl living in a State with a \nconstitutionally upheld parental notification law became pregnant by an \n18-year-old man. The man's mother took her for an abortion in a \nneighboring State with no parental notification requirement. The \nmother's actions were discovered, and she was convicted of interfering \nwith the custody of a child. A prominent proabortion legal defense \norganization appealed the conviction on the grounds that she merely \n``assisted a woman to exercise her constitutional rights'' and as such \nwas herself protected from prosecution by the Constitution. This \nreasoning cannot stand.\n  To say that, because the Court in Roe v. Wade declared most abortions \nconstitutionally protected during the first trimester, that therefore \nminors have an absolute right to abortion without so much as notifying \ntheir parents, and that third parties--whatever their motives--have the \nright to transport them across State lines for a secret abortion, is to \nstand constitutional protections on their head. It is to strip children \nof the natural protection of their parents. There is hardly another \ncircumstance warranting the need for parental guidance and judgment \nmore than when a young daughter becomes pregnant and is considering an \nabortion. For the sake of our children and our families, this must \nstop. As a Nation, we loosen our precious family ties at our peril.\n  I must also note that Idaho is unable to enforce parental \nnotification and consent laws that have passed the State legislature \nand have been signed into law by the Governor. Nearly 20 other States \nare in the same situation. These laws are all enjoined due to lawsuits \nbrought by organizations intent on imposing their flawed understanding \nof the United States Constitutional protections on the American people, \nand judges willing to support it. It is my hope that this litigation \nwill be resolved and that the right of elected officials to make and \nenforce laws under their jurisdiction will be upheld.\n  I strongly support and am cosponsoring the Child Custody Protection \nAct. Children must receive parental consent for even minor surgical \nprocedures. Children must receive parental consent to take an asprin \nfrom their school nurse. I want to make it a Federal offense to \ntransport a minor across State lines with intent to avoid the \napplication of a State law requiring parental involvement in a minor's \nabortion, or judicial waiver of such a requirement. The profound, \nlasting physical and psychological effects of abortion demand that we \nhelp states guarantee parental involvement in the\n\n[[Page S8184]]\n\nabortion decision. That means, at a minimum, seeing to it that outside \nparties cannot walk around State parental notification and consent laws \non a whim or as a means to hide illegal activity. We can no more afford \nto allow State laws to be ignored than we can afford to allow family \nties to be further undermined. For the sake of our families, I urge my \ncolleagues to defend both by supporting the Child Custody Protection \nAct.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today in support of parents' \nmost basic right and responsibility: to be actively involved in their \nchildren's lives, particularly in times of crisis. For that reason I \nwholeheartedly support S. 403, the Child Custody Protection Act.\n  I was an original co-sponsor of this bill when my good friend from \nNevada, Senator Ensign, introduced it in 2005. S. 403 will make it a \nFederal offense to transfer a minor across State lines to obtain an \nabortion in order to evade a parental notification or parental consent \nlaw in the State in which the minor resides.\n  I am sure that my colleagues on both sides of the aisle will agree \nwith me that every abortion is a tragic occurrence. The weight of such \na decision falls heavily on any woman, particularly a minor. That is \nexactly the time that a child should be able to rely on a parent's \ncounsel. And that is exactly the time a parent has a responsibility to \nbe a parent, and get involved in their child's life.\n  Let me stress that S. 403 will not impose any new law or requirement \non any State. Nor does it alter or supersede any existing State laws. \nAll that this bill will do is reinforce state laws that are already in \neffect, and prevent them from being evaded by miscreants who would \ntransport a minor across State lines for an abortion and cut the \nparents out of their child's life at such a crucial time.\n  This bill will promote the health of pregnant teens by ensuring that \ntheir parents--the people best equipped to make major medical \ndecisions, answer questions about medical history, and help their child \nthrough the physical and emotional recuperative process--are present. \nAnd the bill also contains an exception if an abortion is necessary to \nsave the life of the minor.\n  There is already a national consensus in America that a parent should \nbe involved when a minor girl faces such an important decision. Forty-\nfive States have enacted laws recognizing the need for responsible \nadults to give guidance to minors in decisions about abortion. And 37 \nStates have parental notification or parental consent laws, including \nKentucky, which has the latter. What we are doing here is an entirely \nappropriate Federal role: reinforcing the States' power to pass and \nenforce laws which are entirely constitutional. When I say that the \nState law in question must be constitutional, that is also provided for \nin the bill. S. 403 will only reinforce a State law if that law has \npassed constitutional muster.\n  Some critics will claim that this bill will grant too much influence \nto parents in their children's lives, and that young girls ought to be \nable to go and get an abortion without talking to their mom or dad. I \nam a little surprised at that line of thinking. I think that, \ngenerally, it is a good thing for kids to talk to their parents and ask \nthem for help when they need it. But in any event, we have laws that \ngive parents a say in what their kids do for matters far less serious \nthan abortion.\n  Twenty-seven States currently require parental consent--not just \nnotification, but consent--before a child under age 18 can get a \ntattoo. And 27 States require parental consent before a child under age \n18 can get a body piercing. So if the opponents of this bill had their \nway, a 14-year-old girl could evade State law to get an abortion--but \nnot a tattoo.\n  Perhaps thousands of underage girls get taken across State lines for \nabortions every year. Studies have shown that the majority of these \ngirls have male partners older than 20. Many of these men are \ncommitting statutory rape. These girls are in trouble and need the \nadvice of a mom or a dad to help them out of their desperate \nsituations. This Senate ought to take the side of the parents over the \nside of the criminals.\n  Throughout my career, I have consistently stood for protecting the \nunborn and promoting a culture of life. I don't like that people are \nspiriting young girls away from their parents to get them to have \nabortions, and evading State law to boot. If this law means fewer \nabortions in America, I will celebrate that.\n  But I want to stress to my colleagues who may take an opposing view \nthat the central issue of the Child Custody Protection Act is parental \nrights. Parents ought to have the right to be heard at such a pivotal \nmoment in the children's lives, and States ought to have the \nexpectation that their duly passed laws ensuring just that are \nenforced.\n  What opponents of this bill forget is that no parent wants anyone to \ntake their children across State lines--or even across the street--\nwithout their permission. This is a fundamental right, and the Congress \nis right to uphold it in law.\n  Not one girl should have to make a decision--or worse, be forced into \na decision that she will regret for the rest of her life because her \nmom and dad weren't there to lean on. It is this Senate's \nresponsibility to see that doesn't happen. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport this bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, to update our colleagues on what has been \ngoing on, we had three amendments still pending on this bill. Senator \nBoxer and I, and our staffs, with the leadership on both sides, have \nbeen working together. We think we have come up with a compromise \namendment. It will be the Boxer-Ensign amendment. We will be making a \nunanimous consent request in a few moments.\n  I thank Senator Boxer and her staff for the way they have worked \ntogether with us, coming to an agreement. This is a good example of how \npeople who fundamentally disagree--passionately--on an issue can \nactually find some common ground and work together at least on an \namendment. That is what we have done today. I am very pleased with what \nthe staffs have done and the compromise we have reached. It is very \nsatisfying.\n  Let me spend a few minutes talking on the bill as the final details \nare being worked out. This is an important piece of legislation, not \nbecause of the huge numbers it will affect--I have had that question \nfrom reporters: How many girls actually get taken across State lines to \nget an abortion? Sadly, no one knows the answer to that because it is \nnot reported.\n  As a matter of fact, right now when it happens, the parents have no \nrights to the information, so they cannot find out even after the fact. \nThey find out by rumor or maybe their child ends up telling them later \nwhere they had it done. We had cases where they tried to get the \ninformation, but, frankly, the clinic would not release the \ninformation. We have no idea how many victims are out there--the \nrecords are not kept anywhere--or how often this happens.\n  I have tried to put myself in a situation that I would want my \nSenator representing me. I try to say, okay, I am an average person, \nhow would I want my Senator representing me? I happen to be the father \nof a little girl. We have three kids. Our middle child is a little \ngirl. She happens to be with me this weekend in Washington. In the \ncoming years, as she matures as a young woman, I think about if some \n20-year-old preyed on her when she was in her teenage years and got her \npregnant and then somehow, because we had a parental consent law, which \nI hope we do someday in Nevada, and the 20-year old said: I won't date \nyou anymore unless you get a secret abortion. He thinks: I will \nconvince her somehow, manipulate a very vulnerable young woman. I will \nconvince her that I won't see her anymore if she doesn't get the \nabortion--or whatever means needed to persuade her to get an abortion. \nIf there is a parental consent law in my State, I will decide to go \nsomeplace else where they don't require it. In other words, he gets \naround the will of the people of the State of Nevada or any state that \nrequires parental involvement.\n\n  In a case such as that, I would be totally devastated as a parent \nbecause I would not be able to help my daughter through this time \nbecause I would not even know about it. I would not know if she had a \ncomplication from the surgical procedure of abortion. I would not \nknow--if she had a complication in the\n\n[[Page S8185]]\n\nmiddle of the night and she started bleeding--that I should be watching \nfor something that could be going wrong. If she had a fever, I would \nprobably say: Honey, we will get you some Advil or Tylenol. And maybe I \nwould hold her for a little while. And she would be afraid to tell me \nwhat was going on and, without me knowing, that could develop into very \nserious complications overnight. Complications that could even be life \nthreatening.\n  Well, I try to put myself in those kinds of situations as a Senator \nand say: How would I want to be represented? And this is how I would \nwant it. I would want somebody to stand up and say: The rights of \nparents should be respected. That is what we are doing in this bill. \nBut more than that, for the well-being of these teenage girls, the vast \nmajority of them would be better off if the parents were involved.\n  Now, we realize there are cases where that is not the case, where \nthere is an abusive parent. There are exceptions. That is part of the \namendment compromise we are working to reach. I think it is a good \ncompromise. In a situation--that has been brought up here on the floor \nmany times where there has been a girl impregnated who is in her \nteenage years, we do not want to make unreasonable exceptions that make \nthese laws ineffective.\n  There was an amendment that would have said: We will make an \nexception to allow the clergy to take a girl across State lines. They \nwanted an amendment that said the grandparents should have an \nexception. Well, let me address those two exceptions because they \nsound, on their face, reasonable. We have case after case after case of \ndocumentation where the clergy was actually the person who was \nimpregnating the teenager. We have all read about the scandals with \nsome of our clergy. Clergy are human beings and, just like any other, \nthey can be flawed human beings. We know that. Just because they have a \nwhite collar on does not mean they are perfect human beings.\n  Some of those imperfections can be seen in cases of sexual abuse by \nmembers of the clergy with teenagers. For instance, there have been \nmembers of the clergy who have taken minor children across State lines \nto avoid parental consent laws. And because they are clergy--they are \nsupposed to be this authority figure--the girl does not want to \nquestion them and she goes across State lines and has a secret \nabortion.\n  The exception that was going to be offered in one of the amendments \nwould have allowed that member of the clergy, which was not defined, to \nbe exempt from prosecution under this bill. I cannot support such an \nexemption.\n  Not only that, any one can become a member of the clergy. In fact, \nlast night I asked my staff, because I had heard you could become a \nmember on the internet fairly easily, and within 3 minutes she became \nan ordained minister. So, anybody could go on the Internet and \nofficially be recognized as an ordained minister, officially by our \ncourts. Leaving it open that a 20-something-year-old who has \nimpregnated a teenager could become a minister and could still fall \nunder the clergy exception.\n  Let me address the grandparent case. In the case of the grandparents, \nyou have a situation where maybe there was incest in the family, and \nthe grandparent feels they care about the child, and they want to help \nthem. Most grandparents are loving, and they will want to help the \nchild in that case. The Senator from California and others have made \nthe case that they should not be prosecuted under this law because they \ntook the child across State lines to get an abortion because they only \nthought they were trying to help.\n  Well, I would make the argument that if those grandparents cared \nabout that child who was in a situation where they were in an abusive \nhome--they were raped by their father--the grandparents should contact \nthe authorities, get the authorities involved to stop the cycle of \nabuse. You would use the judicial bypass for such case. Judicial bypass \nwould mean that you would not have to go across State lines if that was \nwhat the outcome would be, to have an abortion. You would have the \njudiciary, the authorities involved.\n  If the authorities were involved, you take that girl out of that \nabusive situation and protect her. If you allow for the grandparent \nexception and allow secret abortions, that is not going to happen. In \ntoo many cases, it is easier to get the abortion, and hide the problem, \nsaving the family from embarrassment. If you go to the authorities, it \nmay become public. That is why I think we need to not have the \ngrandparent exception and the clergy exception.\n  So, Mr. President, we are still waiting for the amendment to come \ndown in its final form. As soon as it does, we will be entering into a \nunanimous consent agreement. But let me wrap up because it has been a \nvery good debate, with strong emotions on each side.\n  I think this is a bill Americans can come together on and find common \nground. I have mentioned before there are good people on both sides of \nthe abortion debate with deeply held beliefs. I believe life begins at \nconception and that child is a child and has a soul from the time they \nare conceived. That is why I believe that same child deserves \nprotection throughout their life. I also know that people look at it \ndifferently on the other side, and they too have deeply held beliefs.\n\n  So Americans have been saying: Can't we at least find some middle \nground? Can't we find some ground to at least make some reasonable \nrestrictions on abortion and support parents rights? I believe we have \nbrought forth a bill today that finds that common ground. Eighty \npercent of the American people support this legislation, and they do \nthat because it is reasonable. From a protection of parents' rights \nperspective; from a protection of the girl's perspective; from going \nafter some of these, literally, sexual predators, these 20-something-\nyear-olds, who are taking these teenagers across State lines; from a \nlaw enforcement perspective; from a lot of different ways this is a \nreasonable piece of legislation. That is why I introduced it, why I \nsupport it so strongly, and why I am happy we are finally having this \ndebate on the Senate floor.\n  I want to thank my colleagues, especially Senator Boxer, on the other \nside of the aisle for allowing the debate to happen, for bringing this \nthing to a final vote, where we can get passage on this bill and then \ngo to a conference with the House and, hopefully, work out the \ndifferences between the House and the Senate. My hope and prayer is we \ncan get this bill actually signed into law by the President this year.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chambliss). The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, again, for the benefit of our colleagues, \nwe are waiting patiently to have the amendment we agreed on to come \nbefore us. Then we are hoping at the right time, Senator Ensign will \nmake a unanimous consent request for a vote on an amendment we have \nagreed on, and then vote on final passage. So hopefully we will have \nthat done very soon. As soon as it is done, I will yield the floor and \nallow the Senator, the good Senator from Nevada, to make his unanimous \nconsent request.\n  The Senator from Nevada wants to protect our daughters. He is a dad \nof a daughter. I am a mom of a daughter. I want to protect our \ndaughters. So let's not get confused on this point. We all want to \nprotect our daughters. We all adore them. We want them to be safe, and \nwe want them to get the help they need. We want them healthy. We want \nthem well. We do not want them afraid.\n  But I do fear that this bill, the way it is drafted--and, yes, we are \ngoing to make a little bit of a correction on the incest part, but not \nas much as we should, but some--we are going to make some progress, and \nI am grateful for that. Basically, the way this bill is drafted, it is \ngoing to frighten our daughters because here is the way it works, \nfolks: If you are a young woman in a parental notification State, you \nwill take matters into your own hands because you are too frightened to \ngo to your parents.\n  Now, we all hope all parents will be open and loving and caring and \nhelpful and will be able to be approached when a young woman becomes \npregnant and it is an unintended pregnancy. We would hope and pray that \nfamily, that loving family, will sit around and talk about what ought \nto happen here, what is the best thing for everybody. I am pro-choice. \nI am for whatever the family decides. If they decide that the best \nthing is to raise that child in the family, that is their choice. If \nthey decide\n\n[[Page S8186]]\n\nit is best if the young woman exercises her right to choose, which is \nher right in this country--and has been since 1973--she has that right.\n  That is what we hope happens, that there will be these conversations. \nOf course, my friends on the other side of the aisle do not want a \nchoice. They want to force her to have the child. They are against Roe \nv. Wade, but that is another debate. That is a debate we take to the \npeople, and that is a debate that the pro-choice people win. They do \nnot want Senator Boxer or Senator Ensign involved in that family \ndiscussion, saying: But, no, you must have this child. You must not \nhave any rights to choose. They do not want that. People do not feel \ncomfortable with it. They want to deal with this their own way, with \ntheir own God, with their own family, with their loving family members. \nBut that is not before us.\n  What is before us is a very narrow bill that deals with a very narrow \ncircumstance where there is a young woman who does not go to her \nparents, mostly because she is scared to death to go to them. For \nwhatever reasons, in her mind, she is fearful: Will they--if she is \nfrom a violent home--beat her up? Will they hurt her? Will they \nverbally abuse her? Will they be disappointed? And that weighs on her.\n  So what we are saying with this bill to that girl in a parental \nnotification State is: You are alone. You can't go to anyone else. You \ncan't go to your grandma who you adore, you can't go to your grandpa, \nyou can't go to your big sister, you can't go to your Aunt Susan, you \ncan't go to your clergy who has taken care of you and looked after you.\n  So you can't go to your doctor. You can't do this because they could \nbe sued and put in jail. That is what this bill does. Is that America? \nRather than go to the people who she knows who adore her, love her, \ncare about her, would counsel her, would help her and, perhaps, by the \nway, talk her into speaking to her parents or going with her to speak \nto her parents, this bill says: Go it alone, get in your car, get in an \nairplane, don't take anyone with you, don't tell anyone else, because \nthat person can be sued and, worse, put in jail.\n  These are our kids. My God, what a situation. And somehow this is \nsupposed to be a wonderful thing we are doing, a family-values thing we \nare doing. I don't think you can force families into these situations. \nWe don't know enough to be able to do that. There will be unintended \nconsequences. We will have suicides. We will have very serious \nproblems.\n  As we wait around here in these last moments of this debate--and I am \nhopeful we can bring it to a close--let me say again that I thank \nSenator Ensign for coming my way, not quite halfway, on the issue of \nincest. Because the bill as written allowed a father who raped his \ndaughter to have all kinds of parental rights: the right to sign an \nagreement that she could have an abortion, the right to take her over \nState lines, the right to sue a loving and caring adult who helped her.\n  I wish to show this chart which I have shown previously. Under this \namendment we are hoping is coming to us momentarily, we will stop a \nfather who has raped his daughter from suing the trusted adult who \nhelped his daughter end the resulting pregnancy. So in the case of \nincest, if the child goes to grandma, the incestuous father cannot sue \ngrandma.\n  Then, at the end, Senator Ensign was not willing to take these three \nprovisions which I will debate. He did take my last provision.\n  We now stop a father who has raped his daughter or any other family \nmember who has committed incest against a minor from transporting her \nacross State lines to obtain an abortion. That would be a crime.\n  The three things that are not done, which is why I think this \namendment falls short: we haven't stopped a father who has raped his \ndaughter from exercising parental consent rights; we haven't stopped \nall criminal prosecution or jail time for a trusted adult who helped a \nvictim of incest; and we haven't stopped all civil suits against a \ntrusted adult who helped a victim of incest. But we have taken care of \ntwo issues. For that I am grateful because this bill will become law. \nIt will be sent to the President, who will sign it. Unlike his veto on \nthe stem cell bill, which he should have signed, because that bill \nwould help our families, help our children with juvenile diabetes, help \ngrandmas and grandpas with Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, help our \nyoungsters who were paralyzed--he vetoed that. He will sign this one.\n  This is a political bill. It did come to us in 1998 just before the \nelection. Let's face facts. We know when it came.\n  My friend from Nevada is right when he says people support parental \nnotification. They do want to believe we could all to go our parents \nwith these problems. But let me tell you what they don't want. They \ndon't want to give incest predators any rights whatsoever. They would \nwant to make an exception in this bill for rape victims so that if you \nare a victim of rape and you were too scared to tell your parents, you \ncould go to your grandmother, but not under this bill. A victim of \nrape, you are too scared to tell your parents because of the \ncircumstances--maybe it was date rape, maybe you just can't explain it. \nMaybe you are frightened to death. You go to your grandma. She could be \nsued by the parents and she could be put in jail by the Federal \nGovernment. Send your grandma to jail. That is what we are doing here \ntoday. Why? Because she loved her granddaughter, because she was there \nfor her granddaughter, and because by stepping in, she may have really \nsaved a tragedy from occurring.\n  I don't believe the American people want us to be this radical. I \nthink they would have wanted us to do more exceptions to this bill. \nSeventy percent of the American people oppose abortion laws that put \npeople in jail. I don't believe Americans think that stopping an \nabortion is worth causing a teen a lifetime of paralysis, infertility, \nor worse. This bill, if it does get signed into law, and I say it will, \nand unless it is overturned by the courts, which I think it might be, \nbut if it isn't, it basically will put these young women in a situation \nwhere they feel the world is closing in on them. That is not right.\n  I will close my debate and urge a ``yes'' vote on the Boxer-Ensign \namendment that will go part way toward solving the predator incest \nissue. Then I would urge a ``no'' vote on the underlying bill because \nof all the problems it creates that we have not been able to address.\n  I thank the staffs on both sides. We have had a long and difficult \nday, emotional issues for us all. Yet we have handled it in such a way \nthat I am hopeful that momentarily we will have a unanimous consent \nrequest to resolve the procedures governing the rest of the evening.\n  I yield back my time and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. ENSIGN. I ask \nunanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Boxer \nbe recognized in order to offer an amendment; provided further that \nthere be 5 minutes for Senator Boxer and----\n  Mrs. BOXER. I only need 30 seconds.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. That we have 1 minute for Senator Boxer, 1 minute for \nSenator Ensign, and following that time, the Senate proceed to a vote \nin relation to the Boxer amendment. I further ask that following that \nvote, the bill be read a third time and the Senate proceed to a vote on \npassage of the bill with no further intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4694\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from California [Mrs. Boxer], for herself and \n     Mr. Ensign, proposes an amendment numbered 4694.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. I ask unanimous consent that reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n         (Purpose: To punish parents who have committed incest)\n\n       On page 4, line 5, strike the period and insert ``, unless \n     the parent has committed an\n\n[[Page S8187]]\n\n     act of incest with the minor subject to subsection (a).''.\n\n       On page 5, after line 12 insert the following:\n\n     ``Sec. 2432. Transportation of minors in circumvention of \n       certain laws relating to abortion\n\n       ``Notwithstanding section 2431(b)(2), whoever has committed \n     an act of incest with a minor and knowingly transports the \n     minor across a State line with the intent that such minor \n     obtain an abortion, shall be fined under this title or \n     imprisoned not more than one year, or both.''\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank Senator Ensign. I had an amendment to solve this \nincest predator problem. He came to me almost halfway. We didn't quite \nget there, but it is a start. Again, for the benefit of my colleagues, \ntwo out of five provisions I wanted are in this amendment. This \namendment stops a father who has raped his daughter from suing the \ntrusted adult who helped his daughter end the resulting pregnancy, and \nit stops a father who has raped his daughter or any other family member \nwho has committed incest against a minor from transporting her across \nState lines. This is an improvement. The reason we want to have a vote \non it is because we hope it is a strong statement going into the \nconference on this bill. Again, we still need to fix many more \nprovisions of this bill.\n  I believe, at the end of the day, it doesn't make our teenagers any \nsafer. It will make them fearful. It will make them feel alone. I think \nthe bill is unconstitutional. I hope we have some ``no'' votes to send \na message that this bill needs a lot more work.\n  I thank Senator Ensign and his staff and my staff. It has been a \ntough day.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, to wrap up, I encourage a ``yes'' vote on \nthe Boxer-Ensign amendment.\n  I thank my staff and Senator Boxer's staff and particularly name Pam \nThiessen and Alexis Bayer on my staff for the great work they have done \non this bill and Chris Jaarda for some of the number crunching he did \non the bill as well.\n  I hope we get a strong bipartisan vote on final passage. To alert our \nMembers, these will be two votes, and then we will be completely done \nwith this bill.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays on the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. I ask for the yeas and nays on final passage.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the yeas and nays may be \nrequested on final passage.\n  Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n4694.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. The following Senator was necessarily absent: the \nSenator from Oklahoma (Mr. Coburn).\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from California (Mrs. \nFeinstein) is necessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sununu).

Transportation of minors in circumvention of certain laws \n  relating to abortion..........................................2431''.\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I congratulate Chairman Ensign for managing \nthis bill, an important bill that we have passed and that the House has \npassed, and now it is time for us to go to conference. I thank \nleadership and the managers on both sides because we were able to \naddress a very important issue and had appropriate amendments under an \nagreement that was reached, and conclusion was passage as we just heard \nby 65 to 34 on this bill.\n  With regard to that, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nimmediately proceed to the consideration of H.R. 748, the House \ncompanion measure; provided that all after the enacting clause be \nstricken and the text of S. 403, as amended, if amended, be inserted in \nlieu thereof; the bill then be read a third time and passed, and the \nSenate insist on its amendment, request a conference with the House, \nand the Chair be authorized to appoint conferees with a ratio of 7 to \n5.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, on behalf \nof myself and other Senators, I will object to the appointment of \nconferees at this point. This is an issue which has been debated for a \nshort time here on the floor and never went through the Senate \nJudiciary Committee for consideration. It is our belief that at this \npoint in the session asking for a conference committee is premature.\n  I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, the objection is heard. And I will say that \nI am disappointed. This bill passed the House of Representatives on \nApril 17, 2005, and just passed this body 65 to 34 expressing the will \nof the Senate. Routinely, we would go to conference with the House and \nthe Senate bill and move forward. I understand that objection is made. \nI am very disappointed that is the case.

Mr. President, Iraq Prime Minister Maliki's visit to the \nUnited States comes at an important time. All Americans want Iraq's new \ngovernment to succeed. The principal measure of success will be whether \nthe tide of violence recedes and full-scale civil war is avoided. But \nfor that to happen, the new government must deal quickly, decisively, \nand effectively with the principal threat to stability--the deadly \ninfluence of the militias--especially in Baghdad.\n  It is time for the new government to move beyond vagaries and develop \na viable strategy to deal with the militias and prevent Iraq from \ndescending into full-scale civil war. He needs to begin implementing a \ncredible plan to disarm, demobilize, and reintegrate the militias into \nthe security forces. He must obtain a real commitment from the \npolitical parties to assist in disbanding and disarming the militias.\n  As the new violence in Lebanon demonstrates, political parties cannot \ngovern with one hand and terrorize civilians with militias with the \nother hand. It did not work with Hezbollah in Lebanon, it cannot work \nwith Hamas, and it will not work in Iraq.\n  Militias are the engines of civil war, and there is no role for them \nin a legitimately functioning government of Iraq. Iraq's future and the \nlives of our troops are close to the precipice of a new disaster. The \ntimebomb of full-scale civil war is ticking, and our most urgent \npriority is to defuse it.\n  America, too, must be honest about the situation in Iraq. President \nBush, the Vice President, and Secretary Rumsfeld continue to deny that \nIraq is in a civil war. But the increasing sectarian violence, the \nruthless death squads, and the increasingly powerful role of the \nprivately armed militias tell a very different story.\n  We cannot ignore this major danger. President Bush needs to consider \nthe cold, hard facts and prepare a strategy to protect our troops who \nare at risk of getting caught in the middle of an unwinnable sectarian \ncivil war. Such planning is not an admission of defeat; it is \nresponsible and necessary to protect the lives of our men and women in \nIraq who are serving with great courage under enormously difficult \ncircumstances.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/07/25/senate-section/article/S8188-3", "month": "07", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8188-S8189]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ENHANCEMENT ACT OF 2005\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the need for \nhate crimes legislation. Each Congress, Senator Kennedy and I introduce \nhate crimes legislation that would add new categories to current hate \ncrimes law, sending a signal that violence of any kind is unacceptable \nin our society. Likewise, each Congress I have come to the floor to \nhighlight a separate hate crime that has occurred in our country.\n  On October 14, 1995, in Atlanta, GA, Quincy Taylor, a high school \nstudent, was found dead behind a convenience store from gunshot wounds \nto the chest. Taylor frequented and sometimes worked at a popular gay \nbar known for featuring cross-dressing entertainment. According to \npolice, the killer knew the victim and was motivated solely by his \nsexual orientation.\n  I believe that the Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, \nto defend\n\n[[Page S8189]]\n\nthem against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law Enforcement \nEnhancement Act is a symbol that can become substance. I believe that \nby passing this legislation and changing current law, we can change \nhearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/07/25/senate-section/article/S8189-1", "month": "07", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8189-S8190]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    PRESIDENTIAL SIGNING STATEMENTS\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, yesterday we were reminded, again, of the \nlawlessness of the Bush-Cheney administration as it continues its abuse \nof ``signing statements'' as part of a systematic pursuit of power \nwithout the checks and balances inherent in our constitutional \ndemocracy. A most distinguished task force of the American Bar \nAssociation has now released a unanimous report highly critical of this \nPresident's practice as ``contrary to the rule of law and our \nconstitutional system of separation of powers.'' I thank the \ndistinguish panel of conservatives and moderates, or Republicans and \nDemocrats for their thoughtful report.\n  Let me be clear, this is not some academic debate without \nconsequences. I have been seeking to draw attention to this \nsurreptitious power-grab for at least 4 years, since this President's \nunusual signing statement following enactment of the Sarbanes-Oxley \nbill in 2002 to reign in corporate abuses that cost so many Americans \ntheir livelihoods and their retirement savings through Enron and other \nscandals. The President signed the bill but had secret \n``reservations.'' That is when I first realized the President's \nunorthodox, unwise and unsound practice of signing a bill while \ncrossing his fingers behind his back. We have seen it over and over \nagain as this President insists on the equivalent of an unwritten line-\nitem veto that would undermine the checks and balances of our \nconstitutional separation of powers and that the Supreme Court \ncorrectly determined was unconstitutional.\n  Later this week, the President will be signing the reauthorization \nand revitalization of the Voting Rights Act, passed by the House with \n390 votes and unanimously last week by the Senate. In the past I could \nhave gone to the White House to witness the bill signing knowing that \nour three branches of government were all operating within their proper \nauthority. That is the way we have operated for more than 200 years. \nBut this year, with this President, that is not the way any longer. \nAfter the bill signing, after the celebration, after the bipartisan \nplaudits and after the President takes credit for the civil rights \nadvances that our bill is intended to represent--after all this--we \nwill have to wait to see whether there is a belated presidential \ndocument, a so-called ``signing statement.'' Only then will we see if \nthe President will seek to create a gloss that Congress did not intend, \nor modify a provision of law more to his liking, or declare some \nprovision of law something he and his administration will not enforce. \nThat is wrong. That is the opposite of the rule of law. And no one--not \neven the President--is above the law.\n  The Constitution places the lawmaking power, ``All legislative \nPowers'' in the Congress. That is an article I power. A check on the \ncongressional power is the requirement that ``before [a bill] becomes a \nLaw'' it must be presented to the President. Section 7 of article I of \nthe Constitution provides: ``If he approve he shall sign it, but if not \nhe shall return it, with his Objections to that House in which it shall \nhave originated.'' Of course the Constitution then contemplates \ncongressional power to override a presidential objection or veto. That \nis our system, that is our law. The President has the option to veto--\nin fact after 5 years in office, he finally exercised that power last \nweek when he vetoed the stem cell research legislation. I disagreed \nwith his decision to veto that bill, but it was within his \nconstitutional power to do it. He does not have the power to issue a \ndecree that he will pick and choose which provisions of laws to follow \nin statements issued after Congress passes a law. What this President \nis doing is wrong.\n  Last month, the Senate Judiciary Committee held a hearing on the use \nof these signing statements by the Bush-Cheney administration. I noted \nthat we are at a pivotal moment in our Nation's history, where \nAmericans are faced with a President who makes sweeping claims for \nalmost unchecked Executive power. This President's use of signing \nstatements is unprecedented, although presaged by the work of Samuel \nAlito at the Meese Justice Department during the Reagan Presidency--now \nJustice Alito on the Supreme Court. This administration is now \nroutinely using signing statements to proclaim which parts of the law \nthe President will follow, which parts he will ignore, and which he \nwill reinterpret. This is what I have called ``cherry-picking'' and it \nis wrong.\n  This President's broad use of signing statements to try to rewrite \nthe laws passed by the Congress poses a grave threat to our \nconstitutional system of checks and balances. During his 5 years in \noffice, President Bush has abused his bill signing statements to assign \nhis own interpretations to laws passed by Congress.\n  According to a review of these statements conducted by The Boston \nGlobe, President Bush has employed signing statements to ignore or \ndisobey more than 750 provisions enacted by the Congress since 2001, \nmore than all previous Presidents in the history of our Nation \ncombined. According to scholarly research that number now tops 800 \nprovisions of law.\n  I have alluded to the President's signing statement in 2002 in \nconnection with the Sarbanes-Oxley law designed to combat corporate \nfraud. The President used his signing statement to attempt to narrow a \nprovision protecting corporate whistleblowers in a way that would have \nafforded them very little protection. Senator Grassley and I wrote a \nletter to the President stating that his narrow interpretation was at \nodds with the plain language of the statute, and the administration \nreluctantly relented on this view but only after much protest.\n  We also witnessed the President's fondness for signing statements \nearlier this year, when after months of debate and negotiations in \nCongress, the President issued a signing statement for the USA PATRIOT \nACT reauthorization language in which he stated his intentions not to \nfollow the reporting and oversight provisions contained in that bill. I \nnoted this abuse at the time. When I voted against that \nreauthorization, I explained it was because I did not have confidence \nthat the oversight provisions we succeeded in incorporating into the \nlaw would be respected. What little doubt was left by the self-serving \nsigning statement was erased last week when the Attorney General of the \nUnited States refused to commit to following the law.\n  This President has also used signing statements to challenge laws \nbanning torture, on affirmative action and prohibiting the censorship \nof scientific data. In fact, time and again, this President has stood \nbefore the American people, signed laws enacted by their \nrepresentatives in Congress, while all along crossing his fingers \nbehind his back. And, while this President used to boast--until his \nveto of stem cell research legislation--that he was the first modern \nPresident to have never vetoed a bill, he has cleverly used his signing \nstatements as a de facto line-item veto to cherry-pick which laws he \nwill enforce in a manner not consistent with our Constitution.\n  Under our constitutional system of government, when Congress passes a \nbill and the President signs it into law, that should be the end of the \nstory. At that moment the President's constitutional duty is to ``take \nCare that the Laws be faithfully executed.'' That is the article II \npower, the executive power, to ``execute'' the laws, it is not a \nlegislative power. So when the President, including this President, \ntakes the oath of office and swears on the Bible, he does so, in the \nwords of the Constitution, ``Before he enter on the Execution of his \nOffice,'' and swears that he will ``faithfully execute'' the office of \nPresident and ``preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the \nUnited States.'' I remind this President and this administration that \nthe Constitution has more than one article and that ``All legislative \nPower'' is vested in Congress, not some ``unitary executive.''\n  When the President uses signing statements to unilaterally rewrite \nthe laws enacted by the people's representatives in Congress, he \nundermines the rule of law and our constitutional\n\n[[Page S8190]]\n\nchecks and balances designed to protect the rights of the American \npeople.\n  This President's abuse of signing statements is all the more \ndangerous because he has packed the courts with judges willing to defer \nto him and presidential authority. I have noted that Justice Alito \nhelped develop this device. I could not help but note that Justice \nScalia, who is famous for not consulting legislative history, reached \nout in his dissent in the recent Hamdan decision to reference a recent \nPresidential signing statement.\n  These signing statements are a diabolical device but this President \nwill continue to use and abuse them, if the Republican Congress lets \nhim. So far, this Congress has done exactly that. Whether it is \ntorture, warrantless eavesdropping on American citizens, or the \nunlawful detention of military prisoners, this Republican-led Congress \nhas been willing to turn a blind eye and rubberstamp the questionable \nactions of this administration, regardless of the consequences to our \nConstitution or civil liberties.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/07/25/senate-section/article/S8190-1", "month": "07", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8190]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           VOTING RIGHTS ACT\n\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I rise today to express my support for the \nVoting Rights Act, VRA. Unfortunately a longstanding medical \nappointment kept me from casting my vote in favor of this legislation \nlast week and I want there to be no question as to my support for the \nVRA. For over 50 years, the VRA has protected the cornerstone of \ndemocracy: the right to vote. Congress enacted the VRA in response to \nevidence that some States and counties had denied many citizens access \nto the ballot because of their race, ethnicity, and language-minority \nstatus. The creators of this law were convinced, as am I, that a strong \nAmerica is one that reflects the feelings and opinions of all \nAmericans. That means that everyone has the right to vote.\n  Provisions of the VRA prohibit election laws that would deny or \nabridge voting rights based on race, color, or membership in a language \nminority. The act allows citizens to challenge discriminatory voting \npractices and procedures and prohibits the use of any test or device as \na condition of voter registration. Such provisions seem like common \nsense today, but they were not always so widely supported. We must \nrecommit today not to return to the mistakes of yesterday. I am pleased \nthat the Senate approved the reauthorization of this critical act. It \ncorrectly ensures that every citizen has a stake and a voice in our \ncountry's future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/07/25/senate-section/article/S8190-2", "month": "07", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8190]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         INSTABILITY IN SOMALIA\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am deeply troubled by reports in the \npress that the Islamic courts in Somalia are advancing on the \ninternationally recognized Transitional Federal Government, TFG, and \nare apparently ignoring recently signed cease-fire agreements. It is \nimperative that the Islamic courts recognize the TFG as the official \ngoverning body of Somalia and that it abide by the cease fire agreed to \non June 22, 2006, in Khartoum. The Islamic courts must work in good \nfaith to strengthen the TFG and actively commit to the development of a \nmore inclusive and representative government of Somalia.\n  For this to happen, the international community, including the United \nStates, needs to be fully engaged. The United States, in particular, \nmust develop a comprehensive strategy for Somalia that utilizes all \nfacets of its power and capabilities and must ramp up its diplomatic \nefforts throughout the region and the international community to bring \nthis crisis to an end. Unfortunately, it can't do that if it doesn't \nhave the resources or the people in place to deal effectively with the \ncomplexity of this problem. The U.S. Government needs to appoint a \nsenior envoy for Somalia to pull together a strategy and to engage full \ntime with international and regional partners in addressing this \ncrisis. It also needs more staff and more resources to work with to \nhelp execute this strategy and to contribute to international efforts \nto bring about lasting peace throughout the region. The administration \nshould work closely with Congress to identify what additional resources \nare needed for Somalia, given the recent escalation of tension there.\n  That said, it is important to realize that efforts to both establish \nlong-term peace and to eradicate terrorist networks and safe havens in \nSomalia are complimentary. The U.S. Government must recognize that \nlong-term stability in Somalia is our best weapon against terrorist \nnetworks, extremist organizations, and the conditions that allow them \nto seek safe haven there. We must look at poverty reduction programs, \neconomic development efforts, support for democratic institutions, \nanticorruption efforts, and education as the core elements of a new \nSomalia strategy.\n  As we learned in Afghanistan, we cannot ignore the conditions that \nbreed extremist and terrorist organizations. Accordingly, it is \nessential to recognize that any attempt to address instability in \nSomalia must address a range of root causes or facilitating conditions: \na weak and dysfunctional central government, extreme poverty, \ncorruption, conflict, disease, and drought.\n  It is imperative that the U.S. Government begin playing a leadership \nrole in helping stabilize Somalia and the region and that it do so \nimmediately. We need a comprehensive approach to engaging with regional \nactors, the international community, and the U.N. to find a permanent \nsolution to this crisis. Such an approach will contribute to stability \nthroughout the Horn of Africa and to our national security.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/07/25/senate-section/article/S8190-3", "month": "07", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8190]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               NATIONAL KOREAN WAR VETERANS ARMISTICE DAY\n\n  Mrs. CLINTON.

As we honor the 53rd anniversary of the Korean War \nArmistice, I am proud to reintroduce this legislation recognizing \nKorean War Armistice Day.

I am \npleased to introduce this legislation to respectfully honor and pay \ntribute to the tremendous courage and sacrifice demonstrated by the men \nand women who served in the Korean war.

She was born in Saigon, South \n     Vietnam. Her father was a 3-star Lieutenant General for the \n     South Vietnam military and her family had almost everything \n     that you could possibly think of before the civil war of \n     Vietnam. However, when they lost their country, they lost \n     everything. After the war, all they had left was their hope \n     and beliefs.\n       In 1975, North Vietnam won the war. When my mother was only \n     12 years old (8th Grade), she and her brother and sister were \n     forced to go to Canada. The rest of her family was\n\n[[Page S8191]]\n\n     then scattered around the world in places like France, \n     Australia, Canada and the U.S.A. They all had a very tough \n     time there because they had no support and no money as new \n     immigrants.\n       For 7 years after the war, my mother went to school and \n     worked during the evening to help out my grandfather. My \n     mother attended college for only 2 years because she needed a \n     full time job to support her family. She also went to beauty \n     school, graduated, and worked for the family. Then, having \n     lived in Canada for 10 years, my mother realized there was a \n     better future for her in the U.S.A.--``The Land of \n     Opportunity.'' She decided to move to Pennsylvania in 1985.\n       My mother began hard work at a beauty shop near \n     Philadelphia and she worked hard everyday. Her dreams were to \n     ``ONE DAY'' create her own salon and reach her many dreams. \n     Due to her talents, she developed many clients and made a lot \n     of friends. She saved as much money as she could and even \n     avoided eating out or going to the movies or doing anything \n     fun that might cost money.\n       Then her dream of ``ONE DAY'' had come true when she met my \n     dad, John Bruce Schelkopf. My dad was a very bright young man \n     who was full of energy. With my dad's knowledge and skills \n     and my mom's talent, they opened a small beauty salon in \n     Pennsylvania. During this time my Mom also finished her \n     college degree and got her Bachelor's Degree in Business. My \n     mother also sponsored my grandparents from Canada to the \n     United States. My parents then got married in 1995 to begin a \n     family.\n       My mother's dreams came true because she always viewed life \n     as ``half of a full glass'' and because she found the U.S.A. \n     to truly be the ``land of opportunity.'' My mother often says \n     to me, ``You can do it if you believe in yourself and always \n     try your best.'' My mother is only one of the few million \n     Vietnamese immigrants who settled in the United States. But \n     that one particular Vietnamese immigrant is one special \n     immigrant to me as she struggled to overcome many challenges, \n     hard times, and obstacles in her way. She is a special \n     immigrant who I am happy to call ``My Mom Thuy.''\n                                  ____\n\n\n            Why I Am Glad America Is a Nation of Immigrants\n\n                         (By Arjun Kandaswamy)\n\n\n       Findley Elementary School--2006 National Contest Runner-Up\n\n       Imagine America without pizza and Top Ramen. Imagine \n     America without a booming economy. Imagine a world where \n     everyone wore the same boring style of clothes. That would be \n     reality if America did not have immigrants.\n       Pizza, tandoori, lasagna, dumplings or tortillas would not \n     be a part of our vocabulary or among our favorite foods if it \n     were not for immigrants. Although we don't realize it, many \n     foods we have grown to enjoy were greatly influenced by other \n     cultures. For example, Top Ramen is a popular and addicting \n     food. Although it's an American brand, it was greatly \n     influenced by Manchurian noodles brought over by Chinese \n     immigrants. Despite the fact that Top Ramen has flavors like \n     Cajun chicken it all started with Manchurian noodles. \n     Immigrants not only make our plates colorful and interesting, \n     but also aid our economy in a huge way.\n       Our economy is flourishing because of one thing. \n     Immigrants. Immigrants do countless things to help our \n     economy. For starters, immigrants fill jobs. Immigrants are \n     willing to take up jobs that others may not want to. They \n     take minimum wage, which is a lot compared to what they earn \n     in their homeland. Immigrants often work harder in the jobs \n     that they take up because they really want to stay in this \n     country. Because of this keeping a job is important. \n     Wealthier immigrants usually start their own businesses which \n     is sometimes a restaurant serving their customary dishes. In \n     addition in areas such as high-tech a lot of immigrants have \n     started their own companies and created a lot of new jobs. \n     Most importantly, immigrants raise the bar of America by \n     being hard-working and tough competitors.\n       Since immigrants live in America they pay taxes, property, \n     sales, and income. Property taxes for the land they live on, \n     sales tax for the items they buy and income tax for the \n     amount of money they make. With over 90 percent of America's \n     population as immigrants, that's a lot of money the \n     government receives.\n       Immigrants create or bring new art forms and music that \n     enrich our lives. Be it Jazz, Rap, classical music, or \n     varieties of instrumental music from their native lands. \n     Children of African immigrants founded jazz and Rap. Some of \n     the sports that we could not live without were founded by \n     immigrants, like basketball which is part of the American \n     lifestyle.\n       Have you ever seen everyone walking around in Levi's and a \n     t-shirt? Thanks to immigrants we won't be seeing that. \n     Immigrants add a variety to our closet. Other styles have \n     been Americanized into a popular fashion, like bandanas. \n     Bandanas originated in the Caribbean and are found everywhere \n     in America, from a dog's neck to a person's head.\n       Immigrants have done so many great things for us. They give \n     us a ``taste'' of the world; they strengthen our economy. \n     America should march on forward and continue the tradition of \n     it's forefathers of as a land of immigrants envisioned by \n     them.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                         A Nation of Difference\n\n                          (By Kimya Khoshnan)\n\n\n    Arroyo Vista Elementary School--2006 National Contest Runner-Up\n\n     On the airplane I sat,\n     As my heart thundered in my chest.\n     The silent tears falling into my lap.\n     Why did this have to happen?\n     And of all the people in the world,\n     Why me?\n     Would I be the only one in my school,\n     To have another language?\n     I ponder these questions for a while,\n     And then breathe a deep sigh.\n     I had left everything in Japan,\n     And had to start all over again.\n     A new life, a new me.\n     I would have to learn how to stay strong.\n     I think more,\n     Then my ears begin to pop.\n     The airplane groans,\n     As it reaches its final destination,\n     California,\n     And my new life has begun.\n\n     As my parents and I enter our house,\n     My hopes rise a bit.\n     It is pretty but my house in Japan was better.\n     But my hopes sink farther than ever,\n     As my father leads us to the back.\n     I see that we have rented,\n     The very small two-bedroom house,\n     With only a kitchen and a bathroom,\n     Behind that luxurious castle.\n     I feel jealous,\n     Then angry.\n     I had left my room bigger than a classroom,\n     For this!\n\n     As my first day of school approaches,\n     My stomach is filled with fear and dread.\n     I absolutely know that no one will like me.\n     My backpack slung over my shoulders,\n     My head raised up high,\n     I try to be optimistic,\n     But I know optimism will not help in reality.\n     I slowly enter my classroom,\n     And make my way toward the teacher.\n     I quietly say hello.\n\n     She looks up and says,\n     ``Oh, hello there!\n     Vhy, you must be the new student!\n     Vhat's your name?''\n     I am utterly surprised by her odd accent.\n     Do all Americans speak this way?\n     ``Toshiko,'' I whisper.\n     ``Vell Toshiko welcome to our class!\n     Class say hello to Toshiko!''\n     ``Hi'' the class responded.\n     ``Now Toshiko come sit here next Chieko.''\n     I was suddenly alert of my surroundings,\n     Chieko,\n     Why that was a Japanese name!\n     Could it be?\n     I could not find out for sure until recess.\n\n     Recess came and I ran over to Chieko,\n     Asking if she was Japanese,\n     When she replied yes,\n     My spirits soared.\n     I was so happy not to be the only one!\n     I asked how she felt being the only foreigner,\n     As she chuckled at my question,\n     I began to feel confused.\n     She replied, ``What do you mean?\n     Everyone here is a foreigner!''\n     I looked around me,\n     And sure enough,\n     Nobody was the same.\n     I suddenly started to laugh,\n     I thought I looked like a fool,\n     Braying away like a donkey.\n     As I finally stopped, Chieko asked me,\n     Why I was laughing.\n     I told her my story,\n     And we have been best friends ever since.\n\n     As I reflect upon the past,\n     I realize that if,\n     California was not a state of immigrants,\n     My life probably would have been,\n     As horrible as I imagined it.\n     But since it is,\n     My family and I have been thriving\n     And we shall honor our freedom,\n     Forever.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                   Immigration, Past, Present, Future\n\n                           (By Marissa Lynch)\n\n\n          brown middle school--2006 national contest runner-up\n\n       Last summer, my Grandpa and I visited Ellis Island and the \n     Statue of Liberty. As I looked up at her torch against the \n     baby blue sky, my grandpa read aloud the words at the base of \n     the statue:\n\n     Give me your tired, your poor,\n     Your huddled masses yearning to\n     Breathe free,\n     The wretched refuse of your teeming shore,\n     Send these, the homeless, tempest-tossed to me\n     I lift my lamp beside the golden door\n\n       He told me that those great words were written by an \n     intelligent lady name Emma Lazarus. We talked about what the \n     words mean. From 1892 to 1954, 12,000,000 people passed \n     through the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island to start a \n     new, better life in America. He told me his family came from \n     three different places so he is called ``mixed ancestry''. We \n     talked about why people moved here and what they did when \n     they got here. Many moved here for freedom and peace. We \n     decided that each came with their own stories, hopes and \n     dreams. Once they arrived, they could become anything--\n     doctors, athletes, artists, astronauts, teachers and more!\n       My other Grandpa told me that his parents came to America \n     at age 19. They moved because of a war in their country, \n     Greece, and\n\n[[Page S8192]]\n\n     they were driven out by the Turks. They worked at a \n     restaurant in Newark, New Jersey. At Ellis Island, there was \n     a big board with names of people that passed through there. I \n     noticed their name on the wall!\n       I'm glad our country is full of immigrants because if no \n     one was brave enough to leave family, friends, and their \n     belongings behind, this country would not be as fascinating \n     as it is. Many people call our country a big mixing pot \n     because people all over the world come to live here. The \n     people mix and blend together like food in a mixing pot. Yet, \n     everyone has their own way of life and their own culture. \n     Everyone is a little different. It is good to be different. \n     Everyone stands out in a crowd!\n       Do you think that immigration is just in history books and \n     doesn't happen any more? If you do, you are wrong. Today, \n     many people still come to America, like me. I was adopted \n     from South America, just like lots of kids. We came to \n     America with our new families! My mom and dad tell me about \n     the exciting day I became an American citizen. A flag was \n     flown over the United States Capitol for me! I have this flag \n     and a certificate which says:\n       ``This is to certify that the accompanying flag was flown \n     over the United States Capitol on August 26, 1998, at the \n     request of the Honorable John Edward Porter, Member of \n     Congress. This flag was flown for Marissa Rose Lynch in \n     celebration of her receiving U.S. citizenship.''\n       When I look at my flag, it makes me proud to be a part of a \n     new generation of immigrants.\n                                  ____\n\n\n            Why I Am Glad America Is a Country of Immigrants\n\n                           (By Esteban Ochoa)\n\n\n      st. clement's parish school--2006 national contest runner-up\n\n       I am glad that the United States of America is a country of \n     immigrants because you never feel lonely; you just have to \n     look into a crowd to find someone with your same background. \n     When you think you are alone and without friends, you just \n     have to look around and you will find a friend.\n       When I first transferred from Mexico to my current school \n     in Texas, I did not know how to speak English. I felt alone \n     and confused, but before long, I found that many people in my \n     class spoke Spanish, and I soon made many friends, who \n     eventually helped me learn English and do very well in \n     school.\n       My case is not different from the story of most of the \n     people who have come to this country from other parts of the \n     world. Having millions of people from hundreds of countries, \n     races, religions and economic backgrounds has created a \n     society unlike any other in this planet.\n       With diversity comes cultural, economic, and spiritual \n     richness. It is evident everywhere you look, in its food, in \n     its music, in its clothing, and in its churches, just to \n     mention a few examples. This Country has served as refuge for \n     many people who came to the U.S.A. looking for opportunities \n     and in many cases after having suffered extreme hardships.\n       Those are some of the reasons why I like that America is a \n     country of immigrants. Just when you think that you do not \n     fit in, and that you are alone in this cold world, you can \n     still find variety, alternatives and, consequently, hope in \n     the most unexpected situations.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/07/25/senate-section/article/S8192-1", "month": "07", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8192]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                 COLORADO'S BIG THOMPSON FLOOD OF 1976\n\n Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, today I honor those who lost their \nlives as well as those who survived Colorado's Big Thompson Flood of \n1976.\n  Thirty years ago, more than 1 foot of rain fell in a matter of hours, \ncausing a flash flood in Big Thompson Canyon. One hundred and forty-\nfour people were killed, and over $30 million in property damage \noccurred. We remember those who died in this natural disaster and also \nthe survivors who had to rebuild their lives, working as a community to \nstart over again. Next week, outside of my hometown of Loveland, CO, \nsurvivors of this tragedy will gather to commemorate the Big Thompson \nFlood. Though I cannot be with them in this ceremony, my thoughts and \nprayers are with them, and I speak on the Senate floor today as a \ntribute to this special event.\n  I ask that the following letter, which I wrote for the commemoration \nceremony of the Big Thompson Canyon Flood of 1976, be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The material follows:\n\n                                                    July 31, 2006.\n       Dear Families and Friends of the Victims of the 1976 Big \n     Thompson Canyon Flood: I very much wanted to join you today \n     as you gather to remember the 30th Anniversary of one of \n     Colorado's worst natural disasters.\n       As we look back thirty years, we recall the shock and \n     devastation that took place in this canyon. Joan, myself and \n     our two daughters, who were very young children at the time, \n     will never forget the Big Thompson Flood and the days that \n     followed. We arrived at home just after the flood tore \n     through the canyon and towards Loveland. We were overwhelmed \n     by the destruction we saw as we later viewed the damage.\n       A number of our friends and clients who lived in the canyon \n     were ravaged by the flash flood and brought their animals to \n     my hospital for care. As the Loveland city health officer at \n     that time, I also remember well the many health issues we \n     faced together as a community. The memories will remain \n     forever with each one of us who experienced this flood or \n     witnessed its devastating effect on so many lives.\n       Today, we can see the positive results of the communities \n     in the canyon working together to rebuild their lives and \n     their property. Joan's and my thoughts are with you today as \n     we remember the people who lost their lives and the ones who \n     survived and rebuilt.\n       Today I am entering this letter in the Congressional Record \n     as a tribute to the living and non-living victims of this \n     natural disaster.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Wayne Allard,\n     U.S. Senator.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/07/25/senate-section/article/S8192-2", "month": "07", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8192]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    A TRIBUTE TO WILLIAM OKONIEWSKI\n\n Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, this spring, William Okoniewski, one \nof Wilmington's best, passed away after a long career as a \nphotographer. He was known throughout the community as the guy who shot \nall the pictures at weddings, high school graduations, communions, and \nconfirmations.\n  If you had the Okoniewski Studio logo in the corner of a photo, you \nknew it was quality work. This was before the era of digital cameras, \nwhen our standards were different.\n  A couple of generations of Delawareans came to admire Bill, and his \nfamily. He and his wife of 64 years, Ceclia, had six children, and you \ncould find him coaching winning track teams throughout the 1960s and \n1970s.\n  At his funeral, when his son Stephen read a letter, it reminded me of \njust why we call Bill's generation the ``greatest generation.''\n  The letter was from Art Slote, who on January 9, 1945, was one of \nfive people rescued by Bill in the middle of the Battle of Herrlsheim, \nin France, near the German border.\n  In the letter, Mr. Slote said how he had searched for Bill for years, \ncontacting the Army, the Red Cross, and every phone book, trying to \nlocate the guy who saved his life. He finally found him in the late \n1990s. He wrote:\n\n       I frequently ponder over what impels a man to act as your \n     father did. He could have easily scurried to the rear to save \n     his own skin, and nobody would have criticized him. But he \n     didn't. I wonder if you or I would risk our lives in \n     another's behalf. It must be built into your father's \n     character and sense of morality.\n       Although slow to admit it, your father's personal bravery, \n     his ability to set aside his fears in behalf of his wounded \n     fellow soldiers, his natural compassion for others in \n     trouble, his modesty in never talking to you about it make \n     this a valor and heroic event.\n\n  There is a lesson in those words for all of us in this Chamber and \nfor all Americans. Bill Okoniewski embodied everything that is uniquely \nAmerican. He understood what it meant to be loyal to our country and to \nrespect your fellow Americans.\n  He, and his generation, set the example. Today, he is the model for \nthe brave men and women in uniform who are performing equally dangerous \nacts every day in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n  One day, and hopefully soon, they too will return home not only \nhaving served their country in time of war but going on to lead the \nkind of professional and family life that Bill lived for decades and \ndecades.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/07/25/senate-section/article/S8192-3", "month": "07", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8192-S8193]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               100TH ANNIVERSARY OF DOUGLAS, NORTH DAKOTA\n\n Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize a \ncommunity in North Dakota that will be celebrating its 100th \nanniversary. On August 4, the residents of Douglas will gather to \ncelebrate their community's history and founding.\n  Douglas was founded in 1906 and was proudly named after the nearby \nDouglas Creek. The creek's name honored Major Douglas, who was \nstationed at Fort Stevenson in the 1870s. In 1906, Douglas's post \noffice was established under the stewardship of Arthur C.\n\n[[Page S8193]]\n\nBates. Douglas was incorporated as a village in 1908 with A.G. Burgeson \nas its first mayor.\n  Today, Douglas remains a small, proud community. Each year, the \ncommunity gathers together and has picnics in the park. During the \nsummer, many of its residents can be found on the banks of Lake Douglas \ncatching up with friends and family.\n  To celebrate the 100th anniversary of its founding, the residents of \nDouglas will gather on the weekend of August 4th. There will be an all-\nschool reunion to allow former classmates to reunite with each other, \nfollowed by a charity auction. A fireman's rodeo, lawnmower pull, and \nan event to honor veterans will keep the crowds entertained all \nweekend. The highlight of the celebration will be the parade, which \nwill feature floats, musical performances, and a fireworks display.\n  Mr. President, I ask the Senate to join me in congratulating Douglas, \nND, and its residents on their first 100 years and in wishing them well \nthrough the next century. By honoring Douglas and all the other \nhistoric small towns of North Dakota, we keep the great pioneering \nfrontier spirit alive for future generations. It is places such as \nDouglas that have helped to shape this country into what it is today, \nwhich is why this fine community is deserving of our recognition.\n  Douglas has a proud past and a bright future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/07/25/senate-section/article/S8193-1", "month": "07", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8193]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO JAMES HEALY\n\n Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I to pay tribute to a fine New \nJerseyan and a great friend of my State, James Healy. News of Jim's \nuntimely passing this past Friday at the age of 48 saddened all of us \nin the New Jersey delegation. His great personality and tremendous work \nethic truly made him a pleasure to work with and an asset to his \norganization, the New Jersey Department of Transportation, NJDOT.\n  For nearly 20 years, Jim held several important posts within the \ndepartment. Most recently, he served as the NJDOT's Federal liaison. \nJim was an expert on Federal legislative, regulatory, and finance \nissues. He provided my office with valuable expertise and advice \nconcerning subjects of great importance to New Jersey.\n  New Jersey is the most densely populated State in the Union, and the \nmovement of people and goods through its travel corridors is of utmost \nimportance, not just to New Jerseyans, but for the entire regional \neconomy.\n  Jim guided the New Jersey delegation through Federal highway bill \nauthorizations, which took years to accomplish. The most recent one, \nSAFETEA-LU, took 2 years to complete. Jim also worked closely with New \nJersey members on aviation reauthorization bills, including the VISION-\n100 legislation passed in 2003.\n  He advocated for the State's priorities, including legislation to \nhelp preserve open spaces in New Jersey. My staff and I had the \npleasure of working with him many times on these bills and he was \nalways a consummate professional: well-informed, thorough in his work, \nand always extraordinarily helpful.\n  When a former NJDOT commissioner served as president of the American \nAssociation of State Highway and Transportation Officials, AASHTO, Jim \nserved as liaison to AASHTO staff, where he helped coordinate and set \nnational transportation policy goals.\n  Jim was an assistant professor at Fairleigh Dickinson University and \nwas a 1979 graduate of William Paterson University, where he earned a \nBachelor's Degree in Business Administration. He received his law \ndegree in 1983 from Rutgers University in Newark, NJ.\n  Jim is survived by his parents, Philip and Hannah Healy of Wayne, NJ, \nand his brothers and sisters, Joseph Healy, Mary Jo Ridge, Kathleen \nBianco, Teresa Hoey, and Joan Wielenta. My heart goes out to Jim's \nfamily during this difficult time.\n  I salute the life and memory of this great son of New Jersey, Jim \nHealy. May he rest in peace.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/07/25/senate-section/article/S8193-2", "month": "07", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8193]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/07/25/senate-section/article/S8193-3", "month": "07", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8193]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/07/25/senate-section/article/S8193-4", "month": "07", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8193-S8194]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 9:47 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill and concurrent resolution, without amendment:\n\n       S. 310.

A bill to amend the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to \nestablish the United States Emergency Management Authority, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental \nAffairs.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise to introduce S. 3721, the Post-\nKatrina Emergency Management Reform Act of 2006. It contains a vital \nset of reforms and innovations for our emergency-management systems \nthat are designed to save lives and ease suffering when disaster \nstrikes. The crafting of this bill has benefited from the insights of \nmy principal cosponsor, Senator Lieberman, and from the support of our \nother cosponsor, Senator Salazar.\n  The Senate has already acted on one critical measure to apply the \nbitter lessons of Hurricane Katrina. The 87 to 11 vote on July 11, \nadding creation of the U.S. Emergency Management Authority to the \nHomeland Security appropriations bill, adopted a major element of \ntoday's bill. That was a great step forward.\n  The Senate Homeland Security Committee conducted an 8-month \ninvestigation with 23 hearings, more than 325 formal interviews, and a \nreview of more than 838,000 pages of documents to ascertain why the \nresponse to Hurricane Katrina was so inadequate at all levels of \ngovernment. The investigation revealed serious failures of leadership. \nIt also revealed an urgent need for broad reforms ranging from \ncommunication-technology standards to the structure and missions of \nentire Federal agencies.\n  Some of the 88 recommendations that flowed from our investigation can \nbe adopted by administrative action. The Post-Katrina Emergency \nManagement Reform Act comprises important steps that only Congress can \ntake. I will outline the five key components of our bill.\n  First, we strengthen FEMA and rename it as the United State Emergency \nManagement Authority, or US-EMA, to signify a fresh start. We elevate \nUS-EMA within DHS, restore its preparedness authority, and protect it \nfrom departmental reorganizations that could erode its budget and \nassets. These measures give the agency mission and asset protections \nlike those of its DHS siblings, the Coast Guard and the Secret Service.\n  These statutory protections are important. Securing the integrity of \nFEMA preserves the cooperative benefits of its operating within easy \nreach of other DHS agencies. It also avoids the duplication, cost, and \nconfusion for State and local officials that would come from carving \nFEMA out as a weak, stand-alone agency for natural disasters. Keeping \nFEMA where it was placed by the Homeland Security Act of 2002 avoids \nthe need for DHS to recreate a similar terror-response capability.\n  Improving contact and coordination among Federal, State, and local \nagencies is essential. For that reason, our bill provides for \nregionally based, multi-agency Federal strike teams that will be ready \nto act and deploy in a region they will already know and understand \nbefore a disaster occurs.\n  The bill also provides continued funding for the interstate Emergency \nManagement Assistance Compact that proved so valuable in marshaling aid \nfor the gulf coast last year. It commits the US-EMA to work with States \nand localities to develop a standardized credentialing system that will \nhelp responders and selected private-sector personnel move quickly into \ndisaster areas anywhere in the country, and it requires the US-EMA to \noffer technical assistance to State and local governments.\n  To help remedy the communications gaps revealed by Hurricane Katrina, \nwe also improve the agency's organizational and technical \ncommunications systems. Our bill designates the Administrator of the \nUS-EMA as the principal advisor to the President on emergency-\nmanagement issues. Meanwhile, national and regional advisory councils \nwill ensure that the US-EMA has open channels of communication with \nState and local officials, emergency responders, key private-sector and \nnongovernmental entities, and with representatives of people with \ndisabilities.\n  On the equally important technical side, our bill consolidates \nseveral communications programs within a new Office of Emergency \nCommunications within US-EMA. This office will devise a national \nemergency-communications strategy, administer grants for interoperable \ncommunications, and regularly assess the operability and \ninteroperability of the communication systems that are essential for \ndisaster response and that failed so widely during the Katrina \ncatastrophe.\n  This US-EMA portion of the bill has received a great deal of \nattention. But it is only one part of this package of essential \nreforms.\n  The second part of our bill permits an enhanced Federal role in \nemergency management when major disasters require it. The Robert T. \nStafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act, better known as \nthe Stafford Act, authorizes a variety of Federal assistance measures \nto State and local governments when the President has declared a \ndisaster.\n  Congress has amended the Stafford Act over time to make it more \neffective. Our bill continues that process of improvement by applying \nlessons learned from Katrina.\n  At the highest level, it directs the Federal Government to develop \nand maintain a national disaster-recovery strategy in coordination with \nthe State and local governments which will lead each recovery. This \nfills a remarkable planning void in our current system, which focuses \non response. When disaster overwhelms state and local governments and \ndevastates large areas, recovery can be a long process requiring \nextended Federal assistance.\n\n  We increase the potential for more effective Federal aid in several \nways. For example, the legislation enhances Federal agencies' ability \nto respond when the President uses his authority to direct their \nassistance in major-disaster response and recovery.\n  The bill requires a national-disaster housing strategy and authorizes \nmaking semipermanent housing units a part of Stafford Act assistance. \nIn many cases, the modular ``Katrina cottages,'' for example, would be \nless costly, safer, more livable, more easily sited, and more durable \nthan the notorious trailers FEMA purchased.\n  A new title VII for the Stafford Act gives the President discretion \nto offer increased Federal assistance when disaster overwhelms state \nand local governments. This discretionary--but limited--authority for \ncatastrophes includes raising the cap on individual assistance, \nassisting victims with rent or mortgage costs, extending disaster-\nunemployment benefits, increasing community loans, and raising the \nreimbursement to communities for the cost of food, clothes, and other \nessential goods they distribute to victims.\n\n[[Page S8198]]\n\n  Among other Stafford Act revisions, our bill clarifies that Federal \nmitigation efforts can extend to man-made hazards like the Mississippi \nRiver Gulf Outlet that funneled deadly storm-surge waters toward New \nOrleans. It establishes a missing-child location system and a database \nto help reunite families, a major problem in the aftermath of Katrina. \nAnd it requires that planning and training exercises, as well as \nevacuation and sheltering plans, give consideration to people with \ndisabilities or special needs, or who are not fluent in English, or who \nhave pets.\n  These improvements to the Stafford Act would be a major \naccomplishment by themselves. But the demonstrated need for reforms \ngoes deeper still.\n  The third key element of our bill will provide more and better-\ntrained emergency professionals. The US-EMA will establish a \ncontingency cadre to meet surge workforce needs; implement a human-\ncapital strategy to improve recruitment, development, and retention; \nand make quarterly reports to Congress on staffing levels. These \nactions should reduce the chronic workforce shortfalls--at times as \ngreat as 25 percent--that have hobbled FEMA in the past.\n  Looking to staffing quality across the full spectrum, our bill \ncreates a National Homeland Security Academy. The academy will offer \nboth classroom and distance-learning instruction and training to DHS, \nstate, and local homeland-security professionals.\n  The fourth element in our reform bill will correct the confusion and \nlack of training on incident management and unified-command operations \nthat frustrated a fully effective response to Katrina. Our bill \nmandates a comprehensive review of the National Response Plan, and \nrequires that the DHS Secretary employ the NRP and the National \nIncident Management System to guide Federal actions in a natural or \nmanmade disaster.\n  The Secretary is also directed to work with the US-EMA Administrator \nand with the National Advisory Committee to implement a national \ntraining-and-exercise program to ensure that vital knowledge and skills \nare in place and are kept sharp.\n  The fifth key aspect of our bill targets the waste, fraud, and abuse \nthat outraged both our compassion for disaster victims and our sense of \nstewardship for taxpayer dollars. Based on the investigations by our \ncommittee, the GAO, and the DHS inspector general, I believe far more \nthan a billion dollars has been lost to waste, fraud, and abuse in the \naftermath of Katrina. The purchase of unusable mobile homes, long-\ndistance moving and storage of unneeded ice, and abuse of debit cards \nindicate that DHS has lacked even rudimentary controls to safeguard tax \ndollars.\n  Our bill directs the Department to identify emergency-response \nrequirements that can be contracted in advance with pre-screened \nvendors, so that vital commodities and services can be secured and \ndelivered promptly. This simple change could curtail the waste of time \nand money as officials scramble to make ad-hoc purchase and \ndistribution arrangements, often paying excessive prices. We also \nprovide for a contingency corps of Federal contracting officers who can \nwork in the field for an extended period following a disaster, so that \nresponse and recovery spending is better directed and controlled than \nwith Katrina.\n  Our bill also faces the unfortunate reality that thieves and con \nartists will try to abuse even programs for disaster victims. Our bill \nimposes civil and criminal penalties for misrepresentation, requires \nfraud-awareness training for contracting officers and for the relief \nworkforce, mandates systems to verify identities and addresses, and \nrequires issuing explicit directions on legitimate uses of purchase \ncards.\n  Our bill is no single-issue, silver-bullet exercise but a careful and \ncomprehensive program of improvement and innovation. It takes on each \nof the vital areas that our Hurricane Katrina investigation determined \nrequire action by Congress: reconstituting FEMA, updating and expanding \nthe Stafford Act, improving emergency staffing, enhancing planning and \npreparedness, and reducing waste, fraud, and abuse.\n  Floods, earthquakes, storms, fires, and other natural disasters are \nabiding threats that exempt no one living on this planet. And the \nthreat of manmade disasters has, perhaps permanently, forced itself \ninto our plans for sustaining this great Nation.\n  Hurricane Katrina showed us in tragic terms that our mechanisms for \ndisaster mitigation, preparation, response, and recovery urgently need \nmany improvements. If we leave untouched the gaps, the confusions, and \nthe missteps revealed during Katrina, we will see more unnecessary loss \nof life and prolonged misery. We do not know when the next great \ndisaster will strike, or what form it will take. But we know it will \ncome. We know what needs to be done. The Post-Katrina Emergency \nManagement Reform Act gives us the tools to do it.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to offer my support for \nand cosponsorship of this comprehensive piece of legislation that \nChairman Collins and I are proposing based on our investigation into \nthe failed preparations and response to Hurricane Katrina.\n  About 1 month ago, we introduced a bill to transform FEMA into the \nU.S. Emergency Management Authority to guarantee that our national \nemergency response system can handle a catastrophe--whether it is a \nhurricane the size and scope of Katrina or a terrorist attack. U.S. EMA \nwould have special, protected status--much like the Coast Guard has \nwithin the Department of Homeland Security. The Senate overwhelmingly \nadopted that legislation by a vote of 87 to 11 as part of the \nDepartment of Homeland Security fiscal year 2007 Appropriations Act.\n  Today, we reintroduce that legislation backed up by additional \nreforms to improve emergency communications, planning, training, and to \nmake necessary changes to the Stafford Act, which governs relief and \nemergency assistance to victims of disasters.\n  The Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, at the \nrequest of the Senate leadership, spent 7 months culling through \nhundreds of thousands of documents, interviewing hundreds of witnesses, \nand holding scores of hearings into the botched Government response to \nthat catastrophic hurricane.\n  We found that at all levels, our Government was ill-equipped to deal \nwith the massive human suffering all along the gulf coast that followed \nthe storm's landfall, suffering that shocked and angered the American \npeople who expect more from their government when fellow Americans are \nin need. These failings were the result of many things--negligence, \nlack of resources, lack of capability. But most of all they were the \nresult of a failure of leadership--by the White House, DHS, FEMA, the \nLouisiana Governor's office, and the New Orleans mayor's office.\n  To this day, the Department of Homeland Security does not make \nsufficient distinction between everyday problems that States must deal \nwith on a seasonal basis and the larger catastrophes which, as Katrina \ndemonstrated, quickly overwhelm local and State authorities.\n  The legislation we are introducing today is an effort to get the \nDepartment of Homeland Security to understand that distinction better \nand to target its preparedness and response to cope better with normal \ndisasters as well as with those rarer but truly catastrophic events. It \naddresses--to the extent possible--many of the Federal shortcomings \nexposed by our investigation. And it reflects many of the 88 \nrecommendations the committee reached in its final report on the \nKatrina investigation.\n  Let me briefly summarize the bill. First and foremost, we are \nconcerned about our first responders who rush into the middle of \ncatastrophes to save lives. First responders must have the tools they \nneed to protect and save our communities. Think back to September 11. \nHundreds of firefighters lost their lives that day for many reasons. \nAmong them was that their radio equipment was not compatible with the \npolice force radios, making it more difficult to learn of the warnings \nothers had that the Twin Towers were going to fall.\n  During Hurricane Katrina, first responders not only lacked compatible \nradio equipment, but they lost communication completely when power \nlines and sub stations were knocked out of operation.\n  Whether responding to a terrorist attack, natural disaster, fire, a \nmissing\n\n[[Page S8199]]\n\nchild, or a fleeing suspect, police, firefighters, emergency medical \ntechnicians, and other responders too frequently cannot share crucial, \nlifesaving information at the scene of a disaster.\n  Senator Collins and I introduced a bill, reported out of committee \nlast year, to improve emergency communications, the Assure Emergency \nand Interoperable Communications for First Responders Act of 2005, \nS.1725. We have borrowed liberally from it. For example, today's \nlegislation, like S.1725, would require the development of a national \nstrategy for emergency communications; the establishment of an \nemergency communications research and development program; and \ndedicated funding for State and local communications and \ninteroperability grants, authorized at $3.3 billion over 5 years.\n  We would also establish a new Office of Emergency Communications \nwithin U.S. EMA by combining existing offices at the Department of \nHomeland Security that deal with various aspects of emergency \ncommunications. Among the offices to be combined are SAFECOM within the \nScience and Technology Directorate and the National Communications \nSystem, which was under the Infrastructure Protection Office during \nKatrina. This office will make sure that DHS actually has someone in \ncharge of leading the Department's splintered efforts to fix these \npersistent communications problems.\n  This legislation also makes changes to the Stafford Act and improves \nupon other recovery and assistance benefits for the victims of \ndisaster. Among other things, we would require U.S. EMA to develop \nhousing and recovery strategies; we would increase the assistance \nprovided under the Hazard Mitigation Grant Program from 7.5 percent of \nfunds paid out under title IV of the Stafford Act up to 15 percent, \ndepending on the size of the disaster; and we would expand FEMA's \nauthority so that in addition to providing temporary housing it could \nprovide permanent or semipermanent housing, giving it greater \nflexibility to meet the needs of those affected by a disaster. Unlike \nFEMA, U.S. EMA would not have to reflexively rely on travel trailers to \nhouse victims when other types of housing make more sense.\n\n  Victims would be aided further under this legislation by elimination \nof the subcaps that limited the amount of specific assistance for \nrepairs and home replacement during Katrina and by increased \ntransportation benefits. We would clarify the statute by reinforcing \nCongress's intent to allow for the use of rental assistance to pay for \nutility costs and to provide treatment of mental health problems \nresulting from or aggravated by a disaster. And we would allow U.S. EMA \nto provide temporary residences to all parts of a household that \nnecessarily must split following a disaster--because of multiple \nrelocations or cases of domestic violence, for example.\n  If the President finds ``catastrophic damages'' to a locale hit by \ndisaster, he would be able to provide even more assistance under our \nlegislation. The President would be able to double the cap for \nindividual assistance from $26,000 to $52,000, provide unemployment \nbenefits for 52 weeks instead of 26 weeks, provide help with mortgage \nand rental assistance, and waive maximum limitations on the amount of \nassistance that can be provided under the Community Disaster Loan \nProgram.\n  Other provisions in our bill call for increased planning for people \nwith special needs, better ways to get disaster information to those \nwho need it, and measures to assist with family reunification. We would \nalso require government contractors to hire more local firms and local \nworkers.\n  This legislation also has an extensive section dedicated to saving \nmoney for the taxpayers while preventing waste, fraud, and abuse. For \nexample, we would require the U.S. EMA Director to establish an \nidentity verification process to ensure that victims who apply for \nbenefits under the Individuals and Households Program are who they say \nthey are and are in true need. We would create a registry of \ncontractors able to perform common postdisaster work and use advance, \ncompetitively awarded contracts for predictably required goods and \nservices. And we would create a contingent of volunteer contracting \nofficers from throughout the Federal Government to assist with \nadditional contracting needs during emergencies.\n  Our bill would also require U.S. EMA to plan for a disaster far more \nextensively than it has previously. It requires the development of a \nnational training and exercise program, involving both Federal and \nState officials, to prepare for natural and manmade disasters. And the \nU.S. EMA Administrator would have to review the National Response Plan \nand clarify overlapping or confusing law enforcement, search and \nrescue, and medical responsibilities.\n  Mr. President, we are approaching the 1-year anniversary of Katrina--\nAugust 29. Much has changed since that time. Certainly, the gulf coast \nis better prepared to meet a disaster this hurricane season. Yet many \nvictimized by Hurricane Katrina, as well as those vulnerable to natural \ndisasters or terrorist attacks elsewhere, still face uncertain futures.\n  We cannot forget those still struggling to rebuild their lives from \nthe devastation wrought by Katrina almost a year ago. This legislation \nwas designed to address specific problems exposed by Katrina, so as it \nmoves through the legislative process, we must do all that we can to \nensure that the President has the authority he needs to provide \nassistance to past victims, as well as to victims of future disasters. \nWe must also make certain that, unlike FEMA, U.S. EMA has all of the \nresources it needs to lead a national preparedness effort and to \nrespond to whatever occurs in a manner that the American people have a \nright to expect.\n  The committee's investigation found that FEMA had never been prepared \nfor a catastrophic event but also that it had budget shortages that \nhindered its preparedness and impeded its performance. Scott Wells, \nFEMA's Deputy Federal Coordinating Officer in Lousiana, summed it up. \nHe said, ``This was a catastrophic disaster. We don't have the \nstructure; we don't have the people for catastrophic disaster. It's \nthat simple . . . If you want a big capability, you've got to make a \nbig investment. And there is no investment in response operations for a \ncatastrophic disaster. It's not there.''\n  Clearly, if the Federal Government is to improve its performance in \nthe next disaster, we must give it sufficient resources. This \nlegislation takes an important step in that direction by providing a \n$49 million increase for FEMA's two key operating accounts in fiscal \nyear 2008 and an additional $53 million in fiscal year 2009. However, I \nbelieve even more is necessary, and I will work to secure additional \nresources as U.S. EMA becomes a reality.\n  The Department of Homeland Security was established not to address \naverage disasters--the hurricanes that reliably strike certain parts of \nthe country each year or flooding from heavy rains. DHS was established \nto prevent, prepare for, and if necessary respond to horrific \ncatastrophes that demand all the resources our Federal Government has \nto offer in times of need or when local and State governments are \noverwhelmed by what has befallen them.\n  This legislation is a reminder of that original purpose, an effort to \nget the Department of Homeland Security back to where Congress \noriginally envisioned it should be. This bill will help the Department \nbe as prepared for and able to respond to catastrophes as the American \npublic expects it to be.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DODD (for himself and Mr. Lieberman):\n  S. 3723. A bill to amend the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act to designate \ncertain segments of the Eightmile River in the State of Connecticut as \ncomponents of the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, today I join with my colleague Senator \nLieberman to introduce the Eightmile Wild and Scenic River Act to \ndesignate certain segments of the Eightmile River in the State of \nConnecticut as components of the National Wild and Scenic Rivers \nSystem.\n  The National Wild and Scenic Rivers System was created by Congress in \n1968 to create a ``Hall of Fame'' for exceptional rivers. Eligible \nrivers or river segments must meet two criteria; first,\n\n[[Page S8200]]\n\nthe river corridor must be free flowing and, second, it must contain at \nleast one outstanding remarkable resource deserving special \nrecognition, such as a prominent natural, cultural, scenic, or \nrecreational resource.\n  Over the course of the past few years, the National Park Service has \nresponded to interest and inquiries from local advocates and town \nofficials regarding a potential Wild and Scenic River designation for \nthe Eightmile River located in south central Connecticut. While a local \nmanagement plan has been developed, studies have shown that fifteen \nmiles of the Eightmile River and its East Branch through the \ncommunities of Lyme, East Haddam, and Salem, CT, were already included \non the National Park Service's Nationwide Rivers Inventory of potential \nWild and Scenic River segments. Both segments have great recreational \nvalue and are included on the inventory for outstanding scenic, \ngeologic, and fish and wildlife values. More than 80 percent of the \nConnecticut River watershed is still forested, including large tracts \nof unfragmented hardwood forests that are home to a diverse assemblage \nof plants and animals including bobcats, great horned owls, red foxes \nand roughly 180 other species of birds, plants, fish, and reptiles.\n  The impetus for gaining wild and scenic designation of segments of \nthe Eightmile River originated locally in 1995 when local officials and \ncitizens began working on protection efforts. A variety of local, \nState, and Federal watershed protection programs were considered, and a \nWild & Scenic River study and designation were determined to be the \nbest way to achieve the local vision of a protected watershed. It was \nfound that six special ``resource values'' are present in the Eightmile \nRiver Watershed. These resource values are: Watershed hydrology, water \nquality, unique species and natural communities, geology, the watershed \necosystem, and the cultural landscape. Preserving and enhancing these \nvalues is the basis of the Eightmile River Management Plan and \nultimately the pursuit of wild and scenic designation. Earlier this \nyear I joined with residents of East Haddam, CT, to endorse the \nmanagement plan.\n  Connecticut is a small State in area, but it is densely populated and \nit is essential that balance is achieved between conservation and \neconomic growth. As one of the most diverse and thriving ecosystems in \nthe lower Connecticut River Valley, it is essential that we work to \npreserve this river while all parties, local, State and Federal, are \nwilling and able to support this ecosystem. The Eightmile River, like \nmany other rivers in America, can still be stewarded for future \ngenerations of Americans as both a recreational treasure and an \nunblemished ecological haven.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3723\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to enhance scientific research and competitiveness \nthrough the Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, today, I introduce the EPSCoR \nResearch and Competitive Act of 2006, and I am proud to have the \nbipartisan support of my colleagues, Senators Snowe, Inouye, Cochran \nand Johnson.\n  The Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research, EPSCoR, \nat the National Science Foundation, NSF, is designed to help states \nthat historically do not receive much NSF funding to compete more \neffectively for grants. NSF maintains it high standards, but it also \nprovides help to States to meet such standards. Such an investment is \nfundamental to help promote our country's competitiveness nationwide. \nTwenty-six States are eligible for the EPSCoR program, and these States \nrepresent 20 percent of our population, 25 percent of our doctoral and \nresearch universities, and 18 percent of our academic scientists and \nengineers. The EPSCoR states also represent unique environments for \nscientific research with Hawaii and Alaska having unique features. \nMontana is a major area for paleontology. Six of the top ten energy \nproducing States are EPSCoR States. It is common sense to invest in \nbuilding research capacity in our EPSCoR States.\n  We also know that EPSCoR works. More than one-half of the researchers \nsupported by NSF's EPSCoR program during the first 10 years later were \nsuccessful in competing for non-EPSCoR funding. Also, 75 percent of new \ntechnology companies started by university research are based in the \nStates where the original research was done. To strengthen our research \nand enhance competitiveness EPSCoR is a smart investment.\n  Within the American Innovation and Competitiveness Act of 2006, is a \nprovision authorizing the EPSCoR program at $125 million, and stating \nthat EPSCoR funding should increase in proportion with the overall NSF \nbudget. This package was marked up by the Senate Commerce Committee on \nMay 18, 2006 with bipartisan support.\n  Clearly, there is agreement that EPSCoR needs to be part of our \nnational strategy for competitiveness. This legislation adds some \nspecifics to that goal. The bill proposes that the Research \nInfrastructure Improvements Grant increase to $75 million. It seeks 20 \npercent of the EPSCoR budget for the co-funding program, an innovative \ninitiative to help encourage each of the NSF directorates to \ncollaborate and fund meritorious projects from the EPSCoR States. It \nencourages the NSF Director to develop creative ways to ensure that the \nEPSCoR States are part of the new major initiatives of the foundation, \nincluding cyber-infrastructure and major research instrumentation.\n  West Virginia has truly benefited from the EPSCoR program. Since \n2001, competitive Federal research in West Virginia has risen from \n$35.8 million to $60.1 million which is a 68 percent increase. In 2005 \nalone, research created more than $147 million in economic activity and \nsupported 4,432 jobs. EPSCoR has also been the catalyst for enhanced \ncooperation between West Virginia's leading universities, West Virginia \nUniversity and Marshall University.\n  This legislation will add to the American Innovation and \nCompetitiveness Act's goal of promoting competitiveness in the EPSCoR \nStates which helps our entire country.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KOHL:\n  S. 3727. A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nprovide for an adjustment to the reduction of Medicare resident \npositions based on settled cost reports; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Medicare \nResidency Program Fairness Act of 2006. This bill would provide for an \nadjustment to the reduction of Medicare resident positions based on \nsettled cost reports. The reason I am introducing this bill is because \nunintended consequences of Section 422 of the Medicare Modernization \nAct of 2003 have resulted in a decrease of residents slots in \nWisconsin's Fox Valley and potentially in other small urban and rural \nfamily medicine practices across the Nation.\n  For more than a year, I have been working with the University of \nWisconsin School of Medicine and the Fox Valley Fami1y Medicine \nResidency Program to urge CMS to restore funding for its residency \ntraining positions that was taken away as a result of an audit that \nincorrectly determined that the positions were not used. Now, a Final \nMediation Agreement between Appleton Medical Center and United \nGovernment Services demonstrates that the positions were being used and \nthat the program met the Medicare requirement for those positions. I \nbelieve it is only fair that Appleton Medical Center's residency \npositions be reinstated.\n  The Fox Valley Family Practice Residency Program is an important \ncontributing member to the Fox Valley and surrounding community, \nproviding health care services to some 10,000 families. This is exactly \nthe type of program that we should be supporting, not reducing. My \nlegislation will right this wrong and provide for the same opportunity \nfor any other small urban or rural program that can demonstrate that \nits residency slots were erroneously de-funded by CMS. I ask that my \nSenate colleagues join me by supporting this bill.

SENSE OF CONGRESS ON INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION.\n\n       Congress urges all governments to comply promptly with \n     United Nations Security Council Resolution 1695 and to impose \n     measures on persons involved in such proliferation that are \n     similar to those imposed by the United States Government \n     pursuant to the Iran, North Korea, and Syria Nonproliferation \n     Act (Public Law 106-178; 50 U.S.C. 1701 note), as amended by \n     this Act.\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, the bill that we just passed, S. 3728, to \npromote nuclear nonproliferation in North Korea was introduced by \nmyself, Senator Biden, and others.\n  As we all know, earlier this month, the North Korean regime defied \nthe international community and launched seven long and medium-range \nmissiles into the Sea of Japan. One of the missiles, the Taepodong-2, \nhas a potential range of approximately 9,000 miles, placing the United \nStates well within reach of attack by North Korea.\n  Kim Jong Il's regime took this dangerous and provocative action \ndespite repeated warnings not to do so from the United States, its \nclose neighbors and participants in the six-party talks, and many \nothers in the international community.\n  The unanimous consent which was just approved focuses on this issue \nof nuclear nonproliferation in North Korea.\n  The North Korean missile launches reminded us yet again of the threat \nposed by Kim Jong Il's regime.\n  North Korea's pursuit of nuclear weapons and its possession of long-\nrange missiles that could potentially strike our Nation is a grave \nthreat to the security of the American people and to peace and \nstability in East Asia.\n  This combination of nuclear weapons and long range missiles is a \nthreat that the United States should not tolerate.\n  Since November 2005, North Korea has boycotted the six-party talks \naimed at ending the regime's illicit nuclear weapons program.\n  In an effort to revive this diplomatic track, the People's Republic \nof China 2 weeks ago sent a high-level delegation to Pyongyang to \nconvince North Korea to return to the six-party talks.\n  North Korea remained intransigent and gave no indication of any \nwillingness to allow diplomatic efforts to succeed.\n  The U.N. Security Council then decided to act.\n  On July 15, the United Nations Security Council sent a strong, \nunambiguous, and unified message to the North Koreans that their latest \nprovocations are unacceptable.\n  The Security Council unanimously passed Resolution 1695. This \nresolution condemned unequivocally the North Korean missile launches.\n  In addition, the Security Council demanded that North Korea \nreestablish its moratorium on missile launches. It also requires all \nU.N. member states to do everything they can to prevent the procurement \nand transfer of missiles, missile-related items, materials, goods, \ntechnology, or financial resources to or from North Korea's missile and \nWMD programs.\n  As Ambassador Bolton stated:\n\n       The United States expects that the DPRK and all other UN \n     Member States will immediately act in accordance with the \n     requirements of this resolution.\n\n  However, soon afterwards, North Korea announced that it had no \nintention of abiding by the resolution's requirements--yet another act \nof defiance and brinkmanship.\n  North Korea's continued defiance of the international community \nleaves our Nation with no alternative but to act.\n  For all these reasons, I rise today to call up the North Korea \nNonproliferation Act of 2006, which I originally introduced last week. \nThis legislation will add North Korea to the list of countries \ncurrently covered by the Iran and Syria Nonproliferation Act.\n  Under this bill, the President would be required to submit a report \nto Congress every 6 months listing all foreign persons believed to have \ntransferred to or acquired from North Korea materials that could \ncontribute to the production of missiles, nuclear weapons, other \nweapons of mass destruction, and certain conventional weapons.\n  This legislation also authorizes the President to impose sanctions on \nall foreign persons identified on this list.\n  These sanctions include prohibitions on U.S. Government procurement \nfrom such persons and the issuance of U.S. Government export licenses \nfor exports to such persons.\n  Ultimately, the bill will lead to U.S. sanctions on any foreign \npersons or foreign companies that transfer missile and WMD-related \nitems, as well as certain advanced conventional weapons, to North \nKorea, or that buy such items from North Korea.\n  The U.S. is already doing this with respect to transfers of these \nitems to and from Iran and Syria under the Iran and Syria \nNonproliferation Act. The time has come for us to treat transfers of \nthese items to North Korea no less seriously than we already treat \ntransfers of these same items to Iran and Syria.\n  Of course, no transfers of missile and WMD-related items to or from \nNorth Korea should be taking place now that the Security Council has \nforbidden all such commerce with that country.\n  Experience teaches us, however, that detennined proliferators are \nlikely to ignore these new U.N. sanctions, which is why this \nlegislation is so criticaUy important. It will provide a partial remedy \nin such cases, and should deter violations of the new U.N. sanctions on \nNorth Korea.\n  The North Korea Nonproliferation Act of 2006 will reinforce Security \nCouncil Resolution 1695 and demonstrate that the United States is, \nindeed, doing all that it can to stop the transfer of these dangerous \nmaterials to and from North Korea.\n  The U.N. Security Council has spoken. The United States must now step \nup its efforts to fulfill its responsibility to protect the American \nhomeland from the North Korean threat.\n  Section 4 of this bill calls on all other countries to consider \nmeasures similar to the ones that we will adopt pursuant to this law to \nreinforce Security Council Resolution 1695.\n\n[[Page S8208]]\n\n  I would hope that, in particular, countries such as Japan that are \nespecially threatened by North Korea's provocative actions will \nconsider taking steps like those provided for under this legislation to \ndeter the transfer by others to or from North Korea of sensitive items \nwith weapons applications.\n  These items in the hands of Kim Jong Il pose a direct threat to the \nAmerican people, the people of the region, and peace and security in \nEast Asia.\n  If we are in earnest about protecting the American homeland, then \nit's imperative that we prevent the North Korean regime from acquiring \nthese dangerous materials.

Mr. President, tomorrow morning at 10 o'clock, we will be \nvoting on the motion to invoke cloture on the motion to proceed to the \nGulf of Mexico energy security bill. As has been pointed out over the \ncourse of the day, this bill is a very important issue which will open \nup to deep sea exploration over a billion barrels of oil and over 5 \ntrillion cubic feet of natural gas, enough energy to supply 6 million \nhomes for 15 years--a very important bill. It is bipartisan. We will be \nvoting tomorrow morning on this motion to proceed. I do hope that \ncloture will be invoked and that we are then able to reach an agreement \non when to start debate on the substance of that bill.\n  I remind Senators that after that 10 a.m. cloture vote, we will \nproceed to the Hall of the House of Representatives to hear the remarks \nof Prime Minister Maliki of Iraq.\n  Before we close, I again thank Senator Ensign for his tremendous \nleadership and work on this child custody protection bill. I thank all \nof our colleagues for working together in a bipartisan way to reach an \nagreement which allowed us to finish this bill in short order, in an \norganized way.\n  As my colleagues just heard, we feel strongly that we should proceed \ntonight in the usual fashion to go to conference. This bill passed by \n65 to 34 tonight. We are expressing the strong support of this Senate.\n  The House, as I mentioned earlier, passed their child custody \nprotection bill on April 27, 2005, and as is customary and is routine, \nwe would go to conference. The Democrats have objected to going to \nconference. We will continue to try to go to conference over the next \nseveral days. I am deeply disappointed by that. I hope, as I said \nearlier, that this is not a sign that they are going to obstruct this \nbill at this point, at the level of conference, after this Senate has \nspoken overwhelmingly in support of this bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/07/25/senate-section/article/S8209-4", "month": "07", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8209-S8210]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 9 A.M.
