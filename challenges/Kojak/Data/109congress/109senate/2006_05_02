Mr. President, today the Senate will vote on cloture for \nthe emergency spending supplemental appropriations bill. The President \nhas made it clear that he will veto any supplemental bill coming out of \nthe committee that exceeds the administration's request. I applaud the \nPresident's determination to stick to true emergency spending, and I \nwill support such a veto, if necessary, to keep that Federal spending \nunder control. Families have to live within their means and so should \nwe in Washington. I think we need to tighten the belt and follow a \ncourse of strict fiscal discipline.\n  The President has taken a strong stance on a must-pass piece of \nlegislation that will bolster our national security, hurricane \nrecovery, and border security efforts. I expect my colleagues to work \nin good faith to meet the President's request.\n  The President submitted his emergency spending request in late \nFebruary. The House acted on the supplemental in March. The legislation \nneeds to be on the President's desk before Memorial Day. It is time for \nus in the Senate to bring debate on this measure to a close. We need to \nsupport our troops who are fighting to protect us. We need to support \nour fellow citizens who are working hard to rebuild and recover their \nhomes and communities on the gulf coast. We need to focus resources on \nsecuring our borders against illegal immigration.\n  That is what this vote is all about. These are extraordinary \nresponsibilities, and we cannot, we should not play politics at such \ncritical times. Time is limited. We must finish this legislation this \nweek so we can quickly get a conference report with the House and get \nit to the President for his signature.\n\n  Indeed, by pulling together, we can move this legislation forward and \naddress the critical work of the American people.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/02/senate-section/article/S3851-9", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3851]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, yesterday marked another day of peaceful, \ndignified rallies all over the country in support of comprehensive \nimmigration reform. In fact, in Los Angeles, at the direction and \nsuggestion of Cardinal Mahoney, many people stayed at work and at \nschool. At his request, people met later in the day. Hundreds of \nthousands of people met at 5:30 p.m. in the day to talk about why it is \nimportant that we have peaceful, very powerful demonstrations. The \nreason: They underscore the need for Congress to pass a strong, \ncomprehensive immigration reform bill.\n  Last Friday, I had the privilege of discussing this subject with \nCardinal Mahoney, the archbishop of Los Angeles, and Cardinal \nMcCarrick, the archbishop of Washington. For me, it was a very moving \nmeeting. I appreciated the chance to visit with these two kind, \nthoughtful, and spiritual men. Both of them have been tremendous \nleaders on the issue of immigration. We all agreed that it is of utmost \nimportance for Congress to move forward with the immigration reform \nbill this year as soon as possible.\n  Last week, I also had the opportunity to meet with a number of other \nSenators at the White House with President Bush. As I said after that \nmeeting, I am not in the habit of patting the President on the back, \nbut he deserved credit--and I said so publicly--for calling us together \nand for hosting a good bipartisan meeting. My hope is that this will \ncontinue.\n  I made clear to the President that Senators on this side of the aisle \nare committed to comprehensive immigration reform. I pledged to work \nwith the President and the majority leader, as I have in the past, in a \nbipartisan way on this very important issue.\n  Every day we fail to fix the immigration system, it gets worse. I \nhave said many times our current immigration system is broken, and it \nis. We supposedly fixed it 20 years ago, and in the process we have 11 \nmillion or 12 million illegal immigrants. We didn't do a good job of \nfixing it. We must do better. We must have a cohesive, coordinated \neffort to strengthen border security, create legal mechanisms for \nAmerican companies to hire essential temporary employees, and encourage \nthe 11 million or 12 million undocumented immigrants in our country to \ncome out of the shadows and be part of America. We need to know who \nthese people are and make sure they are productive, law-abiding, \ntaxpaying members of the community. We must also have proper employer \nsanction enforcement so that employers do not hire undocumented aliens \nwith impunity. That is so important.\n  But the question remains: How will we move forward in the Senate? \nPrior to the Easter recess, I tried, we tried to get agreement on the \nnumber of amendments. We couldn't. The best we could get is there were \nat least 2 dozen. I tried to get an agreement on conference and \ncouldn't do that.\n  Why is conference important? As we learned even in high school, when \nthe Senate passes a bill and the House passes a bill on the same \nsubject, the two bodies must meet and work out their differences. In \nthe past, those have been public meetings where the two sides got \ntogether and worked out their differences. In recent years, with this \nRepublican-dominated Congress and the President in the White House, \nconference committees have not been held. The Republican members of a \nparticular committee meet in private with the leadership and come back \nwith whatever they want, ignoring the minority. So that is why it is \nimportant we have some agreement on conference.\n  Over the Easter recess, I sent a letter to the distinguished majority \nleader, my counterpart, urging him to bring the immigration bill back \nbefore the full Senate at the earliest possible time. I expressed my \nview that the Senate should resume the immigration debate immediately \nafter we completed work on the emergency supplemental appropriations \nbill. That bill is going to be completed this week, as we heard from \nthe majority leader.\n  I continue to believe that such a schedule makes a lot of sense. Few \nother issues are as important and no other is as ripe for Senate debate \nas this issue. Surely, we can pass comprehensive immigration \nlegislation before the Memorial Day recess. But to accomplish that \ngoal, the majority leader and I need to reach an agreement on the \nprocess for completing debate.\n  There are two basic elements to such an agreement: the number of \namendments and an understanding about how the bill will be handled in \nconference with the House.\n  Opponents of reform and fairness have filed hundreds of amendments--\nit is estimated about 500 amendments--to weaken or kill this \ncomprehensive immigration legislation. We Democrats are prepared to \ndebate and vote on some of these amendments, but there must be a finite \nnumber of amendments. Before we start the debate, we must know how many \namendments there are.\n  I have made clear to the majority leader that I am flexible on that \nnumber. As I said previously, prior to Easter, I suggested three \namendments per side. As I indicated earlier, I was told there were at \nleast 2 dozen. We were unable to reach agreement before the recess.\n  So today I suggest we vote on 10 amendments per side. That is 20. We \ncan have second-degree amendments and, as we have done in recent \nhistory, we can have side by sides. That immediately balloons up to 40, \nand possibly, with side by sides for each of those, 80. I don't think \nthere is any chance that would happen, but it is certainly possible if \nsomeone wanted to be mischievous. I am willing to start with that \nnumber, 10 amendments per side.\n  I think this is the right way to do it, but this bill has not had the \nblessing of the majority in moving forward. This bill is going to take \nsome time to finish. It is not going to be finished in a couple days. I \nhope we can finish it in a couple weeks, but there is no guarantee of \nthat. But we are willing to work through this.\n  As important as the number of amendments is what happens in \nconference, no question about that. With the Republicans in the House \nhaving passed a bill making all undocumented immigrants felons--\nfelons--with the House majority leader publicly dismissing the Senate's \nbill, and with the House Judiciary Committee chairman serving as \nsponsor of the felon provision in the House legislation--listen to what \nChairman Sensenbrenner said on the House floor. Basically, he said the \nWhite House originally proposed the idea to criminalize the \nundocumented status of these people. This is from Chairman \nSensenbrenner:\n\n       At the administration's request, the base bill makes \n     unlawful presence a crime, such as unlawful entry already is. \n     This change makes sense. Aliens who have disregarded our laws \n     by overstaying their visas to remain in the United States \n     illegally should be just as culpable as aliens who have \n     broken our laws to enter and remain here illegally.\n\n  Again, at the administration's request, says Chairman Sensenbrenner. \nA few days ago, on April 16, a White House source confirmed this \nstatement in the L.A. Times as being accurate.\n  Does everyone understand why I am a little concerned, a little \nsuspicious? We have the House passing a bill declaring these immigrants \nas felons, and we are told by the chairman of the House committee that \nthe idea came from the White House, and we have the majority leader in \nthe House saying he doesn't like our bill. So we must have some \nagreement, and we need it soon. Time is a-wastin', for lack of a better \ndescription. It is imperative we have a firm agreement on whom the \nconferees will be, whom the participants will be, before we move the \nbill forward. As I have said in the past, membership would consist of \nDemocrats and Republicans on the Senate Judiciary Committee--10 \nRepublicans, 8 Democrats--and the Republicans would have a 2-vote \nmajority. However, if the distinguished majority leader has an \nalternative proposal that will protect the completion of a fair \nconference, I will listen, as will Senator Leahy, the ranking member of \nthe Judiciary Committee.\n\n  We cannot allow the House to hijack this bill and destroy the Senate \nJudiciary Committee's bipartisan work. Under these unusual \ncircumstances, conference protections are indispensable. There are many \nkinds of possible conference protections. I have indicated the most \nstraightforward way is to appoint the members of the Judiciary \nCommittee as conferees. The concept of sending a full committee to\n\n[[Page S3853]]\n\nconference is hardly unprecedented. In fact, it happens all the time. \nThe Presiding Officer here for years was chairman of the Appropriations \nCommittee, and I met with him when he was chairman and I ranking member \non many occasions when we had the full Appropriations Committee there. \nIt has happened with Armed Services. They typically send their entire \nmembership to conference. The Judiciary Committee has done the same on \nprior occasions.\n  One way or another, it is crucial that this bill be the product of \nbipartisan consensus. This is how people feel around the country, not \nonly Members of this Senate. Not many feet from here, on Friday, I was \nat a press conference in which Cardinal McCarrick and Cardinal Mahony \nparticipated. Cardinal Mahony said to everyone within the sound of his \nvoice: There must be protections in conference.\n  I hope we can work together toward adequate assurances that the \nSenate's delicate compromise, bipartisan compromise, will not be \nfilibustered by amendment or decided or blown apart in the dark of \nnight without a real congressional conference.\n  Immigration reform is vital to America's national security. We have \nan obligation to act. I look forward to the Senate resuming this \nimportant debate as soon as possible and I would hope the minute we \nfinish this supplemental appropriations bill. I look forward to the \ndistinguished majority leader and I making a proposal to the body so \nthat we can move forward on this issue.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/02/senate-section/article/S3853-1", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3853-S3854]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           IRAQ REDEPLOYMENT\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, our country desperately needs a new \nvision for strengthening our national security, and I believe it starts \nby redeploying our U.S. forces from Iraq and refocusing our attention \non the global terrorist threats that face us. I filed an amendment that \nrequires the redeployment of U.S. forces from Iraq by December 31, \n2006. Unfortunately, the Senate will not be given the opportunity to \nvote on this amendment if we invoke cloture on the emergency \nsupplemental bill we will be considering shortly.\n  I am afraid this body has failed time and time again to debate the \ndirection of our country's policy in Iraq. Three years ago, the \nPresident landed on an aircraft carrier and, as we all remember, \ndeclared ``Mission Accomplished'' in Iraq. Today, with thousands of \nlives lost and billions of dollars spent, we are still no closer to a \npolicy that lifts the burden from our troops and taxpayers and actually \nmakes our country safer from the terrorist networks that seek to hurt \nus.\n  By failing to discuss alternatives to the administration's failed \nIraq policy, we have let down this institution and our constituents. We \nsimply cannot continue to avoid asking the tough questions about Iraq. \nWe should not be appropriating billions of dollars for Iraq without \ndebating and demanding a strategy to complete our military mission \nthere, not when the lives of our soldiers and the safety of our country \nare at risk.\n  Our military has performed heroically in Iraq, but the continued and \nindefinite presence of large U.S. forces there significantly weakens \nour ability to fight the global terrorism networks that threaten us \ntoday.\n  That is why I filed an amendment requiring the Pentagon to draw up a \nflexible time line for redeployment of U.S. forces from Iraq by the end \nof this year. The President has repeatedly failed to spell out for the \nAmerican people when we can expect our troops to redeploy from Iraq. He \nhas refused to provide a vision for ending our military mission in \nIraq, and as a result a growing majority of Americans have lost \nconfidence in our purpose, our direction, and our presence in Iraq.\n  Last August, I proposed a target date for withdrawal when I suggested \nU.S. troops leave Iraq by the end of 2006. This amendment in part \nreflects the fact that the administration has made no progress--no \nprogress whatsoever--in developing a clear vision for ending our \nmilitary mission, redeploying U.S. troops from Iraq, and refocusing on \nthe real national security threats that face our country.\n  My amendment spells out what an increasing number of military \nintelligence and diplomatic officials have been saying for a very long \ntime: that a massive and seemingly indefinite U.S. presence in Iraq is \ndestabilizing and potentially damaging to Iraqi efforts to rebuild \ntheir government and their country. Our presence in some ways is \ngenerating instability in Iraq, and the less we make it clear that our \nintent is to leave and to leave now, our presence can become more \nharmful than it is helpful.\n  More important, though, is the fact that our current Iraq policy is \nmaking the United States weaker, not stronger. We need to redeploy U.S. \nforces from Iraq because, as a result of our current costly and \nburdensome presence in Iraq, we are unable to direct our resources \nworldwide to defeat the wide and growing network of terrorist \norganizations that seek to harm Americans and America. This \nadministration has compounded its misguided decision to wage war in \nIraq by refusing to recognize the consequences of its actions, the \ntremendous cost to our brave troops and their loved ones, the drain on \nour financial resources, and the burden on our Nation's national \nsecurity sources and infrastructure, which are unable to focus on new \nand emerging threats to our country.\n\n  I don't have to point very far to show how imbalanced and burdensome \nare our policies in Iraq. While we have spent, according to the \nCongressional Research Service, upwards of $6 billion per week during \nOperation Iraqi Freedom and $1.3 billion per week during Operation \nEnduring Freedom, we are spending a little more than $2 million--$2 \nmillion--annually--not weekly, annually--in Somalia, a known haven for \nterrorists and criminals and a true threat to our national security. \nThis supplemental appropriation, if passed, will increase the cost of \nthis war to $320 billion, and rising.\n  This is simply unsustainable, and because the President has failed to \nprovide us with any semblance of a vision for when our troops will be \nredeployed, we can expect more of the same in years to come; that is, \nunless the Congress finally requires the administration to develop an \nIraq strategy that includes a flexible time line for redeploying our \ntroops by the end of 2006. My amendment recognizes the need to maintain \na minimal level of U.S. forces in Iraq beyond 2006. Those forces will \nbe needed for engaging directly and targeting counterterrorism \nactivities, training Iraq in security forces, and protecting essential \nU.S. infrastructure and personnel.\n  It is time for Members of Congress to stand up to an administration \nthat continues to lead us astray on what has become an extremely costly \nand mistaken war. We need to hold this administration accountable for \nits neglect of urgent national security priorities in favor of staying \na flawed policy course in Iraq. We need to tell the administration that \nit can't continue to send our men and women in uniform into harm's way \nwithout a clear and convincing strategy for success.\n  Some have suggested that we should tie our military presence in Iraq \nto whether Iraqis are able to form a unity government. While I share \ntheir frustration with the status quo, I think the decisions about \ntroop presence should be based on what is best for our country's \nnational security. Making decisions about our troop levels contingent \non a political solution in Iraq doesn't make sense. Our troops should \nnot be held hostage to the failure to bring about a political solution \nin Iraq.\n  So here is the bottom line: We need to refocus on fighting and \ndefeating the terrorist network that attacked this country on September \n11, 2001, and that means placing our Iraq policy in the context of a \nglobal effort rather than letting it dominate our security strategy and \ndrain vital security resources for an unlimited amount of time. The \nPresident's Iraq-centric policies are preventing us from effectively \nengaging serious threats around the world, including Iran, global \nterrorist networks, and other emerging threats. We must change course \nin Iraq, and we must change course now.\n  It is in this spirit that I filed this amendment to this supplemental \nspending bill. If I am not allowed a vote on my amendment to the \nsupplemental, I can assure my colleagues that I will be looking for the \nnext opportunity to bring this amendment to the floor for debate and a \nvote.\n\n[[Page S3854]]\n\n  My colleagues are, of course, entitled to disagree with my approach. \nI welcome their suggestions and their advice. But what I really want is \nfor the Senate to live up to its responsibility and engage in a serious \ndebate about the topic that is on the mind of every American: how to \nput our Iraq policy right and our national security policy right.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, how much time is remaining on the minority \nside?\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, this morning across America, people got up \nto go to work. Some of them had a very unsettling moment because they \nhad to fill up their gas tanks. So people heading off to work pulled \ninto a gas station across America--in Chicago, in Springfield, and all \nacross our Nation--and saw again a reminder of the failure of our \nenergy policy. They watched as those numbers rolled in front of them \nand saw a new, almost recordbreaking total, just for the gasoline for \ntheir trucks and their cars going to work.\n  Businesses face the same thing, businesses that are trying to keep \ntheir heads above water and that may be forced to lay off people. The \nfarmers I represent across the State of Illinois, farmers who are out \ntrying to plow for their corn crop this year, are paying more for their \ndiesel fuel, paying more for the fertilizer they are going to \nultimately need.\n  All of these are part of the cumulative impact of the increase in \nenergy prices across America. The pain is being felt in every family of \nmodest means in America. Money they have spent they know is going \ndirectly from their pockets and their credit cards to the biggest oil \ncompanies in America, the biggest oil companies in America, which have \nrecorded record profits--record profits.\n  I took a look at the five major companies and how well they did. In \nthe year 2005, they had $111 billion in profits. That boils down to \n$1,000 for every household in America. Every family of every home paid \nan additional $1,000 last year that went directly to the profits of \nthese oil companies. It didn't go for investment, investment in new oil \nopportunities and oil sources or gas opportunities, no. It went to \nprofits, profits that were realized by the people who are running the \ncompanies.\n  One of them is the CEO of ExxonMobil. ExxonMobil has the largest \ncorporate profits in the history of the United States of America, and \nthey are on course to break that record again this year. They rewarded \nthe architect of these profits, Mr. Lee Raymond, their retiring CEO, \nwith a little farewell gift. No, it wasn't a gold watch. No, it wasn't \na set of golf clubs. It happened to be $400 million--$400 million given \nto this man as a parting gift for realizing all these profits. What \ndoes that come out to? Well, every household in America donated $3 so \nthat Mr. Raymond would have a nice little going-away gift--$400 \nmillion. And Lee Raymond didn't even have to buy a Powerball ticket; \nall he had to do was to be there in the corridors of power when the \nmoney came rolling in.\n  So who is to blame? Well, part of the blame is right here, right here \nin Washington where we have failed to develop an energy policy. Do you \nknow that we signed--the President signed, I should say, and we \npassed--an energy bill last August, 8 months ago, that spelled out the \nenergy policy for America, a policy to lead us forward into the future. \nNo sooner had the ink dried on that bill than the cost of heating our \nhomes across America went up 20 percent, our imports from overseas \nstarted reaching record levels, and the price of the gasoline we had to \nbuy has broken all records. What an energy policy. What a failure. What \na failure of leadership. Honestly, when you take a look at this failure \nof leadership, you can understand why people across America are calling \nfor a change in direction. They are sick and tired of the policies that \nhave brought us to this point, failed energy policies which do not \nprotect the consumer, that do not punish the profiteer, and sadly they \ndo not promote the kinds of things we need for our energy future.\n\n  On the floor of the Senate during the debate of this energy bill, \nSenator Maria Cantwell, of Washington, stood up and made a proposal. \nHere is what she said: We need to reduce our dependence on foreign oil. \nLet's set a national goal of reducing our dependence on foreign oil by \n40 percent over the next 20 years.\n  It is ambitious, it is tough, it would require real leadership and \ncooperation on a bipartisan basis. She said this should be our national \ngoal--Democratic Senator Maria Cantwell.\n  It was virtually rejected out of hand. The Republican side would have \nnothing do with it, not even setting a goal of energy independence. Do \nyou know why the administration said they opposed it? Because it would \nrequire oil savings; using less oil to reach that goal, conservation \nand efficiency. The administration said they would oppose the Cantwell \namendment because it would force us to improve our CAFE standards, the \nfuel economy of the cars and trucks we drive. That was the \nadministration 8 months ago, 8 months ago opposing the Cantwell \namendment, 8 months ago opposing a clear way out of the crisis we \ncurrently face.\n  I think we understand the obvious: 60 percent of all the oil we \nimport goes into the cars and trucks we drive. Unless they are more \nfuel efficient, we are going to continue to burn more oil every single \nyear to go the same mileage we went last year. Burning more oil means \nmore dependence on foreign sources, means more cost to families and \nbusinesses, and sadly means more air pollution, more greenhouse gases, \nmore global warming, more natural disasters, more hurricanes and \nstorms. All of it is tied up in one sad package. But the administration \nopposed our efforts on the Democratic side to spell out a clear energy \ngoal.\n  This morning the Republican leader of the Senate, Senator Frist of \nTennessee, appeared on a string of television shows to express his \nconcern about gasoline prices. I saw one on CNN. I read a transcript of \nhis comments on NBC. He is touting, among other things, a $100 rebate; \nthat we would send a $100 check back to the people of America for the \ngas prices they are currently paying--$100. One of the newspapers \nyesterday said that is chump change instead of real change. What does \n$100 buy you, two tanks of gas if you are lucky? Is that the best we \ncan do in Washington, DC? And then say, Adios, voters, see you in \nNovember, we have taken care of the problem? We certainly have not.\n  What the majority leader said on the show was what he was rebating to \nthe consumers across America were the Federal taxes they paid on \ngasoline. Let me tell you, the cost of gasoline has gone up \ndramatically. Some of it is associated with Federal taxes, but most of \nit is associated with profit taking by the biggest oil companies in \nAmerica, an issue and subject which most Republicans will not even \ntouch.\n  Then, of course, the majority leader, Senator Frist, returned to that \ngood old saw of drilling for oil in the Arctic National Wildlife \nRefuge. According to Senator Frist, that is the answer to America's \nprayers. If we could go up to this wilderness and wildlife refuge--set \naside 50 years ago to be protected for future generations--if we could \nget the trucks and the equipment and the pipelines and the roads, then \nAmerica could breathe easy. Then we could find ourselves relieved from \nthis terrible burden of oil and gas prices.\n  But, sadly, the facts don't back him up. The United States of America \nhas under its control in Alaska, offshore in the continental United \nStates, 3 percent of the world's oil supply, all of it. If we could \ndrill it, all we have, 3 percent. Each year we consume 25 percent of \nthe world's oil supply. We can't drill our way out of this. We can't \neven if we invade every wilderness, every refuge, the Great Lakes, the \nnational parks, and put a derrick down by the Washington Monument--we \ncannot drill our way out of this problem. But time and again, that is \nwhat the Republicans suggest is the answer.\n  Let me tell you the facts. If we decided to start drilling in the \nArctic, if we decided to violate this land that we once promised to \nhold sacred for future generations, if we said America was so desperate \nthat we have to turn to drill for oil to a wildlife refuge in Alaska, \nthis is what we can expect: The first drop of oil would come out of \nthat area in 10 years, and as we drill for that oil\n\n[[Page S3855]]\n\nand bring it out, how much is there by best estimates? By best \nestimates, eight-tenths of 1 percent of world oil production. OPEC \ncould turn the spigot off just a little bit and eat up all of the oil \nwe take out of that wildlife refuge. The Arctic National Wildlife \nRefuge is not the answer to America's energy prayers. It is a \ndesperation effort by the Republicans to come up with some answer to \ndeal with the problem, an answer which sadly does not meet the \nchallenge we face.\n  I listened as our majority leader talked about why we face these gas \nprices today. Time and again he said, and I quote, ``I think the price \nis determined by supply and demand.''\n  You know, that is basic economics--reduce supply, increase demand, \nand the price goes up. Increase supply and reduce demand and the price \ngoes down, basically. Except there is one element the majority leader \ndoes not refer to, an element which is critically important: We are not \njust talking about price, we are talking about profit. We are talking \nabout a market price which has been inflated so these companies can \nrealize record-breaking profits at our expense.\n  This last weekend I appeared on a talk show surrounded by people from \nthe oil industry, investors, and they talked about all of the \nconditions that have led us to this point where gasoline prices are so \nhigh: Hurricane Katrina, reduced refinery capacity, $70 to $75-a-barrel \noil--they went through the whole litany of these things. I said to \nthem, as I learned basic economics, everything they explained to me \nwould account for an increase in the price of oil. But they all failed \nto acknowledge an increase in the profits of the oil companies, \ndramatic, record-breaking historic profits by these oil companies. \nUnless and until we address this reality, then everything we do here is \nfor nothing.\n  What can we do? We are down to five major oil companies. Isn't it \ncurious, as you drive around your hometown, all the prices on all the \npumps seem to go up at the same time and come down at the same time and \nthen go up? Is that the sort of thing Government ought to look at once \nin a while? I think so. But when you look at the antitrust division of \nthe Department of Justice, they turned kind of a blind eye to all the \nmergers and acquisitions that have led to this concentration of \nownership in the oil industry, concentration at the expense of the \nconsumers and the American economy.\n\n  Sadly, we don't have the kind of Government oversight we need. This \nadministration, the President and Vice President, made their fortunes \nin private life in the oil industry. This administration is closer to \nthe oil industry than any administration in our history at a moment in \nour history when the oil industry needs to be held accountable.\n  So what do we do? We need to move forward in several areas and we \nneed to do it specifically and immediately. This morning I read in the \nNew York Times that there was a debate on the Republican side about a \npackage of legislation to deal with this issue. This is what the \nheadlines in this morning's New York Times said:\n\n       Republicans drop a tax plan after business leaders protest. \n     Senate rejects action to cushion high gas prices.\n\n  What is this all about? In the Republican plan to deal with high \nenergy prices, they imposed a tax on these profitable oil companies and \nthey squealed like stuck pigs. Their lobbyists got on the phone and \nstarted raising all sorts of objections, indignation, and the \nRepublicans removed the tax. So we cannot even tax these businesses, \naccording to the Republican majority, when they are experiencing \nrecord-breaking profit.\n  This article goes on to talk about all of the protests that came from \nthis industry, and this is a powerful industry. Pick up this paper, the \nNew York Times, or your hometown paper, and today you are likely to \nfind a full-page ad--they run every day, every single day--explaining \nwhy all the money you are paying at the gas pump is for your own good. \nThis is a public relations campaign by an industry that is experiencing \nrecord-breaking profits. Last week the American Petroleum Institute--\nwhich represents all these oil companies--was asked, What are you going \nto do to respond to the consumers' outrage over gasoline prices? What \nare you going to do about the fact that you are crippling businesses \nand farmers and hurting individuals? What will you do when it comes to \nchanging policy?\n  They said, What we will do is this: We will spend $30 million more \nthis year on lobbyists in Washington, DC, and $25 million more buying \nnewspaper ads explaining that it really isn't so bad.\n  The American Petroleum Institute is not going to come willingly to \nthe table. What our Republican friends have said is they are not going \nto drag them to the table to hold them accountable for what has \nhappened across America.\n  What can we do? What should we do? First, we need fuel economy \nstandards for the cars and trucks we drive. I have introduced this \namendment twice and it failed twice, and I will call it up again the \nfirst chance I have. The year 1985 was the last time we had a serious \neffort to bring about more fuel-efficient, fuel-economical vehicles \nacross America. It worked. We increased the average fleet mileage of \ncars across America from about 15 miles a gallon to 25-28 miles a \ngallon, and we did it in 10 years without raising gasoline prices \nthrough the roof, despite the objections and resistance from Detroit \nand the oil companies. We showed leadership and got it done.\n  In that 10-year period of time, as America's economy surged forward, \nour imports of oil from overseas dropped by 30 percent. We dedicated \nourselves to conservation and efficiency, burned less fuel, and still \nfueled economic growth. That is what we need again. But it calls on a \nPresident and a Congress controlled by his party to step out and say \nsome things which a lot of oil companies will find objectionable. But \nso be it. That is what leadership should be about.\n  We need to encourage the kinds of technology for sustainable and \nrenewable fuels, technology that will lead to new companies, good-\npaying jobs across America. Instead of being enslaved to foreign oil, \nwe need to be masters again when it comes to energy, and we can do it \nwith leadership. We can see in these ways the way of the future. There \nare alcohol-based fuels. The President has talked about them. I think \nhe is right. For a long time I have supported ethanol. Of course, that \nis homegrown in Illinois. It is our corn turned into alcohol fuel \nsupplementing our gasoline. There is a great opportunity for expansion \nthere. Biodiesel, taking soybean oil and other vegetable oils, adding \nit to diesel fuel to stretch the value of that fuel and to reduce its \npollution--that is another opportunity for us. Cellulosic ethanol, \nwhich is another approach that has been used successfully by Brazil. \nBrazil, over 30 years, decided they would become energy independent. \nThey saw the writing on the wall. As long as their economy depended on \nforeign oil, they could not control their future and so they said we \nare going to be dependent on our own homegrown fuel. With local oil as \nwell as alcohol, they have transformed their economy into an energy-\nindependent economy which, within 2 years, will start exporting fuel \naround the world. What did it take to reach that? Leadership. \nLeadership that said no to the powerful oil interests and said their \ncountry's interests were more important.\n\n  We need the same thing now. We need a President who will stand up to \nleaders in this oil industry and say the economy of America is more \nimportant than their profits. We can do this, we can do it as a nation, \nand we need to do it because we need to combine this energy debate with \nanother debate that is critically important.\n  In a few days former Vice President Al Gore is going to release a \ndocumentary. It is called ``An Inconvenient Truth.'' It is going to \ntalk about global warming and how it is changing the world we live in, \nwhy we have so many violent storms and hurricanes and changes in \nweather patterns. It just isn't God's random way of reminding us He is \nin charge.\n  Sadly, we had something to do with it. What that means is we have \nfound ways to burn less fuel and still fuel our economy.\n  We have to find ways to conserve and be more efficient so we don't \nsee the disappearance of the Arctic, or Greenland, or sections of \nAntarctica, or the elimination of species of animals such\n\n[[Page S3856]]\n\nas polar bears because of the ice melting that is taking place around \nthe world. It is a very real issue and a very real problem. As we \ndebate the future of energy, let us do it in an environmentally \nresponsible way.\n  When my Republican colleagues say we can find new places to drill, \nsuch as wildlife refuges and wilderness, we can drill in all of these \nplaces and are bound to find some oil; maybe we would, but at what \ncost? Shouldn't America's goal be economic growth in an environmentally \nsensible and responsible way? That should be part of this debate as \nwell. We cannot ignore it--the energy debate and the environmental \ndebate together.\n  Whatever our solution is, it should be a solution that says to our \nchildren we will not only give you a world where you can drive and go \nto work with affordable gasoline prices, but we will give you a world \nwhere it is safe to live, where the environment you live in is not \ngoing to destroy the lifestyle we have enjoyed for generations. That is \npart of our responsibility.\n  I think we have a special challenge. There is a challenge to Congress \nto rise to the occasion which has caused concern and anger across \nAmerica--energy prices that have broken the backs of individuals, \nfamilies, and businesses, driving people to payday loans and pawnshops \nto fill up their tank so they can go to work. We need to show \nleadership. It starts by acknowledging that the Energy bill signed by \nthe President last August has failed. We need a new approach. We need \nnew leadership. We need to punish profiteers. We need to protect \nconsumers across America. We need to promote energy independence and \nthe new technologies of sustainable and renewable fuels that will \ngenerate new industries, new jobs, and new opportunities. That is the \nvision for an America moving in a new direction, a significant new \ndirection, something the people across America have been asking for.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. DeMint). The Senator from Arizona is \nrecognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/02/senate-section/article/S3856-1", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3856-S3857]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 ENERGY\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I wish to address the same subject and begin \nwhere the distinguished Senator from Illinois left off when he talked \nabout new leadership.\n  I wonder if he would join Republicans to see if we can eliminate the \ntariff on Brazilian ethanol, something which the Senator from Illinois \nsuggests we need more of, one of the three solutions he says we need--\nmore leadership, more ethanol and fuel economy standards. I think we \nare going to provide some leadership and we are going to provide some \nmore ethanol. One way to do that is to reduce the extraordinary expense \nof bringing it in from Brazil. We haven't gotten a lot of cooperation \nfrom the other side on that. That will be my first question to him: \nWill he step up and exercise leadership with us to eliminate that \ntariff on ethanol?\n  There is a 10-percent mandate in the Energy bill on ethanol. The \nSenator suggested we should have a higher mandate on ethanol, or a \nhigher subsidy for that. The reality is one of the reasons gas prices \nhave been where they are is we haven't been able to meet that 10-\npercent mandate. There isn't enough ethanol being produced and, \ntherefore, because there is a lack of supply in comparison to the \ndemand, the price has gone up, obviously. What we need to do here, \ninstead of pointing fingers and demagoguing the issue, is to understand \neconomics and appreciate where the real problem is. Then we can begin \nto solve it.\n  There is an old saying: For every complex problem, there is a simple \nand wrong solution. That is what we have mostly heard on the other \nside. The reality is, if you want to know the truth, the single most \nimportant component in the retail price of gasoline is the cost of \ncrude oil--the single most important factor. Indeed, the cost of crude \noil accounts for 95 percent of the price of a gallon of gasoline. \nChanges in the price of retail gasoline are almost entirely explained \nby changes in crude oil prices.\n  I have a chart I wish to show you which demonstrates that over the \nlast 15 years, changes in the world price of crude oil have accounted \nfor more than 95 percent of the changes in gasoline prices. It shows \nthat as crude oil prices have gone up, the price of gasoline has \ntracked it almost exactly.\n  If you are looking for a culprit and why crude oil prices have gone \nup, it is because the demand has exceeded the supply. Countries such as \nChina and India are demanding more and more of the product. And because \nof constraints imposed significantly by the Congress, we have not been \nadding to the supply.\n  There are also other problems that have created this spike recently. \nThe largest reason, according to the folks on Wall Street, is the \nnuclear saber rattling from Iran, which produces about 4 million \nbarrels of oil a day--or about 5 percent of world's supply--and it \ncontrols the Strait of Hormuz through which about 17 million barrels of \nMiddle East oil passes every day. Some experts believe that concern \nabout the Iranian nuclear crisis has added $10 per barrel to the price \nof crude oil since the start of the year. If you add to that supply \ndisruption in Norway and Nigeria, as well as the machinations of \nVenezuela's strongman Hugo Chavez, you can see there has been a spike \nin the world prices which have been reflected at the pump.\n  We have also had some domestic problems that have added to the spike \nin prices. The U.S. Minerals Management Service has reported that over \n334,000 barrels per day of crude oil production in the gulf coast are \nstill shut in as a result of Hurricane Katrina. More importantly, some \nof the heavily damaged gulf coast refineries representing nearly 5 \npercent of U.S. refining capacity are still undergoing repair. But the \ngood news is they are likely to resume production at the end of this \nmonth.\n  Another problem is because there was so much refining capacity that \nwent down, the Government urged the refiners to continue refining and \nforego their regularly scheduled annual fall maintenance in order to \nkeep the supply of gasoline from dropping even further. They did that. \nI am glad they did.\n  The problem now is the crisis is over and they are having to engage \nin that deferred maintenance. And after months of heavier than normal \nusage, they are finding this long overdue maintenance is reducing \nproduction out of the refineries as well. As it comes on line, we are \ngoing to see some relief.\n  Finally, as occurs every spring, refiners, in compliance with Federal \nmandated fuel regulations, have to switch from the wintertime fuel \nblend to the summertime fuel blend which entails completely drawing \ndown supplies of wintertime fuel blend and replacing it with the \nsummertime fuel blend. This obviously also causes a short-term supply \ndisruption adding to the spike.\n  There are some other factors as well, having to do with the \nelimination of MTBE as a motor fuel additive and the mandate for \nethanol production or addition to the fuel which was not initially able \nto comply with the 10-percent standard which has had some impact on \nprices, especially in much of the East Coast and Texas.\n  But the bottom line here is there is a variety of reasons why fuel \ncosts and, therefore, gasoline prices have spiked. It does not do a lot \nof good to point the finger at somebody and say, We know the answer; we \nwill punish them and that will solve the problem. The reality is that \nprofits from the oil industry are now being put to use in expanding \nproduction. The industry invested nearly $109 billion in 2004. While \nthe numbers aren't in for 2005 yet, for first three quarters it showed \ninvestment spending was 28 percent higher than in the first three \nquarters of the previous year. It is projected this year to grow by \ndouble digits again.\n  This investment will lead to a 2.2 million barrel per day increase in \nproduction this year, outpacing demand that is expected to rise by just \n1.8 million barrels per day. That, more than any of these other \nfactors, is going to add actual fuel to the pipeline which will, \ntherefore, enable us to bring the fuel costs down.\n  The bottom line here is when you are talking about solutions, you \ntalk about that which will either reduce the demand or increase the \nproductivity. Unfortunately, consumer demand has not been reduced that \nmuch even with the higher prices, which means you have to look for more \nproduction. There are several ways you can do this.\n\n[[Page S3857]]\n\n  The Senator from Illinois scoffed at ANWR, saying it is only 3 \npercent of the world's supply. Do you realize how much that it is? That \nis huge. That is as much oil as Iraq produced.\n  Had President Clinton not vetoed the exploration in ANWR 10 years \nago, that oil would now be flowing today. The Senator says it will take \n10 years. Yes. Before you can complete your journey, you have to \nestablish the first step. That is what we have to do here. Had we done \nthat 10 years ago, that oil would be flowing today.\n  By the way, to characterize it as a wilderness area is a \nmisrepresentation because as we should realize, this is an area \nexpressly set aside for oil exploration by the Congress. It is not \ngoing into a wilderness area and cutting it out and then exploring in \nan area that was set aside for wilderness.\n  There are other increases in productivity in addition to ANWR. \nIncreasing our deepwater production 100 miles offshore is virtually \nsafe. Clearly we can eliminate restrictions on the 100-mile limit for \ndeepwater drilling offshore. We could, if we wanted to, stop buying \ntemporarily in this market today for the SPR, the Strategic Petroleum \nReserve. We could suspend the boutique fuel blends and reduce the \nethanol mandate.\n  Those are short-term things that could be done. But again for the \nlonger term, if you want to bring in more ethanol, eliminate or reduce \nthe tariff on Brazilian ethanol; if you want to have more production, \nlook at deepwater drilling and ANWR. Those are ways to actually add \ncrude oil and, therefore, fuel to the equation rather than these ideas \nof not adding any oil whatsoever but simply make a political point.\n  The point was made that profits of the oil companies are up. As has \nbeen indicated, those profits are now being plowed back into production \nand to refinery capacity which is going to help us reduce the cost.\n\n  The Senator from Illinois said it is strange indeed that prices go up \nall over town when they go up. It is not strange at all. You don't have \nto have collusion between the oil companies for that phenomenon to be \nreflected because of the fact that the crude oil prices are the same \nfor everyone. So if everybody's baseline price goes up, everybody is \ngoing to be raising the cost of gasoline at the fuel pump. The idea \nthat there must be collusion or at least the inference there must be \ncollusion, remember that the Government has been investigating this for \nyears and, to my knowledge, has never found any evidence of collusion. \nAs the President said, we will keep on looking for it. If we find it, \nobviously those people will not go unpunished.\n  Let us not try to point a finger of blame in an area where we know we \nare coming up with a dry hole. That isn't going to add anything to the \nproduction of crude oil and, therefore, do anything to increase the \nsupply and, therefore, reduce the cost.\n  The bottom line is this: There are a of lot ideas about how to deal \nwith the short-term cost of energy. Some of them are good. There are \nways to increase the long-term supply and thus deal with the long-term \ncost. But until we are serious about the economics of the issue, rather \nthan simply trying to come up with a bumper sticker solution, we are \nnever going to be able to eliminate the cost to consumers. And that, \nafter all, ought to be our primary responsibility.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/02/senate-section/article/S3857-1", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3857-S3858]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                  IRAQ\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, last evening, as most of us had departed \nwith the understanding that the floor was about to close, our colleague \nfrom Illinois, Senator Durbin, the distinguished whip of the Democratic \nParty, came over and proceeded to give what I felt was a very strong \ncritique of all of those things in Iraq which in his judgment and, to \nsome extent, the judgment of others sharing it went wrong. There was \nlittle or no reference to what went right and the progress that has \nbeen made in Iraq.\n  He concluded again with his own personal views with regard to \nSecretary Rumsfeld and what should be done with respect to his services \nin the future.\n  It is interesting. Yesterday, Senator Biden also spoke out with \nregard to his concept of this very difficult dilemma, facing not only \nthe Iraqis but all those nations working to help the Iraqis form their \ngovernment, as to how certain modifications should be taken with regard \nto the new government, namely three secretaries having their own say in \nthis matter with an overall arching government on top. Senator Biden's \ncommentary, in my judgment, was constructive, and was maybe a little \ntoo late to back up from where we are at this moment. But it was \nnevertheless a positive contribution to the debate and constructive, in \nsharp contrast to the comments of Senator Durbin.\n  A lot of things have gone right in Iraq, not the least of which is \nthe freedom of elections, the formation of a new government, the \ndifficult process that their political structure went through in \nselecting a new prime minister, and making the commitments by that \nnewly selected prime minister to finish within this month of May the \nappointments necessary to have a government in place and one that \nhopefully will work to establish and take upon itself the \nresponsibility of full sovereignty of that nation. This was a ray of \noptimism, in my judgment, a ray of hope.\n\n  If there were any time in the entire history of this Iraqi \nconfrontation situation and the Iraqi war when the new leaders of Iraq \nneed support, it is now. I daresay the constructive criticism of many--\nI led a codel with Senator Levin a few weeks ago, and other codels have \ngone through. The Secretaries of State and Defense have been through. \nAmbassador Khalilzad has done a remarkable job in encouraging the Iraqi \nleadership to move forward with this new government. That has been \ndone.\n  Now is not the time to stop all the constructive debate but to stop \nthose remarks and debate which can be pulling back from the gains we \nhave made, showing less than full support to the Iraqi people for their \ncourage and their new government.\n  I have studied each of the generals individually. On the whole, I \npersonally believe it was a constructive contribution to the debate. \nOthers may differ. Somehow, I believe throughout our history our senior \nuniformed officers--and, indeed, others, including enlisted men--have \ncome forward at times to provide their own perspectives which are \ncontrary to the policymakers in charge of that period of history.\n  I commend all who are participating in the constructive debate. It \nshould go forward at this time. This Nation is at war. At the very \nminute we are privileged to be in the Senate exercising freedom of \nspeech and debate, young men and women in our Armed Forces are in \nharm's way, subjecting themselves to life at risk and, indeed, giving \ntheir lives and limbs. We must be ever mindful of the suffering of \ntheir families.\n  Now is the time to show our strongest resolve in Iraq. The President \nhas made a decision as to the leadership he desires, including \nSecretary Rumsfeld. He has that right as Commander in Chief under the \nConstitution. He has exercised that unequivocally and stated his views. \nIt is now a matter for all to respect that judgment of the President \nand move forward.\n  I personally have worked with many Secretaries of Defense; three I \nserved under in the Department of Defense. Every one in the last 30-\nplus years I have worked with--except one, coincidentally; when \nSecretary Rumsfeld was Secretary of Defense I was taking 2 years of my \nlife preparing to try and get elected to the Senate, so with that one \nhiatus I have worked with them all, I have established a satisfactory, \nhard-working relationship with Secretary Rumsfeld.\n  Our committee is now in the midst of its markup and prepared to bring \nto the Senate its annual authorization bill. This is the most intense \nwork period between our committee and the Department of Defense.\n  I conclude by saying think first of our troops and their sacrifices \nthat they have made, the risk they face each day, and our goals to try \nand support the formation of some type of democratic government of the \nchoosing of the Iraqi people and their leadership. Progress is being \nmade every day now. Now is the time to stand steadfast in our support \nof our troops, the coalition forces, the Iraqi elected leaders, and the \npeople.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n\n[[Page S3858]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I intended to speak in reference to an \namendment I was to call up for the supplemental, but because we are in \nmorning business I will speak in morning business.\n  My amendment would be objected to as out of order, as being \ninconsistent with the supplemental emergency bill. However, I am here \nto talk about an emergency in rural Oregon in timber-dependent \ncommunities.\n  For 100 years, there has been a relationship between the Federal \nGovernment and rural communities that has been absolutely indispensable \nto our country and to those communities. The deal was this: In those \nStates where the Federal Government owns much of the land--in my State \nit owns more than half of the State of Oregon--there would be multiple \nuses of public lands. They would be managed as to their resources \nconsistent with environmental law.\n  In the case of the State of Oregon, there would be the result of \ntimber products, wood products, to build countless millions of homes. \nThere would be jobs for people and there would be the types of jobs \nthat would create tax revenues that would allow local communities to \nhave services.\n  In addition to that, there is what are called timber receipts. Local \ncommunities would get 25 percent of the timber receipts from the \nharvest of public timber. This has been absolutely indispensable to the \nlife of these rural communities.\n  That deal changed in the 1990s. To show you how devastating this \nchange was to my State, we had the listing of the spotted owl. We had \nthe Endangered Species Act go into effect. President Clinton and Vice \nPresident Gore pursued a forest policy that took a harvest of roughly 8 \nbillion board feet a year down to less than 1 percent of that in many \nnational forests. As a consequence, by the end of the 1990s, our \nschools were closing. They operated 4 days a week. Counties had no \nmoney because many of them have lost up to 60 percent of their \noperating budgets.\n  At the end of the Clinton administration, the Congress, with \nPresident Clinton, recognized the damage, the devastation, being done \nto these communities, so we passed, in 2000, the Secure Rural Schools \nAct to bridge the gap between what had been, the gridlock that existed, \nand the hope for a brighter day when there would be a predictable, \nsustainable level of forestry.\n\n  President Bush and the Congress pursued the Healthy Forests \nInitiative and this President has fully funded the Northwest Forest \nPlan that was the product of President Clinton but never delivered on \nthe timber that it promised in the hopes of bridging the gap for these \ncommunities.\n  But still, after all of that effort, 6 years later, we find that only \na small percent of what was done 20 years ago is available to these \ncommunities in terms of timber harvest. As a consequence, this secure \nrural schools fund is about to expire.\n  I suggest this is a very real, present danger, even an emergency, \nthat is appropriate to this supplemental. We ought to include it. These \nare Federal decisions that have been made. They have been made by an \nadministration in the 1990s. They have been made by Federal law, the \nlaw that passed by this Congress. They have been made by courts that \nhave enforced that law and have locked up our forests and now have us \nin a bind that is truly an emergency.\n  This is a Federal obligation. I need to use every tool as a Senator \nthat I have available to me to try to remind this Senate, this \nCongress, of the obligation it has. We cannot abandon these \ncommunities. We cannot abandon these people. We have to find a way to \ncontinue to get back to a management level that is consistent with \nenvironmental law, that allows for multiple uses of the land, the \nharvest of timber, the employment of our people, the production of wood \nproducts, the receipt of timber taxes, so that schools can remain open, \nstreets can remain paved, counties can be safe because they have police \nprotection.\n  This is not inexpensive. The annual cost of what we did to bridge \nthis gap was $500 million a year. Oregon is responsible for 20 percent \nof the merchantable timber in this country. We are not alone in terms \nof the benefit that came from this secure rural schools fund. \nCalifornia received $380 million over the last 6 years; Montana, $63 \nmillion; Mississippi received $38.8 million to keep their rural timber-\ndependent communities together body and soul.\n  We cannot walk away from this until we find a day where we can get \nback to a deal that is sustainable in terms of environmental policy, \ntimber production, and the employment of our people. Heaven knows we \nneed the timber. We are now a net importer of timber in this country. \nYet what do we do with our own timber? Our policies are in gridlock and \nour forests are burning.\n  Three years ago, there were 500,000 acres burned in southern Oregon, \nlarger than the State, I am told, of Rhode Island. Yet that timber \nstill stands rotting, a moonscape that, frankly, ought to be allowed to \nat least be salvaged in some degree.\n  Until we come to a day where we have a policy that we in the Federal \nGovernment agree upon, we cannot abandon these rural communities.\n  I will at the appropriate time propose my amendment and hope it is \nnot ruled out of order.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I commend the distinguished Senator from \nOregon for his comments and his leadership on these issues that are so \nimportant to our forestry owners and people throughout the States who \ndepend on incomes from those jobs.\n  I ask unanimous consent I be permitted to call up amendments at this \npoint.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/02/senate-section/article/S3858-2", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3858-S3864]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nMAKING EMERGENCY SUPPLEMENTAL APPROPRIATIONS FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDING \n                      SEPTEMBER 30, 2006--Resumed\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

On this vote, the yeas are 92, the nays 4. \nThree-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn having voted in the \naffirmative, the motion is agreed to.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I voted against the motion to invoke \ncloture on the supplemental appropriations bill because it will have \nthe effect of preventing the consideration of a number of important and \nrelevant amendments.\n  There are more than a hundred amendments which have been filed on \nthis bill. Several are important amendments, such as Senator Wyden's \namendment to prevent funds from being used to continue discounts given \nto the oil companies on royalties which otherwise would be paid to the \nFederal Government for production of oil and/or natural gas on Federal \nlands. Another example is the bipartisan amendment that I offered with \nSenators Collins and Reed to require reports to Congress on progress \ntoward a national unity government in Iraq.\n  Too frequently in recent years, we see a pattern of slowing down \nconsideration of amendments or filling the amendment tree to block them \naltogether, followed by cloture to end debate and further restricting \nor preventing the consideration of amendments. The Senate, which has \noften been referred to as ``the world's greatest deliberative body'' \nand which historically has been characterized by the quality of its \ndebate, should not permit this pattern of preventing the consideration \nof, and votes on, amendments to become the norm.\n  When I came to the Senate, the leadership did not as a routine \napproach try to prevent consideration of amendments they didn't agree \nwith. Instead, they attempted to amend them or simply vote against \nthem. In recent years, we see more and more bills on which amendments \nare limited or blocked entirely, more like the House. On the PATRIOT \nAct, this year, for example, the amendment tree was completely filled \nby the leadership, a procedural technique for preventing any amendments \nfrom being considered, and none were.\n  Mr. President, I support the funding for the troops in Iraq and \nAfghanistan, and I support the emergency assistance for the gulf coast \nin the wake of Hurricane Katrina. I intend to support this bill on \nfinal passage in the Senate. I am opposed, however, to the use of this \nprocedure to limit debate and the consideration of amendments.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3617\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I have an amendment at the desk, No. 3617. \nI ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is pending. It is now the \nregular order.\n  The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, this amendment would strike the $6 million \nearmark for sugarcane growers in Hawaii, which was not included in the \nadministration's emergency supplemental request.\n  I would again remind my colleagues of the Statement of Administration \nPolicy which was issued on April 25, obviously on the legislation now \nbeing considered. Again, this has been repeated several times in the \nChamber, but I think it is important to again quote from the \nadministration's statement, saying:\n\n       The administration is seriously concerned with the overall \n     funding level and the numerous unrequested items included in \n     the Senate bill that are unrelated to the war or emergency \n     hurricane relief needs. The final version of the legislation \n     must remain focused on addressing urgent national priorities \n     while maintaining fiscal discipline. Accordingly, if the \n     President is ultimately presented a bill that provides more \n     than $92.2 billion, exclusive of funding for the President's \n     plan to address pandemic influenza, he will veto the bill.\n\n  The administration statement goes on to say:\n\n       The administration strongly opposes the committee's \n     agricultural assistance proposal totaling nearly $4 billion. \n     The 2002 farm bill was designed, when combined with crop \n     insurance, to eliminate the need for ad hoc disaster \n     assistance. In 2005, many crops had record or near record \n     production and the U.S. farm sector cash receipts were the \n     second highest ever. Furthermore, the proposed level of \n     assistance is excessive and may overcompensate certain \n     producers for their losses.\n\n  So the administration is pretty clear about this issue of these add-\nons which have ballooned this bill from $92 billion to $105 billion or \nso.\n  I also point out for my colleagues' benefit that the American people \nare growing very weary of this earmarking process. Last Thursday, there \nwas a poll published in the Wall Street Journal, which is an NBC News/\nWall Street Journal poll, and it was interesting in that it says:\n\n       In particular, Americans who don't approve of Congress \n     blame their sour mood on partisan contention and gridlock in \n     Washington. Some 44 percent call themselves ``tired of \n     Republicans and Democrats fighting each other.'' Thirty-six \n     percent say nothing seems to get done on important issues. \n     Further, 34 percent cite corruption among lawmakers. Among \n     all Americans, a 39 percent plurality say the single most \n     important thing for Congress to accomplish this year is \n     curtailing budgetary earmarks benefiting only certain \n     constituents.\n\n  If there is ever a bill that would emphasize the frustration \nAmericans have felt, it is this legislation that is before us.\n  A worthy cause, although I intend, along with others, to stop this \nbusiness of continuing to fund the war in Iraq, which has been going on \nnow a number of years now, the ``emergency supplemental,'' it is long \noverdue and time to focus on the normal budgetary process because we \nknow we will be spending money on Iraq, unfortunately, for a long \nperiod of time. But this vehicle in itself is a violation of the normal \nprocedures of the Senate because it should be authorized and then \nappropriated. But this vehicle is then, of course, used to load up \nunnecessary, unwanted, unfortunate, and sometimes outrageous additional \nspending.\n  For example, in this bill, which is not subject to this amendment, we \nhave $15 million to the USDA Ewe Lamb Replacement and Retention \nProgram. This program already exists and is meant to assist with lamb \nbreeding stock needs, not hurricane recovery; $400,000 goes to the Rio \nGrande Valley sugar growers for assistance with sugarcane storage and \ntransportation costs to the port of Baton Rouge, LA. Among the many \nsugar growers nationwide, why are we providing an earmark to this \nparticular group?\n  There is $120 million for sugarcane and sugar beet disaster \nassistance in Florida. Rather than using existing USDA disaster \nassistance programs, this legislation would establish a special program \nthat caters directly and solely to Florida sugar. By the way, it is one \nof the most heavily subsidized industries in America today.\n  There is $6 million to compensate owners of flooded crop and grazing \nland in North Dakota. Hurricanes in North Dakota? North Dakota is one \nof the nation's top producers of, you guessed it, sugar.\n  Mr. President, the amendment I offer today would strike an earmark in \nthe bill that provides $6 million to sugarcane growers in Hawaii. \nObviously, the Hawaiian lands were not anywhere near the path of the \n2005 hurricanes. Certainly it is appropriate that any farmer impacted \nby a natural disaster can seek Federal assistance which, as I already \nsaid, is why there are existing USDA disaster recovery programs \nauthorized under the 2002 farm bill. But in this case the appropriators \nare establishing a special program that caters directly to Hawaiian \nsugar growers via a must-pass emergency appropriations bill.\n\n  I think it is important that we continue to go back, as we argue the \nmerits or demerits of these earmarks, to the fact that this is the \n``Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act for Defense, the Global War \non Terror, and Hurricane Recovery.'' Hawaiian sugar growers do not fit \nin any of those categories.\n  According to this bill, according to the legislation before us, the \nSecretary shall use $6 million to ``assist sugarcane growers in Hawaii \nby making a payment in that amount to an agricultural transportation \ncooperative in Hawaii, the members of which are eligible to receive \nmarketing assistance loans and loan deficiency payments.''\n  What does that mean? I can only assume this funding will be directed \nto the Hawaii Sugar and Transportation Cooperative, the only entity \nthat received $7.2 million from a nearly identical provision in last \nyear's, guess\n\n[[Page S3861]]\n\nwhat, military construction appropriations. This same entity has \nalready got $7.2 million out of a MilCon bill. I am informed the \nmembers are the Gay and Robinson Sugar Company, the island of Hawaii, \nand the Hawaiian Commercial Sugar Company, the island of Maui. These \nare producer-owned sugarcane mills that own the land.\n  Let me repeat. The same cooperative got a bailout a year ago. Are we \nnow going to start providing these two companies with annual \nsupplemental appropriations bailouts? I urge my colleagues to question \nwhat we are doing.\n  Let me quote from the administration's Statement of Administrative \nPolicy again:\n\n       In 2005, many crops had record or near record production \n     and U.S. farm sector cash receipts were the second highest \n     ever. Furthermore, the proposed level of assistance is \n     excessive and may overcompensate certain producers for their \n     losses.\n\n  What are we trying to do with this bill? We are trying to tell our \nfarmers, no matter where you are or what you farm, don't bother with \ncrop insurance because come next year's supplemental, we will dole out \nfar more than you need.\n  As Secretary Mike Johanns said:\n\n       I have spent the last week studying the bill to try to get \n     an understanding of the mechanics of the bill, but taking it \n     a step further, trying to get an understanding of what we \n     have done for disaster relief in the last year. And what is \n     the agricultural economy like that may lay the foundation for \n     somebody to say we need disaster relief.\n\n  He said for the 2005 and 2006 crop years, despite pockets of weather \nproblems, ``Every year you see them. For a country this big, it is \nunusual not to have some weather issues out there.''\n  But despite pockets of problems, production and yields set records or \nnear records recently.\n  Johanns' conclusions, after getting answers to his questions: ``I got \nall that data and evidence, and that got me thinking, `What are they \ntrying to do with that bill?' '' He is talking about the supplemental \nbill before us. ``So I studied the bill and I must admit, my forehead \nstarted wrinkling.''\n  Well, as noted in Saturday's Washington Post editorial, ``Should \nFarming Be the Nation's Only Risk-Free Enterprise?'' perhaps the intent \nin providing this $6 million to the Hawaiian sugar growers is to prop \nup a sugar industry which has fallen on hard times. With rising \ndiabetes and child obesity rates which have more than doubled since \n1977, maybe sugar isn't in demand as in previous years. Maybe the \nefforts by parents to have soft drink machines stripped from public \nschools is having a prolific effect on sugar production. If only that \nwere the case. In reality, consumption of sweeteners in the U.S. has \nrisen from 113 pounds per person per year in 1966 to around 142 pounds \nper person per year in 2004. At that rate Americans consume the \nequivalent of about 1 teaspoon of sugar per hour every 24 hours, 7 days \na week.\n  The U.S. News & World Report compared our sugar fix to other, more \nnutritious agricultural commodities and found that Americans ate an \nabysmal 8.3 pounds of broccoli a year in 2003, something I can \nunderstand.\n  Again I question the need to spend more taxpayer dollars on \nsugarcane. Didn't we just vote last week not to fund a $15 million \nmarketing program for seafood? Certainly less than a week later we are \nnot going to turn around and vote to fund marketing to support this \neffort.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The yeas and nays are requested. Is there a \nsufficient second? There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, the provision under attack at this moment \nwas not snuck in during the dark of night. It was openly discussed with \nthe authorizing committee and was granted approval. It was openly \ndiscussed with the Appropriations Subcommittee on Agriculture and it \nwas granted approval. That is why this provision is in the \nsupplemental. It was approved by the authorizers and the appropriators. \nThirdly, it was openly discussed with the Secretary of Agriculture, and \nthe Secretary issued a statement declaring that this was a disaster \narea.\n  Why do we call this a disaster? In one of those strange natural \nphenomena, for 40 days and 40 nights it rained in Hawaii. In one spot, \nit rained 126 inches in those 40 days. The average in most areas was 3 \ninches a day. Obviously, with such sustained heavy rains, you would \nhave devastation. Many families lost their homes. Private property and \npublic property were destroyed.\n  The $6 million in this provision is to assist the two sugar \ncompanies, Gay and Robinson and Hawaiian Commercial and Sugar, with \ntheir crop losses, damage to their irrigation canal system, and washed \nout roads.\n  It may interest my colleagues to know that on the island of Kauai, \nthat plantation suffered more than 100 miles of roads being severely \ndamaged. They are washed out and require complete rebuilding. Some of \nthe most critical roads were the access roads to irrigation, and these \nwill have to be rebuilt.\n  In addition to the roads, the irrigation infrastructure on the island \nof Kauai was totally damaged and destroyed. This infrastructure damage \nhas two costs. One is the cost of repairing, obviously, and the other \nis the sugar losses due to production disruptions. And the same can be \nsaid for the island of Maui.\n  The yield losses alone for the two companies will far exceed the \namount we are requesting for assistance. Losses have occurred because \nof this damage.\n  In summary, heavy rains caused tremendous infrastructure damages. The \nactual repair or reconstruction costs are much higher than the amount \nwe are seeking.\n  I hope my colleagues will show some compassion and understanding. It \nis an emergency.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, this provision was included in the \ncommittee bill in the agricultural disaster title of the supplemental \nbecause of severe weather-related damage to Hawaii's sugarcane crop \nthis year.\n  Hawaii sustained heavy rains and flooding from February 20 through \nApril 2, devastating and destroying public and private property. The \nfunds were considered by the committee to be necessary to assist \nsugarcane farmers through their cooperatives with cane crop losses.\n  They also sustained damage to their irrigation canal systems, and \nthere were public roads that were washed out resulting from the heavy \nrains.\n  I support the position of the Senator from Hawaii on this amendment \nand urge the amendment be defeated.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I will be very brief.\n  One of the things we know we are all going to have to look at in the \n2007 farm bill is how do we continue down this road and be able to \nafford it.\n  The 2002 farm bill put in what was called crop insurance. Every time \nwe put in a program that undermines the incentive to use crop \ninsurance, all we do is add it to the deficit, and we come back.\n  There is no question there are some needs, and probably legitimate, \nbut what this appropriation does is create an incentive for people not \nto use crop insurance. That is exactly what it does.\n  So if we want to unwind further and raise the costs for the American \npeople of the farm bill we have today, all we have to do is keep this \nkind of funding in, and we will undo and make sure we spend more money \nin the future.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate?\n  The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I will be brief.\n  I understand Hawaii experienced severe flooding this winter. It \nshould be pointed out that the heavy tropical rains did not lead to a \nPresidential disaster declaration. Surely the flooding impacted a broad \nrange of agricultural commodities in Hawaii, not just sugarcane \ngrowers, and the Secretary of Agriculture is providing assistance under \nexisting USDA disaster recovery programs. These programs will help \nfarmers with noninsured crops, debt management, emergency loans, \ninfrastructure repair, and farmland rehabilitation. Do we really need \nan additional earmark of $6 million for Hawaiian sugarcane growers on \ntop of the assistance already offered by the USDA?\n\n[[Page S3862]]\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record a USDA \nfactsheet that contains the programs that are available: Emergency \nConservation Program, Noninsured Crop Disaster Assistance Program, \nDisaster Debt Set-Aside Program, and the Emergency Loan Program.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n    Ongoing Disaster Assistance Programs for Agricultural Producers\n\n\n                                overview\n\n       The Farm Service Agency (FSA) offers farmers and ranchers \n     various types of disaster aid to facilitate recovery from \n     losses caused by drought, flood, freeze, tornadoes, \n     hurricane, and other natural events. Ongoing disaster \n     assistance programs available to eligible producers are:\n\n\n                  Emergency Conservation Program (ECP)\n\n       ECP provides funding for farmers and ranchers to \n     rehabilitate farmland damaged by wind erosion, floods, \n     hurricanes, or other natural disasters and for carrying out \n     emergency water conservation measures during periods of \n     severe drought. The natural disaster must create new \n     conservation problems which, if not treated, would:\n       Impair or endanger the land;\n       Materially affect the productive capacity of the land;\n       Represent unusual damage which, except for wind erosion, is \n     not the type likely to recur frequently in the same area; and\n       Be so costly to repair that federal assistance is, or will \n     be required, to return the land to productive agricultural \n     use.\n\n\n           noninsured Crop Disaster Assistance Program (NAP)\n\n       NAP provides financial assistance to eligible producers \n     affected by drought, flood, hurricane, or other natural \n     disasters. NAP covers noninsurable crop losses and planting \n     prevented by disasters.\n       Landowners, tenants, or sharecroppers who share in the risk \n     of producing an eligible crop may qualify for this program. \n     Before payments can be issued applications must first be \n     received and approved, generally before the crop is planted, \n     and the crop must have suffered a minimum of 50 percent loss \n     in yield.\n       Eligible crops include commercial crops and other \n     agricultural commodities produced for food, including \n     livestock feed or fiber for which the catastrophic level of \n     crop insurance is unavailable.\n       Also eligible for NAP coverage are controlled-environment \n     crops (mushroom and floriculture), specialty crops (honey and \n     maple sap), and value loss crops (aquaculture, Christmas \n     trees, ginseng, ornamental nursery, and turfgrass sod).\n\n\n                 disaster Debt Set-Aside Program (DSA)\n\n       DSA is available to producers in primary or contiguous \n     counties declared presidential or secretarial disaster areas. \n     When borrowers affected by natural disasters are unable to \n     make their scheduled payments on any debt, FSA is authorized \n     to consider set-aside of some payments to allow the farming \n     operation to continue.\n       After disaster designation is made, FSA will notify \n     borrowers of the availability of the DSA. Borrowers who are \n     notified have eight months from the date of designation to \n     apply. Also, to meet current operating and family living \n     expenses, FSA borrowers may request a release of income \n     proceeds to meet these essential needs or request special \n     servicing provisions from their local FSA county offices to \n     explore other options. A complete fact sheet about DSA can be \n     found at http://www.fsa.usda.qov/pas/publications/facts/\n     debtset05.pdf.\n\n\n                      Emergency Loan Program (EM)\n\n       FSA provides emergency loans to help producers recover from \n     production and physical losses due to drought, flooding, \n     other natural disasters, or quarantine.\n       Emergency loans may be made to farmers and ranchers who own \n     or operate land located in a county declared by the president \n     as a disaster area or designated by the secretary of \n     agriculture as a disaster area or quarantine area (for \n     physical losses only, the FSA administrator may authorize \n     emergency loan assistance). EM funds may be used to:\n       Restore or replace essential property;\n       Pay all or part of production costs associated with the \n     disaster year;\n       Pay essential family living expenses;\n       Reorganize the farming operation; and\n       Refinance certain debts.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I also ask unanimous consent to print in \nthe Record the editorial contained in the Washington Post on April 29 \nbasically saying:\n\n       There are, no doubt, farmers who have suffered severe \n     losses this year. Isn't that what crop insurance--government-\n     subsidized crop insurance, to the tune of $4.2 billion this \n     year--is supposed to be about?\n       The administration is right to oppose this provision;\n\n  They are talking about the provision of $4 billion in disaster \npayments to farmers as part of the emergency spending bill--\n\n     the Senate ought to show enough discipline to take it out.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Apr. 29, 2006]\n\n                         Farmers at the Trough\n\n       Farm Subsidies have risen from $8 billion in 1997 to a \n     projected $22 billion this year. Farm earnings have risen, \n     too. Net farm income grew from $36 billion in 2002 to a \n     record $83 billion in 2004. Although that fell last year to \n     $72 billion and is forecast to drop again 2006, to $56.2 \n     billion, that's still above the 10-year average.\n       But why let good news stand in the way of even more \n     payments to farmers? The Senate is poised to add $4 billion \n     in ``disaster'' payments to farmers as part of the emergency \n     spending bill it's debating. A big chunk would go to farmers \n     who have suffered no other disaster than the high energy \n     prices that are hitting every other sector of the economy--\n     not to mention anyone who drives a car.\n       Under the Senate proposal, farmers who already receive cash \n     subsidies for the corn, wheat, cotton or other crops they \n     grow--money they get when prices are high or prices are low, \n     in good years and bad--would get an extra 30 percent, at a \n     cost of $1.56 billion on top of the $5.2 billion the \n     government is already spending. Because payments are based on \n     the size of farm operations, this would funnel the largest \n     amounts to the biggest commercial farms; according to an \n     analysis by the Environmental Working Group, just 10 percent \n     of bonus subsidy recipients will collect nearly 60 percent of \n     the money. More than 50 producers would collect an extra \n     $100,000 or more. Meanwhile, 60 percent of the nation's \n     farmers would get nothing under this program because they \n     raise livestock or grow crops that aren't eligible for the \n     subsidy.\n       Proponents of the spending point to droughts in Iowa, \n     floods in North Dakota and wildfires in Texas--calamities \n     that have affected farmers there, they say, in much the same \n     way Hurricane Katrina slammed those in the Gulf Coast. There \n     are, no doubt, farmers who have suffered severe losses this \n     year. Isn't that what crop insurance--government-subsidized \n     crop insurance, to the tune of $4.2 billion this year--is \n     supposed to be about? True, crop insurance doesn't cover, all \n     losses, but should farming be the nation's only risk-free \n     enterprise? Besides, one of the theories behind the egregious \n     2002 farm bill was that it would, at least, provide generous \n     enough payments year in and year out that farmers wouldn't \n     need emergency bailouts.\n       The administration is right to oppose this provision; the \n     Senate ought to show enough discipline to take it out. Don't \n     count on it, though. On Wednesday, Senate Majority Leader \n     Bill Frist (R-Tenn.) touted a letter to the president, joined \n     by 35 of his colleagues, pledging to sustain a threatened \n     veto if the spending package exceeds the administration's \n     requested $95.5 billion. That same day, the Senate voted by a \n     veto-proof 72 to 26 against removing the farm spending and \n     other provisions from the bill-- current price tag, $106.5 \n     billion.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, if I may respond, on April 2 of this year, \nthe rains ended. The Governor of Hawaii, in a most expeditious manner, \ngathered all the facts and filed a report with the President of the \nUnited States on April 10. That letter to the President requested that \nthe President issue a declaration of disaster. It is now in the White \nHouse under consideration. It is unfortunate it is not before us, but \nwe have been assured that it will be part of the declaration. I wish \nthe record to show that the State of Hawaii did go through every \nregular step to make certain this request was done in the regular \nfashion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment? If \nnot, the question is on agreeing to amendment No. 3617. The yeas and \nnays have been ordered.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I rise to discuss an amendment, filed by \nSenator Nelson of Florida and myself, joined by Senators Lieberman, \nLautenberg, Kerry our distinguished minority leader, that will provide \nserious resources, not just lipservice, to help us kick the oil \naddiction habit and put this country on a long-term path to real energy \nsecurity. At a time when American families are spending exorbitant \namounts to fill their cars and heat their homes, when this Nation is \nusing ever increasing quantities of foreign oil, when our coastal \ncommunities are threatened by rising sea levels caused by global \nwarming, we need a new approach. For the sake of our economy, our \nsecurity, and our environment, we need to act now.\n  For years, this administration has promoted one course--more \ndrilling. Instead of making the necessary and timely investments needed \nto push this country in the direction of a sustainable energy policy, \nthe administration has beat one drum over and over again--drill, drill, \ndrill. Drill in the Arctic, drill in our wilderness, drill off our \nbeaches. This is not the way to kick our oil habit. The President \nclaims to have seen the light, and now touts the virtues of efficiency \nand the importance of biofuels and renewable energy, and we applaud \nhim. But he proposes to fund the Department of Energy's Efficiency and \nRenewables programs at the same level they were at in 2001, and he \nrefuses to endorse higher mileage standards for automobiles, which are \nthe same now as they were years ago.\n  Our energy situation has reached a critical point, and it is truly an \nemergency. Secretary of Energy Bodman even admitted on Sunday that we \nare facing a crisis. Gas prices are nearing their record highs, rising \n41 cents in the past month and over 54 cents since the Energy bill was \nsigned into law last August. Many of the countries that we depend on \nfor our oil are politically unstable or have unfriendly regimes. The \nIranian situation, in particular, threatens to drive oil prices far \nhigher. We can not allow our economy to be continually held hostage by \nthe whims of OPEC.\n  This is not just about economic security. It is about national \nsecurity. As former CIA Director James Woolsey testified before the \nEnergy Committee, the hundreds of billions of dollars we send abroad \neach year to feed our oil addiction help to fund the very organizations \nthat preach hatred for America.\n  We should have taken serious action years ago. The American people \ncan afford to wait no longer. The Nelson-Menendez amendment provides \nthe immediate funding we need to allow us to take control of our \ndestiny and create a brighter, cleaner, and safer energy future for \nAmerica. It provides $3 billion for a wide range of efficiency, \nsecurity, and research and development programs--programs the President \ntalks about in glowing terms but does not propose to actually fund.\n  His 2007 budget barely includes half of the authorized funding for \nrenewable energy research, and provides less than 2 percent for the \nincentives needed to encourage the installation and use of renewable \nenergy. Our amendment would add $50 million for renewable energy \nresearch and development in the Department of Energy, over $100 million \nin renewable energy rebates for homes and small businesses, and $200 \nmillion for the Department of Defense to do its part to meet the \nrenewable energy goals set out by the President and in the law.\n\n  The administration has tried for years to portray efficiency as a \nvice, something that is totally inconsistent with the American way of \nlife. Recently they have changed their tune, but not their actions. The \nPresident's budget actually cut energy efficiency programs by 13 \npercent. That simply astounds me. Few things are more effective for \ncurbing our addiction to oil than becoming more energy efficient. A \n2001 study by the National Academy of Sciences found that a $7 billion \ninvestment in DOE energy efficiency programs had returned $30 billion \nin benefits. That's better than 4 to 1. But the President cut \nefficiency programs by over a hundred million dollars. The \nweatherization program, which helps low-income families reduce fuel use \nand lower their energy bills, has been shown to provide well over $3 of \nbenefit for each $1 spent. But the President proposed to slash that by \nnearly 30 percent.\n  Our amendment recognizes the tremendous benefit we as a Nation \nreceive by becoming more efficient, and provides an additional $300 \nmillion for energy efficiency programs, and another $225 million for \nweatherization grants.\n  If we want to make a serious dent in our use of oil, however, we need \nto look at the transportation sector, which is responsible for two-\nthirds of our national oil consumption. While everyone seems to agree \non the need to get more flex fuel and alternative-fuel vehicles on the \nroad, and the urgency of producing cellulosic ethanol, the \nadministration simply does not make the real financial commitment. But \nthis amendment does. It provides $150 million for vehicle research \nprograms, $350 million for the clean cities program, $200 million for \nbiomass research and development and $250 million in production \nincentives for cellulosic fuels.\n  There are also provisions in this amendment to increase the \nreliability of our electricity grid, encourage the Federal Government \nto purchase alternative fuel vehicles, help improve the efficiency of \naircraft, and much more. It is a large amendment because this is a \nlarge problem. Our economy, our environment, and our national security \nare all too important to be left to the best interests of OPEC and the \ngiant oil companies. Skyrocketing gas prices have been a wake-up call \nfor everyone, but even if we succeed in providing relief for American \nconsumers, as my amendment last week would have done, we can not afford \nto go back to sleep on this issue. The American people expect us to get \nserious about our energy future, and they expect us to do it \nimmediately. If we don't act now, when do we act?\n  So even though I fully recognize the rules of the Senate and \nunderstand the nature of the debate we are having today, I do believe \nwe are in an emergent process as it relates to our energy independence, \nto our energy security, to giving consumers an opportunity for a break.\n  Therefore, I ask unanimous consent that any pending amendments be \nlaid aside to call up amendment No. 3721 and that it be considered \ngermane for the purposes of rule XXII.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent, the order for \nrecess notwithstanding, I be allowed to speak for up to 10 minutes as \nif in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n\n\n                              The Economy\n\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, last week we had numbers that came out \nwith respect to the economy. We also had testimony from the chairman of \nthe Federal Reserve Board with respect to the economy. And as recently \nas yesterday we had some stunning numbers that came out telling us what \nis happening in the economy. I would like to review those very quickly \nfor the Members of the Senate.\n\n[[Page S3864]]\n\n  This chart demonstrates that the economy remains strong. Last week's \nnumber said that economic growth in the first quarter was 4.8 percent.\n  As you can see on the chart, that is the highest number since we had \nthe spike in 2003.\n  Each one of these dark figures represent a quarter and demonstrates \nthat the economy has now grown ever since the end of the recession in \n2001. We had weak growth for the first little while and then the \neconomy has been growing very strongly ever since.\n  This a very strong and vibrant economy, as Chairman Bernanke made \nclear in his testimony to the Joint Economic Committee.\n  People want to talk about jobs. Let us look at the unemployment rate.\n  If you will notice, the shaded areas in the chart represent the last \nthree recessions. In the recession of the 1980s, unemployment got into \ndouble digits--10.8 percent is where it spiked. In the recession that \noccurred in the early 1990s, unemployment got to 7.8 percent--spiked at \nthat point. In the recession we just had, unemployment spiked at 6.3 \npercent, a relatively low level, but it has been zinging ever since, \nand it is now at 4.7 percent.\n  I have sections of my State--and I trust others have in theirs--where \nthere are more jobs than there are people, where people are looking for \njobs. The unemployment rate is going down and demonstrating the \nstrength of this economy as it generates new jobs.\n  Here is the flip side of that. This chart shows payroll jobs either \nlost or created.\n  Here, each bar represents a month. Starting in 2003, instead of \nlosing jobs, we began to gain jobs each month. And there are over 5.1 \nmillion new payroll jobs that have been created since the Senate and \nthe House passed the 2003 Tax Relief Act.\n  More Americans are working today than at any other time in our \nhistory. There are more jobs today than at any other time in our \nhistory. This is a consequence of the robust economy.\n  The next chart shows the growth of business investment. You will \nnotice there are no dates. These are quarters. The red shows quarters \nin which business investment shrank and the blue shows quarters in \nwhich business investment grew.\n  I ask as a test for people: What is the date when the bars went from \nred to blue? We didn't put them on the chart. If you were to guess that \nit was the first quarter of 2003, the time when the tax cuts took \neffect, after which the tax cuts changed the pattern for business \ninvestment, you would be correct. You can see the dramatic difference \nbetween the quarters that preceded the tax relief and the quarters that \nsucceeded it.\n  I would be the first to concede that it is not a pure cause-and-\neffect relationship. But I think the chart demonstrates that you cannot \ndiscount the fact that the tax cut had a significant beneficial effect \non the economy.\n  Business activity continues to grow.\n  This chart gets a little bit busy, but the line in the middle is the \nline between growth and shrinkage. And the two graphs, the red one is \nthe growth in services, the blue one is growth in manufacturing.\n  For those who say manufacturing is in trouble, look at the facts.\n  Again, starting in 2003, manufacturing crossed the line and became \npositive and has been positive ever since.\n  Yesterday this appeared in the Associated Press:\n\n       Manufacturing cranked up. Builders boosted construction \n     spending to an all-time high, and consumers opened their \n     wallets wider, fresh signs that the economy has snapped out \n     of its end of the year slump.\n\n  This was the message coming from the latest patch of economic reports \nreleased Monday.\n  A report from the Institute for Supply Management showed that factory \nactivity expanded with gusto in April. The group's manufacturing index \nrose to 57.3 in April; from 55.2 in March. The showing was much better \nthan the predicted reading of 55 that economists were expecting.\n  So business activity continues to grow.\n  To tick off the facts of what has happened since May of 2003 when the \ntax cuts kicked in, real gross domestic product growth has averaged 4 \npercent; over 3\\1/2\\ million new payroll jobs have been created; the \nunemployment rate has fallen to 4.7 percent; manufacturing has expanded \nfor 35 consecutive months; service industries expanded for 36 \nconsecutive months; business investment has increased for 10 \nconsecutive quarters, with growth averaging over 9 percent; inflation-\nadjusted after-tax income has grown by almost 5 percent; the Dow Jones \nIndustrial Average is up 27 percent; the NASDAQ is up 44 percent; and, \ntaxes paid on capital gains was $80 billion dollars last year, compared \nto taxes paid on capital gains in 2002 which was $49 billion.\n  We hear a lot of gloom and doom on this floor. We hear a lot of \npeople talking about how bad things are. The facts do not support that.\n  The economy is strong. The economy is going forward, and the economy \nis in a boom period and has been since the tax cuts took effect in May \nof 2003.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/02/senate-section/article/S3864-1", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3864]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to call up and \npass amendment 3626, as modified. This amendment is noncontroversial \nbut very much needed and has been cleared by both the majority and \nminority side and all leaders of the relevant committees.\n  Mr. COCHRAN.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 3626), as modified, was agreed to.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 3641, Division IV\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be set aside and amendment 3641, division IV, be called up.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COBURN. We are considering a very large supplemental spending \nbill that now stands about $10 billion larger than what the President \nhas said he will sign. I thought it would be interesting to spend a \nminute to think about what $1 billion is because we throw that number \naround so often. We need to consider that $1 billion is a difficult \nnumber to comprehend.\n  A billion seconds ago, it was 1959. A billion minutes, ago Jesus was \nalive. A billion hours ago, some would say our ancestors were living in \nthe stone age. A billion days ago, no one walked on Earth on two feet. \nA billion dollars was only 8 hours 20 minutes ago at the rate we are \nspending money in the Federal Government.\n  A billion is a hard number to get your arms around. It is an \ninteresting number and $10 billion more than what the President thinks \nwe need. More than what we actually need is a tremendous amount of \nmoney.\n\n[[Page S3865]]\n\n  The second point I make in talking about this amendment is that the \nmoney we are going to spend on this emergency supplemental bill we will \nnot ever see anywhere when we come to talk about the deficit because it \nwill not get included in the deficit reported by the Federal \nGovernment. What it will get included in is the payments your children \nand grandchildren will have to pay back 30 years from now, amortized at \n6 percent, and that $10 billion is going to come to about $50 billion \nwhen they pay it back. We are reaching forward and stealing opportunity \nfrom our kids.\n  This particular amendment deals with an item in the supplemental that \nis meant to help a very significant contractor in our defense industry. \nThey do a lot of great things for this country in terms of supplying \njobs, giving us great equipment, great ships, great tools for our men \nand women to fight with and defend this country. I understand the \ndamage that has occurred in both Pascagoula and all the shipyards along \nthe coast. We are making plans to do what is right. In the \nsupplemental, we put greater than $1.5 billion toward that.\n  There is a significant amount of loss that was incurred by Northrop \nGrumman as the hurricane came on shore and damaged both their \nfacilities and their equipment. They had significant operating losses \nfrom that. My problem with the amendment is they have insurance with \nwhich to cover this loss. No one knows exactly how much it is going to \nbe. Northrop Grumman says by their own public statements that $500 \nmillion was their business interruption cost insurance, so it could be \nupward of $500 million. It is probably somewhere between $100 and $200 \nmillion.\n  If we allow this amendment to go through, we set significant \nprecedence that we will be hard pressed to ever break.\n  First of all, this is a private contractor with insurance who is now \nsuing their insurance company for the claims they have made that will \nnot be adjudicated until 2007.\n  One of the messages we will send if we pass this supplemental with \nthis in it is we will tell the rest of the defense contractors: You do \nnot have to have business interruption insurance. Why would you have to \nif the Federal Government is going to come in and pick up the tab?\n  There is an answer that whatever is collected will come back and be \npaid to the Navy if, in fact, we intercede in the midst of this \ncontract dispute for Northrop Grumman. I hear what the contracting \noffice says, and it is a fairly important point because the contracting \nofficers and the contracting office know the right of legal loss \ndoctrine. Most of our insurance, whether it is homeowners, auto \ninsurance, or business interruption insurance, runs on the doctrine of \nlegal loss. Legal loss in insurance contracting says that if you get \npaid by someone else, we do not have to pay you.\n  This amendment is not so much about being against helping Northrop \nGrumman; it is about not helping their insurance firm which actually \nowes this money, which will be adjudicated in the future, and not \nlimiting their responsibility and not transferring that responsibility \nfrom them to our children and our grandchildren.\n  September 28, 2005--this is the Contract Management Agency for the \nDefense Department:\n\n       This office believes it would be inappropriate to allow \n     Northrop Grumman to bill for costs potentially recoverable by \n     insurance because payment by the Government may otherwise \n     relieve the carrier from their policy obligation.\n       If the Government pays the costs, or agrees that the costs \n     are even tentatively or conditionally allowable, there is a \n     risk that insurers will deny coverage on the basis that there \n     has been no loss suffered by Northrop Grumman.\n\n  In fact, that is exactly right. If we pay the loss, Northrop Grumman \ndoes not have a loss, and therefore the legal loss doctrine will apply \nto this contract, so there will not be a lawsuit. This is in \nlitigation.\n  I also make the point that Northrop Grumman, by their CEO's own \nstatements this year, said that it continues to expect sales of $31 \nbillion; earnings per share between 4.25 and 4.40; and cash from \noperations, free cashflow, between $2.3 and $2.6 billion. If this is \n$100 million or $200 million, they have all the capability in the world \nto borrow that money, pay the interest, and collect the interest \ncharges against the insurance company. We are setting a terrible \nprecedent by doing this.\n  The other thing we are going to do is send a message to every other \ndefense contractor: Don't get business interruption insurance because \nwe will come in and pick up the tab.\n  I want them to be fully remunerated. I want the shipyards to be up \nand running. I want every aspect we can deploy that will make things \nhappen, that will resecure the jobs, resecure our production of ships. \nBut I don't want to do that when Factory Mutual Insurance Company \nreally should be on the hook for this, not our children and our \ngrandchildren.\n  The other point I make is should companies that contract as defense \nsuppliers and make billions each year be put ahead of the others \nwaiting in line for help? Is it going to be our policy by this bill to \nfurther subsidize the business interruption insurance of all the rest \nof the contractors?\n  Their own litigation filed in California says:\n\n       There is no reason to allow Factory to avoid accountability \n     for its wrongful actions.\n\n  I agree. And by keeping this in the bill, we will allow Factory \nMutual to avoid accountability for its obligations.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthe Defense Contract Management Agency letter, dated September 28, \n2005. There has also been the filing of Northrop Grumman Corporation \nagainst Factory Mutual Insurance Company in the U.S. District Court for \nthe Central District of California.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  Defense Contract\n\n\n                                            Management Agency,\n\n                              Los Angeles, CA, September 28, 2005.\n     Memorandum for all Sector Administrative Contracting Officers \n         (ACOs).\n     Subject: Hurricane Guidance.\n       Until all avenues for recovery from insurance carriers are \n     exhausted by the contractor it is recommended that \n     Contracting Officers not approve payments for costs \n     associated with or related to the hurricane disaster(s) if \n     such costs are potentially recoverable through insurance by \n     the contractor.\n       This office believes that it would be inappropriate to \n     allow Northrop Grumman to bill for costs potentially \n     recoverable by insurance because payment by the Government \n     may otherwise relieve the carrier from their policy \n     obligation.\n       If the Government pays the costs, or agrees that the costs \n     are even tentatively or conditionally allowable, there is a \n     risk that insurers will deny coverage on the basis that there \n     has been no loss suffered by Northrop Grumman. It is my \n     recommendation that insurance policy(s) be reviewed. \n     Additionally it would be prudent to reach an agreement with \n     Northrop and the insurer before making payments for any \n     otherwise allowable costs.\n       This matter is under continuing review and additional \n     information will be forwarded as appropriate.\n       Please forward this correspondence to subordinate sector \n     ACOs. Questions should be addressed to me.\n                                               Donald P. Springer,\n                                      Defense Corporate Executive.\n\n  Mr. COBURN. I also note that Northrop Grumman is the fourth largest \ndefense contractor we have in the country. I also note that Northrop is \nalready the recipient of billions of dollars in Government contracts, \nincluding some contracts that otherwise could be considered largess. I \nwill not go into that.\n  I would make a final note that the House Appropriations Committee, \nwhen they passed their bill, put this into the Record:\n\n       The Committee believes strongly that funds in this Act and \n     under this heading in prior Acts should not be used to \n     substitute for private insurance benefits. The Committee is \n     aware that some shipyards have business interruption \n     insurance coverage that could potentially overlap with the \n     Navy's budget for increased delay and disruption costs.\n\n  I understand the Navy. We have an obligation for delay and disruption \ncosts. There is no question about that.\n\n       On March 1, 2006, the Committee received the Navy's \n     certification that there is no overlap between shipyard \n     insurance claims and the Navy's funding plan, and that costs \n     covered by private insurers were not included in supplemental \n     request estimates. Once again in this bill, the Committee \n     directs the Navy not to obligate funds under this heading \n     until the Secretary of the Navy certifies that no such funds \n     will be used for activities or costs that are subject to \n     reimbursement by any third party, including a private \n     insurer.\n\n\n[[Page S3866]]\n\n\n  The final point I would make is the President's message to Congress \non why he would be against us funding this. He made some significant \npoints, and I will summarize them. One is they do not think this is \nnecessary. No. 2, it violates clear contracting guidelines. And, No. 3, \nit sets a terrible precedent for the future, not just on our coast but \nfor any other defense contractor that might have a loss based on a \nnatural catastrophe, that we would now have a precedent that we would \nsupply that.\n  The American people want to help solve the problems on the gulf \ncoast. We want to create a vigorous business environment. We want to \ncreate a vigorous defense industry. This is a step too far. I believe \nwe need to back up and let the private sector take care of its \nobligations, as it should, to help us meet our obligations and then \nmove forward.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I am sympathetic to the Senator's \nconcerns, that he expressed. As I understand the point he makes, it is \nthat we should not create a situation where a shipbuilder can both get \ndisaster funds from the Federal Government and insurance benefits from \nhurricane coverage and, thereby, be unjustly enriched by getting money \nfrom two different sources for one disaster.\n  The language of the general provision, which the Senator purports to \namend with this amendment, prevents a shipbuilder from getting double \npayment, in effect. The Senator's amendment strikes the provision and \nthe language in the provision which guarantees that.\n  I think there is no disagreement between us as to what the outcome \nought to be. What we are trying to do is reduce costs to the U.S. Navy \nand, thereby, to the U.S. taxpayers for future shipbuilding activity by \nreimbursing the shipbuilder for damages caused by the hurricane, purely \nand simply. There is no effort to prevent the shipbuilder from \nrecovering what it is entitled to recover from the insurance companies \nthat had coverage in this situation.\n  But the fact is, you could not get insurance coverage for all of the \ndamages done by the hurricane, only some. The policy defines the \nobligation. The contract, in effect, between the shipbuilder and the \ninsurance company defines what benefits the shipbuilders are entitled \nto receive. And these contracts are being honored, some maybe not as \ngenerously as the shipbuilder would like. But that is something to be \nreserved between the shipbuilder and the insurance carrier. And if \nlitigation develops and is resorted to as a way to resolve that, so be \nit; that happens.\n  But what we are seeking to do is to acknowledge that the shipbuilder \nwas impeded by the hurricane from proceeding under contracts that it \nhad with the Navy to hire and make available workers on a reliable, \npredictable schedule that would ensure the ships' future construction \non time under the contract.\n  Some of those costs cannot get reimbursed from the insurance company. \nThere are provisions in the insurance agreements that prohibit the \ncollection of benefits for some of those costs that were caused \ndirectly by the hurricane.\n  So what we have attempted to do is to work with the Navy, consult \nwith the shipbuilder, and try to provide authority in this supplemental \nbill to help control costs of ships, now and in the future, with a \npossibility of insurance proceeds offsetting Government costs. Or we \ncan exclude this provision, as the Senator is trying to do, and pay the \nresulting higher costs through higher taxes, more appropriations to \nhelp pay the costs to the Navy to pay for the ships.\n  To me, I think this amendment reflects a difference in understanding \nof what the language of the supplemental seeks to accomplish. We do not \ndisagree with the motivation of the Senator from Oklahoma. We applaud \nhis effort to review carefully and make sure we are not ``wasting'' \nmoney in this supplemental, that the taxpayer is benefiting, not a \nshipbuilder being unjustly or inappropriately enriched. I guarantee you \nthat is not the purpose of the assistance that is provided in this \nsection of the bill, this general provision of the bill.\n  Here is what it seeks to do. And we think it does do this: The \ngeneral provision adjusts ship contract target costs for the effects of \nHurricane Katrina. It provides the U.S. Navy with reimbursement of \nfuture shipbuilder insurance receipts. And it makes clear that payments \nmade by the Government to the shipbuilder could not be treated as \ncollateral insurance coverage and could not be used as a reason for \ninsurers not to honor their policy obligations.\n\n  That is the purpose of the general provision. I challenge anybody to \ndisagree with that purpose as laudable, as important, and as fair to \nthe taxpayers, to the shipbuilder, and to the insurance companies that \nhave coverage.\n  This provision was included because it is clear that the impact for \ndelaying the recapitalization of the shipyards will have long-term \nnegative impacts to the Navy's shipbuilding program by making ships \nmore expensive and taking longer to build.\n  We can provide this authority now to help control the costs of ships, \nand with the possibility of insurance proceeds offsetting Government \ncosts, or we can exclude this provision and pay for the resulting \nhigher costs of ships.\n  And note this. The estimated cost of this provision is $140 million, \nto be paid from within the $2.7 billion the President requested in the \nshipbuilding account. Hear that? The President requested $2.7 billion \nin his submission in this request. And a 3- to 6-month shipyard \nrecapitalization delay is estimated to cost $300 to $600 million in \nincreased ship costs.\n  This is serious business. You can pay me now or pay me later. I guess \nthat is the way to say it. But the whole point is, we can appropriate \nthis money in this supplemental that the President requested. We have \nidentified the part that is going to be used to pay the costs of this \namendment.\n  So in response to Hurricane Katrina and the disaster that resulted to \nthe region, the President requested over $2\\1/2\\ billion--$1 billion in \nthis supplemental and $1.7 billion in the last supplemental--in the \nShipbuilding and Conversion Navy account to address these ordinary \ncosts to replace destroyed or damaged equipment, prepare and recover \nnaval vessels under contract, and, most relevant to this debate, \nprovide for cost adjustments for naval vessels for which funds have \nbeen previously appropriated.\n  So what happened is the President's request did not address or take \ninto account all costs associated with Katrina. So a general provision \nwas added to adjust an existing Navy ship contract's target costs for \nthe effects of Hurricane Katrina. It ensures the industry does not \nreceive redundant funding from the Government and insurance companies. \nBut--guess what--the amendment offered by the Senator, my friend, \ndeletes this provision. That should not be done.\n  The focus of this supplemental is to provide disaster relief and \nrecovery for hurricanes, including Katrina. Katrina caused the costs of \nships that were already under contract with the Navy to increase. \nIncreased costs were occurring because of the disaster.\n  The provision included in the bill does not impose additional costs. \nInstead, it directs that all costs be paid from within the $2.7 billion \nshipbuilding account requested by the President to address the \nhurricane recovery costs.\n  In my view, the Senate needs to reject the amendment of the Senator. \nLet's carry forward in this bill this general provision.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, let me address a question to the \ndistinguished chairman of the committee because I thought his remarks \nwere very well done and answered a number of questions that have been \nput out in the discussion of this language in the media. But I think it \nis important to clarify a few of those points.\n  The first point you are making is that this is not an additional or \nadded expenditure. This will come out of the $2.7 billion that has \nalready been requested to go into this shipbuilding recovery effort; is \nthat correct?\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield, he is \nabsolutely correct. There is, in this general provision, a reference to \nthe $2.7 billion that is contained in the President's request\n\n[[Page S3867]]\n\nsubmitted to the Congress, a request that we appropriate that amount. \nHe is right. We are not creating new funding in this provision but \ntrying to spell out what that funding should be used for.\n  Mr. LOTT. Well, Mr. President, I thank the chairman for that \nclarification and for making that point. I might also ask this \nquestion: The Senator was a very capable young lawyer in our State \nyears ago, president of the young lawyer's section, and I think he \nunderstands this sort of issue. Are you satisfied that this language is \nsuch that when and if there is an insurance recovery, those funds will \ncome back to the Federal Government?\n  Mr. COCHRAN. The Senator is correct. It will not result in a double \npayment, in effect, to the shipbuilder, of course. And any insurance \nproceeds that offset the Government's costs are excluded specifically \nfrom this provision.\n  Mr. LOTT. One final point that the Senator made that I think is a \nvery important one. If we do not allow this provision to remain in this \nlegislation, the net cost is going to be twice as much or more.\n  I believe the questions that have been posed have been answered \ncorrectly and appropriately by the chairman of the committee. This \nprovision does not require additional funds. Payments will come out of \nfunds that have already been earmarked for shipbuilding recovery. It is \nnot going be a process where the shipbuilder will be relieved of trying \nto recover from the insurance company and, if they recover, they get to \nkeep it. It is important to emphasize those points.\n  Let me confess to my colleagues, this is personal with me. I admit \nit. This is my hometown. I grew up in the shadow of this shipyard where \n13,000 men and women make their livelihood, the biggest single employer \nin the States of Mississippi and Louisiana and at one point of \nAlabamians, a critical component of our national security. They build \nsome of the most sophisticated ships in the world--destroyers, \ncruisers, LHAs, LHDs, LHARs. And that shipyard got hammered by \nhurricane Katrina. My dad was a pipefitter in that shipyard and was in \nthe pipe department when he was killed in an automobile accident. I \ndon't just see statistics and numbers; I see neighbors, classmates, men \nand women who believe in what they do and build quality product. They \nhave been hit a grievous blow.\n  I understand the effort of the Senator from Oklahoma. On many similar \noccasions, if I didn't know all the facts or if I weren't as intimately \ninvolved, maybe I would be doing something similar to what he is. I \nunderstand. But I don't think he has all the facts. Maybe the \nclarification that my colleague from Mississippi made will help him.\n  The magnitude of what we were hit with is the most devastating thing \nwe have ever seen. I won't bring out a lot of charts, but so you will \nget some idea of the destruction, here is a picture of the shipyard \nright after the hurricane. This whole shipyard had a direct hit. It is \nright on the mouth of the river. It got hammered. Five hundred men and \nwomen put their lives at risk that night trying to keep ships that were \nmoored there from sinking. This is what we were dealt. Everything in \nthat shipyard was under water. And by the way, just so you will get \nsome idea, there in the background of this picture, those cranes are \nactually on the water. This photo was actually taken a distance inland, \nand you see the kind of destruction that was brought on us.\n  One of the things we did in the aftermath of the hurricane was to \nsay: OK, let's rescue people. Let's get them the basics. Then we sat \ndown and said: What is the order of what we ought to do? No. 1, we need \nto get our people back to work first. Because if we can get them back \nin their jobs, even if they don't have a home or a truck, that will \nbegin the return to normalcy. They will have income. Then let's get our \nschools open. Then let's remove the debris. So we had an order. We have \nnot done this haphazardly.\n  This provision was not stuck in the bill as an afterthought. It was \ncarefully done. It was done after looking to see what the actual impact \nwas going to be.\n  Several shipyards in my area--three of them, as a matter of fact--\nowned by VT Halter had ``only'' 20 or 30 feet of water. But this \nshipyard was completely shut down. They made a valiant effort to feed \npeople, get people back to work. Now the shipyard is back up to \nprobably 11,000 people working there.\n  Talk about getting insurance. Let me put the shipyard in my place. My \nwife and I lost our home. It is totally gone. I had flood insurance. I \nalso had a household policy. My insurance company said: You had no wind \ndamage. We will pay you nothing. After that house sat there for 4 to 6 \nhours being hammered by winds of 140 miles an hour with gusts at 160 \nand 170, they came back and said: No, you didn't have any wind damage. \nIt is not credible. So what am I going to do? I guess I could hock \neverything and rebuild on that site before I get any insurance, but the \n``no payment'' or the ``slow payment'' of insurance companies is \nretarding the entire gulf coast. They are like me; I can't rebuild \nuntil I get some insurance proceeds.\n  They have the problem of how much can they put into this situation \nwithout getting the plant back up to operation. They have spent $550 \nmillion to clean up this shipyard, repair the facilities, repair the \nships, and cover the cost of business interruption not caused by them. \nThey have done their part. In fact, of that $550 million, less than \none-third, about $175 million, has been recouped so far from the \nshipyard's insurance companies. They are going to continue to pursue \nthese insurance claims. I hope they are going to get a good settlement \nand they will be able to go forward with business.\n  But this shipyard had a billion dollars of damage. This matter is \nabout national security. It is about the Navy. It is about the world's \nbest ships. It is about men and women who have busted it to get that \nshipyard back on line.\n  The same thing has happened in Louisiana, where a lot of work is done \non the LPDs and where they went back to work before they had a bed to \nsleep in. So this provision is the right thing to do for Gulf Coast \nrecovery and to help the Navy maintain the cost and schedules for its \nships.\n  Let me give you a couple of examples of quotes after the hurricane. \nAfter the hurricane, Assistant Secretary of the Navy John Young \nrecognized the significant impact of that storm on Navy shipyard \nbuilding and national defense. In a letter to Navy and Defense \nDepartment leadership, Secretary Young wrote that:\n\n       The Navy [should] take an aggressive and proactive approach \n     in helping restore shipyards and returning workers to \n     shipbuilding tasks. Importantly, this approach has the short-\n     term benefit of contributing in a significant way to the \n     restoration of jobs and the economy in the Gulf Coast.\n       Yard restoration delays, loss of the skilled workforce, and \n     ship delivery delays will translate directly into creation in \n     future years of significant new prior year completion bills \n     on Navy shipbuilding programs.\n\n  That was very thoughtful. He was looking at it realistically in the \nimmediate aftermath of this terrible storm. He recommended an action \nthat was appropriate.\n  Some people say it wasn't in the President's budget. Presidents' \nbudgets don't come down from heaven. They sometimes don't include \neverything that should be included or maybe it will include something \nthat should not be included. We are a coequal branch of government. We \ndo have a say in these issues. Sometimes we can help. When it came to \ngetting Medicaid for the States affected, we had to take the lead. When \nit came to getting tax incentives for businesses and industry to create \nnew jobs, we took the lead. When it came to finding a solution for the \npeople who had a home that was not in a flood plain--after the \nhurricane all they had left was a slab, no insurance, no way to \nrebuild, and nobody had a solution--Senator Cochran came up with a \nsolution and the administration signed it. They didn't do it; we did it \nin the Congress. We are from there. We are of this situation. We \nunderstand the problems.\n  We are trying to be reasonable. We told our colleagues months ago \nabout what we would need to recover. We have not exceeded that \nestimate. We are way under that estimate. In some categories we are not \neven going back and saying we need more, even though we were somewhat \nshortchanged. We are trying hard to help the people who have been dealt \na grievous blow. If we don't do this, the people in that shipyard will \nbe hurt, the Navy will be\n\n[[Page S3868]]\n\nhurt, and it will cost us more. I want to make sure we get the \ninsurance recovery.\n  I am a plaintiff for the first time in my life. I didn't want to do \nthat. When I met with shipyard officials immediately after the \nhurricane, I went out there, and they were feeding the people on a ship \nthat was moored. There was no electricity. I said: What about \ninsurance? They said: We are fortunate. We had insurance. We even had a \nclause in there so we feel we are going to get a good recovery.\n  Well, it hasn't happened. So we can deal with this realistically and \nin a sensible and thoughtful way, the way Senator Cochran has outlined, \nand I think we will get through it. We will keep the jobs, build the \nships, help the Navy, help the workers. And we won't lose money in the \nend. The disruption cost, if we don't do this, will be much greater \nthan by going ahead and doing this right now.\n  I beg my colleagues, bear with us. I know you are beginning to say: \nHow much is enough? I don't know in every instance, because we are \nstill dealing with the magnitude of this disaster. But we are going to \ntry to be honest with you. We are going to try to be thoughtful. I \nbelieve this language is crafted well. I am proud to be a part of the \neffort to defend the language that is in this legislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I want to raise a few points. First, I \nhave great respect for the Senators from Mississippi and Louisiana. If \nthey will note, my votes have reflected that, when we have sent money \nfor both. The President did request $2.5 billion, $2.7 billion for \nthis. But he also requested that we not do this specific thing, that we \nnot do this. The Senator from Mississippi makes a point they have \nalready collected $125 million--actually they told us $125 million, \nmaybe it is more--from insurance. They did have a big loss.\n  We had a hurricane down there and everybody will agree, because of \nthe hurricane, the ships are going to cost more, no matter what we do. \nThey are going to cost more because they were delayed. We know that in \ndefense contracting. Is it in Northrop Grumman's interest to \nrecapitalize this shipyard? Yes. There is no question about it. Do they \nhave a positive cashflow of $2.6 billion this year? Yes. The reason we \nshould not do this is because there will be no money coming from the \ninsurance industry. Under the legal loss doctrine, we will obviate all \nthose policies. So by doing this, it is true, any money that comes \ncomes back to the Navy. I agree, that is in here. But the fact is, \nthere will be no money coming back because they will have and utilize \nin their insurance contracts the legal loss doctrine. That doctrine \nwill obviate any obligation, any liability these insurance companies \nhave to do it. So the question is, should our kids pay for it, our \ngrandkids pay for it, or is it in Northrop Grumman's best interest to \nput the business interruption insurance, which is in litigation, to \nborrow that money or take it out of earnings from cashflow from \noperations right now and then collect the interest on it? Instead, we \nare going to send it on down the pike 30 years to be paid back, and \n$125 or $200 million will become $800 million or $1 billion after 30 \nyears.\n  I would also read into the record part (a), section 2303, ``Amounts \nappropriated or otherwise made available by this Act.'' Going on down, \n``under the heading `Shipbuilding and Conversion, Navy' may be \nobligated and expended to pay the costs of any business disruption \nincurred by a ship construction contractor with respect to facilities \nor businesses located in the Hurricane Katrina Disaster area by reason \nof Hurricane Katrina.''\n  We do get all four of them, all four segments intentionally, because \nif we don't, then we pay. The insurance industry won't pay. Anything \nthat isn't settled at the time this goes through will not be paid for \nby the insurance industry. So if you want to go out and make some money \ntoday, go buy Factory Mutual insurance. Because if this goes through \nand is a part of it, they made $150 million today with this thing going \nthrough. They are not going to pay, and they are going to be upheld in \na court of law.\n  This is an established doctrine of law. And if it is already paid for \nby the U.S. taxpayers' grandchildren, then Factory Mutual is not going \nto have to pay for it.\n  I understand the intent. I believe the Senators from Mississippi are \ndoing what they think is right. I think this is just a step too far \nthat doesn't have to be done to truly get going. There are 11,062 \nemployees in Mississippi right now working for Northrop Grumman. They \nhave employees in 38 States. They are a great company and a vital \ncontractor. But I would make the case that the cost of ships has gone \nup because we had the hurricane. And it is noble to try to limit that \nincrease. This won't limit the increase; this will just increase the \ncost to our grandchildren.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I rise to support the chairman's mark on \nthis very important issue relative to the rebuilding of the gulf coast. \nChairman Cochran has taken great responsibility to shape a supplemental \nbill that asks for what is absolutely crucial to the development of the \ngulf coast. I know that a few of our colleagues may take issue with one \nor more things that are in this bill. But overall, it is a genuine \nattempt to try to give direct and targeted help to the standing up of \nthis very important area of the United States that has been hit, as we \nsaid, not by one hurricane but two hurricanes, two of the worst that \nhave ever hit the continental United States since 1837, since \nhurricanes have been recorded, and by the extraordinary flooding that \ntook place in a large metropolitan area, not just Orleans Parish, but \nPlaquemines Parish and St. Bernard Parish, the heart of America's \nenergy coast and the heart of the economic region about which we are \nspeaking.\n\n  Inside this region that has been devastated there are over 16,000 \npeople employed in shipbuilding. We are proud of those shipyards at \nIngalls, Gulfport, and Avondale. Fortunately, the Avondale shipyard, \nwhich is in New Orleans, did not sustain tremendous flooding because it \nwas on the west bank of the city and, of course, the east bank is the \npart that flooded. We are very fortunate in that regard. There was \nstill a tremendous amount of damage at Avondale.\n  As my friends from Mississippi said, their shipyard was just \nhammered. We are so grateful that Avondale stood up because we have \nbeen able to help keep the ships on schedule and get our people \nemployed.\n  The Senator who is objecting, Mr. Coburn, has been so helpful in \nother ways. I know he wants to make sure we are not double-dipping. He \nkeeps referring to the first paragraph of this amendment, but if you \nread the second paragraph of the chairman's mark, it is clear. It says: \nThis may not be treated as collateral insurance coverage, so they \ncannot collect twice.\n  It is not the chairman's intention or my intention or Senator Lott's \nintention for the company to collect twice. But advancing these \npayments to them in the way this has been drafted will help them get \nthese yards back up and running, to get their construction done, and to \nget people hired again. It is very difficult.\n  We keep saying--and I know people are tired of hearing this--this was \nnot a regular hurricane. It has destroyed so much that not only do \nemployers, large and small, have to get their businesses back going, \nthey have to go out and literally find their customers. Then they have \nto provide housing for their workers. Then they have to get electricity \nturned on for their workers, then they have to get running water turned \non for their workers. It is more than our employers can bear, even the \nbig ones such as Northrop Grumman.\n  We are not asking for a taxpayer bailout. We are not asking for \ndouble-dipping. The Navy knows what we are doing, and they are \nsupportive. The Department of Defense is supportive.\n  I came to the floor to ask my colleagues to please support the \nchairman's marks on this to help our shipbuilding. We are not asking \nfor double-dipping. When the insurance moneys come in, which I am sure \nthey are entitled to do, this language allows the taxpayers to be \nrepaid. So we get the benefit of getting our shipyards up and running, \ngetting potentially 17,000-plus\n\n[[Page S3869]]\n\npeople between Avondale and Ingalls back at work as quickly as we can. \nEven with this, it is going to be very difficult. Without it, it will \nbe almost impossible.\n  So I ask my colleagues to please reject the Coburn amendment. I know \nthe Senator means well, and he has been extremely helpful and sincere \nin many ways as he has attempted to help us, and we don't want to waste \nany money. But this language makes it clear, not just paragraph A that \nhas been read, but by paragraph B, that it is not double-dipping.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coleman). Is there further debate?\n  Mr. COBURN. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to division IV of amendment No. 3641. The \nclerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from West Virginia (Mr. \nRockefeller) is necessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \ndesiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 48, nays 51, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 105 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--48\n\n     Alexander\n     Bayh\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Burr\n     Byrd\n     Cantwell\n     Carper\n     Chafee\n     Coburn\n     Conrad\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     DeMint\n     DeWine\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Feingold\n     Frist\n     Graham\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Hatch\n     Inhofe\n     Kohl\n     Kyl\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lugar\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Obama\n     Reed\n     Santorum\n     Stabenow\n     Sununu\n     Thomas\n     Thune\n     Voinovich\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--51\n\n     Akaka\n     Allard\n     Allen\n     Baucus\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Brownback\n     Chambliss\n     Clinton\n     Cochran\n     Coleman\n     Collins\n     Cornyn\n     Dayton\n     Dole\n     Domenici\n     Feinstein\n     Harkin\n     Hutchison\n     Inouye\n     Isakson\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerry\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Lincoln\n     Lott\n     Martinez\n     Menendez\n     Mikulski\n     Murkowski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Pryor\n     Reid\n     Roberts\n     Salazar\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Talent\n     Vitter\n     Warner\n\n                             NOT VOTING--1\n\n       \n     Rockefeller\n       \n  Division IV of amendment No. 3641 was rejected.\n  Mr. COCHRAN.

It was my \nintention to vote ``yea.'' Therefore, I ask unanimous consent I be \npermitted to change my vote since it will not change the outcome.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The foregoing tally has been changed to reflect the above order.)\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I will take this opportunity to review \nfor a moment that this is an anniversary date of some significance \nwhich I believe ought to be recognized. It is 3 years ago this week \nthat President Bush stood on the deck of the USS Lincoln in front of a \nbanner that declared that our mission in Iraq had been accomplished. He \ntold our troops and all Americans that major combat operations in Iraq \nhave ended 3 years ago this week. At the time, we had lost 139 people, \n139 troops in Iraq. Today, we have lost more than 2,400 American troops \nthere, and 2,258 have died since ``Mission Accomplished'' was \npronounced. In other words, 95 percent of the United States fatalities \nin Iraq occurred after President Bush said major combat was over, and \ntens of thousands of young Americans have suffered injuries, including \nsevere head injuries and lost limbs, that will change their lives and \nthe lives of their families forever.\n  One need only visit Walter Reed Hospital and see what the ravages of \nwar have done to so many. The only thing that was accomplished that day \nwas a photo opportunity for the President's reelection campaign. When \nwe look back at that publicity stunt on that aircraft carrier, we \nrealize how wrong the President was. But that was hardly the only major \nconduct error in the judgment of this war.\n  Recently, a number of retired generals have come forward to say what \nmany in the military have been thinking for years. These officers know \nthat our men and women in uniform have been let down by the \nmiscalculations and the incompetence of the Bush administration. The \ntroops on the battlefield pay with their lives, but nobody in the \nadministration has been held accountable.\n  The generals say we can't move forward without accountability. They \nsay that the Secretary of Defense must go. The generals are right. \nSecretary Rumsfeld has made too many mistakes to stay in that job. As \nthe old expression says, when you are in a hole, stop digging.\n  Let's recount the miscalculations of the Secretary of Defense. Before \nthe war, he said, ``We know where the weapons of mass destruction are. \nThey are in the area around Tikrit and Bagdhad, and east, west, south \nand north, somewhat.''\n  But now we know there was no solid evidence before the war that Iraq \nhad any WMDs. None were found when the United States invaded the \ncountry in March, and none have been found since. That was over 3 years \nago.\n  Secretary Rumsfeld also said that the Iraqis would welcome U.S. \ntroops and that the Iraqi resistance would be limited. Obviously way \noff. Not only did Secretary Rumsfeld fail to build coalitions with our \nallies, he flippantly, arrogantly dismissed them as ``old Europe,'' \nalienating these allies when he should have been reaching out to them. \nThe result of a failure to build a real coalition is that our troops \nare bearing the risks and suffering the casualties.\n  There were other serious miscalculations. Secretary Rumsfeld said the \nwar would be short. On February 7, 2003, he said:\n\n       The war could last 6 days, 6 weeks, I doubt 6 months.\n\n  Secretary Rumsfeld also rejected calls for a larger number of troops. \nHe even pushed out GEN Eric Shinseki, the Army Chief of Staff, when \nGeneral Shinseki, a distinguished leader, a military leader, suggested \nthat postwar Iraq would require many more forces than the 100,000 \ntroops we had on the ground. As I remember, he said over 300,000.\n  Secretary Rumsfeld was also way off on the cost of the war. He said \nit would cost at least $10 billion but no more than $100 billion. We \nnow see the actual costs coming close to $500 billion.\n  Despite all of the funds devoted to the war, Secretary Rumsfeld has \nfailed to equip our troops properly. After more than 3 years, thousands \nof Army and Marine Corps personnel still do not have adequate body \narmor or sufficient armor for their humvees. When I was there over 3 \nyears ago, I heard the plea then from soldiers from New Jersey: Give us \nthe flak vest, Senator, that you are wearing, the latest technology. \nThey will protect us. Please let us have that.\n  We know what happened with the humvees and the resulting serious \ninjuries because of inadequate armor for the humvees.\n  In December 2004, in a meeting with U.S. troops in Kuwait, some \nsoldiers raised these concerns with Secretary Rumsfeld. His response \nwas offensive; humiliating for our troops who are serving there. He \nsaid, ``As you know, you go to war with the Army you have, not the Army \nyou might want or wish to have at a later time.''\n  I don't know what was meant by that statement but it certainly is a \nslur in many ways.\n  I must say that what I find incredibly offensive is this \nadministration still will not allow photographs of flag-draped coffins \nwhen they return to our shore and come into Dover, DE, which is the \nrepository for the remains. It is such an honor to recognize the \nsacrifice made by having a flag draped over the coffin. Yet that honor \nof our fallen troops is shielded from the American people by the order \nof the President of the United States.\n\n[[Page S3870]]\n\n  It doesn't make sense to me, and I know it doesn't make sense to \nthose families.\n  It isn't just civilians upset by these events. We have now heard \neight retired generals call for Secretary Rumsfeld's resignation, \nciting gross mismanagement and profound errors in judgment.\n  Retired Army MG Paul Eaton, in charge of training the Iraqi military \nfrom 2003 to 2004, recently wrote in the New York Times that Rumsfeld \n``has shown himself incompetent strategically, operationally and \ntactically . . . Mr. Rumsfeld must step down.''\n  Retired Marine GEN Anthony Zinni, an outstanding leader, former head \nof the U.S. Central Command, which includes the Middle East, last month \ncalled for Mr. Rumsfeld to resign.\n  Other military leaders who have called for Secretary Rumsfeld to go \ninclude retired Marine LTG Gregory Newbold; retired Army MG John Riggs; \nretired Marine GEN Paul Van Riper; retired Army MG John Batiste; \nretired Army MG Charles Swannack, former Commander of the 82nd Airborne \nin Iraq; and retired U.S. Army GEN Wesley Clark.\n  In addition, we are now seeing people of lower ranks who are upset \nwith the way that campaign has gone and are expressing their \ndissatisfaction.\n  We see also a phenomenon we haven't seen before; that is, people \nfilling out their obligatory term at the Academy and a third of whom do \nnot stay on. They finish their obligatory terms of 5 years and they are \ngone. It is a serious problem in many ways. Morally, I think it is a \nserious problem, but also functionally we don't have the personnel \nsupporting the war in the way we had hoped. Whole branches of services \nover there are as courageous as can be. It is very dangerous territory, \nand they serve bravely. We owe them a debt of gratitude.\n  The fact is the Bush administration has made serious mistakes in \nprosecuting the war in Iraq, and our soldiers have paid the price. Our \ntroops deserve better.\n  On the third anniversary of President Bush's ``Mission Accomplished'' \nfiasco, I hope that the President finds the strength to make real \nchanges. And those changes need to start at the top.\n  I urge the President to be more specific about what our assignment \nis. He has already said it will be up to another President to take care \nof what continues there. Unfortunately, we have to believe that.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as if \nin morning business for 5 to 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                              War in Iraq\n\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. Mr. President, war is difficult. War is not pretty. \nSometimes war, unfortunately, leads to death and injury.\n  Our country has been blessed over our history. There have been men \nand women who believe enough in our system, who believe enough in the \nsystem of democracy that we are so fortunate and blessed to have, who \nare willing to give their lives so this system may endure, so this \nsystem may continue, so that our country can continue to be free.\n  I believe, as we look at a difficult situation in Iraq, the last \nthing we need is a policy of defeatism, is a policy that looks to ways \nin which we can criticize and critique without offering an alternative \npath and without offering an alternative solution.\n  The fact is there was a worldwide failure of intelligence in the days \nleading up to the war in Iraq, but the fact also is that we are there \ntoday and that thousands of Americans--the best and the brightest, \nthose we are the proudest of--are there serving this Nation with \ndistinction, with valor, and I daresay with great success. Our hope for \nthem must be that they complete their mission and come home; that they \ncan come home with their heads held high for a job well done.\n  I also believe that the civilian concept of leadership of our \nmilitary is well ingrained in our system. I had the high and distinct \nhonor and privilege of serving in the Cabinet of this President with \nSecretary Rumsfeld. Secretary Rumsfeld is a man of great distinction. \nHe is also someone who has tackled the very difficult job of \ntransforming our Armed Forces. He has taken on the very difficult job \nof moving forward into a post-cold war sort of world with an Armed \nForces that is very different than the one we have had. Any time a \nlarge bureaucracy undergoes change, there is difficulty with that \nchange. And sometimes there are different opinions about how that \nchange takes place. And there is no doubt that there are people who \nhave had different ideas about how to approach, whether it is a war \neffort, whether it is a reorganization of our Armed Forces from those \nof Secretary Rumsfeld, but to those who have had those kind of \ndifficult ideas I would say that we elect only one President at a time, \nand that President has only one Secretary of Defense at a time. That is \nwhy we have a chain of command because someone has to lead and someone \nhas to make decisions.\n\n  I believe our country, at a time when we were unfairly and unwantonly \nattacked by terrorists, has been fortunate to have a President at hand \nwho has had the good fortune to have dedicated people such as Secretary \nRumsfeld at the helm to serve at his side.\n  This is a President who did not seek a war with terrorists but who \nhad a war brought to us in the streets of New York, with over 3,000 \nAmerican casualties on a given day. And the fact is that this President \nwas also confronted with the need to act on this global war on terror.\n  I can remember when in the mountains of Afghanistan there seemed to \nbe a stalemate after about a month or 2 of our initial conflict there, \nand the naysayers were saying we had not sent enough troops. All of a \nsudden, a tremendous breakthrough in modern warfare took place as we \nsaw our special forces operating on the backs of horses with laptop \ncomputers directing fire, and a whole new era of warfare evolved. But \nwe liberated the people of Afghanistan, who since then have had \nelections, where women and children of all sexes can now go to school, \nwhere women can now walk the streets without fear, where children can \ngo to school, whether they be little boys or little girls. They have \nhad that unique opportunity in the world which we take for granted in \nour country.\n  But for those of us who were born in other places, we understand the \nuniqueness of voting and have had the right and opportunity to elect \nleaders.\n  More recently, 11 million Iraqis voted in the third election in 1 \nyear, followed by the formation after some politicking and some good, \nold-fashioned Democratic horse trading, have formed a government.\n  The moment today ought to be to highlight the hope of a new Iraq, the \nhope of a democracy in the Middle East, which is so unique to that \nregion of the world, the fact that a new government has been formed--\nnot to try to recount all of the potential for different moves at any \ngiven point.\n  All warfare is riddled with difficulties and second-guessing. But \nhere we have a moment of hope and opportunity. Defeatism is not a \npolicy. It is only a prescription for failure.\n  I am hopeful that as we go forward, we recognize the successes of the \nIraqi people and the difficult task of forming a democracy; that we \nrelish in the accomplishments; that we understand it is an incomplete \nproject in democracy but one moving in the right direction.\n  I, for one, thank all of those who are serving in these difficult \ncircumstances over there and their families for the sacrifices they are \nmaking so that we might be successful, so that we might find a way \nforward that is better than defeat and is better than negativism and \nthat is better than second-guessing.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3727\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 3727.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to setting aside the \npending amendment? Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Mississippi [Mr. Lott], for himself and \n     Mr. Dodd, proposes an amendment numbered 3727.\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n[[Page S3871]]\n\n(Purpose: To provide funding for the Election Assistance Commission to \nmake discretionary payments to States affected by Hurricane Katrina and \n                other hurricanes during the 2005 season)\n\n       On page 203, strike line 8 and insert the following:\n\n                          INDEPENDENT AGENCIES\n\n                     Election Assistance Commission\n\n\n                          Election Assistance\n\n       For purposes of making discretionary payments to States \n     affected by Hurricane Katrina and other hurricanes during the \n     2005 season to restore and replace supplies, materials, \n     records, equipment, and technology used in the administration \n     of Federal elections and to ensure the full participation of \n     individuals displaced by such hurricanes, $30,000,000: \n     Provided, That any such funds shall be used in a manner that \n     is consistent with title III of the Help America Vote Act of \n     2002: Provided further, That the amount provided under this \n     heading is designated as an emergency requirement pursuant to \n     section 402 of H. Con. Res. 95 (109th Congress), the \n     concurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal year 2006.\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I understand that this amendment has been \ncleared on both sides. I am pleased to join Senator Dodd, who is a \ncosponsor of this amendment.\n  Speaking of elections in Iraq, we also hope to have effective and \nfair and open elections in America.\n  In the Katrina area, we had significant damage to polling places and \nto voting machines. We lost all of them in many areas--in New Orleans, \nSouth Louisiana, and Mississippi.\n  This amendment would provide $30 million, through the Federal \nElections Commission, for replacement of those losses.\n  I have checked on both sides of the aisle. I find no objection. I \nknow that our managers have cleared it.\n  I, therefore, urge my colleagues to accept it. The amendment is \ncertainly very worthwhile. It is needed, and it is needed right away in \norder to prepare for elections this fall.\n  I yield the floor so my colleague, Senator Dodd, can further \nelucidate.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I thank my colleague, and I thank the \nchairman and ranking member for their acceptance of this amendment.\n  I point out to my colleagues that I was looking over some of the data \ninvolving the need for this appropriation.\n  In Louisiana, four of the most heavily impacted parishes, not \ncounting New Orleans, a total of 60 polling places the hurricane simply \nswept away. These parishes lack basic services, such as electricity, \ngenerators, rest rooms, lights, and the like, creating some serious \nproblems. We were told that FEMA would not allow for an allocation of \nfunds in this kind of a situation--even Federal elections. It does not \nmeet the test of assistance under the Stafford Act.\n  We point out to our colleagues that New York City officials were in \nthe process of holding a primary election on September 11 when they \nwere interrupted by the terrorist attack. FEMA in that case allowed $8 \nmillion for the city of New York to allow for the election process to \ngo forward.\n  There are other precedents, indeed, which fall under the emergency \ncategory.\n  Elections are a number of weeks away, and certainly providing \nassistance for the most basic of all of our functioning as citizens, to \nmake sure that every person in these Gulf State areas is able to cast a \nvote and have their vote count is something we all embrace.\n  We appreciate the managers of this amendment allowing this kind of \nadditional appropriation on this bill.\n  Over 8 months ago, the lives of many Americans living in the Gulf \nCoast region of the United States were subject to the devastating \nnatural disasters of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita.\n  Today, those impacted by the hurricanes face many of the same \nproblems faced immediately after the storms--no homes, no jobs, no \ncommunity infrastructure, and no guarantee that their lives will return \nto normal any time soon.\n  And in this election year, many of these same individuals now also \nface the potential that their communities will be unable to guarantee \nthat they will be able to cast a vote and have that vote counted in the \nmid-term federal elections. This is simply unacceptable in America.\n  There are still areas of the Gulf Coast that are without basic \nservices, such as electricity, and many areas that are still mucking \nout homes and demolishing buildings.\n  The hope and desire to rebuild their communities and restore some \nsense of normalcy is alive and well in the Gulf Coast. But these \ncommunities need help. And that is clearly the case when it comes to \nfederal elections.\n  In Louisiana, four of the most heavily impacted parishes--not \ncounting New Orleans--must recreate a total of 60 polling places. The \nhurricanes simply swept them away or destroyed them beyond use.\n  These parishes lack basic services such as electricity, generators, \nrestrooms, or lights which are necessary to hold an election.\n  But FEMA is taking the position that the conduct of elections--even \nfederal elections--does not meet the test for assistance under the \nStafford Act.\n  That is a curious position for FEMA to take since that agency did \nprovide election assistance to both New York City, following 9-11, and \nto Miami-Dade County, Florida, following Hurricane Andrew in 1992.\n  In the case of Miami-Dade--which faced a very similar situation to \nwhat the Gulf Coast faces today--FEMA provided temporary polling \nplaces, water, generators, lights, fans and portable restroom \nfacilities on election day. FEMA also provided trailers for absentee \nvoting in the September primary.\n  More importantly, FEMA even reimbursed Miami-Dade for the costs of \nholding the election that were over and above the normal costs of the \nelection.\n  In New York City, officials were in the process of holding primary \nelections on September 11 when they were interrupted by the terrorist \nattack. Elections were rescheduled two weeks later, and FEMA reimbursed \nthe state roughly $8 million for the costs involved in cancelling and \nrescheduling the primary election.\n  The Katrina impacted States are not asking for anything that has not \nbeen provided by FEMA before for the conduct of elections following a \nnatural disaster.\n  And yet, when these States have requested assistance to conduct \nelections--including federal elections--following what has been \ndescribed as the most devastating hurricane season to ever hit the \nregion, FEMA has balked.\n  The federal Election Assistance Commission, established in 2002 under \nthe Help America Vote Act, has attempted to work with impacted states \nin order to help identify both the requirements for ensuring accurate \nand accessible federal elections and potential sources of assistance \nfor these communities.\n  To date, FEMA has come up largely emptyhanded. So far, FEMA has been \nwilling to only reimburse states for the uninsured loss of certain \npolling equipment, machines, supplies and storage facilities. In the \ncase of Louisiana, that has amounted to just over $1 million.\n  But Louisiana officials estimate that the state will face costs of up \nto $18 million this year to hold elections--well in excess of what FEMA \nhas been willing to certify to date. Similarly, Mississippi officials \nanticipate un-reimbursed expenses for holding elections to total $7.8 \nmillion while Alabama faces nearly $3 million in un-reimbursed costs.\n  And there is little reason to expect FEMA to offer more assistance. \nIn a letter addressed to Paul DeGregorio, Chairman of the Election \nAssistance Commission, dated March 9 of this year, FEMA advises the EAC \nthat--and I quote from the letter:\n\n       FEMA does not have the authority to pay for operating costs \n     related to the conduct of elections.\n\n  Well if FEMA does not, then who does?\n  I would suggest to my colleagues that the Election Assistance \nCommission not only has the expertise to accurately access the \nrequirements and costs of holding federal elections, but they are in a \nbetter position to do so.\n  Consequently, the amendment my distinguished colleague, Senator Lott, \nthe Chairman of the Rules Committee, and I are offering today.\n  It is a very modest and targeted amendment. It provides $30 million \nto the Election Assistance Commission to provide grants to eligible \nstates impacted by these natural disasters to restore and replace \nsupplies, materials, records, equipment and technology used in the \nadministration of federal elections and to ensure the full \nparticipation of individuals displaced by the 2005 hurricanes.\n\n[[Page S3872]]\n\n  This amendment is supported by a broad bipartisan coalition of voting \nrights activists and election officials, headed by the Leadership \nConference on Civil Rights and the National Association of Secretaries \nof States. Joining in support of the amendment is the National \nAssociation of Counties, the National Association of Election \nOfficials, the National Association of State Election Directors, and \nthe National Conference of State Legislatures.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this letter be included in the Record \nfollowing my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit I.)\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, these funds will enable the states to \nestablish temporary polling places, secure generators for running the \nelectronic voting machines, provide basic sanitation services for poll \nworkers and voters, such as water and portable restroom facilities.\n  Congress has taken great efforts to address the immediate needs of \nthose affected by the hurricanes. Now Congress must take additional \nsteps to assist the long-term needs of these communities as they \nrebuild and move forward.\n  Ensuring the integrity of federal elections in these states by \nguaranteeing that the people of the Gulf Coast have access to a polling \nplace is the very least this Congress can do.\n  Senator Lott and I first brought these anticipated needs to the \nattention of the Senate last October. At that time we noted the loss of \npolling places, election equipment, and election records in the \nimpacted states. While we did not have reliable cost estimates at that \ntime, we served notice that as the committee of jurisdiction over \nfederal elections, we would come back to the Senate as the full extent \nof the damage and its potential impact on the 2006 federal elections \nbecame clear.\n  Well, by last December it had become clear that the states could not \nreconstruct the infrastructure to conduct federal elections without \nassistance.\n  And so in December Chairman Lott and I introduced the ``Hurricane \nElection Relief Act of 2005.'' This bill authorizes the necessary \nfunding to aid impacted states in the conduct of federal elections this \nyear, consistent with the Help America Vote Act--HAVA.\n  Specifically, it provides federal funding to impacted states to \nrestore and replace supplies, materials, records, equipment and \ntechnology that were damaged, destroyed, or dislocated as result of the \nstorms. The bill directs the Election Assistance Commission to \ndetermine need and disburse grants to eligible states.\n  The Senate passed this measure by unanimous consent on February 9. A \nHouse companion bill, H.R. 4140, ``Ensuring Ballot Access for \nHurricanes Katrina and Rita Victims Act of 2005,'' was introduced by \nRepresentative Millender-McDonald.\n  It is imperative that Congress ensure that affected states have the \nresources necessary to conduct federal elections this year in a fair \nand accurate manner. It is equally imperative that all eligible voters \naffected by these natural disasters have an opportunity to participate \nin their democracy.\n  Being displaced by a hurricane should not result in being \ndisenfranchised from a federal election.\n  Each affected state will have its own challenges. For example, \naccording to the Secretary of State in Louisiana, over 400,000 \nregistered voters are dispersed in 49 states.\n  While fewer voters were displaced in Mississippi, the election \ninfrastructure was completely destroyed or severely damaged by winds \nand surges, according to the Secretary of State of Mississippi.\n  In Alabama, the Secretary of State has indicated that their allocated \nelection costs were spent not on conducting elections, but removing \ndebris and repairing election infrastructure following the hurricanes.\n  Other states have been impacted, to a lesser extent, by the influx of \ntemporary residents displaced by the hurricanes. In many of those \nstates, displaced citizens may have decided not to return home but to \nbecome residents of the host state, thereby adding to the election \nadministration responsibilities of those jurisdictions.\n  The amendment we are offering today will ensure that these unforseen \nneeds are met and that the federal elections required this year are \naccessible, accurate, and transparent.\n  Regardless of the funding needs of the impacted states, one thing is \nclear. They are similarly situated with all other states conducting \n2006 federal elections. They have a solemn duty to protect and preserve \nthe constitutionally guaranteed right of each eligible voter to cast a \nvote and have that vote counted.\n  The impacted states are prepared to work hard to secure the rights of \nour nation's voters and they will conduct these elections with whatever \nresources are available to them. But the access to the ballot box \nshould not depend upon whether or not a state has recovered from an \nunprecedented series of natural disasters.\n  And voters are ready to work hard and participate in the governance \nand rebuilding of their communities, no matter what the damage \ninflicted on them by nature. But their ability to participate in our \ndemocracy through the ballot box should not depend upon whether their \ncommunity has been successfully rebuilt.\n  It is essential that we join together to ensure that all states \nimpacted by these natural disasters have the resources to conduct \ntimely federal elections that fully enfranchise all eligible voters.\n  This is literally our last opportunity to provide these funds in time \nto make a difference. It would be irresponsible not to ensure that \nthese states have sufficient resources to conduct federal elections \nthis year. The health of our democracy depends upon it.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n\n                               Exhibit I\n\n                     Make Election Reform A Reality\n\n\n support gulf coast states in their extraordinary efforts to administer \n                        elections after katrina\n\n                                                   April 24, 2006.\n       Dear Senators: We, the undersigned organizations, urge you \n     assist Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama in their efforts to \n     hold meaningful elections in the aftermath of Hurricane \n     Katrina. We are asking for $50 million in the upcoming \n     Emergency Supplemental Appropriations legislation for those \n     states in their efforts to administer transparent and \n     accountable elections.\n       It is imperative that the citizens of the Gulf Coast region \n     are provided with the opportunity to participate in the \n     critical and difficult decision making that each of these \n     states face in the foreseeable future. Every election \n     presents states with challenges, but never before has there \n     been such great potential for disenfranchisement than in the \n     elections the Gulf Coast states are facing this year.\n       Voters have been displaced, voting equipment has been \n     destroyed or severely damaged and polling places have been \n     leveled. The outcome of the devastation is that county \n     budgets which were strained before the hurricane have now \n     been depleted dealing with issues like debris removal and \n     infrastructure rebuilding. Many of the businesses have shut \n     down, thereby reducing or eliminating a tax base for those \n     counties. The funding is just not available at the state and \n     local level to rebuild the elections infrastructure.\n       Time is of the essence. Starting this month and running \n     through the summer, all of these states have primary \n     elections for local and federal offices.\n       The officials and residents of the Gulf Coast states are \n     extremely grateful for the support from all levels of \n     government and from the many Americans who have been devoted \n     to helping them rebuild and move forward. We look forward to \n     working with you on this critical issue. Should you have any \n     questions, please contact Leslie Reynolds of the National \n     Association of Secretaries of State at (202) 624-3525 or Val \n     Frias of the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights at (202) \n     263-2852, or any of the individual organizations listed \n     below.\n           Sincerely,\n       Leadership Conference on Civil Rights,\n       National Association of Counties,\n       National Association of Election Officials,\n       National Association of Secretaries of State,\n       National Association of State Election Directors,\n       National Conference of State Legislatures.\n\n  Mr. DODD. I urge adoption of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment? If \nnot, the question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 3727) was agreed to.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. LOTT. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n[[Page S3873]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n\n\n               Amendment No. 3641, Division V, Withdrawn\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be set aside so I may call up Coburn amendment No. 3641, \nDivision V, and I ask unanimous consent for its withdrawal.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, \nDivision V is withdrawn.\n\n\n               Amendment No. 3641, Division VI, withdrawn\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Division VI \nof amendment No. 3641 be called up.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is now pending.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I have every intention of withdrawing this \namendment. But I wish to mention for a moment that this is an amendment \nthat would have removed $20 million from the National Marine Fisheries \nService to study catch, bycatch, shrimp and relief and fishery \nprofitability in the Gulf--the study of profitability. We are going to \nspend $20 million to study profitability.\n  The Louisiana Seafood and Marketing Board considers this to be \nunnecessary spending and a low priority.\n  That is what the people who market the seafood from Louisiana said \nabout this amendment.\n  I am not going to put us through a vote on it, but I think we ought \nto pay attention to the people down there who are now saying they don't \nneed $20 million for marketing and studying. They believe it is a waste \nof money. When the people of Louisiana are telling us it is wasted \nmoney, it is certainly wasted money.\n  I ask unanimous consent it be withdrawn.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n\n\n              Amendment No. 3641, Division VII, withdrawn\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 3641, Division \nVII.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The division is pending.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I don't intend to ask for a vote on this \namendment and may, in fact, withdraw it, but I think it is something \nthat the American people should know. This is about AmericaCorps, the \nNational Civilian Community Corps.\n  There are three things we ought to know. The idea behind this is \nfine. They have done a great deal of work on the gulf coast. However, \nthere are some real problems with this program. The House also has \nsignificant problems with this program.\n  Here is the key point: It has never had a comprehensive evaluation in \n13 years to see if it accomplishes anything of importance. Compared to \nall the other AmeriCorps service programs, this one is about 50 percent \nmore costly per person. This one costs $28,000 per volunteer for 10 \nmonths. That annualized out to $34,000 per person per year.\n  No. 3, no one is measuring any performance. There are no set goals. \nNo one is saying what they are intended to accomplish? How do we \nmeasure that? Could we do it cheaper? Can we do it a better way? None \nof that has been evaluated on this program.\n  People will oppose this. I have no lack of reality in knowing we do \nnot have an opportunity to eliminate this money. However, contrast what \nactually happened on the gulf coast with this AmeriCorps. We had people \nfrom all over this country go down and help. We didn't pay them a \npenny. We did not pay them a $35,000 annualized salary. We had college \nstudents from all across this country spend their spring breaks, their \nChristmas breaks, their Thanksgiving breaks on the gulf coast \nvolunteering. We had churches, civic organizations, local charities, we \ndid not pay them a penny. They all came because there was a need.\n  There is something very wrong behind the idea that we have to pay \npeople to be volunteers. As a matter of fact, it is an oxymoron. You \ncannot have a paid volunteer because they are not volunteering if they \nare getting paid. The motivation and commitment shown by true \nvolunteers is unmatched by any congressional appropriation. The Nation \nis answering the call to be Good Samaritans and treat others the way \nthey want to be treated.\n  This program was started in 1993 with good goals, and the purpose was \nto create leadership. We may have done that, but the fact that we do \nnot know if we have done that, the fact that we keep throwing this \nmoney--which does not go to the individual volunteers; $4,000 does, but \nit costs too much to operate.\n  I will ask unanimous consent for withdrawing of this division, but we \ncertainly ought to have some oversight. I intend to have an oversight \nhearing in the Committee on Federal Financial Oversight.\n  I ask unanimous consent to withdraw the division.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Louisiana.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 3627, as Modified\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I rise to ask unanimous consent amendment \nNo. 3627 be called up. Also, I request unanimous consent it be modified \naccording to the modification I am sending to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Martinez).

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to yield myself 5 \nminutes to speak to the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. THUNE. I rise to offer an amendment on behalf of America's \nveterans. My amendment provides an additional $20 million for veterans \nhealth care, offset by striking $20 million appropriated under this \nsupplemental for the AmeriCorps Program.\n  Among other things, my amendment provides more funding for the \nimplementation of the provisions of the 2004 CARES Act, or capital \nasset realignment for enhanced services decision, submitted by the \nSecretary of Veterans Affairs for enhanced VA service, as well as other \nactions designed to help the VA provide better and more accessible care \nto our Nation's veterans.\n  As we seek to restrain spending, we must carefully scrutinize our \npriorities. Our veterans must take priority over programs and some of \nthe other priorities we are trying to address in the budget. My \namendment does this with AmeriCorps. We must do everything we can in a \nfiscally responsible way to ensure our veterans receive the health care \nthey require.\n  While we provide a generous funding of over $30 billion for VA health \ncare for the current fiscal year, there is still room for improvement, \nif we can do so in a way that does not force us to spend beyond our \nmeans.\n  This is particularly true as we take care of those veterans who have \nreturned from Iraq and Afghanistan. Finally, this amendment is \nparticularly important for veterans living in rural and geographically \nisolated areas. For example, the VA's Midwest health care network, \nwhich serves South Dakota, is the most rural and covers the largest \ngeographic region of any veterans integrated service network in the \nNation. It is therefore one of my highest priorities to ensure that \nveterans living in rural areas continue to see growth in the VA's \nability to reach out to our rural veterans and provide adequate care \nfor them.\n  For these reasons, I strongly urge my colleagues to support this \namendment.\n  I simply say, as a member of the Committee on Veterans' Affairs, one \nof the debates we often have at the committee level is how, on a \nconsistent basis, we have to borrow from the medical facilities account \nto fund ongoing operations, to fund veterans health care.\n  What this amendment simply does is, in an offset way, in a paid-for \nway, force us to make choices. Obviously, the budget process is always \nabout choices, about where we are going to invest, where we are going \nto put our limited resources. In this era of budgetary constraint, it \nis important we make choices that are consistent with the priorities I \nbelieve we ought to be addressing in this country, one of which is the \nimportance of our veterans, in making sure we are putting the \nappropriate funding levels in place not only to provide health care for \nour veterans but to make sure those facilities out there that are in \nneed of improvement, that are in need of additional dollars for \nconstruction or rehabilitation or whatever the case may be, that there \nare dollars in place that would enable us to meet that very important \nneed.\n  Again, I ask my colleagues to support this amendment. I believe it \ndoes reflect a priority that is important to Members of the Senate, \ncertainly a priority that is important to members of the Committee on \nVeterans' Affairs, and done in a way that is offset, that is paid for, \nand more accurately reflects on what we ought to be spending tax \ndollars.\n  With that, I ask unanimous consent my amendment be laid aside, and I \nyield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I wish I would have thought of that \namendment. It is a great amendment.\n  The Senator from South Dakota makes the point, we have to make \ndecisions about priorities. When we have an unproven volunteer program \nthat is more expensive than any other volunteer program, and we are \nputting an extra $20 million on the basis of emergency versus \nfulfilling the obligations to those people who have made the ultimate \nsacrifice and paid the price and served this country and put their \nlives in danger doing so, it is a no-brainer that we ought to be \nspending the money on the veterans rather than a program that has not \nproven to be effective, not proven to match a performance goal, and not \nproven even to be measuring itself in the 13 years of its existence.\n  I support the Senator's amendment.\n\n\n              Amendment No. 3641, Division VIII, Withdrawn\n\n  With that, I ask the pending amendment be laid aside and amendment \nNo. 3641, division VIII, be called up.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I do not intend on asking for a vote on \nthis amendment, but I highlight this amendment because of the problems \nimplicit in this request.\n  In this supplemental is a request for $230 million, an earmark, for \nthree additional Osprey V-22 airplanes. The Pentagon, in 2005, formally \napproved full rate production of the V-22: 360 for the Marine Corps, 48 \nfor the Navy, and 50 for the Air Force. The Pentagon has ordered 90 as \nof today.\n  This plane is not yet proven, one, and I will not go into the debate \non that. It cannot even have full testing and cannot be used in the \nbattlefield.\n  The point is, there is no emergency need to order these planes. This \nplane is manufactured in Texas and Pennsylvania. The Pentagon did not \nrequest this. The President did not request it. What we have is people \nrequesting it.\n  We have a plane that has not met performance tests yet, has not been \nbattle proven, and we are adding three airplanes for which some would \nraise a good question as to whether it ought to be done in this way. It \nought to be done through an authorization and through the regular \nprocess.\n  I know this is in the mark. I am not sure the chairman is supportive \nof it, and I will not ask for the vote, but I don't think this is the \nway we ought to buy airplanes, especially when it is not an emergency.\n  There are numerous problems. Most of them have been corrected, but \nthere still have been numerous problems. This is the problem with \nearmarks. We are adding something that is not authorized, a plane that \nhas had tremendous developmental difficulties, that the Pentagon does \nnot want, the President does not want, yet we want. Why do we want it? \nBecause, for some reason, we end up either employing more people on \nsomething that may not eventually work to the military's satisfaction \nor we get benefits from it in terms of political expediency.\n  I believe it is the wrong way to go. I ask unanimous consent to \nwithdraw the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n               Amendment No. 3641, Division IX, Withdrawn\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be set aside and that we proceed to the consideration of \namendment No. 3641, division IX.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the division is pending.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this division \nbe withdrawn.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n               Amendment No. 3641, Division X, Withdrawn\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that division X be \nwithdrawn.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 3641, Division XI\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to call up \ndivision XI.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I find myself bringing an amendment again \nagainst two of my friends who have a significant stake. They are both \nfrom Mississippi. They have looked at this issue a great deal.\n  What I want to do is raise the issues with a debate on the amendment, \nand then possibly talk about solutions.\n  During Katrina, the Armed Forces Retirement Home in Gulfport, MS, was \ndamaged. The first floor was damaged significantly. It required and \nnecessitated us moving those veterans to other retirement homes.\n  We need to remedy that. There are lots of options on the table. I \ntalked\n\n[[Page S3875]]\n\nwith the chairman of the Appropriations Committee, and there are a lot \nof good ideas coming out on how to solve that problem.\n  The problem I have is, we allocated $45 million for this in the last \nyear, and $44 million of it remains in the bank and has not been spent. \nThis bill has $176 million, but it does not tell us what we are going \nto do with it. It just has $176 million.\n  So that brings us to a quarter of a billion dollars on this \nretirement home that houses 600 of our best, who have proven they have \nbeen our best through their service to our country.\n  Now, if you divide this out, you come to almost $400,000 per room, if \nwe created a new style. And the plans, the proposals are all in the \n$480 million and $490 million range that have been offered up on the \ndifferent options.\n  Congressman Gene Taylor from Mississippi, in the debate on this \nissue, says we can fully restore this facility to what it was \nbeforehand for $80 to $90 million. That is what the estimates are. \nPrivate industry estimates for a brand-new naval home facility are that \nit could be built to the desired standards--that means up to date for \nAmericans with disabilities; up to date on size, doors; up to date on \nthe ability to handle people with advanced aging and disease and long-\nterm consequences--for $125 million to $150 million.\n  So the question I raise with this amendment is not whether we should \ndo it. It is: We have $221 million, after this bill goes through, that \nis going to be for that, and we are not through, and there is nothing \nin the report language that would direct us on how we are going to make \na decision on spending this money and what it is going to go for.\n  I will agree with the goal of the chairman that we ought to replace \nthis facility, and those people involved in that area ought to have a \nlot to say about it. My concern is the cost. If you really take the \n$589.54 million, which is option No. 1 that is coming out for this, and \nthe estimate that it will take 13 years to get us back to where we \nwere, that is $1 million a room.\n  I want to contrast that with what we can do for $1 million. If you \nlook at the average price of a new home in Mississippi for a single \nperson to live in, it is less than $80,000 a year. We could buy every \nveteran who lives in that home a brand-new home and provide nursing \ncare for 10 years--for 10 years--for what is being proposed in \nreplacing this.\n  So my real question is, what is the plan? Where is the commonsense \noversight? How much are we going to spend? And before we send more \nmoney in an emergency appropriations, we ought to know what that is, \nand that ought to be decided before we spend more money, especially \nsince $44 million that has been appropriated has not been spent.\n  All I am saying is that we should consider that. I would hope we \nwould wait to send additional supplemental money for this until we know \nexactly where it is going to go or specify exactly where it is going to \ngo.\n  We do know that to be considered an emergency we need to meet the \nrequirements. I believe we need to meet the requirements for our \nveterans, especially in this home because we have some of them in \nWashington, DC, and we have them living all across the country. But the \nfact is, we don't know where the money is going to go. We don't know \nhow much money we are going to spend. We don't have a plan. Nothing is \nagreed to. Why not go through the regular process with this? Why not go \nthrough the authorization and appropriation process on this since we \nhave not spent the money already and we don't know how this money is \ngoing to be spent?\n  So it is a simple, straightforward question: Wouldn't it make more \nsense to do it under the regular order since this is definitely not an \nemergency now? Under their five different plans they have offered up, \nthis would not be an emergency.\n  I would ask the consideration of the chairman if we could do it in a \nbetter, more efficient way that is better for the taxpayer; if, in \nfact, we could withdraw this money at this time and bring it back \nthrough the regular order to accomplish that?\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3713\n\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to set the pending \namendment aside and call up amendment No. 3713.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered. The amendment is pending.\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, I will be brief because I know we are in \ndebate on another amendment.\n  Avian flu is the concern of not just this Congress but of this \ncountry and the rest of the world. As it has spread by migratory \nbirds--and in some instances around the world--it has infected humans. \nIt is the responsible thing on the part of this country to prepare for \nthat.\n  Part of preparation is not only being prepared for the human side, it \nis being prepared to track its entry and possible migration through the \nUnited States. Today we have devoted, with the leadership of the \nchairman of the Appropriations Committee, moneys to the Fish and \nWildlife Service to successfully do that, and we do it between Russia \nand Alaska. Unfortunately, there is a lot of geography in North America \nthat goes uncovered and has routes for migratory birds.\n  My amendment is simple. We would like to reprogram $5 million of \nsurveillance money that is in this emergency spending bill to the \nSmithsonian, directed to work with all of their nonprofit affiliates to \nset up a migratory bird surveillance program. This Congress has \ncommitted a tremendous amount of dollars to be prepared and to respond \nif bird flu becomes a human-to-human transmission. If we look around \nthe world at successes, one would look at Taiwan and Japan \nspecifically, where their migratory birds surveillance program \ndetected, contained, and eliminated on their islands the infection. \nThat is not to say that they are home free, but they certainly have a \ntrack record of eliminating the threat, even before it hit in total \ntheir domestic population of poultry.\n  We are concerned about the human-to-human transmission. With that \nconcern has come a tremendous amount of resources from the Federal \nGovernment. It deserves us spending as much time focused on the \neconomic impact before human-to-human transmission. I think it is safe \nto say that a majority of this country can be affected with our poultry \nflocks, and we have an opportunity, with a successful surveillance \nprogram, to make sure that we do what Japan and Taiwan did, and that is \ndetect its entry, try to contain it, try to eliminate it when it first \nenters.\n  I am not sure that we have an entity that has a track record of doing \nwhat we are asking the Smithsonian. In the past, the Appropriations \nCommittee has devoted some funds to some entities that suggested they \ncould do it. The reality is they are not doing it today. This effort is \nto take an agency, a Federal arm, and to try to extend to them the \nresources to do what they say they can do and that is a successful \nmigratory bird surveillance program.\n  I ask my colleagues to support the amendment. Without it, we have no \nhope of a surveillance program for migratory birds, with the exception \nof what we currently do in Alaska with Fish and Wildlife. We have a \ncommitment to make sure that the efforts of the Smithsonian and their \nsuccesses are integrated into the database of Fish and Wildlife. This \nis not to duplicate. It is not to create something that might be a \nthreat to the existing program we have under way. It is to complement \nit. It is to say that we understand this is a large continent and that \nwe have to tap the pool of people who are in nonprofits across the \ncountry and across the continent, if we want to be successful with a \nsurveillance program.\n  I ask my colleagues to support reprogramming $5 million for this \nyear. It is not new money. It is reprogrammed money. It is money that \nwe had devoted to surveillance. It is shifted from human surveillance \nto migratory bird surveillance.\n\n[[Page S3876]]\n\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I was going to ask the Senator if he \nknows of any objection. I was advised that there is one Senator who has \nindicated opposition to the amendment. I am a member of the Board of \nRegents of the Smithsonian. I have a high regard for the work that is \ndone there. Listening to the description of the Senator from North \nCarolina, I am inclined to support the amendment. But in view of the \nfact that there is at least one Senator with a contrary view, I think \nwe ought not go forward without giving him an opportunity to come and \nexpress his concerns, if he would like to have an opportunity to do so. \nMy hope would be that we could put in a quorum and see if there is a \nneed to discuss it further; otherwise, I suggest that we accept it on a \nvoice vote.\n  Mr. BURR. I thank the chairman and recognize there might be an \nindividual who wants to speak in opposition.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n               Amendment No. 3641, Division XI, Withdrawn\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, is the amendment pending now and open for \ndebate by Senator Coburn with regard to the Armed Forces Retirement \nHome?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That division is available for debate.\n  Mr. LOTT. If I may speak on this subject, I would plead with my \ncolleague from Oklahoma to bear with me and work with us on this. I \nhave a feeling this is something he would like to see done. I think he \nwants to make sure it is done in the right way. That is my goal, too. I \nwould ask him to hear me out a minute. Let's see if we can work this \nout and perhaps not force this to a vote, take up the Senate's time, \nsee if we can accommodate everybody's concerns.\n  Again, this is a place that I have direct personal familiarity with. \nI was there when it was a high ground on the Mississippi gulf coast \nbeach area with 200-year-old oaks, a beautiful site. In the 1970s, \nthrough the good offices and efforts, probably of Senator Stennis, an \n11-story retirement home for old sailors was built on that magnificent \nsite in 1976. I was there when the ribbon was cut, and I was so proud \nof that facility. It was such an exciting thing to see the look in the \neyes of those at that time sailors, but it has since become, of course, \nthe Armed Forces Retirement Home. So it is a place of last resort for \nretirees from all the military branches. That is how far back my \nhistory goes with this facility.\n  In preparation for the storm, to the credit of the leaders there, 300 \nof the residents were temporarily evacuated to the Armed Forces home in \nWashington. The rest moved in with friends and family. The facility is \ncapable of holding as many as 500, and there was always a waiting list. \nWhen Katrina came in, the entire first floor was flooded. The exterior \nof the building was blasted with 150-mile-an-hour winds. The entire \nelectrical room located below ground level was flooded from floor to \nceiling.\n  But from that time to this, I continue to hear from the residents \nsaying: We want to come back; we want to come home. Nothing against the \nWashington, DC, area, but their family, quite often, what little family \nthey have, lives in that area and they feel so comfortable there, they \nwant to go back.\n  By the way, the Gulfport facility, unlike the one in Washington, \ndidn't lose money. It was always a moneymaker. But the rooms they had \nwere 90-square-foot rooms, and sometimes it was a retiree and his or \nher spouse in this very small room. I realized several years ago that \nwhoever designed the building had made some mistakes in terms of the \nsize and the options of those retirees.\n  I don't know if my colleagues are familiar with black mold, but it is \nbad stuff, and it comes quickly after a hurricane. You begin to see it \non the walls, and it will make you sick. If you don't get it out of \nthere, your building will be sick. You have to go in and basically take \neverything out but the two by fours. You have to take out the walls in \nthe building--just everything--and replace it with new material, or you \nare going to have this black mold.\n  I have really been embarrassed by the way the Defense Department has \nhandled the Gulfport facility in the aftermath of the hurricane. I \nunderstand we have had a lot of things on our minds, but basically they \nhaven't done anything to mitigate further decay. They haven't gone in \nthere and repaired that first floor. They have not gotten the \nventilation system going to dehumidify the rest of the building. They \nhave not done anything to repair the exterior facing. They have not \nremoved the black mold. And to make matters worse, other then some \nvolunteer work initially done by the Navy Seabees, they basically will \nnot let anybody else come in to try to mitigate the decay that is \noccurring.\n  Remember, this hurricane was August of last year and that 11-story \nbuilding stands there today basically like it was the day after the \nhurricane. They are letting it just sit there. They even initially \nrefused to let the electric company come through the gate to help \nrestore power. This has not been one of our better moments.\n  Then we started asking: What can we do? I want to do the right thing \nfor our retired veterans at this site. There have been proposals: Let's \njust go in and put a Band-Aid on it, clean it minimally, move things \noff the basement and the first floor up to the second floor. There are \nquestions about how feasible that is. Let's just patch it up. But the \nprojection of the costs for even that is not good.\n  The second alternative is to go in and do a major overhaul and make \nthese 90-square-foot rooms bigger--knock a hole in the wall and have \ntwo-room suites, really a major overhaul. The amount of money they are \ntalking about, again, is very high.\n  Then, of course, the last one is to raze the building and build \nsomething more modern, safer in hurricanes, more pleasing to the \nretirees and everybody involved.\n  My attitude has been, OK, somebody who is an expert tell me what is \nthe right solution. I can go with any of these alternatives, but let's \nmake sure we do it responsibly and let's not have to do it again in 3 \nor 4 years. And, by the way, is there some way we can control the \ncosts? A novel idea. So that is where we are.\n  I met with the Pentagon officials, and I think they are trying to \ncome up with an alternative solution. $64.7 million in appropriated \nfunds was previously provided to study options to rehouse evacuated \nveterans. Mr. President, $64 million to study options? Do we need that?\n  What I am saying and what Senator Cochran is saying is let's take the \nbalance of that prior money that can be reprogrammed, and let's couple \nthat with another, I believe, $176 million and go forward.\n  My colleague from Oklahoma has said he wants a facility put back in \nGulfport. He wants to know what it is, and he wants to know what it is \ngoing to cost. Some of the numbers I have been hearing--I don't know if \nI can put my finger on it right here--are proposals of $589 million for \nrenovating it or $389 million to rebuild it. Good gravy. That is real \nmoney. I don't like either one of those.\n  I believe we can repair it or we can come up with this modified \nproposal Senator Cochran has, about which we had some input, that would \nbe a better, more aesthetically pleasing, more livable, cheaper \nfacility to build.\n  Look at the report. The report makes it clear what the committee is \ntalking about doing: combined with prior unobligated balances, taking \nthe $176 million the committee has recommended, which shall be used to \nconstruct a new, multi-building, campus-style facility on the site \noccupied by the former Armed Forces Retirement Home.\n  I think Senator Cochran envisions more of a three-story, military-\nstyle retirement facility, perhaps with some surrounding dormitories.\n  I don't want to say how this is going to be done, but the hurricane \nwas 8\\1/2\\ months ago, and we are still waiting. The costs are going \nup, by the way. Try to get a contractor down there now and see what it \ncosts.\n  So we are trying to get this done. We are making recommendations \nbecause\n\n[[Page S3877]]\n\nwe haven't gotten one from anybody else. But keep in mind, this \nmodified plan makes more sense. I think it would please everybody, and \nit is a heck of a lot cheaper.\n  If my colleague from Oklahoma has something he would like to suggest \nwe include--I am not chairman of the committee, I am not on the \ncommittee, but I am saying, this was not designed in perfection, but I \nthink it is a positive move that deals with the realities of a pitiful \nsituation.\n  I talked with the mayor of Gulfport, MS, recently, Mayor Brent Warr, \nand he told me a story that breaks your heart. He picked up on the \nstreets of Gulfport, MS, one of the former residents who was walking \nalong the side of the road after he had made his way from Washington, \nDC, to Gulfport. He got tired of waiting. He went home--this is his \nhome--to a mold-infested, mildewed, improperly air-conditioned \nfacility.\n  I don't think we should do this to these retirees and these veterans. \nI think we need to move ahead and do the right thing to get our \nveterans home to Gulfport. I will be glad to yield to my colleague from \nOklahoma if he has some additional suggestions. I know this is an area \nabout which he cares.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I want to see this facility replaced, too, \nbut I have some serious questions. The Senator was not here for the \ndebate. I want him to hear those questions because what he is proposing \nis cheaper than several of what the retirement board suggested. I \nagree. Call me cheap. What he is proposing is $370,000 per resident. \nThat is twice what I can build a brand-new hospital for with the latest \neverything.\n  I guess my point is, for $221 million, what are our grandchildren \ngoing to get because we are doing this under an emergency, and we know \nwe can build a brand-new facility up to code, nice as can be, with the \nrooms the size the Senator wants, for $150 million total. We know that \nis possible. So why should we spend $221 million doing it? If it is not \na fixed plan now; if we send $221 million out of here, they are going \nto spend it.\n  My problem is, I would love for the Senator and maybe the chairman to \nwork with me to get this to a more realistic idea of what the real \ncosts should be so that we accomplish the goal they want, and we do it \nin a more timely manner. I agree, having a campus style is probably a \nlittle bit more expensive, but it isn't 50 percent more expensive than \nwhat it should cost.\n  I made the point earlier that for a new home, for a single or couple \nliving in 1,200 to 1,500 square feet in the State of Mississippi, you \ncan buy one of the nicest places in the world for $81,000 right now, or \n$72,000. We got a quote yesterday from Mississippi. So that leaves \n$300,000. If we bought them all a brand-new home and then hired them a \ncaretaker at $30,000 a year for the next 10 years, we would spend less \nmoney.\n  Again, you bet, I am a tightwad when it comes to our grandchildren's \nmoney, and I want value for what we spend. That is the purpose of this \namendment. I am willing to withdraw this amendment if I can have the \nassurance that we can moderate this back into a range that would look \nlike something comparable to what we really need to spend.\n  I wish to make a final point, if the Senator will bear with me. We \ndon't have this money. We don't have it. Anything we don't get good \nvalue for today because our kids are paying for it means they are going \nto get an exaggerated cost when they come to pay it back. That is my \npurpose.\n  I want them to have a great home. I want them to be able to come \nhome. I know they have a tremendous camaraderie living there. I want to \nsee that restored for them. They deserve it. Can we not do it in a much \ncheaper way and still give them what they want? Remember, they fought \nhard so we would have the money to be able to do it.\n  Mr. LOTT. If the Senator will yield, Mr. President, taking my time \nback, look, I on occasion have thought of myself as a cheap hawk, too. \nWhen you see what I have seen--and the President of the United States \nand Senator after Senator and Congressman after Congressman looked \nthese people in the eye and said: We are going to make you whole; we \nare not going to give you everything you want, but we are going to help \nyou get back on your feet. And we said that to these old veterans, too.\n  I don't want to build a Taj Mahal. Unfortunately, quite often that is \nwhat we get when the Government does it. I would like to do it for \nless. I would like to have more for less. I would prefer the Pentagon \nhad developed a plan 4 months ago and said let's do this. But here we \nsit on the sideline.\n  I can't speak for the chairman of the committee, but the Senator can \nsee this is something I have paid attention to. It is something I care \nabout. But I would be open to suggestions and working with the Senator \nto see if we can come up with a plan that the Pentagon, hopefully, \nwould help us with that would do more and maybe do less. I am amenable \nto that.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator, my \ncolleague from Mississippi, for his contribution to this discussion. I \nthink he made a very compelling argument for the fact that we need to \nprovide funds in this bill with direction to proceed to work on a new \nfacility for these veterans. That is the point. That is why included in \nthis bill is a committee recommendation of $176 million.\n  The language specifically suggests that this be used to construct a \nnew, multibuilding, campus-style facility on the site occupied by the \nformer Armed Forces Retirement Home in Gulfport, MS. I think that is \nthe key, and that was brought out by my good friend and colleague from \nMississippi. That is the point.\n  It is the sense of our committee and those familiar with this \nfacility that it should remain in the Gulfport, MS, area. The mayor of \nGulfport came up to see me to talk about his concerns, his interests, \nand his ideas. I know he talked with Senator Lott and probably other \nmembers of our delegation. I want to help him achieve his goal for \nhaving the facility rebuilt, using the best measures that we can to be \nsure we get a good result for the dollars that we invest, and we don't \nwaste money. We don't want to do that. We don't want to just throw a \nlot of money out there and let the home spend it without any guidance \nor restraint.\n  I am very committed, though, to the notion that we ought to have a \nprovision with some money and these directions in the bill. I don't \nthink the House has included anything like this. We are going to have \nto negotiate with the House when we get to conference. I don't know \nwhat their ideas would be, but I want to be able to have at least the \ncommitment of the Senate behind our effort to do what is said in this \nreport.\n  It could be $176 million. If the Senator wants to change it to $166 \nmillion or $120 million--I don't know what the right number is. But it \nshows a commitment to proceed with funds available to hire some people \nto get the work done. This is what Senator Lott's point is. Nothing has \nbeen done. We have to get somebody moving, get an architect selected, \ncome together with a plan, and then we will see whether we can fund it. \nBut at least we have enough money in here to show we are serious about \nrebuilding it, that we are making this investment, and we will monitor \nthe use of the money and try our best to be sure that every dollar is \nwell spent. That is my goal.\n  The Armed Services Committee has oversight responsibility. That is \nthe legislative committee. So they can help monitor and follow the \nprogress as well. But I hope we won't strike the money and just say \nthis is a bad idea and we are not going to do anything else. That is \nunacceptable. That is totally unacceptable.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I concur with the Senator's desire to \nreestablish the site there. That is not what this is about. I am told \nthe Senate Armed Services Committee is not for this because it only \ngets us halfway there, which bothers me greatly because instead of $221 \nmillion, we are going to spend $442 million, which ends up being about \n$800,000 per bed.\n  The point I make is this: If you throw money out there, they are \ngoing to build where they expend the money. How about us having a plan \nwithin a certain amount of money and living with it, rather than saying \nwe are\n\n[[Page S3878]]\n\ngoing over or we are not going over? How about taking the average of \nthe last couple that have been built where there have been any \nfacilities similar to it and using that as a guideline? My problem is \nit is not $176 million; it is $176 million plus $44 million, and other \npeople are going to authorize another $200 million, so we are going to \nbe talking about a half a billion dollars, and that is my problem with \nit.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent at this time to withdraw this amendment. I \nappreciate the courtesies extended to me during the debate. I know the \ndesire is right. I think the money that is out there is extraordinarily \ntoo much, especially when we have documented estimates to repair the \npresent facilities between $50 million and $60 million and to build new \nones between $120 million and $150 million. So anything above that is \nfluff at this time, which we can't afford. We can meet our obligations, \nbut we can't go much beyond that and meet our other obligations. So I \nask unanimous consent to withdraw the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is withdrawn.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry: What is the \npending business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Alexander). The amendment of the Senator \nfrom North Carolina.\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, would the Senator from Colorado yield for a \nquestion? If the Senator would allow me, it is my understanding we \nwould be able to voice vote my amendment that is pending right now. If \nthe Senator would allow me to do that, we could dispose of this \namendment in 30--I have been told I am incorrect.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, through the Chair, I think it would be \nappropriate for my friend from North Carolina to have a conversation \nabout how to move forward with his amendment. At this point I ask \nunanimous consent that the pending business be set aside so I may offer \nan amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3736\n\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 3736.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Colorado [Mr. Salazar] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3736.\n\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To provide funding for critical National Forest System \n  projects to address the consequences of Hurricane Katrina and other \n hurricanes of the 2005 season, reduce the risk of catastrophic fires, \n and mitigate the effects of widespread insect infestations throughout \n                      the National Forest System)\n\n       On page 172, strike lines 15 through 21 and insert the \n     following: ``System'' for necessary expenses, $50,000,000, to \n     remain available until expended: Provided, That the amount \n     provided under this heading is designated as an emergency \n     requirement pursuant to section 402 of H. Con. Res. 95 (109th \n     Congress), the concurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal \n     year 2006.''\n\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, a few days ago I came to the floor of the \nSenate to talk about a very important issue that is facing the entire \nNation with respect to the fire emergency we are seeing across many of \nour States, including many of our western States. At that point I \nproposed an amendment that would provide an additional $30 million in \ndisaster emergency aid so the Forest Service can take on the work it \nneeds to take on to assure that we don't have the destruction from \nfires we have seen in prior years.\n  In my own State alone, we have seen what happens when you have the \nfire situation getting out of control. In 1994, the Storm King fire \nnear Glenwood Springs ended up with the deaths of over 14 firefighters. \nBack in 2002, we had another fire, the Hayman fire, which caused \n138,000 acres of national Forest Service lands to be burned across 4 \ndifferent counties. These kinds of fires are the kinds we are seeing \nacross our entire country, and we need to make sure we have the \nresources in order to be able to fight the fires we are going to be \nseeing in the weeks and months ahead throughout our great Nation.\n  What I am doing with this amendment is simply providing the amount of \nmoney that would be needed to get us up to the levels for firefighting \nthat we had during the prior year. It is something that is essential to \nour country, it fits within the framework of addressing disaster \nemergencies, and I am hopeful my colleagues in the Senate will agree \nwith me and support this amendment.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  At this time there is not a sufficient second.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield, I hope that \nthe Senate could accept this on a voice vote. I don't know that we need \nto have a rollcall vote. It seems to me to be an amendment that should \nbe accepted by the Senate. It calls for the use of--my piece of paper \nsays $50 million, and I heard the Senator say $30 million, or did I \nhear him wrong?\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, if I may respond to my friend from \nMississippi, the amendment asks for $50 million because we attempted to \nmake sure we were protecting the amount of money that had been \nrequested in the bill in the Forest Service items for Katrina recovery. \nSo this is $30 million in addition to that, which brings up the amount \nin the amendment to $50 million.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. So the bill as reported from our committee was $20 \nmillion, and this adds $30 million?\n  Mr. SALAZAR. That is indeed correct. I am willing to withdraw my \nrequest for a vote at this point in time if, indeed, we can resolve \nthis by a voice vote.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I am willing to urge the Senate to accept \nthe amendment. There is clearly a need for funding, and we will have an \nopportunity to monitor this carefully to be sure that money is not \nwasted. But clearly, the devastation to timberland and forestry \nresources is immense. It is indescribable. You have to see it. You can \ndrive along hundreds of miles of forestlands in the region, and it is \nstaggering, the amount of destruction that has occurred.\n  I compliment the Senator and thank him for offering the amendment and \nassure him of my support and recommendation that we accept it.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, regarding Senate amendment No. 3637 to \nH.R. 4939, I believe it is important to clarify the intent of this \namendment. The intent of Senate amendment No. 3637 is similar to Senate \namendment No. 3645; however, due to technical considerations I had to \nredraft the amendment. The intent of Senate amendment No. 3637 is to \nprovide $20 million to the Forest Service to address the consequences \nof Hurricane Katrina and other hurricanes of the 2005 season, as the \nSenate Appropriations originally reported. My amendment retains that \n$20 million for the gulf coast and adds another $30 million to reduce \nthe risk of catastrophic fires and mitigate the effects of widespread \ninsect infestations throughout the entire National Forest System.\n  The need for this additional funding is highlighted in the State of \nColorado. In Colorado, the Forest Service expects to conduct 35,000 \nacres of hazardous fuel reduction work as well as process timber sales \nin insect infested areas. However there is a capacity for more critical \nwork to be done. Colorado has approximately 35,000 additional acres \nthat are approved for hazardous fuel treatments; however the Forest \nService lacks the funds to carry out those treatments. Colorado also \nhas 12,000 acres ready for timber sales that would benefit the fire and \ninsect situation but for lack of funding are not being carried out in \nfiscal year 2006. I use Colorado as an example, but this problem exists \nthroughout the Western United States where extended drought and insect \ninfestations have created dangerous conditions ripe for catastrophic \nfires in 2006. It represents a true emergency. Waiting to address this \nissue in the fiscal year 2007 appropriations\n\n[[Page S3879]]\n\nprocess is not a viable option; the 2006 fire season is already upon us \nin the West, and these funds are needed immediately.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Senate for recognizing this emergency on \nthe national forests throughout the country.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate?\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I thank the chairman.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 3736) was agreed to.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Mississippi as \nwell as the floor manager from Washington, my distinguished friends, \nfor their assistance on this important issue.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, what is the pending amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Coburn amendment is the pending amendment.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3810\n\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside the \npending business so I may call up my amendment No. 3810.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Illinois [Mr. Obama] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 3810.\n\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To provide that none of the funds appropriated by this Act \n   may be made available for hurricane relief and recovery contracts \n    exceeding $500,000 that are awarded using procedures other than \n                        competitive procedures)\n\n       On page 253, between lines 19 and 20, insert the following:\n\n\n            ACCOUNTABILITY IN HURRICANE RECOVERY CONTRACTING\n\n       Sec. 7032. None of the funds appropriated by this Act that \n     are made available for relief and recovery efforts related to \n     Hurricane Katrina and the other hurricanes of the 2005 season \n     may be used by an executive agency to enter into any Federal \n     contract exceeding $500,000 through the use of procedures \n     other than competitive procedures as required by the Federal \n     Acquisition Regulation and, as applicable, section 303(a) of \n     the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 \n     (41 U.S.C. 253(a)) or section 2304(a) of title 10, United \n     States Code.\n\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, to begin with, I thank the floor managers \non this bill for their help in finding the time to call up this \namendment. I would love to get advice from the Senator from Colorado in \nterms of how to unanimously get an amendment accepted.\n  After the devastation of Hurricane Katrina, millions of Americans \nopened their hearts, their homes, and their wallets to help the victims \nin the gulf coast. Even before Katrina's winds and rains died down, \nAmericans across the country called national hotlines and pledged their \nhard-earned dollars, their time, and their prayers to the relief \neffort.\n  But they didn't just pledge--they also delivered. They delivered to \nthe tune of $3.5 billion. Many of these donations came from working-\nclass families who didn't have much to give, but they gave what they \ncould.\n  Like the American people, President Bush made a pledge after the \ndisaster. He pledged he would provide the gulf coast with the Federal \nassistance it needed to get back on its feet. With the bill now before \nus, the total amount of Federal funding for hurricane recovery will \nexceed $100 billion, and it is safe to say more money will be needed in \nthe months and years to come.\n  But in order to make good on the President's pledge, we need to do \nmore. We need to pledge to be responsible stewards of taxpayer dollars. \nWe owe this to the Americans who donated their own funds to hurricane \nrelief efforts and to those who trust us each day with the tax money \nthey send to Washington. Unfortunately, we haven't done a very good job \nso far of delivering on this pledge.\n  Yesterday, Senator Coburn and I came to the floor to detail the \nnumerous instances of waste, fraud, and abuse in the use of Katrina \nfunds. We know that FEMA spent nearly $880 million in taxpayer money on \n25,000 temporary housing trailers stored around the country, including \n11,000 that are currently rusting away in a field in Arkansas.\n  There are reports of prime contractors charging upward of $30 per \ncubic yard for debris removal--work that actually costs subcontractors \nas little as $6 per cubic yard.\n  As the Washington Post reported, four large companies are charging \n1,500-percent markups--1,500-percent markups--to cover damaged roofs \nwith plastic tarps.\n  Senator Coburn and I have tried to address these problems by offering \na sensible package of amendments to ensure fiscal accountability and \ntransparency. We have proposed the appointment of a chief financial \nofficer to oversee the spending of Federal funding. We have proposed \nlimits on the amount of overhead expenses a contractor can charge the \nFederal Government, and we have proposed that the details of all large \nKatrina contracts be posted on the Internet.\n  Unfortunately, these amendments are not germane now that cloture has \nbeen invoked. I think that is unfortunate. It is unfortunate because \nthe interests of the American taxpayer are not being well served by \nthis body. Even though we will have appropriated well over $100 billion \nby the end of this week for Katrina relief and recovery, we haven't put \nin any accountability systems to ensure that the money is well spent.\n  I am aware that I am new to this body, but I am troubled that Senate \nrules are getting in the way of sound policy. I understand that is how \nthe Senate works, so Senator Coburn and I are here to offer one modest \namendment to protect taxpayer dollars. Our amendment addresses no-bid \ncontracting and is germane to the underlying bill.\n  Immediately after the hurricane, FEMA awarded four $100 million no-\nbid contracts to four large companies--400 million taxpayer dollars--\nwithout full and open competition. Acting FEMA director David Paulison \nwas asked about these contracts when he testified before the Senate \nHomeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee on October 6, \n2005, and he said the following:\n\n       I have been a public servant for a long time and I have \n     never been a fan of no-bid contracts. Sometimes you have to \n     do them because of the expediency of getting things done. And \n     I can assure you that we are going to look at all of those \n     contracts very carefully. All of those no-bid contracts, we \n     are going to go back and rebid.\n\n  Senator Coburn and I expected Director Paulison to stick to his word \nand rebid these contracts. But a month and a half passed, and the \ncontracts still had not been rebid. So last November, we introduced an \namendment to the tax reconciliation bill expressing the sense of the \nSenate that FEMA should immediately rebid these contracts. Our \ncolleagues agreed and the amendment passed by unanimous consent.\n  After our amendment passed, both Senator Coburn and I met again with \nDirector Paulison and again he assured us these contracts would be \nrebid. Yet, surprisingly enough, these contracts still have not been \nrebid. And to add insult to injury, FEMA said in March that the \ncontracts would not be rebid after all. In fact, the contracts have \nactually been extended, despite the fact that GAO found three of these \nfour firms had wasted millions of dollars in taxpayer funds.\n  The abuse doesn't stop with these four contracts. We learned 2 weeks \nago that the Army Corps of Engineers missed an opportunity to negotiate \na lower price on a $40 million contract for portable classrooms in \nMississippi. Instead, a no-bid and overpriced contract was awarded to \nan out-of-State firm. I have often heard it said that the definition of \ninsanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a \ndifferent result. Frankly, what we are doing with Katrina funding \nborders on insanity. We in Congress keep\n\n[[Page S3880]]\n\non trusting FEMA to enter into competitive contracts even though there \nis no evidence that it has any intention of doing so.\n\n  The amendment we are offering today is only our effort to say enough \nis enough. Our amendment requires all Federal agencies to follow \ncompetitive bidding procedures for any Katrina-related contracts \nexceeding $500,000. It is a commonsense amendment. It is a good-\ngovernment amendment. Eight months after Katrina, there is no longer \nany emergency that justifies a no-bid contract that might have been \nentered into in the days after Katrina. If there is an emergency, it is \ngetting control of how the money is being spent by FEMA.\n  The American people deserve the benefits of competition on Government \ncontracts. Competition is good for American business. It is also good \nfor government. It helps ensure high quality and low cost. That is what \nthe American people have the right to expect. That is what our \namendment seeks to deliver.\n  Before we spend another dollar in the gulf coast, let's make sure we \nhave some transparency and accountability in place to ensure that \nFederal money is helping those people who need it the most, instead of \nlining the pockets of contractors. In our rush to give money to the \ngulf coast 8 months ago, we didn't do that. It was understandable. We \nwere all shell-shocked by what had happened. But the American people, \nand more importantly the victims of Katrina, have paid a heavy price. I \nurge we not repeat that mistake. I urge my colleagues to support \nSenator Coburn and me in this effort.\n  Mr. President, I understand the Senator from Oklahoma does not wish \nto speak on the amendment, so I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  Is there further debate? If not, the question is on agreeing to the \namendment. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. The following Senator was necessarily absent: the \nSenator from Wyoming (Mr. Enzi).\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Mr. President, I withdrew amendments for things I still \ndo not agree with that are in this bill. I am not going to spend the \ntime in the Senate now, but I will spend the time before we have the \nfinal vote on this bill to discuss what is in this bill that is not \nemergency, that is not an obligation by the Federal Government, that is \nnot prudent or fiscally wise. I will not spend the time on that at this \ntime.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 3641, Division XIX\n\n  Mr. COBURN. I ask unanimous consent division XIX be brought up.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chambliss). The measure is pending.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, this is an amendment that removes $11.3 \nmillion from our Corps of Engineers, Sacramento River Bank Protection \nProject in California.\n  I have no lack of understanding of the potential flooding problems \noccurring in San Francisco and south of there in California and the way \nthe rain patterns have changed. I am not wishing to defeat anything \nthat will make a real difference on that.\n  This amendment is about a program that is 46 years old that, \naccording to the Corps' own statement, is 95 percent complete, that we \nhave already spent $131 million on, that $10.6 million is being spent \nthis year, as we speak, on this program.\n  In this supplemental, they are asking for another $11 million for \nthis program. I don't doubt that the $11 million will be needed. But it \nwon't even get there under this emergency supplemental, through the \nCorps' own admission, until after September when the new year starts.\n  First of all, it does not meet the definition of ``emergency,'' that \nit should meet in coming through this bill.\n  What does this program do? This program solves and prevents levee \nerosion problems while providing fish and wildlife mitigation. That is \nwhat the program does. It has been going since 1960.\n  We had $6.3 million included in the energy and water appropriations \nbill last year and an additional $10.96 million. The Corps also stated \nthat $57 million more is needed for the final completion of this \nproject.\n  This says a lot about the Corps of Engineers and their ability to get \nthings done. Although I might agree we need to eventually spend the \nmoney for this project, it certainly ought to be paid for and come out \nof the energy and water appropriations because the money will not get \nthere to be utilized. They have not even spent the money appropriated \non the spend-out this year.\n  I am not, in substance, against completing this project. It comes \nback to the same things we have been talking about. Is it an emergency \nthat we do it now? And if, in fact, it is an emergency, will the money \nget there and make a difference? It won't.\n  I am asking this go through the regular process, through the energy \nand water appropriations, that it be authorized to the extent that the \nSenators from California would like to have it, and that we do it in \nregular order.\n\n[[Page S3881]]\n\n  It would be different if we thought this money was really going to \nmake a difference with the problems in California, but it is not. It \nwill not change one thing in terms of how the Corps operates this \nprogram this year. By the time the money would get there, it would have \nto be reprogrammed anyhow.\n  I have some other problems with this program. Ask yourself: If we \nhave spent $131 million plus $6.3 million, $137 million already, and \nthe Corps says it is 95 percent complete, and then they say they need \nanother $51 million to complete it, how can it be 95 percent complete?\n  This is not about the need. This is about the inefficiencies within \nthe Corps. This is about whether we can get the money to solve a \nproblem that is deemed an emergency at this time, but I seriously doubt \nwhether that has been the fact.\n  The Corps has been cited on numerous occasions by the GAO for its \ninability to predict costs, stay within the forecasted budget. In fact, \nsome of GAO's strong criticisms have come in regard to this very work \nin the Sacramento area.\n  I made the point in an earlier amendment with Senator Obama that the \nCorps made $5 a cubic yard on everything we removed in Katrina. That is \nover 30 million cubic yards. That is $150 million the Corps took out of \nthe Homeland Security and the emergency appropriations. Why don't we \nspend that money on this? Why do we borrow more money against our \nchildren and grandchildren to accomplish this worthy goal?\n\n  When I ask those questions, we do not get any answers. No one answers \nthe question, can we efficiently be good stewards of our children and \nour grandchildren's money? When is enough enough? If this project is, \nindeed, an emergency, as we are being told, we need to be asking the \ntough questions. How long does it take to shore up levees near \nSacramento--46 years for the Corps to do this job? I have a real \nsneaking suspicion 10 years from now the Corps will continue to ask us \nfor money to shore up levees in Sacramento. And if that is the case and \nthey have not completed it, it means they will not have done a good job \non the very job we ask them to do, which is something I contend anyway.\n  These funds may, in fact, be needed. If that is the case, the Corps \nof Engineers has failed miserably.\n  I intend, in my oversight committee, to ask for an explanation of \nevery penny the Corps has spent on the river bank protection near \nSacramento. Representatives of this city and taxpayers all across the \ncountry should be outraged regarding the irresponsibility of the Corps \nin carrying out this project. Forty years and over $130 million later, \nwe are asked to give the Corps an additional $11 million in emergency \nappropriations, money we will have to borrow, all because the Corps \ncannot do its job correctly the first, third, fourth, fifth, up to the \n46th time.\n  Enough is enough. No venture would ever continue to receive such high \nfunding with this track record.\n  Two other questions I think should be asked. Does the Corps lack the \nresources to fund the emergency needs? According to the Office of \nManagement and Budget, the Corps of Engineers had $4.5 billion in \nunobligated balances last year and has an estimate of $5.8 billion in \nunobligated balances this year. According to the Corps itself, as of \nMarch 30, their unobligated scheduled carryover was $1.49 billion. They \nhave the money to do this right now.\n  The Sacramento Corps office will have unobligated balances by the end \nof 2006 in excess of $13.5 million.\n  I ask again: Why are we going to borrow money when we have the money? \nIf, in fact, it is an emergency, the Corps has the money in unobligated \nbalances to accomplish it. All we need is an authorization to do that.\n  How do we prioritize Federal funds in California? In fiscal year \n2006, California has 549 earmarks costing $733 million. In addition, it \nreceived $10 million in earmarks for museums alone. That expenditure \nalone would have been enough to pay for nearly all of this requested \nwork.\n  Are the following museum earmarks more important than protecting the \ncity of Sacramento: $200,000 for the California State Mining and \nMineral Museum; $550,000 for development and construction of Noah's \nPark at the Skirball Cultural Center; $4.35 million for repairs of Sala \nBurton Maritime Museum, in San Francisco; $300,000 to the city of San \nJacinto for improvements to the museum/Extudillo property; $175,000 for \nthe M.H. de Young Memorial Museum; $500,000 for the construction of a \nmuseum also at the San Francisco Fine Arts Museum.\n  Just the museum earmarks alone would take care of this. So instead, \nwhat we are going to do, we are going to borrow money because we do not \nhave the money to pay for this.\n  Attempting to attach more funds for the project, the project in its \n46th year, outside of the regular budget process, is an abuse of \ntaxpayer resources, takes advantage of the emergency appropriations \nprocess intended to deal only with the most urgent and immediate needs \nof the devastated gulf region, and to provide for our soldiers in \nbattle.\n  Senator Boxer said on May 1, 2005, the war should be paid for in the \nbudget, not in an emergency supplemental. The war is known. The cost of \nthe war was anticipated by some people that this administration fired. \nThe cost of this war is spinning out of control.\n  The same can be said for this project. This project was authorized in \n1960. It has received over $100 million and its future costs are known. \nThis should be addressed in the regular appropriations process, not in \nan emergency supplemental.\n  With that, I yield the floor, and I offer time to the opponents of my \namendment.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I am joined in the Senate by my friend \nand colleague, Senator Boxer. We are joined at the hip in opposition to \nthis. If there ever was a disaster waiting to happen, it is the levee \nsituation in the State of California. I will take a few minutes to \nexplain why.\n  Let me begin with this fact. We have a comparison of flood protection \nlevels for major river cities. Sacramento is the only city in the \nNation with 85-year protection. All comparable cities--New Orleans, \n250-year flood protection; Omaha, 250 years; Dallas, 500 years; Kansas \nCity, St. Louis, Tacoma, 500 years.\n\n  The problem is, much of this area is 20 feet or more below the river, \nbelow the flood basins.\n  I stood in a home in Sacramento on Saturday. It was 20 feet below the \nlevel of the river. That is the problem. The sedimentary base of soils \nthere is peat, and it is easily crumbled.\n  What you have are 2,600 miles of levees--some owned by the Federal \nGovernment, some by the State, some by private owners. These levees \nbecome eroded. And because of the heavy rain--the heaviest rainfall, I \nbelieve, that I can remember in California--there is deep concern about \nthese levees.\n  Let me show you the specific area we are talking about. Shown in this \npicture is the Sacramento Pocket Area. The Governor, Mr. Pombo of the \nHouse, and a number of other public officials were right in this area--\nstanding right here--a short time ago. We flew over the area. These are \nhomes, all 20 feet below the river area. There are several places in \nthis area that are priority needs for restoration immediately.\n  The Governor has declared a state of emergency. The Governor has \nadvanced State moneys. The Governor has said this is of urgent \npriority. The fact of the matter is, at any time, places along this \nlevee could go. You would flood 100,000 people in 20 feet of water. \nMany would be unable to evacuate. You would have real catastrophe.\n  The Army Corps of Engineers, through Colonel Light, the commander of \nthe Sacramento District, came back. We sat down with Senator Cochran, \nthe chairman of the committee, Senator Byrd, Senator Domenici, and \nSenator Reid. It was all explained that there is an emergency. \nEarthquake probabilities, for a major earthquake equal to 1906 in San \nFrancisco or higher, are 62 percent by 2030. If there is an earthquake \nequal to what took place in California, the likelihood is that this \nentire area would be flooded and hundreds of thousands of people could \nbe involved.\n  Now, this bill provides $23 million in contingent emergency funding. \nThis particular division is $11.3 million. Funding would become \navailable only if the President requests the money and certifies that \nit is an emergency.\n\n[[Page S3882]]\n\n  As I say, on February 24, the Governor proclaimed this state of \nemergency. He cited 24 critical erosion sites. That has been changed to \n29 because of ongoing erosions due to the current high water level.\n  Today, there are 400 people from Sacramento who were worried enough \nabout it that they have come to the Capitol to lobby for these funds. \nThe money can become available as soon as the President signs the bill \nand certifies the contingent emergency.\n  The Sacramento River Bank Protection Project is the Federal project \nthat repairs these critical erosion sites. This additional funding will \nensure that these sites are repaired in this construction season. Both \nthe State, Senator Boxer, and I have looked very carefully: Is this \nmoney that could be used this fiscal year, before the end of September, \non these sites? The answer is clearly, yes.\n  Today, President Bush announced he is expediting environmental review \nto allow construction work on the sites to proceed as quickly as \npossible.\n  So President Bush, Governor Schwarzenegger, and the Senate \nAppropriations Committee all recognize how important it is to repair \nthe weakened levees along the Sacramento River.\n  Mr. President, 174 actively eroding sites on levee banks have been \nidentified. The highest priority is 29 of these sites. That is what we \nare trying to repair as soon as possible to prevent subdivisions, such \nas this one shown in this picture, from being inundated with 20 feet of \nwater.\n  I stood there. I saw it. I saw the difference in height. And that is \na phenomenon on the levee. Some might say housing should have never \nbeen built there, but the fact is it was.\n  The critical sites we are asking money for stretch along 137 miles of \nthe Sacramento River. They include areas of the river in the city of \nSacramento, and that is this pocket area.\n  Now, these homes sit virtually in the shadow of the levee system, and \nmodeling by Sacramento show that a breached levee would result in the \narea flooding to depths of 17 to 20 feet.\n  This area is called the ``Pocket'' because the homes sit in a pocket \nby a broad curve in the river.\n  Mr. President, 33,000 homes are here; 100,000 people live right here. \nColonel Light, the commander of the Sacramento District of the Corps, \nhas indicated to me, to Senator Cochran, to Senator Byrd, to Senator \nDomenici, to Senator Reid, that this money can be utilized by the Corps \nnow. The reason they cannot transfer funds is because prior legislation \nof this body and the other body prohibits the transfer of funds above a \ncertain amount in a timely and effective manner.\n\n  The repairs consist largely of armoring the levees with rock. Of the \n29 sites, repairs for 5 have been designed already, and the remainder \nwill be designed in the next few months.\n  I do not need to tell you what a major flood would do. I do not need \nto tell you that these rivers are at historic highs right now. And it \nis as the river begins to decline that they worry most because the fear \nis the water subsiding will take with it portions of this levee.\n  The work has to be done.\n  It is kind of interesting. I often tell a story of when I was mayor, \nand the director of Public Works came to me and said: Madam Mayor, I \nthink if there was an earthquake, the rim of Candlestick Park would \ncome down. And I thought: What is the likelihood of that? I said: How \nmuch does it cost? He told me. And then I thought: I now know this. I \nhave an obligation to do something about it. We found the money. We \nrepaired the rim. And who would have thought that the Giants would have \nbeen in the second game of the World Series, at 5 o'clock, when the \nLoma Prieta earthquake hit, and the rim of Candlestick Park--had it \ncome down--would have killed 20,000 people sitting directly below it.\n  I am telling you that these levee banks could breach. I am telling \nyou that 100,000 people and 33,000 homes--as shown right here--could \nlose their lives and their homes. And the evacuation difficulty is \nenormous.\n  It seems to me that once we know this as public officials, we have an \nabsolute obligation to do something about it.\n  The Appropriations Committee has agreed. The money can be used this \nfiscal year. And both my colleague and I believe very strongly we \nshould vote ``no'' on this amendment.\n  I would like to yield the floor to my colleague. I know she is here \nsomewhere.\n  Mr. COBURN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I certainly will.\n  Mr. COBURN. When you were changing Candlestick Park, you did not \nborrow money from future generations of Americans to do that? You found \nit within the budget? I believe that is correct; is it not?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Well, it is interesting. City and county budgets have \nto be balanced. The only budgets that do not have to be balanced are \nthe State budget, at least in California, and the Federal budget. But \nwe had to balance our budget, so, yes, I did have to find the money by \ntaking it from other places. That is true.\n  Mr. COBURN. Will the Senator yield for an additional question?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I will.\n  Mr. COBURN. I have said I do not deny this work needs to be done. Can \nyou foresee that the environmental impact assessments for all this will \nbe completed in time for this money to be used this fiscal year?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Yes. Because I am told the declaration of emergency \nby the State and the contingent emergency by the President, which he \nsaid he would declare this morning, effectively clears that for this \nparticular work on these particular high-priority sites.\n  Mr. COBURN. Will the Senator yield for one additional question?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Yes, I will.\n  Mr. COBURN. Does it concern you at all that over the 46 years of this \nproject the engineering by the Corps of Engineers for these levees is \nrequiring them to go back now, in 29 places, and fix what they should \nhave done right the first time? Does that concern you at all?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Well, of course it does. Of course it concerns me. \nBut we learn in this business. And I think Katrina was a big learning \nlesson for all of us. And we have not done right by our infrastructure.\n  One of the problems is, as we have to cut discretionary spending that \nis nondefense, not entitlements, the only thing we are cutting--we are \ncutting 18 percent of what we spend every year. These are Federal \nlevees. They are owned by the Federal Government. There is a \nresponsibility to protect the people behind them.\n  Mr. COBURN. Will the Senator yield for one additional question?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Of course.\n  Mr. COBURN. Would it make sense to you that we could, in a \nsupplemental, change the authorization under the emergency process so \nthat the Sacramento Corps could use their $13.5 million they are going \nto have in unobligated balances at the end of this year? We could do \nthat just as well as borrow an additional $10.9 million against our \nchildren; could we not?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Well, I have not looked at this. I was at the Napa \nRiver, where we have a big flood project, and there is a problem there. \nThe corps there told me they could not transfer funds above a certain \namount. And I believe there was some provision in a prior supplemental \nto prevent the transferring of that money.\n  Let me say this to the Senator. Do I believe this is a life \nemergency? Yes. Do I believe that any day these 100,000 people and \n33,000 homes could be flooded? Yes. Why? Because I know they are 20 \nfeet below the water level. I know the water level is the highest it \nhas ever been. I know the levees are eroded. I know what they call \n``boils'' are popping up all over.\n  I know it could happen. And when it happens, it happens so fast \nbecause there is so much water. So because I know it, and now you know \nit, we have an obligation to do something about it. And that is what \nthe Government is here for: to save lives in the event of an emergency.\n  We also know that earthquake probabilities are way up, and this could \nbe devastating. So this work has to be done. We are asking for money in \nthe Energy and Water bill. We will have additional money there. We are \ngoing through the regular channels. But this high priority work should \nbe done now. And we should get the money there as fast as we possibly \ncan.\n  It could happen tomorrow, it could happen the next day, the next \nweek. I\n\n[[Page S3883]]\n\ncould not live with myself if it happened, and, respectfully, you could \nnot live with yourself if it happened because you now know it can \nhappen.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I wish to say to Senator Feinstein how \nmuch I appreciate her leadership on this in the Appropriations \nCommittee. I wish to say to the chairman of the committee how much I \nappreciate his understanding of what we are going through in our State \nwith historic rains, historic flooding. I thank the Appropriations \nCommittee for listening to Senator Feinstein when she transmitted a \nrequest from the two of us and also from our Governor. This is a \nbipartisan request.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a letter \nwritten to Senator Coburn from Governor Schwarzenegger. I also ask \nunanimous consent to have printed in the Record information regarding \nthe Sacramento region.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                              State of California,\n\n\n                                       Office of the Governor,\n\n                                      Sacramento, CA, May 2, 2006.\n     Hon. Tom Coburn,\n     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Coburn: I am writing regarding your proposed \n     amendment to the supplemental appropriations bill that seeks \n     to block additional funds needed to repair California's \n     Central Valley levee system.\n       As you may know, I am working very closely with Senator \n     Feinstein and members of the California Congressional \n     Delegation to secure additional federal funds to share in the \n     costs of repairing California's Central Valley levee system. \n     The need for funding and quick action could not be more \n     urgent and that is why I have made it my top priority to work \n     with our State Legislature to enact a major infrastructure \n     bond initiative that would dedicate $2.5 billion in state \n     funds for urgently needed levee repairs along this federally \n     authorized flood control system.\n       Our work to restore structural integrity to our levee \n     system began over a year ago. We cannot wait for a disaster \n     to strike and must use the lessons of Katrina and act now. \n     Prior to Katrina, New Orleans had a 250-year level of flood \n     protection. Sacramento has a 100-year level of flood \n     protection. This is the lowest of any major city in the \n     United States. It is only a matter of time before there is a \n     significant levee breach or system failure. Such an event \n     would flood valuable farmland that produces food for the \n     entire nation. All of Sacramento and other Central Valley \n     towns would be flooded. According to modeling done by the \n     City and County of Sacramento, a single levee breach would \n     cause flooding in many areas of the City with depths over 15 \n     feet. A flood event of this magnitude would cut off Southern \n     California's water supply. Such an event would also cause a \n     major economic disruption in California and across the \n     nation. Most troubling is without action, the lives of \n     thousands of Californians are at risk.\n       As you know, Senators Feinstein and Boxer have worked very \n     closely with Chairmen Cochran and Domenici to include funds \n     in the pending supplemental appropriations bill for certain \n     levee and flood control improvements in the Sacramento \n     region. These funds are for identified improvements that can \n     be completed this fiscal year in federally authorized flood \n     control projects.\n       I support these funds and want to assure you that this is a \n     necessary and urgent time for Congress to act. Moreover, any \n     investment at this time decreases the chances that Congress \n     will have to respond in the future with another far more \n     expensive emergency funding bill to address a widespread \n     flood disaster in California.\n       I ask that you recognize this as necessary emergency \n     funding and support this as part of the supplemental \n     appropriations bill.\n           Sincerely,\n     Arnold Schwarzenegger.\n                                  ____\n\n\n  THE SACRAMENTO REGION IS AT GREATER RISK OF FLOODING THAN ANY OTHER \n MAJOR U.S. METROPOLITAN AREA--FULL FEDERAL PARTNERSHIP IS CRITICAL TO \n                      PROTECTING THIS VITAL REGION\n\n                      Sacramento: A Region at Risk\n\n       The city of Sacramento is at the confluence of two great \n     rivers, the Sacramento and the American. And while these \n     rivers help shape the Sacramento region's identity, they also \n     pose a very real, very serious risk--flooding.\n       A catastrophic flood will devastate lives, property and the \n     economy. Nearly a half-million residents who make the city of \n     Sacramento their home will be impacted. That number grows to \n     over 2.2 million people within the six-county region \n     surrounding the city. Regionally, one million jobs will be \n     affected by a catastrophic flood and the direct and indirect \n     economic loss of property and economic activity could total \n     nearly $30 billion. The Sacramento region represents over \n     $73.3 billion annually in gross regional product.\n       A major flood in the Sacramento region will send economic \n     shockwaves rippling throughout the region and state. These \n     include serious impacts to principal transportation arteries \n     such as interstates 5 and 80, railway thoroughfares, and \n     Sacramento International Airport. This jeopardizes over $2.6 \n     billion in Central Valley agriculture and livestock \n     production--a vital national resource.\n       The Sacramento region is a civic, commercial, healthcare \n     and economic hub for greater California and must be \n     protected. The Sacramento region serves as the capital of \n     California--the world's sixth largest economy. Sacramento \n     area levees protect nearly one million acres of farmland in \n     the Sacramento Valley. At least 10 major hospital facilities \n     are found within the region. In addition, the Sacramento \n     metropolitan region serves as a ``nucleus'' for state and \n     federal civic activity, providing a home to 1,300 government \n     facilities supplying over 200,000 public sector jobs.\n       Given all that the city, region, state and even the nation \n     stand to lose, it is astonishing that the Sacramento region \n     has the lowest level of flood protection of any major U.S. \n     metropolitan area. The 1986 high-water event demonstrated the \n     region's population centers are extremely vulnerable. It is \n     estimated that six hours of additional rain during that time \n     would have led to catastrophic failure of the region's flood \n     protection system.\n       Since 1986, federal, state and local interests have \n     invested over $400 million in levee improvements, reservoir \n     re-operations and floodplain restoration, but critical flood \n     protection deficits, including erosion, stability, levee \n     heights and underseepage, still exist. These deficits prevent \n     the Sacramento region from achieving even 100-year flood \n     protection in many places and have made flood protection the \n     Sacramento regional Congressional delegation's number one \n     public safety issue.\n       Sacramento must achieve a minimum of 200-year flood \n     protection immediately.\n\n              Full Federal Partnership: A Critical Element\n\n       While local and state leadership are unified in making \n     flood protection a priority, it is essential that FY 2007 \n     appropriations fully fund the $89,240,000 federal share of \n     Sacramento's authorized flood protection program. \n     Appropriations are critical to continuing levee improvements \n     on the Sacramento and American rivers and Folsom Dam--a \n     necessary part of protecting the region's livelihood and \n     achieving a minimum of 200-year flood protection.\n       Similarly, it is essential that federal partners support \n     and reward state and local efforts to enhance flood \n     protection. These efforts, which are sustained by state and \n     local funding initiatives, should be incorporated into the \n     traditional federal/local flood protection partnership using \n     appropriate crediting and reimbursement arrangements. This is \n     necessary in order to expedite project permitting, \n     contracting, and construction activities.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. I am going to read part of this letter. He says:\n\n       Our work to restore structural integrity to our levee \n     system began over a year ago. We cannot wait for a disaster \n     to strike and must use the lessons of Katrina and act now. \n     Prior to Katrina, New Orleans had a 250-year level of flood \n     protection.\n\n  And then the Governor says:\n\n       Sacramento has 100-year level of flood protection.\n\n  That is optimistic. Most experts tell us that it is an 85-year level. \nAnd whether it is 85 years or 100 years, it is the lowest of any major \ncity in the U.S.\n  The Governor writes:\n\n       It is only a matter of time before there is a significant \n     levee breach or system failure.\n\n  This is important for the Senator from Oklahoma to hear. I know he \nhas been very gracious in filling me in on this and saying: I didn't go \nafter your other items but just this one. But the fact is, this one is \nas important as all the rest. The Corps has told us they need these \nfunds to move forward.\n  Here is what the Governor says:\n\n       Such [a flooding] event would flood valuable farmland that \n     produces food for [our] entire nation.\n\n  I say to my friend from Oklahoma, please, listen to us, because the \nfood supply for the entire Nation is at stake, according to Governor \nSchwarzenegger, Senator Feinstein, myself, and a bipartisan delegation \nin the Congress.\n  The Governor says:\n\n       All of Sacramento and other Sacramento Valley towns would \n     be flooded. According to modeling [that has been done], a \n     single levee breach would cause flooding in many areas of the \n     City with depths over 15 feet. A flood event of this \n     magnitude would cut off Southern California's water supply.\n\n  I say to my friend from Oklahoma, in this body we are all equal, two \nSenators from every State. We have 37 million people in my State. \nSacramento is a huge growth area. I will get into the\n\n[[Page S3884]]\n\nnumbers in a minute. We are not talking about a few people being hurt. \nWe are talking about a catastrophe. We are talking about farmland. We \nare talking about the State's water supply. About two-thirds of the \nwater supply in the State comes from that northern area.\n  When my friend started, he was very nice and said he doesn't doubt \nthe fact that the Sacramento levees are a problem, and that San \nFrancisco has been having problems. I wrote down what he said. He said: \nSan Francisco and the area south of there. This is the area north of \nSan Francisco. This is Sacramento. I don't think my friend really, with \nall due respect, gets the intricacies of what we are dealing with here. \nThere is a difference between north of San Francisco and south because \nnorth of San Francisco is where we have delta--again, two-thirds of the \nwater supply of our State--the farmland and all the rest. South of San \nFrancisco, we have Silicon Valley. That has other issues. But right \nnow, we are talking about the Sacramento area, which is north.\n  The Governor goes on to talk about the economic disruption. Because \nwe are such a large State, people say when California sneezes, the \ncountry gets a cold. It is an expression that speaks to the power of \nour State in terms of economic productivity. And in terms of the goods \ncoming across into the ports of California and going all across into \nyour State and everybody else's--this region is the bread basket. So we \nask you to back off this amendment.\n  This is so not a partisan issue. The Governor writes:\n\n       As you know, Senators Feinstein and Boxer have worked \n     closely with Chairmen Cochran and Domenici to include funds \n     in the pending supplemental . . . for certain levee and flood \n     control improvements . . .\n       I support these funds and want to assure you that this is a \n     necessary and urgent time for Congress to act.\n\n  The Governor came here. He met with Senator Domenici and many \nSenators. He said:\n\n     . . . any investment at this time decreases the chances that \n     Congress will have to respond in the future with another far \n     more expensive emergency funding bill to address a widespread \n     flood disaster in California.\n\n  I ask that you recognize this as a necessary emergency funding bill. \nSupport this.\n  I want to show a picture. Senator Feinstein showed us a version of \nthis. They all tell a story better than I could. Here you have the \nSacramento River. Here you have thousands and thousands of people. Here \nyou have the levees, and here you have the riverbed. And what has \nhappened, if my friend would like to take a look at this--I know he \ndoesn't question that we need a project; he questions whether it \nbelongs in this bill. I understand.\n  Mr. COBURN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Yes.\n  Mr. COBURN. I question how we are paying for it. We are borrowing the \nmoney from future generations to do it rather than make the hard \ndecisions of trimming something else. That is important.\n  Mrs. BOXER. That is what I just said. I said the Senator doesn't \noppose us doing this. He doesn't want it in this bill. That is my \nunderstanding of his position. I couldn't disagree with you more. When \nmy friend quoted me and I said Iraq should have been in the budget, \nthat is exactly how I feel, because we knew about it. Frankly, we \ndidn't know about this, that we were going to have the kind of events \nwe have had, the rain and the rain and the rain. I will go into the \ndetails of how much rain we have had compared to other years and the \nfact that anything can happen now.\n  The weather patterns are changing. When I lived in the bay area in \nCalifornia so many years ago, it is too long to remember, when I first \ncame here in the 1960s, you never had rain in March, let alone April. \nIt was dry. It was dry really from mid-February on. It has been moving \nforward, and we have March as one of the rainiest months and then \nApril. We had a month this year--April--where we had rain almost every \nday. It is unheard of. You can see how muddy this is. You can see the \nbreaks here in the riverbank.\n\n  I will show you another picture on the other side where there is not \nas much development but the same thing has occurred. These trees were \non the other side of the riverbank. Look at these trees. They are now \nburied in the water. So if we don't go ahead with the Corps now, when \nthe Corps tells us we need to do this now, we are going to lose this \nriverbank. We are going to lose the levees. And then it is too late.\n  My friend says he wants to save money. It reminds me of the old adage \nof penny wise and pound foolish. It is a colloquialism, but the fact \nis, you have to prevent things. This is an emergency circumstance, as \nthe Governor said. These levees could break. Now we have a snowmelt. \nThat snowmelt occurs, that water gets deeper, the pressure in that \nriver increases, and the riverbank begins to disappear, leaving those \nlevees exposed.\n  I wish to refer to a document put together by the Chamber of Commerce \nin Sacramento. It reads, ``Sacramento: A Region at Risk.'' Cities and \ncounties don't like to say, especially chambers of commerce, we are at \nrisk. They don't like to say that because they want to have investment. \nThey want people to come in. They don't go about saying: We are in \ndanger. And when a chamber of commerce goes out and says: We are in \ndanger--and these are Republicans mostly, and these are as conservative \nas my friend from Oklahoma; they know that an investment is not \nwasteful spending if, in fact, we are going to save money at the end of \nthe day. How much would we have saved if we had built stronger, better \nlevees in Louisiana? Untold, probably billions. I don't think my friend \nis at all a fiscal conservative by taking away $11 million. It is \nreckless. I hope and pray that my colleagues are listening to this \ndebate and are looking at these pictures and understanding what we are \ntalking about.\n  The Sacramento area faces a triple flood threat, and it faces it now. \nWe have a confluence of two major rivers, the threat of a deteriorating \nflood control system, and the threat of near record precipitation this \nyear. We are talking about 165,000 homes, nearly 500,000 residents, the \nState capital, and many businesses providing 200,000 jobs. It is also \nthe hub of the six-county regional economy, providing hundreds of \nthousands of jobs. A major flood along the lower Sacramento or American \nRivers would cripple the region's economy. I will go into that tomorrow \nbecause Senator Feinstein and I each have 15 minutes in the morning. I \nwill save some of my talk for then.\n  California has the world's fifth largest economy, and we are \nquibbling over $11 million that the Corps says it needs to fix up these \nriverbanks. How outrageous, how shortsighted, how foolish. I don't \nunderstand why my friend is doing this. We talked. He feels deeply \nabout it. I respect that. I voted with him a couple of times. I have \nbeen very careful, picking and choosing, sticking with the committee \nwhen I felt the committee was right, joining my friend. But I don't \nunderstand this one. This one is inexplicable.\n  The average family understands that if they have a problem with their \nroof, they fix it. They don't put it off. They fix it so that their \nhome is not destroyed. It is straightforward.\n  Let's look at the pocket again. They call this the pocket of \nSacramento; 112,000 people are at risk, and you can see clearly where \nthis riverbank has deteriorated. On New Year's Day, Californians in the \nnorthern and central parts of our State awoke to flooding that cost the \nState $200 million. We are talking about $11 million so we can mitigate \nwhat comes next. But precipitation after January 1 has kept river \nlevels very high, further stressing and eroding our critical flood \ncontrol infrastructure.\n  Precipitation, including snow pack, as the snows melt, is nearly \ntwice the normal amount, 174 percent of normal, and that is just as of \nlast week. And the snows are just now starting to melt.\n  We have another threat to this area. My colleague, Senator Feinstein, \nsaid it beautifully: How would we feel if we did something on this \nSenate floor today that turned our backs on this issue and then we had \na tragedy?\n  We would not feel very good about it. So I am going to save the rest \nof my talk until tomorrow. But I am going to say to you, Mr. President, \nagain thank you. It is very rare that we have such bipartisan \ncooperation in our State. This is not a Republican issue or a \nDemocratic issue. We will have Republicans suffer if we have a problem \nand\n\n[[Page S3885]]\n\nwe will have Democrats suffer. We are Californians united. Our Governor \nhas recognized the crisis. He declared a state of emergency earlier \nthis year to expedite improvement of this system.\n  Everything we did in this bill we cleared with the Army Corps and \nthey say they can use this money. They need this money. They are going \nto move forward with these repairs. So my friend from Oklahoma can make \nthe case every which way he wants. He can use rhetoric and say anything \nhe wants. The bottom line is this, and I will quote Representative Dan \nLungren, a Republican, who is very well respected among our Republican \nfriends in this body. He said:\n\n       Today the Sacramento region has half the flood protection \n     and twice the risk as did the city of New Orleans prior to \n     Katrina. The cost of recovering from a flood-related disaster \n     far exceeds the price of guarding against it.\n\n  Unlike other issues where we have come to the floor and it has been \nRepublican versus Democrat, I can honestly say to you that I stand here \nrepresenting a bipartisan, strong majority in my State and, hopefully, \nin the Senate, that says this: The 2005 hurricane season taught us some \nhard lessons--that we neglect shoring up eroded and damaged flood \ncontrol infrastructure for major metropolitan areas at our peril.\n  We always say we must learn from history. We must surely learn from \nrecent history. Sometimes we forget history that occurred way back, but \nwe certainly should remember history from a year ago.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote a resounding no on this Coburn amendment \nand to take a stand for innocent people in this valley, in this area, \nthese farmlands, these farmers, and the economy, and don't take out $11 \nmillion that could do so much good to restore these banks.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, the arguments that have been made by the \nSenators from California, in terms of needing to fix things, are \nprobably accurate. But I am sitting here thinking to myself, if it \nwould take only $11 million to take care of this, and to know that the \nearliest this money is going to be there is 8 weeks, if I were Governor \nof California, I would find $11 million. I would get that tomorrow. If \nit is not going to get done tomorrow, we ought to be asking why not, if \nthe threat is that great and it imperils that much of the economy and \nthat many people.\n  I still raise the same questions. I am not denying this needs to get \ndone. I am denying how we pay for it. We are not making the hard \nchoices to cut something else out of the bill to pay for this because \nit is a higher priority. No, what we are doing is taking the money from \nfuture generations because we refuse to make those hard choices.\n  That is what it is all about. We could have reprogrammed money within \nthe Corps to get this done. The Governor could ask the legislature for \n$11 million to get this done starting tomorrow. If there are 29 sites, \nwhat we do know about the Corps is it doesn't do anything fast. In this \nproject, we know what they have done over the last 46 years has not \nbeen sufficient because they are having these problems. We will finish \nthe debate tomorrow morning. The point is, I don't deny that this needs \nto get done. If it is the case that has been made by the Senators from \nCalifornia, then why hasn't it already been done? If there is this \nimpending emergency, why hasn't California ponied up to put up the $11 \nmillion that is so desperately needed right now to pay for it, rather \nthan asking the rest of the country's children and grandchildren? If \nthis bill had come to the floor paid for, I would not be out here. But \nit is not paid for. We are going to go write the bills and bonds to pay \nfor this $11 million. Maybe that is what we should do. Maybe that is \nthe priority we should have. But I would think that the rest of the \nAmerican people ought to say, where are you getting the money?\n  We are not making hard choices. We are passing it down the line. I \nagree if something were to happen, the cost would be much greater. I am \na physician and I believe in prevention. That is what this debate is \nall about, preventing America from becoming a second-rate economy \nbecause we refuse to make hard decisions here on how we spend money. \nThat is what this is about. I don't deny the desire to address this \nissue. That doesn't have anything to do with it. But if it is an \nemergency as described at the present time, why doesn't California fix \nit? Why hasn't California ponied up the $11 million, which is a small \namount there. It is the fifth largest economy in the world. They can \ncome up with $11 million.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. COBURN. Yes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Does the Senator not know that this is a federally \nauthorized project? Is the Senator unaware of that?\n  Mr. COBURN. I understand that.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Cost sharing goes along with this project just as with \nevery other project. So for the Senator to stand up and suggest that we \ndon't pay into this project is simply false.\n  Mr. COBURN. Reclaiming my time, since it is a question, this isn't \nabout whether you pay your share. It is about whether it is an \nemergency. If it is an emergency, then why wasn't it done last time? \nWhy are we going back--why isn't a Corps that spent 46 years doing this \nproject going back to repair what they didn't do right in the first \nplace?\n\n  I am going back to the main point and then I am through. I will talk \nagain in the morning. Where is the money coming from? Had the money \nbeen paid for, I would not be out here. But the money isn't paid for. \nIt is borrowed. So when you take $10.9 million, take your calculator \nout and put it at 30 years and amortize it at 6 percent, you will come \nup to about $55 million. That is what we are actually going to pay to \ndo this $10.9 million because we are borrowing the money. That is my \npoint. I am not against doing it, not against getting it done, against \nprevention. What I am against is borrowing the money against the future \nof this country because we refuse to make the hard choices.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I cannot allow certain things that were \nsaid to go unchallenged. My friend says this is not about paying your \nshare, after he said it was about that. He made a big point, why \ndoesn't California do something? Of course, we are doing something. We \nabide by the law. I have to say to my friend, if something happens in \nCalifornia, a bread basket of this country in many ways, there is going \nto be suffering throughout this country. If something happens to this \neconomy, let alone the 112,000 people who live in this pocket, this \nparticular amendment will put them at greater risk.\n  My friend says he believes in prevention. He is a doctor. I am sure \nhe does and I am sure he does a wonderful job at that. But he doesn't \nbelieve in prevention right now, I will tell you that. Because that is \nwhat Senator Feinstein, Governor Schwarzenegger, and both Democratic \ncandidates for Governor--everybody agrees this has to be done. This is \na Federal project. This is not a State project. This is a Federal \nproject with a State share. The Army Corps has a responsibility which \nthey have stepped up to the plate to do, and they told us they need \nthese funds. As far as not paying for this, we know that emergencies \nget special treatment around here because they are emergencies. My \nfriend says, why is this an emergency? Take a look at this. This isn't \nthe way a river is supposed to look, the way a riverbank is supposed to \nlook. This isn't the way a tree that was on the land is supposed to \nlook, when it was on the other side of the riverbank. When you get the \nsecond highest predicted snow pack melt known to the history since they \nstarted taking down the record, in the history of California, yes, you \nhave an emergency.\n  I know my friend from Oklahoma left the floor. I hope he joins me in \na pay-as-you-go budget because I have voted for that every year. \nFrankly, right before the Bush administration, we had surpluses. Now we \nhave deficits. I will admit that. I support pay-as-you-go budgeting. I \nhave voted for it. We can talk about that another day. But this is a \ntrue emergency, just as I believe funding the veterans home in \nMississippi was, which I was sorry I didn't get a chance to vote on. I \nlistened to the debate. I could hardly believe my ears that the Senator \nfrom Oklahoma\n\n[[Page S3886]]\n\nwas objecting to making sure that our veterans, elderly veterans, could \ngo home. What is wrong? Something is wrong here with these debates. I \ndon't know where the heart is, where the soul is. I don't know where \nthe common sense is.\n  I pray and hope that tomorrow, come morning, we are able to get the \nvotes to keep this funding in the supplemental. Again, I thank Senator \nCochran. I thank the Chair for his patience.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey is recognized.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be set aside.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from New Jersey is recognized.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I want to reiterate my motion simply to \nhave an opportunity to offer an amendment. I think it is an emergency, \nand it is a moral imperative to deal with the issue in Darfur, Sudan. \nSo I hope the mere opportunity to have a debate on the floor of the \nSenate would be allowed.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the pending amendment be set aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? The Senator from Nevada\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Reserving the right to object, I support the Senator from \nNew Jersey. I support the intent of his amendment and realize there is \na severe emergency in Darfur about which many of us feel strongly, and \nwe need to do something there. During consideration of this bill, we \nhave been trying to hold the line on spending, to reprioritize. If \nthere is something else the Senator can offer as an offset for this \nincrease in spending, I would be more than happy to let the amendment \nbe debated and voted on. But without an offset, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard. The Senator from New \nJersey.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I say to my distinguished colleague, if \nI may, that we have talked with both the chairman's staff and with \nothers who express the view that this is a moral imperative and have \nsuggested offsets, none of which have been accepted. So it is very \ndifficult to have a position in which we all agree there is a moral \nimperative to act and then we reject every offset that is proposed.\n  Understanding the Senator's concern, but also understanding that \ngenocide does not have an offset to it, I once again ask unanimous \nconsent that the pending amendment be set aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that there now be \na period for the transaction of morning business, with Senators \npermitted to speak for up to 10 minutes each.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard. The Senator from New \nJersey.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. If I may ask the Presiding Officer a parliamentary \nquestion: If we were to proceed to the Senator's unanimous consent \nrequest, would that obviate the ability to offer an amendment during \nthat time period?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It would.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Then I have to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be set aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Reserving the right to object, what I understand is that \nthe Senator from New Jersey is going to send an amendment to the desk \nthat has an offset for the funding for Darfur, and with that as a \nmodification to the unanimous consent request, I will not object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 3777, as Modified\n\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I call up my amendment that is at the \ndesk with a modification and ask unanimous consent that it be \nconsidered at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report the amendment, as modified.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Jersey [Mr. Menendez], for himself, \n     Mr. Leahy, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Sarbanes, Mr. Lautenberg, Mr. \n     Dodd, and Mr. Obama, proposes an amendment numbered 3777, as \n     modified.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 89, line 9, strike ``$69,800,000, to remain \n     available until September 30, 2007: Provided, That the amount \n     provided under this heading is designated as an emergency \n     requirement pursuant to section 402 of H. Con. Res. 95 (109th \n     Congress), the concurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal \n     year 1006.''. and insert in lieu thereof ``$129,800,000, to \n     remain available until September 30, 2007: Provided, That the \n     amount provided under this heading is designated as an \n     emergency requirement pursuant to section 402 of H. Con. Res. \n     95 (109th Congress), the concurrent resolution on the budget \n     for fiscal year 2006.''.\n       Sec.--Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, the \n     amount provided for ``Diplomatic and Consular Programs'' \n     shall be $1,392,600,000.\n\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, last Sunday, thousands of Americans \ngathered here in Washington, DC, and in other cities across the country \nto focus our attention on the horrific acts being committed a world \naway in Darfur, Sudan. But it wasn't a gathering of the powerful, \nalthough politicians and celebrities were there. It was a gathering of \nthe American community--of high school students, of members of \nsynagogues and colleges, of churches, of people of all races, \nethnicities, and religions. In fact, the movement to stop genocide in \nDarfur has been led by some of the youngest in our society.\n  In New Jersey, students in middle schools have raised funds for \nrefugees. Young people at colleges have led the movement to divest from \nSudan. They are not the leaders of the future; they are the leaders of \ntoday.\n  I know that as I stand here calling for action, I am not alone. In my \nhome State of New Jersey, high school students started a nonprofit \norganization called Help Darfur Now which raises awareness and funds \nfor the refugees in the Sudan.\n  Newark, NJ, is the headquarters of the Darfur Rehabilitation Project, \na national group started by the Sudanese people living in the United \nStates who lobby for humanitarian aid, intervention, and conflict \nresolution in the Sudan. And across the country, Americans are signing \npetitions, participating in marches, holding townhall events and \ncontacting their elected officials to demand that the dire needs of the \nDarfurian people be addressed. It seems to me as representatives of the \npeople, it is our job to act.\n  Here in Congress, many of our fellow colleagues in the Senate and in \nthe House of Representatives have led the fight for real action to \naddress the genocide in Darfur, and I certainly salute them for their \nhard work.\n  When we talk about genocide, it seems to me it is almost impossible \nfor any of us to take the intellectual understanding of what that \nmeans: the number of people killed, over what period of time, and for \nwhat reason, and to comprehend the dimensions of such atrocities.\n  The truth is that each of the estimated 200,000 to 400,000 people \nmurdered in Darfur was a father, a mother, a sister, a daughter, or son \nslaughtered by their own countrymen whose ethnic makeup and religion \nwas similar to their own. Each of these people has a family who mourns \nthem and a community that lost them.\n  Many of us here cannot imagine what life is like for the at least 2 \nmillion\n\n[[Page S3887]]\n\nwho have been displaced in this conflict. Those who have survived have \nthe scars of watching their relatives and neighbors murdered, raped, \nand subjected to other horrors we cannot imagine.\n  For the hundreds of thousands of people who fled to Chad, the terror \ncontinues as they face new attacks in this expanding conflict. Samantha \nPower, who is a Pulitzer Prize winning expert on genocide, has pointed \nout that many women face the essence of a Sophie's choice: They can \neither leave their villages and camps to gather firewood, facing the \nlikelihood of rape or attack by the jingaweit, or starve inside the \ncamp.\n  It is in this dire context that the World Food Program announced that \nit would be forced to cut the rations to feed those who are affected by \nthe conflict in Darfur. This means people already facing a humanitarian \ncrisis will now only receive half of the recommended level of calories \nper day. Even worse are reports that at least 200,000 people have been \ndisplaced since January, and that many of those cannot be reached or \nhelped by aid agencies.\n  A recent article in the New York Times quoted one senior humanitarian \naid official as saying:\n\n       The situation for humanitarian workers and the United \n     Nations has never been as bad as it is now. The space for us \n     to work is just getting smaller and smaller.\n\n  Not surprisingly, the Sudanese Government, which is supporting the \ngroups that conduct this campaign of death and destruction, continues \nto hinder any attempts by the international community to assess the \nsituation and provide aid to the millions of refugees. Just this month, \nthe Sudanese Government denied entry into the country to Mr. Jan \nEgeland, a top U.N. official on humanitarian issues. Last week, Sudan \nrefused to grant visas to officials who intended to conduct a U.N. \nmilitary assessment on planning a peacekeeping operation in Darfur.\n  So in a region the size of Texas, 7,000 African Union troops have \nbeen put in place to protect the people of Darfur. While I believe the \nAfrican Union force is better than nothing, their troop numbers are \nclearly too small. They are underfunded, underequipped, and lack a \nmandate to protect civilians. I agree with many of the experts who have \nsaid that we need to at least triple the size of the African Union \nforce as a bridge until we can get a U.N. force operational in Darfur. \nI also think the President and others have the right idea of using NATO \nforces to provide logistical support while letting countries with \nMuslim populations take the lead on the ground.\n  Of course, we face some obstacles to getting a U.N. force into the \nSudan and controlling the situation. First, the Chinese continuously \nstand in the way of the United Nations. Let's make it simple: The \nChinese buy oil from the Sudanese, and they don't want to stop. In \nfact, China, because of its rule that it doesn't involve itself in any \nway in the domestic affairs of other countries, has no problem buying \noil from a government committing genocide in the Sudan. Then there is \nthe issue of Osama bin Laden, who has denounced the idea of U.N. troops \nand in his most recent audiotape broadcast called on Muslims to fight \nsuch a force.\n  In the past, some steps have been taken on the part of the United \nStates and the international community to address the crisis in Darfur, \nbut the violence continues. Congress has appropriated funds for African \nUnion peacekeeping, food aid, and support for refugees. The United \nNations Security Council has passed various resolutions raising \nconcerns about war crimes committed in Darfur. The Government of Sudan \nand the two rebel groups involved are now in negotiations, and I know \nthat Deputy Secretary of State Zoellick is there now trying to reach a \nfinal agreement with the rebels. Yet, despite all of these measures, \nthe sad truth remains that the people of Darfur face a bleak future of \nuncertainty, suffering, and death. It is time that we take additional \naction to stop the genocide in the Sudan.\n  That is why this amendment that I have had other colleagues join me \nin would provide $60 million to support U.N. peacekeeping in Darfur. I \ncertainly wish to thank the cosponsors of this amendment--Senators \nLeahy, Durbin, Sarbanes, Dodd, Obama, Lautenberg, Wyden, and Stabenow--\nfor their support and for their efforts.\n  The African Union troops in Darfur are clearly overwhelmed by the \nchallenge at hand. This amendment would provide critical funding to \nequip international troops and restore law and order to the region of \nDarfur. Although the intervention of U.N. troops has not been \nauthorized, this amendment would assure that when it is accomplished, \nthe money is there, and it will increase pressure on the African Union, \nthe Khartoum Government, and the international community to make sure \nthat a U.N. force is put in place in Darfur.\n  For those who would question the amount--even though it is now \noffset--proposed in this amendment, I would like to point out that my \namendment adds the same level of funding to the Contributions for \nInternational Peacekeeping account that has already been approved in \nthe House supplemental appropriations bill. There is no other way to \nget these funds to protect the people of Darfur. They are not in the \ncurrent funds appropriated for fiscal year 2006. I think we can all \nagree that genocide in Darfur constitutes an emergency--an emergency to \nwhich this body has a moral obligation to respond.\n  Genocide is not a new phenomenon. We have witnessed this hatred and \ninhumanity many times over the past century. After the world learned \nthe horrors of the Holocaust, America and the international community \nvowed: Never again. Never again. After we saw the gruesome slaughter of \napproximately 800,000 Tutsis in less than 100 days in Rwanda, we swore: \nNever again. Never again, however, is an empty promise--it is an empty \npromise--if we do not take action to stop the murder of innocent people \nwhen we know it is happening.\n  Once again we find ourselves in a position to make that choice, and \nhistory is going to judge what we do--not what we say about never again \nbut what we do when we have the power to do it. For even as I stand \nhere today, I know the number of dead and displaced persons in Darfur \ncontinues to grow. Genocide is not Sudan's problem, it is not Africa's \nproblem, it is the world's problem. It is our problem. And by failing \nto take part in the solution, we have become part of the problem. As \nAmericans and as human beings, we have a moral obligation to help those \nwho are suffering the consequences of genocide and who cannot help \nthemselves. Now is not the time to forget that obligation, and history \nwill judge us by the actions we take or fail to take in the next days \nas we move forward on this amendment.\n  Jan Egeland, one of the top U.N. humanitarian officials, has said, \n``Africa is the biggest drama of our time; nowhere else in the world \nare so many lives at stake as in Africa.'' Now is the time to act.\n  Some people might say that the fiscal 2007 budget proposal allocates \nsufficient funds to help the people of the Sudan. I would say you \ncannot put a price on human lives. Genocide is not a horror of the \npast; it is the reality, unfortunately, of the present. It is an \nemergency we must face today. The $60 million this amendment offers \nwill help put an end to the senseless murder and displacement of the \npeople of Darfur. If American lives were at stake, I am certain we \nwould find the money to act. I hope we have both the humanity and the \ncommitment to say ``never again,'' to make sure that we do so in this \ncase. Simon Wiesenthal said, ``For evil to flourish, it only requires \ngood men to do nothing.'' Let us act now to put an end to this evil.\n  I hope my colleagues will see that in the face of genocide, this is \nmoney well spent. I certainly hope we are permitted to respond to a \nmoral imperative because history will judge each and every one of us \nfor how we act in the face of the genocide going on in Darfur and in \nthe Sudan. I hope that when it comes time for a vote on this amendment, \nthe chairman will actually be able to accept the amendment as offset as \nit is now. I find it sometimes difficult to hear that we have a moral \nimperative, that we say ``never again,'' and yet we put up roadblocks \nfor fulfilling and responding to that moral imperative, and when we \noffer solutions to it, there are those who do not like the solution of \noffsets.\n  The bottom line is, if it were one of us--if it were one of us--thank \nGod we\n\n[[Page S3888]]\n\nlive in the greatest country in the world, and it is not, but if it \nwere one of us, if it were our family suffering the slaughter, would we \nbe content with the councils of patience and delay? I daresay the \nanswer is no. That is why I feel so passionately that we have an \nopportunity to fulfill the commitment to say ``never again.''\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I thank my colleague, Senator Menendez, \nfor his eloquent statement and for sponsoring this incredibly important \namendment. I am proud to be a cosponsor with him and a number of my \ncolleagues. It is incredibly important that we act and that we act now.\n  As Senator Menendez described his amendment, it would add $60 million \nto address the shortfall in the U.S. contribution to the United Nations \nfor international peacekeeping and to fund a U.N. peacekeeping force in \nDarfur.\n  The situation in Darfur is alarming, and it is a true emergency. In \nfact, words can't describe how much of an emergency this is. \nApproximately 3.5 million men, women, and children in the western \nDarfur region of the Sudan are in a fight for their lives against the \nSudanese Government-sponsored campaign of violence and forced \nstarvation. Since the conflict began in February of 2003, recent \nestimates are that there are as many as 400,000--400,000--Sudanese \npeople who have died, and more than 2 million who have been displaced. \nBy some estimates, 500 people perish every day in Darfur. Five hundred \npeople perished today, if those estimates are correct, 500 more will \ndie tomorrow, and 500 more will die the next day. If this is not \ngenocide, I don't know what is, and we must act to stop it as soon as \npossible.\n  The United States has taken the lead in the international community \nto provide humanitarian aid and to support the African Union \npeacekeeping mission in Darfur. However, we must do more. Clearly we \nhave not done what we should and we have not done it fast enough if 500 \npeople are dying every day.\n  We must ensure that our contribution to the United Nations \nContributions for International Peacekeeping Activities account is paid \nin full so that we are credible when we support a U.N. peacekeeping \nmission in Darfur. This amendment helps make that possible. We must \nalso apply pressure to the Sudanese Government so that they take action \nto stop the killing or face the consequences of their actions. We must \nnot sit idly by any longer as people die from a coordinated government-\nsponsored campaign of violence and forced starvation.\n  I am also proud to be a cosponsor of the Darfur Peace and \nAccountability Act which calls for assistance to the African Union \npeacekeepers and urges the President to press for NATO support of the \npeacekeeping mission. I am hopeful that the House and Senate will \nsoon--very soon--resolve the differences between the versions of the \nbill and send it to the President for his signature as soon as \npossible. Millions of men, women, and children are waiting and praying \nfor us to act and to act now.\n  I am proud to join with Senator Menendez and with colleagues on both \nsides of the aisle in this critical funding amendment regarding the \nU.N. peacekeeping mission to put an end to the genocide and bring peace \nto the people of Darfur. This is an opportunity for all of us together \nto do something that will address literally the lives of people who \nhave no one else to turn to but those of us who understand what is \ngoing on and have the ability to act.\n  So on behalf of the human race, I urge this amendment and other \nactions be taken as soon as possible. We must act, and we must act now.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n\n                               Biometrics\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the committee report accompanying the fiscal \nyear 2006 Iraq/Katrina supplemental appropriations bill includes the \nfollowing provision: ``The Committee is aware that the Defense Science \nBoard is studying the management of the Department of Defense's \nbiometrics program and will make recommendations on whether or not the \ncurrent structure is meeting the needs of the warfighters dependent on \nthe system in Iraq and in the Global War on Terror. The Committee \ndirects no management changes be made until the Defense Science Board \ncompletes its study and informs the Congress of its recommendation.''\n  Would it be the understanding of the Senator from Hawaii that any new \nor ongoing organization, personnel, or management changes within the \nArmy, to include the Biometrics Fusion Center, be ceased until the \nDefense Science Board report is complete and briefed to Congress?\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, that would be my understanding.\n  Mr. BYRD. Does the Senator also agree that until the Defense Science \nBoard, DSB, study is complete and briefed to Congress, the Biometrics \nFusion Center should continue to execute its mission to acquire, test, \nevaluate, and integrate biometrics, as well as to develop and implement \nstorage methods for biometrics templates?\n  Mr. INOUYE. I do agree with the distinguished ranking member of the \nfull committee. He has accurately clarified this matter.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank my distinguished colleague for his comments.\n\n\n                     emergency conservation program\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. As the Senate is aware, the Southwestem United States \nhas been devastated by a severe drought which has resulted in numerous \ndeleterious effects to that part of the country.\n  New Mexico's neighbor to the east, Texas, has lost 5,000 head of \ncattle, 5,500 miles of fence, and 4.9 million acres have burned due to \nrecent wildfires. Severe drought also exists in New Mexico, which is \ncurrently facing one of its worst droughts in the past 125 years. It is \nanticipated that great hardship will result in New Mexico as a result \nof this drought. These conditions require emergency measures be \nundertaken in both States.\n  Although the Appropriations Committee is silent on the intent of the \nappropriation to the Emergency Conservation Program, ECP, within the \nDepartment of Agriculture, it is my understanding that of the $17 \nmillion made available to the ECP in this legislation, $12 million is \nto be provided to the State of Texas and $5 million is to be provided \nto the State of New Mexico. The amendment did not originally include \nECP funding, so I want to especially thank Senator Hutchison for her \nleadership in requesting that these funds be included for ECP.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I appreciate the concerns of the distinguished senior \nSenator from New Mexico regarding the ECP provision ontained in title \nIII of this legislation. The Senator's understanding of the intent of \nthe ECP appropriation is correct.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I, too, concur with this assumption with Mr. Bennett \nand Mr. Domenici. I appreciate their support and work on this important \nprovision.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the distinguished Senator from Utah, Mr. \nBennett, and the distinguished Senator from Texas, Mrs. Hutchison for \ntheir consideration and explanation of this important matter.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, Senator Brownback and I wanted to tell \nyou about our amendment 3741 and the progress we are making on one key \naspect of the avian flu preparedness front. As we speak, the HHS and \nUSAID are collaborating to administer the global avian influenza \nnetwork for surveillance--GAINS program. GAINS is a smart and targeted \ninvestment in the USG's fight against avian flu since wild birds can \ncarry the deadly disease and thus have the potential to spread it. HHS \nand USAID have invested $6 million from fiscal year 2006 arvian flu \nsupplemental appropriations to establish GAINS. GAINS will require \nanother $4 million to complete and $10 million for fiscal year 2007. \nSenator Brownback and I are pleased to see that the health \nappropriations committee, led by Senators Specter and Harkin, is \nhelping to allocate $200 million in part to carry out global and \ndomestic surveilliance to undertake activities of this sort. Our \namendment doesn't add more money to the avian flu supplemental, but it \nmakes clear HHS's commitment to GAINS, which we applaud.\n  GAINS will systematically test and monitor wild birds, captive wild \nbirds, and birds in the wildlife/pet trade to\n\n[[Page S3889]]\n\nidentify which viral strains they carry, to share the virus samples in \norder to continually update vaccine production options, and to \ndisseminate lab results on a public electronic database utilizing a \nuser-friendly mapping system. Major flyways will be monitored including \nthose running north-south through the Americas.\n  GAINS is a global surveillance program supported by an international \nnetwork including conservation organizations, bird groups, the poultry \nindustry, vaccine developers, and academic institutions representing \nmore than 5 million members.\n  With HHS and USAID's leadership, the Wildlife Conservation Society's, \nWCS presence in 56 countries around the world, and the presence of its \nglobal partners, GAINS has a presence in virtually every key country \nrelated to avian influenza. Data shared among these partners in the \nGAINS network will deliver real-time data on viral strains carried by \nwild birds.\n  Additional funds for international Western Hemisphere work are \nwelcome but must be integrated with the existing GAINS system. Parallel \nefforts waste limited resources. Like intelligence data, disease \nsurveillance data must be shared to be effective in preventing the \nenemy--avian influenza in this case--from progressing. The USG should \nnot fund the creation of separate international wild bird surveillance \nprograms. Instead, these programs must work together.\n  GAINS is a sensible approach to gather scientific data for the public \ndomain in as close to real time as possible to combat a looming public \nhealth emergency.\n\n\n                             Amendment 3775\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, more than 3 years into the Iraq war, we \nhave had report after report documenting rampant corruption and \nprofiteering on the part of defense contractors, as well as lax \noversight by government officials. A major reason why this is \ncontinuing largely unchecked is that the Department of Justice has been \nsystematically delaying whistleblower law suits brought under the False \nClaims Act. Earlier today, I filed an amendment designed to break this \nlogjam by requiring the Department of Justice to allow these cases to \ngo forward after a maximum 1-year review period. I am pleased that \nSenator Johnson is co-sponsoring this amendment.\n  The cost of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan has risen dramatically \nin each of the last 3 years. The Congressional Research Service reports \nthat we are now spending $10 billion a month in Iraq, alone. One reason \nfor these runaway costs is the widespread corruption in the contracting \nprocess: shoddy work, nonwork, stealing, fraud, kick-backs, bribes, \ninsider dealings, inflated billings, and on and on.\n  The waste of billions of dollars in taxpayer money is bad enough. But \nthis widespread corruption is also impeding our war effort, slowing \nreconstruction efforts, and denying our troops in the field the quality \nsupport and equipment that they deserve.\n  The single most important tool that American taxpayers can use to \nrecover funds stolen through fraud by U.S. contractors is the False \nClaims Act. Indeed, thanks to this law, more than $17 billion has been \nrecovered on behalf of the American taxpayer. Under the False Claims \nAct, whistleblowers are given a powerful incentive to come forward and \nexpose instances of fraud. The statute allows them to sue contractors \nsuspected of defrauding the government, and then to keep a portion of \nthe recovered funds as a reward.\n  But there is a problem--a big problem. Scores of lawsuits have been \nbrought against contractors suspected of fraud in Iraq and Afghanistan, \nincluding Halliburton subsidiary Kellogg Brown and Root. But the \nDepartment of Justice has allowed only one of those suits to go forward \nin the courts; that lawsuit resulted in a major recovery of \nfraudulently collected payments. For reasons that I cannot fathom, the \nDepartment of Justice is systematically delaying these law suits and \npreventing the recovery of perhaps billions of dollars in taxpayer \nmoney.\n  Cases filed under the False Claims Act are automatically sealed. They \ncannot go to trial--in fact, they cannot even be publicly disclosed--\nuntil the Department of Justice makes a decision about whether to join \nthem. Under the statute, these decisions are supposed to be made within \n60 days. But, with just one exception, the Department of Justice has \nrefused to take a position on any of the suits related to Iraq and \nAfghanistan, some of which were filed more than 3 years ago. Instead, \nthe Department has repeatedly filed for and received indefinite \nextensions of seal.\n  As a result, with one exception, every single whistleblower lawsuit \nhas been effectively blocked by the Department of Justice. Fraud has \ngone unpunished. Billions of taxpayer dollars continue to be squandered \nin Iraq, Afghanistan, and elsewhere. And courageous whistleblowers, who \nhave come forward often at great personal risk, have been left in a \nlegal limbo. As one attorney put it: ``The Bush administration has made \na conscious decision to sweep the cases under the rug for as long as \npossible. And the more bad news that comes out of Iraq, the more \nmotivation they have to do so.''\n  This situation is unacceptable. My amendment would prevent the \nDepartment of Justice from imposing undue secrecy on false claim civil \nactions related to government spending on Iraq and Afghanistan by \nsimply requiring the Department of Justice to make a decision about \njoining such cases within 1 year, or 4 months in the case of cases that \nhave already been filed. There will be protections against the release \nof information that could be detrimental to national security. But, \nafter the 1-year period, the allegations will become public and the \ncase will proceed.\n  A 1-year time period will provide the Department of Justice ample \nopportunity to conduct a full investigation into the underlying \nallegations of fraud, and to decide whether to join the suit. In \naddition, my amendment allows the administration to seek additional \nextensions to keep a case sealed upon a showing of extraordinary \ncircumstances. And nothing prevents the Department of Justice from \njoining a case at a later date.\n  As a matter of good faith to our troops and to the American taxpayer, \nwe need to move aggressively against corruption and war profiteering in \nIraq, Afghanistan, and elsewhere.\n  Stuart Bowen, the Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction, \nhas issued a number of reports on waste and fraud in Iraq. He reported \nthat the Coalition Provisional Authority failed to account for the \nexpenditure of nearly $9 billion in taxpayer funds. The money simply \ndisappeared into a black hole. More recently, he reported on a case of \nfraud uncovered in the Iraqi city of Hillah. Here's how the Special \nInspector General described it to the Wall Street Journal: ``There was \nno oversight anywhere near the [perpetrators] at any time, and they did \nnot believe they would be caught. They considered it a free-fraud \nzone.''\n\n  The Hillah fraud, alone, cost taxpayers nearly $100 million. And this \nis just the tip of the iceberg, as reports of fraud continue to pour \nin. The inspector general's own Hotline, which has been in operation a \nlittle more than 2 years, had received 449 cases of fraud, waste, \nabuse, mismanagement, and reprisal in Iraq as of January 30. Instead of \ndelaying the prosecution of fraud under the False Claims Act, the \nDepartment of Justice should be leading the charge to criminals and war \nprofiteers to justice.\n  I commend our colleague, the junior Senator from North Dakota, Mr. \nDorgan, for chairing a Democratic Policy Committee hearing in February \n2005 on the issue of waste, fraud, and abuse in Iraq. He heard \ntestimony from Alan Grayson, an attorney who represented whistleblowers \nin the one and only case allowed by the Department of Justice to go \nforward under the False Claims Act. Mr. Grayson described what happened \nto one of those whistleblowers, a former FBI agent, who refused to go \nalong with the fraud. Said Mr. Grayson: ``He was held at gunpoint, \nstripped of his weapons and security identification, and then he was \nreleased defenseless on the streets of Baghdad.''\n  Waste, fraud, and abuse are a fact of life in any war. But in past \nwars, we have had aggressive oversight by congressional investigative \ncommittees. During World War II, the Truman Commission worked \nrelentlessly to root out corruption and war profiteering--a Democratic \nSenator investigating a Democratic administration. Senator Truman \ndenounced war profiteering as\n\n[[Page S3890]]\n\n``treason''--and he was exactly right; it is treason and a betrayal of \nthe troops in the field.\n  Unfortunately, in the current wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, there has \nbeen only negligible congressional oversight and investigation of war \nprofiteering. That leaves the False Claims Act as the last best hope \nfor taxpayers to recover, yet the Department of Justice has \nsystematically delayed lawsuits brought under the act.\n  My amendment will directly address this latter problem. By all means, \nthe Department of Justice should have ample time to review cases \nbrought under the False Claims Act. But after a maximum of 1 year, \nthose cases should be allowed to go forward in the courts so that \njustice is served.\n  This is a strictly nonpartisan amendment. It is all about protecting \ntaxpayer dollars and ensuring that our troops in the field are not put \nat risk because of corrupt contractors. I urge my colleagues to support \nthis amendment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/02/senate-section/article/S3890-1", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3890]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. ENSIGN.

It \nreaches hundreds of thousands of teachers and millions of students \naround the world. Past events in support of Space Day have taken place \nin over 25 countries on 6 continents.\n  Created by the Challenger Center for Space Science Education, Space \nDay Design Challenges is a national competition that encourages \nstudents to create innovative solutions to the challenges of space \nexploration. The 21 Stellar Design Challenges teams were selected from \nmore than 259 teams who participated in the competition, making these \nstudents' work even more impressive.\n  The Mervin Iverson Elementary School team designed a tool to help \nresearchers on Mars. The remotely operated tool would collect samples \nof rock, minerals, and soil, analyze their chemical compositions, \nmeasure temperatures of the Martian surface, and relay this data back \nto Earth.\n  In honor of their achievements, the Iverson students will attend the \nnational Space Day 2006 ceremony at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center \nand meet former Senator John Glenn. They will also have the opportunity \nto share their knowledge by displaying their project to more than 2,000 \nsixth graders from the Washington, DC area.\n  Their success is reflective of their hard work, dedication, and \ncreativity as well as Mervin Iverson Elementary School's strong \ncommitment to academic excellence.

Mr. President, I rise today with a heavy heart and a deep \nsense of gratitude to pay tribute to a brave young man, PFC George \nRonald Roehl, Jr., of Manchester, NH, for his service and his supreme \nsacrifice for his country.\n  George was born on January 24, 1985, in Manchester, NH. He graduated \nfrom Franklin High School, Franklin, NH, in 2003 and entered the United \nStates Army on November 2, 2004. He subsequently graduated from basic \ncombat training and advanced individual training at Ft. Knox, KY, and \nwas assigned to Bravo Troop, 7th Squadron, 10th Cavalry, 1st Brigade, \n4th Infantry Division at Ft. Hood, TX, where he served as a Scout \ndismount.\n  George, the oldest of five children, risked everything to fight for \nthe values we Americans hold dear, in a country halfway around the \nworld. Tragically, on April 11, 2006, this courageous young soldier and \ntwo of his comrades died as a result of injuries sustained in Taji, \nIraq when an improvised explosive device detonated near their Bradley \nFighting Vehicle and they subsequently came under small arms fire \nduring combat operations. His awards and decorations include the Bronze \nStar Medal, the Purple Heart, the Army Good Conduct Medal, the National \nDefense Service Medal, the Iraq Campaign Medal, the Global War on \nTerrorism Service Medal, the Army Service Ribbon, the Overseas Service \nRibbon, and the Combat Action Badge.\n  Patriots from the State of New Hampshire have served our Nation with \nhonor and distinction from Bunker Hill to Baghdad--and George served in \nthat fine tradition. Daniel Webster said, ``God grants liberty only to \nthose who love it, and are always ready to guard and defend it.'' \nGeorge was one of those proud and dedicated volunteers who believed in \nfighting for our country and guarding our precious liberty, and for \nthat we will always owe our sincere gratitude.\n  My condolences and prayers go out to George's family, and I offer \nthem my deepest sympathies. Family, friends, and fellow soldiers will \nno longer be able to enjoy the company of PFC George R. Roehl, Jr. Yet \nmemories of this young patriot will last forever with those who were \nfortunate enough to have had the opportunity to know him. He realized a \ncalling and chose to employ his youthful energy and considerable \ntalents for his country. He understood that the freedoms and \nopportunities provided by this Nation need continuous defense and that \nthey are among the most precious gifts he can give to his family and \nloved ones. Because of him, the safety and liberty of each and every \nAmerican is more secure. May God bless George Ronald Roehl, Jr.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/02/senate-section/article/S3890-4", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3890]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ENHANCEMENT ACT OF 2005\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the need for \nhate crimes legislation. Each Congress, Senator Kennedy and I introduce \nhate crimes legislation that would add new categories to current hate \ncrimes law, sending a signal that violence of any kind is unacceptable \nin our society. Likewise, each Congress I have come to the floor to \nhighlight a separate hate crime that has occurred in our country.\n  In April 2006 the beatings of two gay men in separate attacks took \nplace in northeast Fort Lauderdale, FL. The first attack involved a gay \nman who was riding his bicycle. When he passed a man on the sidewalk, \nthe man yelled a gay slur and then beat him. Minutes after the first \nattack a group of men forced a gay man into their car, took him to a \nlocal park, then beat and robbed him. According to reports, both \nattacks appear to have been motivated by the victim's sexual \norientation.\n  I believe that the Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, \nto defend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act is a symbol that can become substance. I \nbelieve that by passing this legislation and changing current law, we \ncan change hearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/02/senate-section/article/S3890-5", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3890-S3891]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n        RECOGNITION OF A DUAL CELEBRATION FOR THE CITY OF KERMAN\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise to recognize a dual \ncelebration for the city of Kerman, CA. This year marks the 100th \nanniversary of Kerman as a city in Fresno County and also the 60th \nanniversary of its incorporation as an official city.\n  In 1891, the Southern Pacific Railroad Company constructed a new line \nbetween Tracy and Fresno. A nondescript watering tank and pump along\n\n[[Page S3891]]\n\nthat line was given the name Collis as a tribute to Collis P. \nHuntington, a member of the famed ``Big Four'' of western railroading. \nThe first inhabitant, the caretaker of the pump and tank, resigned his \njob after just a few months, not because of the demands of the job but, \nrather, because the area was too desolate and barren.\n  As a speculative venture, the Bank of California purchased a large \ntract of land in every county in California. The arid land around what \nbecame Kerman was chosen as the allotment for Fresno County. After the \ndeath of its promoter, the once prominent bank became insolvent and its \nholdings were liquidated. In 1910, the property in Fresno County caught \nthe attention of two Los Angeles capitalists, William G. Kerckoff and \nJacob Mansar, who saw the tract as an opportunity to purchase a rich \nwater supply from the newly constructed Enterprise Canal. Mr. Kerckoff \nand Mr. Mansar combined the first three letters of their names and \nrenamed the area ``Kerman.''\n  Since its incorporation in 1946, Kerman has experienced steady growth \nwhile retaining its identity and character as a predominately agrarian \ncommunity. Today, Kerman has joined with other thriving cities on the \nwest side of Fresno County along the Interstate 5 corridor by reaching \nout to industry through the development of an industrial park.\n  From a remote outpost that was once deemed too isolated for a \nwatering tank operator to one of the fastest growing cities in Fresno \nCounty, the city of Kerman has served as a shining example to the \nimportance of agriculture in California and also to the virtues of \ncommunity spirit and diversity.\n  As the residents of Kerman continue to work together to make their \ncity a better place to call home, I congratulate them on their \nauspicious dual landmark anniversaries and wish them continued success \nand good fortune.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/02/senate-section/article/S3891-1", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3891]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        HONORING MANUEL PORTILLO\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise today to honor a remarkable \ncitizen of my home State of California, Mr. Manuel Portillo, as \nNational City dedicates the Casa de Salud Manuel Portillo Youth Center \nin his honor.\n  Throughout his lifetime, Mr. Portillo has played an exemplary role in \nempowering and improving the lives of children and young adults \nthroughout the San Diego community. His tireless efforts to improve his \nbeloved community and his selfless service to our Nation has made a \ntangible difference for countless people. The will and vision of Mr. \nPortillo serves as an inspiration to us all.\n  Born in 1920, Mr. Portillo rose from humble beginnings to become a \nleader in the San Diego community. As a youth, he developed a passion \nfor the sport of boxing that he still enjoys today. At age 12, he was \nearning 25 cents an hour picking celery, yet the strength of character \nfor which he has come to be known was only just beginning to emerge. By \n17, Portillo was working for the Civilian Conservation Corps, helping \ndevelop bridges and campgrounds, many of which are still in use today \nthroughout the State, including in Yosemite National Park.\n  In 1942, only 30 days after being married, Portillo was drafted by \nthe U.S. Army and sent to join the Allied struggle in Europe during the \nheight of World War II. While serving in the Army, Portillo honed his \nboxing skills to a fine art and often challenged his fellow soldiers. \nPortillo returned to National City after being honorably discharged and \nafter receiving four bronze service stars as a Sergeant in Company A \n378th Infantry.\n  After returning home, Portillo dedicated himself to improving his \ncommunity by establishing positive programs for otherwise troubled \nneighborhood youth. He was able to keep many of these kids off the \nstreets and out of trouble by teaching them the sport of boxing. With \nan emphasis on sportsmanship and discipline, Portillo has made a \npositive impact in the lives of countless children and young adults. \nHis success inspired the creation of the Casa Knight, the Casa Men's \nClub, Santos and Peewees for boys, and the Knightetts. These \nrecreational groups have become fundamental vehicles for social \nmobility, encouraging positive self-image and motivation in both an \nextracurricular and academic capacity.\n  It is with great pleasure that I commend Manuel Portillo for his \npassionate commitment to helping others and tireless efforts to improve \nthe broader San Diego community. I wish him great success in the \nfuture.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/02/senate-section/article/S3891-2", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3891]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  A message from the President of the United States was communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/02/senate-section/article/S3891-3", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3891]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       EXECUTIVE MESSAGE REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \na message from the President of the United States submitting a \nnomination which was referred to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and \nUrban Affairs.\n  (The nomination received today is printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/02/senate-section/article/S3891-4", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3891]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MEASURES READ THE FIRST TIME\n\n  The following bill was read the first time:\n\n       S. 2700.

INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n      By Mr. CORNYN (for himself, Mr. Allen, Mr. Enzi, Mr. Lott, Mr. \n        Allard, and Mr. Bennett):\n  S. 2691. A bill to amend the Immigration and Nationality Act to \nincrease competitiveness in the United States, and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, today I am introducing a bill that will \nreform our immigration policies to make the United States more \ncompetitive, called the Securing Knowledge, Innovation, and Leadership, \nor ``SKIL'' bill. Other original cosponsors of this legislation include \nSenators Allard, Allen, Bennett, Enzi, and Lott.\n  Our ability to innovate is crucial to the success of our economy. By \ninvesting in science and technology, we revolutionize our economy and \nimprove the world. The President has responded to this need by \nproposing the American Competitiveness Initiative. And I am a proud co-\nsponsor of legislation that has been introduced in the Senate: the \nProtecting America's Competitive Edge (PACE bills) and National \nInnovation Act.\n  But there is still more that can be done. Immigration policy must be \npart of any discussion of competitiveness. The United States does not \nproduce enough engineers--China graduates four times as many engineers \nas the U.S., and within a few years, approximately 90 percent of all \nscientists and engineers in the world will be in Asia. Foreign students \nfill that gap right now in the U.S., but then our immigration policy--\nnot our economy--forces them to return home because there are not \nenough highly skilled work visas.\n  In the long run, we must improve our schools and encourage more U.S. \nstudents to study engineering and mathematics. But we also must adapt \nimmigration policy so that when U.S. students are educated in \nengineering fields, there will be U.S. jobs for them to fill. With the \nSKIL bill, foreign students who graduate from U.S. institutions will be \nable to stay and work in the United States. The bill will allow \ncompanies to retain highly skilled and educated workers.\n  The SKIL bill requires the government to change its processes so that \ncompanies do not waste valuable resources. If a worker has been in the \nU.S. and has complied with all immigration laws, he should be allowed \nto renew his visa here in the U.S. Why make that worker go to a \nconsulate when all of the processing can be done here in the U.S.?\n  The SKIL bill exempts from annual visa limit any foreign student \ngraduating from a U.S. university with a Master's or PhD in essential \nfields. Foreign workers with extraordinary skills, such as a Nobel \nPrize winner or an international scholar--should not have to wait for a \nvisa. The President has also called for an increase in H-1B visas.\n  As Chair of the Immigration subcommittee, I have seen how \nimmigration--both legal and illegal--affects all aspects of our lives. \nI am pleased that there is so much discussion about immigration and \nabout improving avenues for workers to enter our country. But \nimmigration today will shape the country that our children grow up in. \nAnd so there needs to be more discussion about the kinds of immigration \nthat will most benefit our economy and our country.\n  I am introducing the SKIL bill because I don't believe enough \nattention has been focused on legal immigrants, especially the highly \nskilled workers who contribute to our economy and comply with our laws. \nIt is my hope that this legislation will allow U.S. companies to retain \na highly educated workforce until we can channel more American students \ninto the math, science, and engineer pipeline. The SKIL bill is yet \nanother important piece of the U.S. competitiveness agenda, and I urge \nmy colleagues to cosponsor this important legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BURNS:\n  S. 2693. A bill to prevent congressional reapportionment distortions; \nto the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, over the last few months, we have discussed \nat length the problem of illegal immigration. What many may not realize \nis that illegal immigration affects our system of representation as \nwell.\n  After the 1990 Census, my State of Montana lost one of its two seats \nin the House of Representatives. Ten years later, our great State had \ngrown to more than 900,000 residents, but still did not gain a seat.\n  Meanwhile, we have an estimated 12 million illegal aliens in this \ncountry today, and all of them will be a factor to determine which \nStates gain or lose a seat in the House of Representatives after the \nCensus in 2010. This is because current policy tells us to count \neveryone in this country, illegal or not, when determining \nCongressional apportionment.\n  If these trends continue, we will have millions more illegal aliens \ncounted in the 2010 Census. The result will be more seats lost in \nStates that have actually increased in population of law-abiding U.S. \nresidents.\n  Thankfully, my State of Montana cannot lose any more seats in the \nHouse of Representatives. We are down to our last one. Other States, \nhowever, will not be so fortunate.\n  Law-abiding citizens should not have to lose representation because \nmillions of illegal immigrants ignore our laws. That is why today, I am \nintroducing the Fair and Accurate Representation Act. This bill will \nexclude the masses of illegal aliens in this country from being part of \nthe Congressional apportionment process.\n  If we act now, we can get started on reforming this process in time \nfor the 2010 Census. The voting rights of law-abiding citizens should \nnot be diluted by those who choose to enter this country illegally. I \ncall upon my colleagues in the Senate to join me in correcting this \nprocess, so that those who lawfully reside in this country receive fair \nand accurate representation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CRAIG (for himself and Mr. Graham):\n  S. 2694. A bill to amend title 38, United States Code, to remove \ncertain limitation on attorney representation of claimants for veterans \nbenefits in administrative proceedings before the Department of \nVeterans Affairs, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Veterans' \nAffairs.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I have sought recognition today to comment \non legislation that the distinguished Senator from South Carolina, \nSenator Graham, and I are introducing. This bill will provide veterans \nwith the right to hire counsel to represent them in proceedings before \nthe Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and will help ensure that all \nwho represent veterans are held to the highest standards of \nprofessional and ethical conduct.\n  As President Abraham Lincoln eloquently expressed nearly 150 years \nago, this Nation has an obligation ``to care for him who shall have \nborne the battle, and for his widow, and his orphan.'' In keeping with \nthat charge, the Federal Government provides a wide array of benefits \nto veterans and their dependents, through an administrative system that \nis intended to be informal, claimant-friendly, and non-adversarial.\n  During recent years, however, veterans' organizations, VA, and others \nhave observed that this system has become increasingly complex. \nEnhanced legal requirements and layers of procedural steps intended to \nprotect the rights of veterans have increased both the complexity of \nthe system and how long it takes to process a claim. At the same time, \nwith the Nation at war and servicemembers deployed around the world, \nthe disability claims filed by returning veterans have become more\n\n[[Page S3897]]\n\ncomplex. Many of these claims are based on disabilities caused by \nenvironmental exposures, traumatic brain injuries, psychological \ntrauma, severe combat wounds, and other highly complex medical \nconditions, which by their nature may entail complex questions of \ncausality or intricate factual or legal analyses.\n  Despite the increasing complexity of many cases, all 24 million \nliving veterans are prohibited from hiring a lawyer to help them \nnavigate the VA system. It is only after a veteran has spent months and \neven years exhausting the extensive VA administrative process that the \nveteran then may retain counsel--a process that often takes 3 or more \nyears to complete. As the National Organization of Veterans' Advocates \n(NOVA) testified before the Veterans' Affairs Committee last year, \n``[t]his is too late in the process for counsel to be truly effective'' \nbecause by that time the evidentiary record ``is effectively closed.'' \nOn the other hand, NOVA testified that, if attorneys were retained at \nan earlier stage of the process, they could be helpful in obtaining and \npresenting necessary evidence and in ensuring that VA timely and \naccurately processes claims.\n  So, with the potential for lawyers to help veterans successfully \nnavigate this increasingly complex system, why does the government \nprohibit veterans from retaining counsel? This restriction, which dates \nback to the Civil War, was born out of concern that unscrupulous \nattorneys would improperly take large portions of veterans' disability \nbenefits as compensation for their services. And some will argue that \nthis concern is equally warranted today.\n  Although I understand this longstanding desire to protect veterans' \ndisability compensation, I would ask my colleagues to consider a simple \nquestion posited in a recent editorial: ``If American soldiers are \nmature and responsible enough to choose to risk their lives for their \ncountry, shouldn't they be considered competent to hire a lawyer?'' I \nbelieve the obvious answer to that question is ``yes.''\n  Particularly for veterans of to day's All-Volunteer Force--which has \nbeen described as the ``best-trained, best-equipped, best-led fighting \nforce in the history of the world''--this paternalistic restriction is \nsimply outdated. These highly trained, highly skilled veterans have the \nability--and should have the right--to decide whether or not to hire a \nlawyer.\n  This is a right that is not denied to individuals seeking other \nearned benefits from the government. In fact, if a veteran were to seek \nSocial Security benefits for disabilities suffered during military \nservice, the veteran would be permitted to hire an attorney--while the \nsame veteran seeking benefits from VA for the same disabilities would \nbe prohibited from hiring an attorney based on this remnant of an \nancient policy.\n  The paternalistic restriction that prevents veterans from hiring \ncounsel may have been advisable 150 years ago, but--as one veterans' \norganization recently testified before the Veterans' Affairs \nCommittee--there is now no logic to it ``except history.'' It has \nendured for far too long and it is now time to embrace Justice Oliver \nWendell Holmes' admonition that it is ``revolting'' for a law to \npersist ``in blind imitation of the past.'' It is time to repeal this \narchaic law and to allow our Nation's veterans the option of hiring \ncounsel.\n  Having said all that, I want to be clear that I am not suggesting \nthat attorneys should be considered necessary in order to obtain VA \nbenefits. Above all, we must ensure that the system continues to serve \nveterans in a claimant-friendly, non-adversarial manner--regardless of \nthe presence of an attorney or any other representative--and we must \nstrive to reduce the complexities of this vast system. I hope that \nveterans' organizations across the country will join me in pursuing \nthose goals.\n  I also want to be clear that, although I believe veterans should have \nthe option to hire attorneys, they should not be discouraged in any way \nfrom utilizing the free services now provided by many dedicated \nrepresentatives of veterans' service organizations. Those \nrepresentatives are an important and valuable resource that veterans \nand their families will undoubtedly continue to rely on for many \ngenerations to come. The availability of this resource, however, is no \nreason to restrict veterans' access to other options. If a veteran \nwould rather hire an attorney, we should not stand in the way.\n  At the same time, however, we should ensure that anyone who \nrepresents a veteran is held to the highest standards of professional \nand ethical conduct and that any fee charged to a veteran is patently \nreasonable. To that end, this legislation will allow veterans the right \nto hire an attorney at any time and it will heighten the expectations \non all individuals who represent veterans.\n  Specifically, this legislation will allow VA to ensure that all \nattorneys who practice before VA have adequate training or experience \nin this specialized area of law to competently represent veterans and \nthat they conform to specified standards of ethical and professional \nconduct. It would also allow VA to ensure that all veterans' \nrepresentatives are honest, professional, and law abiding; that they \navoid further delaying or complicating the system by presenting \nfrivolous claims or arguments; and that they conduct themselves with \ndue regard for the non-adversarial nature of the system.\n  For veterans who opt to hire an attorney, this legislation would \nprovide the Secretary of Veterans Affairs with authority to reduce any \nattorney fee if it is excessive or unreasonable and with authority to \nset restrictions on the amount of fees that could be charged in any \ncase before VA. Finally, in order to avoid any drain on existing VA \nresources, VA would have authority to impose on attorneys a \nregistration fee to defray any costs associated with allowing them to \npractice before VA.\n  In sum, this legislation will take measures to ensure that the \ninterests of veterans will be protected, while allowing them to decide \nfor themselves whether they want to hire a lawyer. I ask my colleagues \nto support this groundbreaking legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2694\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to provide for Federal agencies to develop public \naccess policies relating to research conducted by employees of that \nagency or from funds administered by that agency; to the Committee on \nHomeland Security and Governmental Affairs.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I rise today to join my friend Senator \nLieberman in introducing legislation that will ensure U.S. taxpayer \ndollars are spent wisely, and will help enhance America's ability to \ncompete in the global economy.\n  Each year, our Federal Government invests more than $55 billion on \nbasic and applied research. That s roughly 40 percent of the current \ntwo-year budget for my home State of Texas.\n  The bulk of this money is spent by approximately 10 agencies, \nincluding: the National Institutes of Health, National Science \nFoundation, NASA, the Department of Energy, and the Department of \nAgriculture. These agencies use the money to fund research which is \nusually conducted by outside researchers working for universities, \nhealthcare systems, and other groups.\n  Most of the time, researchers will publish the results of their work \nin an academic journal. The NIH, for example, estimates that roughly \n65,000 articles are published each year that report on research either \npartially or entirely funded by NIH.\n  Unfortunately, as it stands now, most Americans have little--to no--\ntimely access to this wealth of information, despite the fact that \ntheir tax dollars paid for the research. Some Federal agencies, with \nthe NIH chief amongst them, have taken some very positive steps in the \nright direction to require that these articles reporting on government-\nfunded research be freely available to the public in a timely manner.\n  In fact, today marks the one-year anniversary of the implementation \nof a ground breaking public access policy at NIH developed by Director \nElias Zerhouni. I thank Dr. Zerhouni and his colleagues for their \nleadership on this important issue and for energizing this debate.\n  While Dr. Zerhouni and NIH have made strong progress, Sen. Lieberman \nand I believe more must be done, not only at NIH and in medical \nresearch, but throughout the Federal Government and the sciences in \ngeneral.\n  That is why today we are introducing the Federal Research Public \nAccess Act of 2006, legislation that will refine the work done by NIH \nand require that the Federal Government's leading underwriters of \nresearch adopt meaningful public access policies.\n  Our legislation is a simple, common sense approach that will advance \nthe public's access to the research it funds. We hope this access will \nhelp accelerate science, innovation, and discovery.\n  Under our bill, all Federal departments and agencies that invest $100 \nmillion or more annually in research will be asked to develop a public \naccess policy. Each policy will require that all articles that result \nfrom federal funding be deposited in a publicly accessible archive no \nlater than six months after publication.\n  Our bill simply says to all researchers who seek government funding \nthat we want the results of your work to be seen by the largest \npossible audience. It will ensure that U.S. taxpayers do not have to \npay twice for the same research--once to conduct it, and a second time \nto read it.\n  This legislation is an opportunity for our government to better \nleverage our investment in research, and to ensure a greater return on \nthat investment, which is all the more important given the current \nbudget situation. By sharing this information quickly and broadly with \nall potential users, we can advance science, accelerate the pace of new \ndiscoveries and innovations, and improve the lives and welfare of \npeople at home and abroad.\n  All Americans will be positively affected as a result of this bill: \npatients diagnosed with a disease or condition will be able to use the \nInternet to access the full text of articles containing the latest \ninformation on ent and prognosis; students at small institutions will \nhave equal access to research articles they need to complete \nassignments and further their studies; researches will have their \nfindings more broadly and more quickly disseminated, possibly sparking \nfurther discovery and innovation\n  The Internet has dramatically altered how the world gathers and \nshares information. The Internet gives the homemaker in Houston the \nability to find volumes of information about a recent medical diagnosis \ngiven to a family member. It allows a young community college student \nin rural West Texas--a great distance from the nearest research \nlibrary--to learn the latest in scientific discovery and hopefully spur \nhim to continue his studies.\n  While a comprehensive competitiveness agenda is still in the works, \nensuring greater access to scientific information is one way we can \nhelp bolster interest in these important fields and move this issue \nforward while at the same time helping accelerate the pace of discovery \nand innovation. Through this legislation, I hope to ensure that \nstudents, researchers, and every American has access to the published \nresults\n\n[[Page S3899]]\n\nof federally funded research, and I ask for my colleagues' support.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. TALENT (for himself, Mrs. Lincoln, Mr. Coleman, Ms. \n        Landrieu, Mr. Pryor, Mr. Bond, Mr. Dorgan, and Mr. Vitter):\n  S. 2696. A bill to extend all of the authorizations of appropriations \nand direct spending programs under the Farm Security and Rural \nInvestment Act of 2002 until after implementing legislation for the \nDoha Development Round of World Trade Organization negotiations is \nenacted into law, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nAgriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n  Mr. TALENT. Mr. President, America has the safest, most abundant, \nbest tasting, and least expensive food supply not only in the world, \nbut in the history of the world. There are a lot of good people in the \nfood and fiber production industry who deserve credit for that. But the \nheart of food production in the United States and the world and the \ncenter of the rural communities that produce our food and fiber, is \nnone other than the American family farmer and rancher.\n  I want to assure everyone here of this. There are a lot of us in \nCongress and in the country that believe in agriculture; we intend to \ncontinue supporting policies that help farmers; and we're not going to \napologize to anyone for doing it, especially foreign countries that are \nnot negotiating in good faith with the United States through the WTO.\n  When I am in Missouri, I hear strong support for the current farm \nbill. Producers all over the State tell me that they like the programs \ncreated in the farm bill and they want to see it extended, especially \nwhen we have the uncertainty of the current WTO negotiations hanging \nover the head of our domestic agriculture industry.\n  It would be unfair to our nation's agriculture producers to write a \nnew farm bill in the midst of ongoing international trade negotiations. \nToday, Senator Lincoln, and I, with a number of other members, filed \nlegislation to extend the current farm bill until the Doha round of \nWorld Trade Organization (WTO) negotiations is complete.\n  Our Nation's farmers and their lenders should not be asked to operate \nunder rules that keep changing. We must have fair global trading rules \nin place before we write the next farm bill. A farm bill extension is a \nreasonable and sound approach.\n  Everyone knows that safe food is abundant in the United States. \nFarmers and farm workers constitute 2 percent of the total workforce in \nthe United States, yet they help feed the entire world. Unfortunately, \nsome people in Washington believe that we spend too much in securing \nthat safe and abundant food supply.\n  What does this safe and inexpensive food supply cost the Federal \ntaxpayer? In the United States, domestic support programs amount to \\3/\n4\\ of one per cent of the total Federal budget. For \\3/4\\ of one per \ncent our farmers are able to sustain an agriculture industry that \nproduces 25 million jobs and 3.5 trillion dollars in economic activity.\n  For three quarters of one per cent of the Federal budget, Americans \nhave a hedge against ever being held hostage to food imports the way we \nare now held hostage to energy imports. Where would our security be \nwithout the American family farm? What would it mean for the United \nStates if our family farmers went out of business, and foreign powers \ncould threaten our food as they now threaten our energy? Do we want to \nrely on Brazil for food the way we rely on Venezuela for oil?\n  I believe the best way to continue support for this strong sector of \nour economy is to extend the farm bill until we have a WTO agreement \nthat is good for American agriculture. I do not believe that we should \nnegotiate with our trading partners and against ourselves.\n  As George Washington wrote in 1796, ``Agriculture is of primary \nimportance. In proportion as nations advance in population and other \ncircumstances of maturity, this truth becomes more apparent, and \nrenders the cultivation of the soil more and more an object of public \npatronage.''\n  America will be more than ever what George Washington predicted in \n1788 it would be: the ``storehouse and granary for the whole world.''\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nthat would extend the provisions of the 2002 Farm Bill until our \ntrading partners in the WTO have at least matched our commitment to \nlevel disparities in global agriculture trade. I would like to thank \nSenator Talent for working with me on this important piece of \nlegislation to farm families in my State of Arkansas and across the \nNation.\n  This legislation would extend our current farm bill until one year \nafter implementing legislation for a WTO Doha agreement is enacted. \nThen . . . and only then . . . will Congress know what to expect of our \ntrading partners and what our trading partners expect from us.\n  Four years ago, President Bush, after some noted reluctance, signed \ninto law the 2002 Farm Bill. As a member of the Senate Agriculture \nCommittee and a farmer's daughter, I played an active role in that \ndebate and was pleased with the outcome, which I view as a compromise \nbetween many different interests. Most importantly, I view it as a \ncontract between the farmers in my State of Arkansas and their \ngovernment. It is meant to offer what little certainty can exist for \nthose who choose to make a living providing the safe and affordable \nfood supply which we as Americans depend on. Unfortunately, certainty \nis something that's hard to come by in farm country these days.\n  This Administration has repeatedly asked Congress to cut funding or \nmake structural changes to the 2002 Farm Bill, regardless of the fact \nthat CBO estimates it has come in approximately $13 billion cheaper \nthan anticipated.\n  This Administration has also refused to provide emergency assistance \nto agriculture producers, despite the fact that farmers across the \nNation faced weather-related disasters of all kinds and record high \nfuel and fertilizer costs in 2005. A wet spring, followed by extreme \ndrought and rising fuel prices, cost farmers in my State $923 million \nlast year. In Arkansas, where one in five jobs is tied to agriculture, \nthis impacts the entire State economy.\n  All the while, producers wait and watch as U.S. negotiators offer \nproposals in the WTO that would require drastic reductions and changes \nin our farm support, while our trading partners continue to protect \ntheir markets with tariffs and subsidies far higher than we have in the \nU.S.\n  I am tired of waiting, and so are my farmers. Very little was \naccomplished at the WTO ministerial in Hong Kong, and trade officials \nrecently announced that the April 30th deadline for reaching a \nnegotiating framework would pass without progress. The 2002 Farm Bill \nis set to expire in September of next year, and we are no closer to an \nagreement in the WTO than we were one year ago.\n  No doubt our trading partners are quite content to take the wait and \nsee approach. This Administration has made it quite clear that it \nsupports drastic changes to our farm policy, with or without an \nagreement in the WTO. Our trading partners are demanding that we \ndismantle our farm program . . . meanwhile they do little to nothing to \nshow that they are willing to do the same. Why would they?\n  This Administration is sending them the very clear message that they \nagree with them . . .  and envision 2007 as the year to make those \nchanges. If that is the case, what incentive then do our trading \npartners have to come to the negotiating table at all? More \nimportantly, what does it say about our negotiating priorities if we \nare simply negotiating with ourselves?\n  Some may argue that we must change our agriculture policy to avoid \nfurther litigation against our farm programs by WTO countries. But \nwithout a completed WTO agreement, like the one negotiated in the \nUruguay Round, how are we expected to write new farm policy that is \ncompliant? Compliant with what?\n  In my view, and I think many of my colleagues agree, the best course \nof action is to extend the current farm bill until we know the rules of \nthe road. As a member of the Senate Finance Committee, with \njurisdiction over international trade . . . and as a farmer's daughter \nwho understands full well the importance of international markets to \nthe U.S. agriculture industry . . . I am introducing this legislation \nto send a message to our friends in the WTO. We will not negotiate by \nourselves . . . we\n\n[[Page S3900]]\n\nwill not make wholesale changes to our domestic policies until we know \nthat you are willing to do the same.\n  So long as we maintain the status quo in our international trade \nagreements, then we should maintain the status quo with regard to our \ndomestic farm policy as well. That is the type of message that I wish \nour trade negotiators were sending to our trading partners. And that is \nthe message that I hope our trading partners receive today. That is the \ntype of certainty that America's farmers need and deserve.\n  The legislation Senator Talent and I introduce today will provide \nthis certainty to our farming communities and send a strong signal to \nour trading partners. Congress will not make drastic changes to our \nfarm policy without a meaningful agreement in the WTO.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LUGAR (for himself, Mr. Biden, Mr. Kerry, and Mr. Obama):\n  S. 2697. A bill to establish the position of the United States \nAmbassador for ASEAN; to the committee on Foreign Relations.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, today, I rise to introduce ``The U.S. \nAmbassador for ASEAN Act'', which signals the importance of bolstering \nthe U.S.-ASEAN relationship for our mutual benefit.\n  ASEAN was originally established in 1967. The founding Members, \nIndonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore and Thailand, remain as \nanchor participants of ASEAN today. Overall membership has expanded, \nwith ten countries now comprising ASEAN.\n  Over the years, ASEAN has contributed to regional stability in East \nAsia and has partnered with the United States to combat global terror. \nIn addition to promoting regional peace and stability, ASEAN is \ncommitted to accelerating economic growth, social progress, and \ncultural development.\n  ASEAN is the third largest export market for United States products, \nand has received approximately $90 billion in direct investment from \nU.S. sources. Nearly 40,000 ASEAN students are studying in the United \nStates.\n  The United States maintains bilateral relationships with the ASEAN \nMember countries. However, as ASEAN develops an integrated free trade \narea and addresses matters of common concern with the United States--\nranging from environmental and financial challenges to avian influenza \nand terrorism--it is appropriate for the United States to enhance its \noverall relationship with ASEAN.\n  With this in mind, my legislation establishes the position of U.S. \nAmbassador for ASEAN, subject to advice and consent of the Senate. I \nbelieve this initiative will be an important step in advancing an \nalready positive relationship. In addition, I am hopeful that once the \nposition is established, the U.S. Ambassador to ASEAN will help \nfacilitate ongoing implementation of the ASEAN-U.S. Enhanced \nPartnership, announced last November by ASEAN leaders and President \nBush.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ALLARD (for himself and Mr. Salazar):\n  S. 2698. A bill to establish the Granada Relocation Center National \nHistoric Site as an affiliated unit of the National Park System; to the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce my bill to \ndesignate the Granada Relocation Camp, also known as Camp Amache, as a \nNational Historic Site in Colorado.\n  The Granada Relocation Camp, which is located in Southeast Colorado \nbetween the towns of Lamar and Holly on the Santa Fe Trail, played an \nimportant, and sometimes sad, part in United States history. In the \n1800's travelers that came into Colorado along the Santa Fe Trail used \nit as a place to buy supplies and rest, and it was known as the \n``Gateway to Colorado''. This put Granada on the map and the area was \nsettled in 1873. By 1876 it was one of the largest cities in Colorado \nand endured a move further west for expansion.\n  The town is now best known for the Granada Relocation Camp, Camp \nAmache, which was established during one of the darker, but just as \nimportant time periods in American history. This camp, one of ten \ninterment camps in the Nation, was established in August 1942 by the \nUnited States government during World War II as a place to house the \nJapanese from the West coast and was closed on August 15, 1945. Camp \nAmache was named after Amache Ochinee Prowers, the wife of John \nProwers, the founder of the county in which Granada presides. It became \nits own little city with 30 blocks of barracks, school rooms, and mess \ntents. It also included its own post office, fire station, police, and \nhospital.\n  While this was a dark moment in American history, it is still an \nimportant part of it. By preserving this site, we are preserving our \nown history.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BROWNBACK (for himself and Mr. Lieberman):\n  S. 2699. A bill to promote the research and development of drugs \nrelated to neglected and tropical diseases, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, today I introduced with my colleague, \nSenator Lieberman, the Elimination of Neglected Diseases Act of 2006. \nThis legislation is designed to confront and combat a group of \ndangerous parasitic diseases that together claim more than 500,000 \nlives each year and adversely affect millions more. These 13-15 \nneglected tropical diseases, NTD, as they are called, are the most \ncommon infections in the developing world, and include such \ndebilitating diseases as leprosy, guinea worm, and trachoma. Many are \ndescribed in the Bible, exposing the sad fact that humans have been \nsuffering from these diseases for millennia. Moreover, research has \nshown alarming rates of comorbidity of NTD's with HIV/AIDS, \ntuberculosis, and malaria, resulting in severe complications with these \nalready devastating diseases.\n  The biggest challenge to finding cures for these diseases is the lack \nof a market. Pharmaceuticals are expensive to develop, and since \nneglected diseases disproportionately affect poor and marginalized \npopulations in the developing world, there are fewer incentives for \nconducting research and development for new treatments. The purpose of \nthis act is to encourage drug development by creating market incentives \nfor investment in new research. Specifically, the bill awards a limited \npatent-term extension or patent-term restoration for certain lifestyle \nand tropical disease drugs provided the company successfully develops a \nnew FDA-approved drug for an NTD. In this way, a drug company can \nrecoup costs for the large investment in NTD research and development.\n  With the exception of market incentives, we have all the right \ningredients to develop new drugs that would dramatically reduce the \nnumber of NTD cases and improve the quality of human life worldwide. I \nstrongly believe that this legislation will add the last remaining step \nto jumpstart competitive research and development for combating NTD's. \nI urge my colleagues to join in this effort by supporting this bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/02/senate-section/article/S3900-1", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3900-S3901]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 459--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING \nUNITED STATES PARTICIPATION AND AGREEMENT IN THE DOHA DEVELOPMENT ROUND \n                    OF THE WORLD TRADE ORGANIZATION\n\n  Mr. BAYH submitted the following resolution; which was referred to \nthe Committee on Finance:\n\n                              S.

Res. 460\n\n       Whereas General Mohamed Siad Barre, who came to power in \n     Somalia through a military coup in 1969, was ousted from \n     power by several armed groups of Somalia in 1991;\n       Whereas, following the collapse of the central authority in \n     Mogadishu, the capital of Somalia, rival groups of Somalia \n     devastated the region by--\n       (1) engaging in an armed struggle for personal political \n     power; and\n       (2) preventing food and medicine from reaching innocent \n     civilians who were suffering from drought and famine;\n       Whereas, during the continued internal chaos and \n     destruction in Somalia, hundreds of thousands of people have \n     died from--\n       (1) violence;\n       (2) starvation; and\n       (3) disease;\n       Whereas the people of Somalia witnessed the country \n     splinter into--\n       (1) the Republic of Somaliland, which--\n       (A) is located in the northwest portion of Somalia; and\n       (B) seeks independence;\n       (2) Puntland, which is an autonomous region located in the \n     northeast portion of Somalia; and\n       (3) a myriad of warlord-controlled fiefdoms that are \n     located in the southern portion of Somalia;\n       Whereas, on November 9, 1992, President George H. W. Bush \n     authorized Operation Restore Hope, and used the Armed Forces \n     to safeguard nongovernmental organizations while the \n     organizations attempted to provide humanitarian assistance to \n     the suffering civilian population of Somalia;\n       Whereas the United States led the Unified Task Force \n     (referred to in this preamble as the ``UNITAF'') in an effort \n     to--\n       (1) save lives; and\n       (2) help create a relatively peaceful environment for \n     humanitarian activity in Somalia;\n       Whereas, in May 1993, UNITAF handed its operations to the \n     United Nations for an operation subsequently known as the \n     ``United Nations Operation in Somalia'', giving the people of \n     Somalia hope for peace and stability;\n       Whereas the operation was unfortunately unsuccessful in \n     establishing peace and stability in Mogadishu and other parts \n     of Somalia;\n       Whereas, in March 1994, the Armed Forces withdrew from \n     Somalia after a long and bloody battle in Mogadishu on \n     October 3, 1993;\n       Whereas, 1 year after the withdrawal of the United States, \n     the United Nations withdrew all remaining peacekeepers \n     because the security conditions in Somalia had further \n     deteriorated;\n       Whereas the United Nations withdrew United Nations troops \n     from Somalia in 1995;\n       Whereas 13 conferences dedicated to promoting \n     reconciliation or peace have been called in order to end the \n     fighting in Somalia;\n       Whereas, in October 2002, 21 warring parties in Somalia \n     took positive action by--\n       (1) agreeing to a cease fire under the auspices of the East \n     African organization known as the ``Intergovernmental \n     Authority on Development''; and\n       (2) beginning a dialogue that was focused on forming a \n     government;\n       Whereas, in September 2003, the parties to the Kenyan peace \n     process agreed on the Transitional National Charter for \n     Somalia, and thus paved the way for the creation of a unified \n     national government in Somalia;\n       Whereas, in August 2004, the 275-member Transitional \n     Federal Assembly of Somalia was assembled in Kenya to reunify \n     and heal Somalia and comprised of 61 delegates from the 4 \n     major clans of Somalia and 31 delegates from an alliance of \n     minority clans located in that country;\n       Whereas Abdullahi Yusuf Ahmed, the former leader of \n     Puntland, was elected President of Somalia by the \n     Transitional Federal Government on October 10, 2004;\n       Whereas Abdullahi Yusuf Ahmed appointed Professor Ali \n     Mohamed Gedi as Prime Minister in November 2004;\n       Whereas a limited number of countries on the continent of \n     Africa have pledged to send peacekeeping troops to Somalia to \n     help protect the Transitional Federal Government as the \n     Government seeks to reestablish peace and order;\n       Whereas the international community should encourage those \n     individuals and organizations that have shown commitment to \n     the peace process, including--\n       (1) the African Union;\n       (2) the Intergovernmental Authority on Development;\n       (3) the Transitional Federal Government; and\n       (4) the many clans located in Somalia;\n       Whereas escalating tensions and violence between certain \n     clans threaten to weaken the ability of the Transitional \n     Federal Government to--\n       (1) develop capacity;\n       (2) effectively establish stability; and\n       (3) enforce the rule of law throughout Somalia;\n       Whereas the 2004 Country Reports on Terrorism, produced by \n     the Secretary of State in accordance with section 140 of the \n     Foreign Relations Authorization Act, Fiscal Years 1988 and \n     1989 (22 U.S.C. 2656f), noted that--\n       (1) ``a small number of al-Qa'ida operatives in East \n     Africa, particularly Somalia, continue to pose the most \n     serious threat to American interests in the region'';\n       (2) ``Somalia's lack of a functioning central government, \n     protracted state of violent instability, long unguarded \n     coastline, porous borders, and proximity to the Arabian \n     Peninsula make it a potential location for international \n     terrorists seeking a transit or launching point to conduct \n     operations elsewhere''; and\n       (3) ``[t]he U.S. government must identify and prioritize \n     actual or potential terrorist sanctuaries. For each, it \n     should have a realistic strategy to keep possible terrorists \n     insecure and on the run, using all elements of national \n     power'';\n       Whereas current political tensions may be exacerbated by \n     the ongoing humanitarian crisis that continues to affect \n     hundreds of thousands of individuals in Somalia, thereby \n     making the task of creating a stable, central government \n     increasingly difficult;\n\n[[Page S3902]]\n\n       Whereas the Transitional Federal Government is incapable of \n     meeting the fundamental needs of all people of Somalia, \n     including--\n       (1) education;\n       (2) health care; and\n       (3) other essential services;\n       Whereas the 2005 Human Rights Report published by the \n     Department of State cites significant concerns relating to \n     abuses of human rights in Somalia, including--\n       (1) female genital mutilation;\n       (2) rape; and\n       (3) political violence;\n       Whereas the Federal Government has provided $476,000,000 \n     for humanitarian assistance activities since 1990, although a \n     majority of those funds were distributed during the early \n     1990s;\n       Whereas it is the desire of the United States that the \n     people of Somalia live peaceful, stable, prosperous, and \n     happy lives;\n       Whereas the United States has historically supported the \n     aspirations of the people of Somalia; and\n       Whereas the compassion of the citizens of the United States \n     extends across the world to embrace every member of the human \n     family: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) the United States is working with the people of Somalia \n     to build a stable and enduring democratic nation in the Horn \n     of Africa that is prosperous and free of civil war;\n       (2) to achieve long-lasting peace in the region, the \n     nascent leadership and governance structures of Somalia \n     must--\n       (A) commit themselves to the principles of democracy and \n     the rule of law; and\n       (B) pledge to hold popular elections as soon as Somalia has \n     stabilized;\n       (3) the nascent Transitional Federal Government for Somalia \n     should--\n       (A) organize itself in 1 city as soon as practicable to--\n       (i) promote national unity; and\n       (ii) begin the process of reentering the international \n     community; and\n       (B) delay the consideration of the delicate issue regarding \n     the Republic of Somaliland until an appropriate level of \n     stability has been achieved in Somalia, while understanding \n     the critical importance of that issue for establishing a \n     peaceful Somalia;\n       (4) the President should--\n       (A) commend the efforts of those that have worked to \n     restore a functioning and internationally recognized \n     government in Somalia, including--\n       (i) the people of Somalia and their representatives;\n       (ii) the African Union;\n       (iii) the Intergovernmental Authority on Development;\n       (iv) friendly countries from the continent of Africa; and\n       (v) nongovernmental organizations;\n       (B) through the Secretary of State, develop a comprehensive \n     interagency stabilization and reconstruction strategy that--\n       (i) aligns humanitarian, developmental, economic, \n     political, counterterrorism, and regional strategies;\n       (ii) achieves the objectives of the United States in \n     Somalia in coordination with the international donor \n     community; and\n       (iii) orients current and future programs to meet the \n     objectives described in clause (ii);\n       (C) appoint a special envoy to Somalia to--\n       (i) help guide and inform United States policy and \n     interests in the region;

and\n       (ii) develop an improved plan to monitor and protect the \n     vast land and maritime borders of Somalia from--\n\n       (I) smuggling;\n       (II) dumping; and\n       (III) piracy; and\n\n       (E) through the Secretaries of State and the Treasury, work \n     with international financial institutions to incrementally \n     reduce the crippling international debt of Somalia on the \n     condition that Somalia upholds democratic and free market \n     principles;\n       (5) the United States Agency for International Development \n     should increase the assistance that the Agency provides to \n     the Transitional Federal Government to rebuild the national \n     infrastructure of Somalia, and place particular emphasis on \n     the promotion of the governmental institutions of Somalia;\n       (6) the United States should provide training and support \n     to the Transitional National Government of Somalia to--\n       (A) fight terrorism and extremism; and\n       (B) strengthen the civil society and grassroots efforts in \n     Somalia that will deny terrorist and extremist groups a \n     fertile ground for recruitment in that country;\n       (7) the United States, in partnership with the United \n     Nations and the international donor community, must--\n       (A) heed the calls concerning the significant drought \n     affecting the region that have been placed by--\n       (i) the United Nations Coordinator for Humanitarian \n     Assistance;\n       (ii) the international community of nongovernmental \n     organizations; and\n       (iii) regional governments;\n       (B) provide sufficient humanitarian assistance to those \n     impacted by the drought; and\n       (C) realize that a failure to address the humanitarian \n     emergency could have a negative impact on fragile political \n     developments; and\n       (8) not later than 180 days after the date of enactment of \n     this resolution, the Secretary of State should present to \n     Congress a status report on items referred to in paragraphs \n     (4) through (8) that includes--\n       (A) a projection of future challenges regarding Somalia;

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nnow proceed to consideration of S. Res. 461, which was submitted \nearlier today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 461) supporting and commending the \n     supporters of the Jefferson Awards for Public Service for \n     encouraging all citizens of the United States to embark on a \n     life of public service and recognizing those citizens who \n     have already performed extraordinary deeds for their \n     community and country.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, this week has been designated as Public \nService Recognition Week and in keeping with the spirit of this \nimportant week I would like to take this opportunity to recognize the \nimportant contribution that the Jefferson Awards for Public Service \nhave made over nearly three and a half decades.\n  I am pleased to be joined by Senators Durbin, Lugar, and Biden is \nsubmitting this resolution commending the American Institute for Public \nService and the importance of the Jefferson Awards for Public Service. \nThe Jefferson Awards were established on a bipartisan basis in 1972 by \nJacqueline Kennedy Onassis, Senator Robert Taft, Jr., and Sam Beard. \nThe awards honor individuals for their achievements and contributions \nthrough public and community service.\n  Winners of the award for elected and appointed officials have \nincluded former Senators Robert Dole, Daniel Patrick Moynihan, and John \nGlenn. Other winners include Rudoph Giuliani, Dr. Condoleezza Rice, \nJustice Sandra Day O'Connor, and Robert Rubin. In addition, private \ncitizens who have won the award include Walter Annenberg, Brian Lamb, \nand Oprah Winfrey.\n  The Jefferson Awards have honored award recipients at the national \nlevel by placing them on a ``Who's Who'' list of outstanding citizens \nof the United States and at the same time have honored at the local \nlevel recipients as ``Unsung Heroes'' who accomplished extraordinary \ndeeds for the betterment of the United States.\n  The Senate fully supports the goals and ideals of the Jefferson \nawards and during this week of Public Service Recognition, I stand on \nthe floor of the Senate and commend the people of this organization.\n\n\n                    PUBLIC SERVICE RECOGNITION WEEK\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, this week, we celebrate Public Service \nRecognition Week, a time when all Americans are asked to remember the \nNation's public workers who serve their country and the world by \ndelivering services essential to our daily lives.\n  As the ranking member of the Federal Workforce Subcommittee, I wish \nto spotlight the dedication, commitment, and loyalty demonstrated every \nday by public servants. That is why I introduce annually--and the \nSenate passes--a resolution honoring employees at all levels of \nGovernment. In the aftermath of 9/11 and the anthrax attacks a month \nlater, we gained a better appreciation of the critical work undertaken \nby public employees, such as firefighters, paramedics, nurses, and U.S. \npostal workers. I thank my colleagues for their quick action last week \nin passing my resolution, S. Res. 412, which I introduced with the \nsupport of the leadership of the Homeland Security and Governmental \nAffairs Committee.\n  Despite the need to support public workers, far too often we take for \ngranted these men and women whose sense of duty and devotion to country \nguides the work they do daily for their fellow Americans. Although our \nlives are enriched by the work of Federal employees, most people are \nunfamiliar with the Federal Executive Boards, FEB, which were created \nby President John F. Kennedy in 1961 to better coordinate the \nactivities of the Federal Government outside of Washington, DC. \nDecisions affecting the expenditure of billions of taxpayer dollars are \nmade in the field which affect all Americans. Having FEBs--whose \nmembers are senior agency personnel--saves time, money, and effort \nwhile ensuring that these senior employees are more in touch with State \nand local governments, as well as their communities.\n  I am especially proud of the Honolulu-Pacific Federal Executive \nBoard, HPFEB, which today celebrates its 50th Excellence in Federal \nGovernment Awards with a ceremony at the Sheraton Waikiki Hotel. I am \nalso pleased to note that before an FEB was even established in Hawaii, \nforward thinkers had already begun to honor the best in Federal service \nthrough these awards. Today's program not only honors the 153 employees \nreceiving awards but provides all agencies and military commands in \nHawaii and the Pacific an opportunity to showcase their organizations \nthrough exhibits outside the hotel's ballroom. Honoring today's \nawardees are Federal agency heads, military commanders, State and local \ngovernment officials, and members of the business community.\n  According to the HPFEB, the Excellence in Federal Government Awards \nProgram recognizes outstanding Federal employees for their efforts, \nleadership, and initiative. The program encourages innovation and \nexcellence in government, reinforces pride in Federal service, and \nhelps call public attention to the broad range of services provided by \nFederal employees.\n  The HPFEB has over 90 members, senior heads of Federal agencies and \nmilitary commands, who represent the over 70,000 civilian and military \npersonnel in the Pacific region, including the Department of Defense, \nthe Government's largest civilian employer in Hawaii. Like its 27 \ncounterparts nationwide, the HPFEB communicates with and partners with \nthe community, works to reduce costs and improve efficiencies, \nfacilitates service delivery and coordinates emergency services.\n  The Honolulu-Pacific Federal Executive Board embraces its interagency \ncoordinating role and is proud of its five primary accomplishments: \ncreating and operating the Pacific Leadership Academy to ensure that \nagencies within Hawaii and the Pacific area are\n\n[[Page S3917]]\n\ntraining today and tomorrow's cadre of Federal leaders; celebrating the \nwork of Federal employees through its Excellence in Government Awards, \nwhich last year honored 126 employees; supporting the Combined Federal \nCampaign by raising over $6.1 million in 2005; working with Federal, \nState, and local governments to improve emergency planning by \nparticipating in disaster exercises, partnering with the State of \nHawaii to purchase the $70,000 system ``Notifyer,'' and developing a \nsimultaneous broadcast telephone message system that updates emergency \ninformation; and establishing councils and working groups.\n  Hawaii's FEB is sponsored by the Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard and \nIntermediate Maintenance Facility, Department of the Navy, and is \nheaded by Ms. Gloria Uyehara, the Executive Director, who has over 30 \nyears of career service, most recently as head of the Education and \nDevelopment Office, promoting leadership development and succession \nplanning at the Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard. She is supported by Ms. \nGerry A. Reese, who has been with the HPFEB for more than 30 years as \nthe Executive Assistant.\n  Ms. Uyehara points out that today's Excellence in Federal Government \nAwards provides a model of excellence for all Federal employees and \npromotes ideas and concepts to encourage the use of best practices. \nThose Federal and military personnel working with the HPFEB understand \nthe need to reach out to their community and foster cooperation among \nall levels of Government. These men and women exemplify the spirit of \npublic service. Together they typify today's Federal and military \npersonnel who work tirelessly to make democracy work.\n  At a time when the Federal Government faces strong competition with \nthe public and private sector for skilled employees and the \nadministration is pushing for greater outsourcing, it is imperative \nthat we continue to support the Government's network of Federal \nexecutive boards, associations, and councils. It would be unwise to \ndiminish the critical role that these entities play in identifying and \ninstituting efficiencies and improving Government services within the \ncommunities they serve and to the Nation as a whole.\n  Again, I send my warmest congratulations and aloha to the members of \nthe Honolulu-Pacific Federal Executive Board which provides the \nleadership, the enthusiasm, and the expertise to ensure that Government \nis more responsive, innovative, and effective.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. I ask unanimous consent that the resolution be agreed to, \nthe preamble be agreed to, and the motion to reconsider be laid upon \nthe table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 461) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 461\n\n       Whereas one of the defining traditions of the democracy of \n     the United States is that each person can make a difference;\n       Whereas the value of public and community service was a \n     founding principle of the Government of the United States;\n       Whereas, for generation after generation, the citizens of \n     the United States have desired to pass to the youth of the \n     Nation the tradition of neighbors helping neighbors through--\n       (1) local community service;\n       (2) volunteerism; and\n       (3) public service;\n       Whereas, to build stronger communities, the youth of the \n     United States should be inspired to seek career opportunities \n     in--\n       (1) the public sector;\n       (2) the nonprofit sector;\n       (3) the faith-based community; and\n       (4) Federal, State, and local governments;\n       Whereas the Jefferson Awards for Public Service are a \n     prestigious national recognition system that was created on a \n     nonpartisan basis in 1972 by--\n       (1) Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis;\n       (2) Senator Robert Taft, Jr.; and\n       (3) Sam Beard;\n       Whereas the creators of the Jefferson Awards for Public \n     Service sought to create an award similar to the Nobel Prize \n     to encourage and honor individuals for their achievements and \n     contributions in public and community service;\n       Whereas, for over 30 years, the supporters of the Jefferson \n     Awards for Public Service have pioneered the promotion of \n     civic engagement by using profiles of individual excellence, \n     the media, and modern technology to attract and recruit all \n     citizens of the United States to participate in the \n     democratic processes of the Nation; and\n       Whereas the Jefferson Awards for Public Service have \n     honored award recipients at--\n       (1) the national level, by placing the recipients on a \n     ``Who's Who'' list of outstanding citizens of the United \n     States; and\n       (2) the local level, by naming the recipients ``Unsung \n     Heroes'' who accomplish extraordinary deeds for the \n     betterment of the United States while going largely \n     unnoticed: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) fully supports the goals and ideals that the creators \n     instilled into the civic engagement initiatives of the \n     Jefferson Awards for Public Service; and\n       (2) salutes and acknowledges the American Institute for \n     Public Service and the role played by the Jefferson Awards \n     for Public Service in promoting public service in the United \n     States.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/02/senate-section/article/S3917-1", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3917-S3918]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nPOSTHUMOUSLY AWARDING THE PRESIDENTIAL MEDAL OF FREEDOM TO LEROY ROBERT \n                           ``SATCHEL'' PAIGE\n\n  Mr. ENSIGN.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S.

Res. 408\n\n       Expressing the sense of the Senate that the President \n     should declare lung cancer a public health priority and \n     should implement a comprehensive interagency program that \n     will reduce lung cancer mortality by at least 50 percent by \n     2015.\n       Whereas lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death \n     for both men and women, accounting for 28 percent of all \n     cancer deaths;\n       Whereas lung cancer kills more people annually than breast \n     cancer, prostate cancer, colon cancer, liver cancer, \n     melanoma, and kidney cancer combined;\n       Whereas, since the National Cancer Act of 1971 (Public Law \n     92-218; 85 Stat. 778), coordinated and comprehensive research \n     has elevated the 5-year survival rates for breast cancer to \n     87 percent, for prostate cancer to 99 percent, and colon \n     cancer to 64 percent;\n       Whereas the survival rate for lung cancer is still only 15 \n     percent and a similar coordinated and comprehensive research \n     effort is required to achieve increases in lung cancer \n     survivability rates;\n       Whereas 60 percent of lung cancer is now diagnosed in \n     nonsmokers and former smokers;\n       Whereas \\2/3\\ of nonsmokers diagnosed with lung cancer are \n     women;\n       Whereas certain minority populations, such as black males, \n     have disproportionately high rates of lung cancer incidence \n     and mortality, notwithstanding their lower smoking rate;\n       Whereas members of the Baby Boomer generation are entering \n     their sixties, the most common age for the development of \n     cancer;\n       Whereas tobacco addiction and exposure to other lung cancer \n     carcinogens such as Agent Orange and other herbicides and \n     battlefield emissions are serious problems among military \n     personnel and war veterans;\n       Whereas the August 2001 Report of the Lung Cancer Progress \n     Review Group of the National Cancer Institute stated that \n     funding for lung cancer research was ``far below the levels \n     characterized for other common malignancies and far out of \n     proportion to its massive health impact'';\n       Whereas the Report of the Lung Cancer Progress Review Group \n     identified as its ``highest priority'' the creation of \n     integrated, multidisciplinary, multi-institutional research \n     consortia organized around the problem of lung cancer rather \n     than around specific research disciplines; and\n       Whereas the United States must enhance its response to the \n     issues raised in the Report of the Lung Cancer Progress \n     Review Group: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that the \n     President should--\n       (1) declare lung cancer a public health priority and \n     immediately lead a coordinated effort to reduce the mortality \n     rate of lung cancer by 50 percent by 2015;\n       (2) direct the Secretary of the Department of Health and \n     Human Services to increase funding for lung cancer research \n     and other lung cancer-related programs within a coordinated \n     strategy and defined goals, including--\n       (A) translational research and specialized lung cancer \n     research centers;\n       (B) expansion of existing multi-institutional, population-\n     based screening programs incorporating state of the art image \n     processing, centralized review, clinical management, and \n     tobacco cessation protocols;\n       (C) research on disparities in lung cancer incidence and \n     mortality rates;\n       (D) graduate medical education programs in thoracic \n     medicine and cardiothoracic surgery;\n       (E) new programs within the Food and Drug Administration to \n     expedite the development of chemoprevention and targeted \n     therapies for lung cancer;\n       (F) annual reviews by the Agency for Healthcare Research \n     and Quality of lung cancer screening and treatment protocols;\n       (G) the appointment of a lung cancer director within the \n     Centers for Disease Control and Prevention with authority to \n     improve lung cancer surveillance and screening programs; and\n       (H) lung cancer screening demonstration programs under the \n     direction of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services;\n       (3) direct the Secretary of Defense, in conjunction with \n     the Secretary of Veterans Affairs, to develop a broad-based \n     lung cancer screening and disease management program among \n     members of the Armed Forces and veterans, and to develop \n     technologically advanced diagnostic programs for the early \n     detection of lung cancer;\n       (4) appoint the Lung Cancer Scientific and Medical Advisory \n     Committee comprised of medical, scientific, pharmaceutical, \n     and patient advocacy representatives to work with the \n     National Lung Cancer Public Health Policy Board and to report \n     to the President and Congress on the progress and the \n     obstacles in achieving the goal described in paragraph 1; and\n       (5) convene a National Lung Cancer Public Health Policy \n     Board comprised of multiagency and multidepartment \n     representatives and at least 3 members of the Lung Cancer \n     Scientific and Medical Advisory Committee, that will oversee \n     and coordinate all efforts to accomplish the mission of \n     reducing lung cancer mortality rate by 50 percent by 2015.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/02/senate-section/article/S3918-3", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3918-S3930]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           NAVAJO-HOPI LAND SETTLEMENT AMENDMENTS ACT OF 2005\n\n  Mr. ENSIGN.

Mr. President, I rise today in support of the amendment \noffered by the Senator from New Jersey, Senator Menendez. Senator \nMenendez is carrying on a great tradition. His predecessor, Senator Jon \nCorzine, now Governor of New Jersey, showed a special interest in the \ngenocide which is occurring in Darfur in Africa. I cannot say how many \ntimes Senator Corzine came to the Senate to raise this issue. I am glad \nSenator Menendez has the same intensity and the same commitment \nGovernor Corzine showed in the Senate. He has evidenced it by this \namendment which adds an additional $60 million for peacekeeping forces.\n  I have spoken in the Senate many times about the Darfur crisis. I say \nthat with some embarrassment. It is unfortunate that I still have to \nreturn to the Senate time after time, month after month, year after \nyear. While we debate, people die. What is happening in Darfur is a \nshameful situation for any country in the world, shameful for those who \nlive in peace and in powerful countries for not doing more.\n  First, let me salute this administration. Though I disagree with the \nBush administration on so many things, I have been respectful of the \nfact from the beginning, under Secretary of State Colin Powell and now \nSecretary of State Condoleezza Rice, they have not pulled any punches. \nThey have said from the outset what is occurring in Darfur is nothing \nshort of genocide. That is a stark departure from what occurred under \nthe Clinton administration, an administration which I admired and \nworked with, but during the Rwanda genocide they were reluctant to use \nthe word. So many times our Secretary of State and others within the \nadministration were pinned down: Was Rwanda a genocide? And even while \npeople were losing their lives in that African nation, they refused to \nuse the word.\n  The reason is because it carries with it so much moral import, so \nmuch responsibility. Once deciding a genocide is occurring in some part \nof the world, what, then, must we do? Under the Genocide Convention, we \nare to step forward. The civilized family of nations is to step forward \nto stop the genocide in place and to protect the innocent people.\n  For several years, though we have declared it genocide, we have not \ndone nearly as much as we should. We have relied on a small and \nsomewhat impotent group of African Union soldiers who may be trying to \ndo their best but who are completely outmanned by the jingaweit and \nother violent actors in that nation who take advantage every day of the \npoor people of Darfur.\n  Last week, I went back to my alma mater, Georgetown University, here \nin Washington, DC, and I spoke to a group of students. It was a great \nnight. I have not been back at campus in that capacity. It was great to \nspeak to them. As the students came up to ask questions, a group of \nstudents came forward and said, We are a student group on this campus \ngenuinely interested in the genocide in Darfur. We are planning a rally \nin Washington--this last Sunday--and we want to know what you are going \nto do about it, Senator.\n  It was a legitimate question, one which I answered by saying I had \ndone some things, but I need to do more. I offered an amendment to the \nbill now pending to add $50 million to help move in a U.N. peacekeeping \nforce that will augment the African Union force and give some power to \nthis effort to protect these poor innocent people.\n  This weekend, on the National Mall in Washington, at the Federal \nPlaza in Chicago, and in 16 other cities across our country, tens of \nthousands of people gathered to protest the ongoing genocide in Darfur. \nAs the Washington Post noted, the gathering of people on The Mall was \none of the most diverse in history. The crowd was composed of people \nfrom all walks of life: Jews, Christians, Muslims, liberal, \nconservatives, teenagers, and members of the ``greatest generation.'' \nThey gathered under many different signs but many contained the same \nmessage: Save Darfur. That is simple. That is powerful. That is our \nmoral responsibility, to save Darfur.\n  Once again, we have fallen short. We promised that once we declared \ngenocide, we would act. We said after the genocides of recent memory, \nit would never again happen in our time. Sadly, it has. And things are \ngetting worse instead of better. Violence is continuing. The Sudanese \nGovernment is blocking the preparations for the U.N. mission and peace \ntalks have stalled.\n  Last week, there was an announcement in the paper which troubled me. \nThe World Food Program, one of the most important programs in the world \nto feed needy people, announced it was forced to cut food rations in \nDarfur in half. More than 6 million people across Sudan require food \naid, more than any other country on Earth. The World Food Program \nestimates it needs approximately $750 million to feed them and it does \nnot have the money. The United States has provided $188 million; the \nEuropean Union, almost nothing. Libya is the only member of the Arab \nleague to step up.\n  This has to change. We can and should do more and so should the rest \nof the world. It is bad enough to stand by without taking appropriate \naction to stop the violence of genocide. But how can we have on our \nconscience that these poor people, these children, these families, \ndispossessed and living in fear, will now slowly starve to death on our \nwatch?\n\n  Several amendments have been filed to this emergency supplemental \nbill that addressed Darfur. I am proud to cosponsor them. On this \namendment by Senator Menendez of New Jersey, I ask unanimous consent to \njoin as a cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S3931]]\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. His amendment increases funding for international \npeacekeeping efforts by $60 million.\n  Another amendment that has been filed authorizes the Department of \nDefense to assist NATO in peacekeeping efforts in Darfur. The third \nsets aside funds for a special envoy to be named to play the role that \nformer Senator John Danforth of Missouri played so effectively. Let me \nsay parenthetically, he is a great man. I am honored to call him a \nfriend. He accepted this assignment when he could have returned to the \npeace and solitude of his retired life in St. Louis, but leaving the \nUnited Nations he went on to Darfur. That speaks volumes about this \nman's commitment to the suffering of the world that he did it.\n  Now we have an amendment before the Senate asking that another envoy \nbe sent by the United States, a person of the caliber of John Danforth, \nwho can do his best to try to bring some peace to that region.\n  The situation in Darfur represents a massive humanitarian \ncatastrophe, one that is ongoing, one that is happening on our watch. \nAs we stand to make these speeches in the comfort and security of the \nSenate, people are literally dying, being raped, and starving to death \nin Darfur.\n  Over the past 3 months alone, resurging violence in Darfur has forced \n200,000 people from their homes. One-third of them are cut off from any \nhumanitarian aid. In addition, Human Rights Watch has reported the \nSudanese Government launched a new offensive in southern Darfur last \nweek. The government troops reportedly used helicopter gun ships \nagainst a defenseless village in south Darfur where thousands of \ndisplaced Darfurians sought refuge. Can you imagine the horror of that \nscene as helicopter gun ships sprayed these poor helpless people?\n  The African Union mission in Darfur has 7,000 peacekeepers; 7,000 men \nin uniform to guard an area the size of Texas. But a Texas without \nroads, a Texas without bridges, a Texas without communication. They \ncannot end this genocide by themselves.\n  Unfortunately, while violence in Darfur escalates, the news on the \nprospects of peace, talks between the Government of Sudan and the rebel \ngroups, is very discouraging. The talks have dragged on for 2 bloody \nyears. They were set to conclude on Sunday, but in the absence of an \nagreement, they have been extended another 48 hours. The prospects for \nan accord seem dim. Khartoum so far has also refused to allow a U.N. \nassessment team into Darfur to prepare for a mission there.\n  The Sudanese Government launched a war on its own people for 3 \nstraight years. They cannot be allowed to dictate terms to the United \nNations. Hundreds of thousands of lives hang in the balance in Darfur. \nWe should appoint that special envoy, someone of the stature, the \ndedication, and wisdom of John Danforth, to try to advance the peace \nprocess. The United States must engage the other members of the United \nNations Security Council to put real pressure on the Government of \nSudan.\n\n  One of the troubling aspects is that many believe that the major \ncountries of the world are pulling their punches and not holding Sudan \naccountable because Sudan has oil deposits. Once again, our foreign \npolicy is being affected, if not dictated, by energy reserves in \nAfrica, as it is in so many other parts of the world.\n  What a grim reminder of how important it is for the United States to \nmove to energy independence so we can stand up for the values we need \nwithout sacrificing all-important energy for our own economy and that \nother countries can step forward and make the right decision in terms \nof the morality and values of the world rather than gauging the impact \nit will have on their oil imports.\n  We have to work with our European allies to persuade China and Russia \nto set aside their objections to U.N. action.\n  We should pass the amendments before us this week on the supplemental \nappropriations bill, and the Darfur Peace and Accountability Act should \nbe signed into law. We should continue to support the African Union \nmission in Darfur, while leading efforts to ensure that NATO and the \nUnited Nations take up the peacekeeping mission in Darfur.\n  Three years of genocide--3 years after our declaration that a \ngenocide was occurring right here on our watch--3 years is too long.\n  I echo the thousands of people who gathered across America on \nSunday--the students from Georgetown University, the students from \nother universities across this country, and many other caring people \nwho came forward. I urge the Senate to join them to save Darfur.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/02/senate-section/article/S3931-1", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3931]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  MEASURE READ THE FIRST TIME--S. 2700\n\n  Mr. DURBIN.
