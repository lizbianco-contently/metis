Mr. President, I would like to open today with respects \npaid to Erma Byrd, the wife of our dear friend and colleague, Senator \nRobert Byrd. As the Chaplain mentioned in his prayer, Mrs. Byrd passed \naway recently--in fact, on Saturday night.\n  Erma Ora James Byrd was the devoted wife of Senator Byrd for nearly \n69 years. Born in Virginia in 1917, Erma and her family moved to West \nVirginia when she was a child. It was there that she met her future \nhusband at the Mark Twain Grade School in Raleigh County.\n\n[[Page S2398]]\n\n  The couple married when they were 19 years old. The daughter of coal \nminers, Erma never forgot her humble beginnings.\n  As a young couple, the Byrds enjoyed a simple existence. They could \noften be found at community square dances where Senator Byrd would be \nplaying his fiddle and Erma would be dancing. From those local dances, \nto running a grocery business, to raising a family, Erma and Senator \nByrd were partners in everything they did.\n  When Senator Byrd decided to come to the House of Representatives in \n1952 and then later entered law school, Erma took the lead in handling \nthe house and bringing up their daughters.\n  Throughout her life, Mrs. Byrd focused on her family. The Byrds were \nthe proud parents to two daughters, Mona and Marjorie. And they were \nblessed with six grandchildren and six great grandchildren.\n  Mrs. Byrd's love of children extended far beyond her family. In West \nVirginia, Erma Byrd was known far and wide for her advocacy for \nchildren and for helping young people get ahead.\n\n  Dedicated, determined, loving, and loyal--these were the words many \nused to describe Erma Byrd. And they are the qualities that our \ncolleague cherished dearly in his wife.\n  On their 65th wedding anniversary, Senator Byrd said:\n\n       Erma and I are complete and whole, a total that is more \n     than the sum of its parts. In my life, Erma Ora Byrd is the \n     diamond. She is a priceless treasure, a multifaceted woman of \n     great insight and wisdom, of quiet humor and common sense. I \n     wish that more people could know the joy I have had in \n     finding one's soul mate early in life and then sharing that \n     deep companionship over many happy years.\n\n  Senator Byrd, our thoughts and our prayers are with you and your \nfamily. We mourn your loss, and we celebrate the life of the wonderful \nwoman who stood by your side.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/03/27/senate-section/article/S2398-1", "month": "03", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2398-S2399]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            BORDER SECURITY\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, this week, if there are no obstructionist \ntactics, the Senate will begin debate on protecting our country and \nfixing a broken immigration system.\n  Since last fall, when I announced the Senate would take up this \nissue, the Judiciary Committee has spent over 5 weeks, and, as of \ntoday, they are in their sixth markup on it. I thank Chairman Specter \nfor his leadership throughout this process, during these six markups \nover the last 5 weeks. The Judiciary Committee members and their staff \nhave worked long and hard under his guidance. As we speak, his \ncommittee is in session trying to finish the task set out for them. I, \nas leader, appreciate that and appreciate their efforts and the \ntremendous work they have done thus far.\n  America needs secure borders. Right now, we do not have them. Every \nday, thousands of people violate our frontiers. We do not know who they \nare and quite often we cannot stop them. As a nation of immigrants \nwhich honors the rule of law, we must secure our borders to make \nAmerica safe, so we can fix our country's immigration system.\n  We are a nation of immigrants. We all came from somewhere else, and \nwe have all benefited from America's uniquely inclusive ethos. But \nAmerica is also a nation of laws. Our laws bind and protect us. They \ntransform us from seekers into citizens and are the very foundation of \nour democracy.\n  A nation that cannot secure its borders cannot secure its destiny or \nadminister its laws. The situation along our southern border now ranks \nas a national security challenge second only to the war on terror.\n  Before we left for last week's recess, I introduced the Securing \nAmerica's Borders Act, or SABA, so that the Senate would be able to \ntake up border security and interior law enforcement and allow the \nSenate to focus on comprehensive illegal immigration reform. It \nincludes a number of commonsense, consensus measures that improve \nsecurity along our physical border, crack down on human smugglers, \nsimplify the process of deporting wrongdoers, and make it easier for \nemployers to confirm their employees' legal status. And many of its \nprovisions are built from ideas in the 9/11 Commission report.\n  Why should we act and why should we act now? Well, every day we delay \nwe discover new facts that show us waiting makes America less safe and \nless secure. To take just one example, in January, officials discovered \na massive tunnel stretching nearly a half a mile from Tijuana to San \nDiego. We do not know how many, or who, snuck in through this tunnel. \nWe do not know what materials came into our country, or when, through \nthis tunnel.\n  When people break our laws and come through our borders, we do know \nthat mixed in with families looking for a better life are drug dealers, \nhuman traffickers, terrorists, and common criminals who cross into our \ncountry. Increasing our border security reduces that threat to our \ncountry and to our citizens.\n  The danger is not only to America; there is danger to those who try \nto cross our borders as well. Unofficial data collected along the \nArizona border--the only area for which we have information--show that \nnearly 225 people died along the border in 2005 alone. About 10 percent \nperished under circumstances that suggest foul play. And we all know \nthe terrible stories of those who prey on vulnerable migrants, who \ncharge outrageous prices to smuggle them across the border and then, \noften, abandon them the moment trouble strikes. That is wrong. We must \nact. And we will do so over the next 2 weeks.\n  We need better enforcement and more manpower on the ground. Last \nyear, the Senate led the charge to provide funding to hire 1,000 \nadditional officers, more equipment, and more detention beds. This was \na start but only a start.\n  My proposal adds nearly 15,000 more officers over the next few years \nin a sustained and focused effort to buttress the 20,000 already \ndeployed to work on border issues. It also requires new investments in \nunmanned aerial vehicles, cameras, and sensors, and a comprehensive \nnational border security strategy. It establishes the long-term project \nof building a virtual barrier to cover every mile of the 1,951-mile \nlong border with Mexico. This will both make America safer and reduce \nthe number of people endangering themselves trying to come into this \ncountry.\n  In addition to physically strengthening the border, the bill makes it \neasier for the Department of Homeland Security to catch people who \nviolate our immigration laws. It enhances the collection of biometric \ndata about who enters the country and allows the Homeland Security \nDepartment to set up additional border checkpoints.\n  The law creates tough, new penalties for human smugglers and document \nforgers. And under this bill, terrorists, dangerous gang members, and \nothers with serious criminal connections face expedited removal from \nthe United States.\n  But my bill doesn't just draw on the common sense of the American \npeople for its provisions; it also looks to the \n9/11 Commission report for guidance.\n  Many of the bill's provisions reflect the guidance of that \ncommission. For example, the commission recommended that we consolidate \nborder screening systems. SABA does that. It encouraged the use of \nbiometric data to keep track of who was coming and going. SABA does \nthat. It identified the need of State and local officials to work with \nFederal agencies to identify terrorist suspects. SABA does that as \nwell.\n  Securing the border and enforcing our laws are crucial first steps to \nmaking America safer. But much more remains to be done. There are over \n11 million people in this country illegally today. Congress cannot turn \na blind eye to this growing number. We need to act.\n  As many know, I oppose amnesty. With our economy at full employment, \nmany who break our laws come to this country to do the work others \nwon't do so as to make a better life for themselves and their families. \nI honor that. America has always been the place where one can come to \nlive out a dream of improvement and renewal. But while we welcome those \nwho refresh and restore our American spirit, we have always done so \nwithin a framework of law. The full Senate should have the chance to \ndiscuss and to debate and to decide how we balance that rule of law \nwith the situation as we find it today.\n  I am here to solve problems, not stand around. All Members come here\n\n[[Page S2399]]\n\nto act and not to fill space. We need to work together so that all 100 \nSenators have the opportunity to work within our rules to solve this \nproblem.\n  I do hope the minority will not put procedural roadblocks in the way \nof the Senate resolving these issues, so we can put some of our \ncountry's best minds to work here on the floor now, this week.\n  I invite all who have ideas to come and work with us. Together, \nrather than apart, we can bring the best to bear to solve this problem \nof illegal immigration so that America is safer, so that America is \nmore secure.\n  As I said when I introduced the bill we call SABA, I want this coming \ndebate to reflect our history in America as a nation committed to the \nrule of law and our immigrant inheritance.\n  I am glad many agree on the need to ensure our debate is in the best \nkeeping of the Senate's traditions. We ought to be honest about the \nproblems we face and the outcomes we seek, within a framework of \nconversation that does credit to the Senate and the Nation.\n  This debate, and our effort, is about the American dream and the hope \nthis country holds for so many hard-working people. But it is also an \nissue about what it means to be a nation. And every nation must keep \nits citizens safe and keep its borders secure. We should not have to \nchoose between respect for our history and respect for our laws.\n  With hard work and responsible debate, we can have both. I hope we \ncan conduct this debate with civility and seriousness.

Mr. President, having arrived late Saturday night from \nHawaii where we attended the memorial services for Senator Inouye's \nlate wife Maggie, my wife Catherine and I were deeply saddened the next \nmorning to learn that Erma Ora James Byrd had passed away Saturday \nnight. I come to offer our sincere condolences to our good friend \nSenator Byrd and his family.\n  As the leader has said, Senator Byrd and Erma were married at the age \nof 19. In their nearly 69 years of marriage, Erma was a pillar of \nstrength to our friend. She stood by him as he finished high school and \ncollege and attended American University Law School. She was at his \nside every moment and milestone in his 60 years of public service. As \nhe has often told us, it was Erma who made sure he was polished and \nwell pressed before he left for the Capitol every morning. She took \ngreat pride in the work he did for their State and for our Nation.\n  Erma has been part of our Senate family since the Senator was elected \nto this body in 1958. Those of us who have served with the Senator have \ncome to know her and love her, and we will deeply miss her.\n  She was a true southern lady in every sense--intelligent, graceful, \nand known for her southern hospitality. As Senator Byrd has often \nmentioned, she never sought the limelight, choosing instead to keep her \nfocus on their family and their home.\n  Catherine and I were privileged to travel with Erma and Senator Byrd \nover the years, and my family has always enjoyed being with them. We \nhave looked forward to celebrating Erma's birthday each year. Her \nannual birthday lunch on Capitol Hill has always included lots of \nbeautiful flowers which Erma loved.\n  We have also been the recipient of Senator Byrd's good wishes for our \nfamily, particularly our children over the years. I remember distinctly \nthe comment that Senator Byrd made on the floor when our first \ngrandchild was born, and he has been very kind to our last child, Lily, \nwho has grown up and known Senator Byrd as one of her ``uncles,'' so to \nspeak. Catherine remembers the many hours Erma spent sewing and \nknitting on Tuesday mornings for the Senate wives' Red Cross projects. \nWe will not forget how gracious and generous she was when she hosted \nMembers of the Senate and the British Parliament in their home State of \nWest Virginia some years ago. It was a lovely evening up on the \nmountaintop. Those memories will stay with us forever.\n  Erma was not only a great partner to Senator Byrd in life, she was a \nwonderful mother to their two daughters. Senator Frist has spoken \nextensively on them. But anyone who wants to understand the depth of \nthe Senator's love for Erma should read the speeches he has come to the \nfloor to deliver each Mother's Day.\n  In his Mother's Day address in 1997, he said this:\n\n       I could not have put in the countless hours required by my \n     office without [Erma's] extreme patience and forbearance, \n     understanding and good humor and support. Erma is the epitome \n     of traditional family values, and my pride in the \n     accomplishments of my daughters and their children is a clear \n     reflection of the values and lessons they learned from their \n     mother and their grandmother.\n\n  Mr. President, West Virginia has lost a beloved daughter, and the \nSenate has lost a dear friend. I think she may have been the longest \nserving wife of a Senator. Catherine and I extend our deepest \nsympathies to Senator Byrd, his family, and all who knew and loved \nErma. We are deeply saddened by this news.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic minority whip.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today to commemorate the life and \nmourn the loss of a remarkable woman. Erma Byrd, the wife of Senator \nRobert C. Byrd, passed away over the weekend after battling a long \nillness. Her death brings sadness to the entire Senate family. On \nbehalf of the Senate I wish to extend our condolences to Senator Byrd \nand their two daughters, five grandchildren, and six great-\ngrandchildren.\n  This remarkable couple had been married for 69 years, and anyone who \nspent time with Senator Byrd knows how much they loved one another. It \nis clear they took their vows very seriously, to stand by one another \nin sickness and health. It is a tribute to our colleague and to his \nlate wife that their devotion and love sustained them together for so \nmany years.\n  As Senator Byrd has said on the floor of the Senate so many times, \nErma Byrd has always been his touchstone. He said:\n\n       Her faith in me has never wavered and she took to mothering \n     me as effortlessly as she took to mothering our daughters. In \n     Erma Ora James Byrd runs the blood of a great line of \n     mothers, fierce in their devotion to their families, vigilant \n     in their care, loving in their manner.\n\n  In a time of increasing callousness and cynicism, the story of Robert \nand Erma Byrd can only be described as a true lifelong love story. Erma \nand Robert Byrd were married when they were both 19 years old. They met \nwhen they were students in grade school in Raleigh County, WV.\n  One of my favorite stories that Senator Byrd tells is about his \ncourtship of Erma. It turns out he decided that the best way to Erma's \nheart was with another man's candy. His family wasn't prosperous, but \nthe young Robert C. Byrd had a friend whose father owned a candy store, \nand each day that young man would pass out a few pieces of candy to his \nfriends--such as Robert Byrd. As tempting as I am sure it was, Robert \nC. Byrd never ate his candy. Instead, he would present it to his \ngirlfriend Erma.\n  It worked. Those of us who know the two of them know that little \nexchange of friendship would lead to a lifetime of commitment. I am \nsure Robert C. Byrd had many fine qualities and Erma noticed those, but \nshe also apparently noticed the candy.\n  A true coal miner's daughter, Erma Byrd met Presidents and Senators, \nkings and queens, and the greatest among celebrities, yet. She never \nsought the limelight. She never lost her sturdy and sensible ways. She \nnever forgot the values that sustained her in West Virginia and \nthroughout all her life.\n  All of us in political life know that we make increasing demands on \nour\n\n[[Page S2400]]\n\nspouses. We know they have to make great sacrifices because of our \nchoice of public service. We all join in expressing our sadness at the \nloss of Erma Byrd, and we stand by our colleague Senator Byrd and his \nfamily to help them remember, at this time of loss, those good memories \nof times together. We know those memories will sustain their family.\n  Erma Byrd was the guiding star in her husband's firmament--the light \nthat sustained him, healed him, and comforted him. I know her \nremarkable spirit will continue to guide him not only through this day \nof mourning but throughout the rest of his life.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, we are about to begin this week a very \nsignificant discussion, debate, and, hopefully, passage of some \nlegislation to address what is one of the crucial public policy issues \nwe have as a country, which is the question of how we handle \nimmigration.\n  We are, obviously, a nation which has been built on immigrants. Every \none of us in this country, except for Native Americans, comes from a \nfamily that came from somewhere else and immigrated to this country. It \nis a part of our heritage of which we are most proud, the fact we have \nbeen able to assimilate cultures from around the world and bring them \nto the United States and create America. We should take pride in \nsomething that sets an example for the rest of the world to show that \npeople can gather and can live together and can be productive and can \nproduce a nation founded on democracy, freedom, liberty, individual \nrights, and heritage--heritage which has built a matrix of strength for \nus as a nation as we bring together peoples from different cultures and \nwe form an America.\n  E Pluribus Unum, the line above the Presiding Officer of the Senate, \nsays it so well: From many, one. We are, therefore, a nation which \nneeds to have an immigration policy which understands that, which, \nfirst and foremost, appreciates and continues to reward the idea that \nthere are people from around this world who wish to come to America to \nparticipate in this country and to make us a more productive place in \nwhich to raise their children and to assist us as a nation in being \nstronger economically, socially, and from a standpoint of inner \nstrength we obtain from having so many different people participate in \nour country. We always want to be that beacon, that light upon the hill \nthat draws the world to us. As long as people want to come to America, \nwe know we are doing something right, and we should take great pride in \nit.\n  We continue to be a place where people want to come and, as a result, \nwe do have issues of how we deal with immigration. But most \nimportantly, as we move down this road, we have to recognize it is \ncritical that we not do anything which tarnishes or chills or in any \nway undermines that great tradition of America, which is that we reach \nout our arms to people who wish to come here and be productive and \nparticipate in our way of life.\n  However, unfortunately, over the last few decades, and especially in \nan accelerated way as we moved through the nineties and moved into this \nfirst decade of 2000, we have seen that a large number of people are \ncoming into our Nation illegally. They are not following the course \nwhich is available to become an American citizen legally--to immigrate \nhere, to take advantage of our system, and to build on the \nopportunities that are here but to do it legally. That has become a \nproblem for us. It is a problem, obviously, from the standpoint that it \nviolates our laws. It is also a problem for us in the post-9/11 world \nwhere we need to know who is coming into this Nation because of the \nthreat of terrorist acts against us.\n  For the most part, these people who come to our country have come \nhere for purposes which are good and decent. They want to have a better \nlife. They want to be able to earn a better living. They want to be \nable to give their families more than they had in the nation they left. \nThat is a well-intentioned purpose. But they have still come here \nillegally, and we need to address the issue of how we deal with that \nsituation.\n  This question has been divided into basically two functions. First is \nhow we physically control the borders of our Nation and make sure those \nborders are reasonably secure so that we have a decent idea of who is \ncoming across those borders and why they are coming into our Nation.\n  The second question is how we deal with people who have come here to \nwork, to perform tasks which are available to them, people who may \nalready be here illegally, but people who still want to come here and \ndo it in a way that is within the law. And that, of course, involves \nthe debate over a guest worker program.\n  On the first issue, I have had a fair amount of interest and \ninvolvement because I chair the subcommittee that has jurisdiction over \nthis question, the Subcommittee on Homeland Security. The question of \nwhether our borders are secure is something which, since I have taken \nover as chairman of this subcommittee, has been all consuming over the \nlast 2 years I have had the good fortune of chairing this subcommittee \nof the Appropriations Committee. It is pretty obvious to any American \nthat our borders are not secure, that we do not know who is coming in. \nWe certainly don't know who is leaving. We don't know what is coming \nin, and we don't know, to a large degree, what is going out.\n  But on the issue of movement of people, we are attempting to address \nthat question. We have over the last 2 years significantly increased \nthe resources going into border security. We have increased the number \nof Border Patrol agents by almost 2,000. We have increased the number \nof beds which are available--what is known as detention beds--also by a \nsignificant number. We have increased resources flowing in to the \nborder security area, especially in the area of technology capability, \ntrying to set up a system called US-VISIT which will allow us to \neffectively track who is coming into our country on a real-time basis \nthrough using fingerprints and our databases on fingerprints. We have \nmade progress, but we are nowhere near solving the problem.\n\n  I wanted to talk briefly about that specific issue and then a little \nbit about the bigger issue of the guest worker program and how you \nbecome an American citizen.\n  As the Judiciary Committee wrestles with this problem of border \nsecurity, it is important that we do it the right way, that we think \nabout it in terms of what is going to get the best results versus what \nis going to get the best press releases.\n  To begin with, we do not need a wall across our southern border. We \ndon't need it from the standpoint of being able to know who is coming \nacross the border, we don't need it from the standpoint of being good \nneighbors, and we do not need it from the standpoint of presenting the \nnational culture. Doing that would be the exact opposite of what we \nshould do as a Nation.\n  There may be sections, clearly, where some sort of fencing or wall \nwill be necessary, sections where the commingling of the border is so \nclose that it is very difficult to control that section without some \nsort of a definable event which forces people who wish to come across \nthe border through a controlled point, but to run a wall the length of \nthe border as has been suggested by some of our colleagues, especially \nin the other body, is just anathema to the concept of what America \nstands for. We want to continue to be a society which says we are open, \nthat we are a place where people are encouraged to come, and that we \nare a place that reaches out to people who wish to be productive and \ncome here to be productive\n\n[[Page S2401]]\n\ncitizens. Furthermore, it would cost a huge amount of money, and it \nwould accomplish very little.\n  So much more could be accomplished through other means, such as the \naddition of a fairly significant but not dramatic increase in the \nnumber of border agents, if we went up to, say, 20,000--we are now at \nabout 13,000--and with the addition of a fairly significant but not a \ndramatic amount of new detention beds and some creative approach to \ndetention capability such as using former military bases and the \nfacilities that might be available through transient housing. Maybe we \ncould use some of those trailers we have sitting down there in Arkansas \nwhich are not being used. But through creative detention capability, we \ncould add the necessary additional beds, and there are not that many \nneeded compared to the overall numbers, with creative approaches using \ntechnology, of which we have an unlimited source of ingenuity in this \nNation. In fact, every day, it seems as if somebody comes to my office \nwith a new idea as to how to create a monitoring system or some form of \nmonitoring system through the use of unmanned vehicles, through the use \nof satellite technology, through the use of sensors, which would not \ncost that much. With the creative use of just adding physical capital \nassistance such as new cars, new helicopters, new planes for Customs, \nsuch as new capacity for the Coast Guard, we could, without a great \ndeal of incremental increase compared to the expending which we do in \nother parts of this government, effectively monitor and manage \ncertainly the southern border. As a result, we would know who was \ncoming into this country across that southern border, which is where \nmost of the illegal immigration occurs.\n  Would we solve the northern border issues? Probably not. That is a \nlittle different puzzle. The northern border does not have the huge \nillegal immigration issue, but it does have an equally severe, maybe \neven more severe opportunity for terrorists, people who wish to do us \nharm, to cross. There are other approaches which need to be taken \nthere. But as to the southern border, it is totally possible, \nreasonable, and should be done to manage that border effectively with \nthe addition of some significant resources, but not dramatic increases.\n  I suggested a year and a half ago that if we increased the capital \nresources available to the Border Patrol and the Customs Agencies by \nabout $1.2 billion, we could essentially buy out almost all the major \ncapital needs they need in order to manage the border--all the housing, \nall the airplanes, all the cars, all the unmanned vehicle monitors, all \nthe technology for detection capability we would need. That is a lot of \nmoney by New Hampshire standards, but in the context of a $1.8 trillion \nbudget, it is certainly a manageable sum. So far, that suggestion has \nbeen stiff-armed by the administration and basically limited as a \nresult of politics here on the floor of the Senate.\n  In addition to that capital need, which, as I mentioned, is about \n$1.2 billion, there is the need to add new agents, and there is the \nneed to increase our capability on the operational side. But again, the \ndollars necessary to do that are not dramatic, not dramatic at all--\nprobably in the range of $2 billion of additional funding per year. \nThat is a lot of money, again, by New Hampshire standards, but in the \ncontext of overall national defense where we are spending $440 billion \nplus $90 billion on the war on terrorism, for a total of over $500 \nbillion, an additional $2 billion to secure our southern borders in the \ncontext of personnel increases is not dramatic and is doable. The point \nis, it would accomplish our goal, which is to secure the southern \nborders.\n\n  I have asked for that to be done. Unfortunately, that has not been \ndone--well, that is incorrect. It was proposed by the administration to \nincrease the commitment of the number of Border Patrol agents. They \ngave that commitment in their budget submission, but they took it away \nbecause they tied it to creating a fee, which would increase the \nairline user fee, and the practical result of that would be the money \nwhich was supposed to be used to add these additional agents would \nnever be realized. But it should be done, it can be done, and if a fee \nis necessary to do it, it should be done on a fee basis, but a fee that \nhas no relationship to the actual usage.\n  An airline fee does not impact southern border protection. The \nairline fee impacts the TSA, and it needs support. It has gone through \n2 years of freeze and should be increased in our commitment there, and \nthis fee maybe should be used to do that. But if we are going to have a \nfee, it should be border related, if that is the way it is going to be \ndone. In any event, it should be done. We should spend those dollars to \naccomplish this.\n  The bill that is working its way through the Judiciary Committee has \na commitment to these types of efforts, but it is an authorizing bill. \nIt doesn't have to find the money. I have to find the money as an \nappropriator, and right now the money isn't there. So the ability to \naccomplish those good intentions isn't there.\n  Also, the bill that is coming through the authorizing committee \ncreates a number of mandates. It says: This shall be done by Border \nPatrol, this shall be done by Customs, this shall be done by the Coast \nGuard. I am not sure it addresses the Coast Guard, but it has a number \nof mandates for Border Patrol and Immigration, and the practical effect \nof that is that it is artificially directing and redirecting flows of \nrevenues and resources, and it may actually, as a result of those \nmandates, end up undermining our ability to effectively address the \nborder. As the bill comes to the floor, which I hope will be this week, \nwe can discuss that, and I am sure we can deal with those kinds of \nissues.\n  But the bottom line is simply this: We can accomplish security on the \nsouthern border. We can know to a large extent who is coming in and out \nof this country. We can limit dramatically--I mean dramatically; down \nto a trickle for all intents and purposes--the number of people who get \ninto this country illegally across our southern border by the \napplication of resources which, in the relative context of national \ndefense, are quite small and in the relative context of the overall \nnational budget are extraordinarily small. If we have to pay for them, \nwe should pay for them through some sort of a border security fee. It \ncan be done.\n  Why hasn't it been done? Because border security has been a stepchild \naround here to national defense for a long time. I find that \nunacceptable myself. If we are going to have a defense budget which \nspends $440 billion, up from $289 billion just 5 years ago, on top of \nwhich we are spending $90 billion a year to fight a war, one has to \nask: What is the core defense budget for? It is not to fight the war, \nobviously, because we have to spend the next exceptional amount of \nmoney on top of it to fight the war, so it is obviously for strategic \ndefense, for personnel, for operations, and it is needed, I guess, for \nthe most part. But if that is the need of critical priority, clearly \nprotecting our southern border is an equal need of national defense. \nMaybe we should roll the border security effort into the Defense \nDepartment and then we would get the resources for it, although I think \nthat would be a bad policy decision, but at least we would get \nresources.\n  In any event, in the context of what is important from the standpoint \nof national security, I can't think of anything--well, there are a lot \nof things. I think it has to rank right up there at the top, knowing \nwho is coming in and out of this country, when it is our country that \nis at risk. We know these people want to attack us on our soil, so it \nis absolutely critical that we have the necessary resources to protect \nour borders, to know who is coming in and out of our country so we can \nprotect ourselves from people who might cause us harm.\n  It is also critical that, as a culture, we control this. We cannot \nsurvive as a culture if we have a massive amount of people coming into \nthis country illegally. It just doesn't work. People who want to come \nto this country--and we do want to maintain a very open approach to \nencourage people to come into this country--have to know that if they \nfollow the rules and if they come here legally, they are going to be \nable to get in line under the rules and legally and get a shot at \nAmerican citizenship and participating in the American dream.\n  So it is critical that we get our southern border under control, and \nit is\n\n[[Page S2402]]\n\ncritical that we get our northern border under control. It is critical, \nwe can do it, and we should do it. We should have done it long ago, and \nwe can do it now, and we should make that commitment to those types of \nresources. As this bill moves forward, I intend to make those points \nand try to get people to look at this in the context of a doable event \nrather than in the context of simply a press release event.\n  Secondly, on the issue of immigration itself, it is also obvious that \nwe have to have a workable guest worker program. We have to have \nsomething that says to people: If you want to come here and work and \nbetter your family, there is a way we can work that out. We can make \nthat happen. That takes the pressure off of illegal immigration.\n  As we secure the border, it is clear that some sort of effective \nguest worker program is necessary. As part of that overall immigration \neffort, there is one little slice, though, which I believe we need to \naddress. It is a small slice.\n  Today there is a lottery program where you can essentially send in \nyour name and you are put into a lottery, and you have to be from a \ncountry which is deemed underprivileged, I believe; there is some sort \nof categorization. But if your name is pulled out of a hat, you can get \non the path to American citizenship. Fifty thousand names are pulled \nout of the hat every year, just as a lottery.\n  At one time, this may have made sense, but it doesn't make sense \ntoday. It is very obvious today that just pulling people's names out of \nhats to put them on the path to citizenship in America is not fair to \nthose people who are waiting in line and who have a reason and who have \nfollowed the process and have a purpose, and it is not fair to our \nNation. How do we know we want somebody whose name is drawn out of a \nhat to be an American citizen? What benefit is that to us, other than \nthat the person happened to be lucky?\n  Thus, if we are going to keep this lottery program, I believe we \nshould change it over to a lottery program which essentially says: If \nyou want to participate in this lottery, you have to have some unique \ntalents or skills which America needs, such as a master's degree or a \ndoctorate in some sort of science or mathematical capability or maybe \nsome foreign language capability, something that America has a use for. \nSo I think we should convert this lottery to that type of an approach.\n  I note that my time is about to expire and that we have both \nassistant leaders on the Senate floor, so something big must be \nhappening. Therefore, I will continue this discussion as we move \nforward on the debate of immigration. But I do believe it is critical \nto understand that resolving the border issue is a very doable event. \nThere is no complication to this, it is not subtle. It is simply a \nquestion of resources, and we can accomplish it with the right amount \nof resources placed in the right place. We don't need new laws to do \nit.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/03/27/senate-section/article/S2402-1", "month": "03", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2402-S2403]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           IMMIGRATION REFORM\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I wish to comment very briefly, because I \nnotice Senator McConnell is on the floor, about the pending immigration \nbill now before the Senate Judiciary Committee. It is an interesting \nstory, as we watch the news reports, of the people who are gathering \nacross the United States. Over 110,000, some say close to 200,000, came \nout in Chicago a few days ago; 500,000 in the city of Los Angeles. \nThere is hardly a major city in America where people have not stepped \nforward because of their concern about this immigration bill.\n  Who are these people? They are people we always see but seldom come \nto know. They are our neighbors. They sit next to us in church; they \nsend their kids to the same school as our kids. They probably cooked \nyour breakfast this morning. They probably washed your dishes and \ncleaned your hotel room. They are watching your children at daycare and \nthey are changing your aging mother's soiled bed in the nursing home. \nThey make sure your putting green is perfect, and they stand for hours \nevery day in a damp and cold place, watching a production line of \nchicken carcasses come by, so you can invite friends for a barbecue \nthis weekend.\n  They often live in crowded homes. They deny themselves many things. \nThey sacrifice for their children and in the hopes that, at the end of \nthe week, they might be able to send a small check home to their \nfamilies in other countries.\n  Their children are in our military--thousands of them, wearing the \nuniform of the United States of America. Some have been killed serving \nour country. At their funerals, people in uniform come forward and \npresent to the grieving parents a flag as a token of their heroism and \nbravery and their commitment to America.\n  Now from this Republican-controlled House of Representatives, we \nlearn the way to treat these people is to declare them criminals--\ncriminals. These 11 million undocumented people, according to the \nSensenbrenner bill which passed the U.S. House of Representatives, \nwould be branded and prosecuted as aggravated felons, treated the same \nas armed robbers and rapists--11 million people. That is the bill that \ncame over.\n  This same Sensenbrenner bill doesn't stop there. It makes criminals \nof those who offer help. In the city of Chicago is a domestic violence \ncenter, Las Mujeres En Accion. I know it because I have been going \nthere for years. It is in a place called Little Village. The people in \nLittle Village are Mexican. Some are citizens and some not. Las Mujeres \nis there for battered women. Women who have been beaten unmercifully by \ntheir husbands bring their small children to Las Mujeres for safety, \nfor shelter. They are allowed to stay there while the police are out \ntrying to find drunk and abusive husbands and put them in jail.\n  Under the Sensenbrenner bill which passed in the Republican House of \nRepresentatives, all of the volunteers at that center and all of the \nstaff at that center could be prosecuted as aggravated felons. Why? \nBecause the people they are sheltering, many of them, are not \ndocumented citizens in the United States.\n  That is the sad reality of the bill that came over from the House of \nRepresentatives. These immigrants are people in America without legal \nstatus. Some, indeed, crossed the border in darkness. Some entered \nlegally and stayed on beyond the time given them. Some had their \npaperwork lost in this mindless bureaucracy of immigration laws. Some \ncame, fell in love, married, and over time they became the only ones in \ntheir family who were not American citizens. They are Mexican, they are \nPolish, they are Irish--they are from many nations. Their ranks have \ngrown to almost 11 million.\n  Most polls tell us the American people don't want to give them all \namnesty, to automatically make them citizens, and no one is suggesting \nthat. But we also realize that deporting all of them, as some have \ncalled for, is as unrealistic as well. Even if it were wise--and it is \nnot--it would be prohibitively expensive.\n  America has two great traditions. We are a nation of immigrants and \nwe are a nation intolerant of immigrants.\n  How can that be? Many of us have seen examples in our lives. Just a \nfloor away, in my office, is a little framed certificate I value very \nmuch. It is my mother's naturalization certificate. She came to the \nUnited States in 1911 and some 20 years later became a naturalized \ncitizen. Her son is now the 47th Senator from the State of Illinois. It \nis a classic immigrant story of hard work and sacrifice so your \nchildren can do better. It is a story that has been repeated millions \nof times by immigrant families who came here at great risk, with great \ncourage, and gave this country something special. The people who came \nto our shores had the courage to step up one day and say: I am leaving \nmy village. I am leaving my children. I am leaving my family, my \nculture, my language, my history. I am going to a place I have never \nbeen where they speak a language I cannot speak in the hope that I will \nhave a better life.\n  Think of that courage. They bring it to our shores by the thousands, \nand change America into this vibrant, growing, diverse Nation we value \nso much.\n  Just a few blocks away from where I am speaking, in the Dirksen \nSenate Office Building, the Senate Judiciary Committee is trying to \ndecide what to\n\n[[Page S2403]]\n\ndo next. We are agreed on several things. We need better enforcement. \nAmerica cannot absorb every person who wants to live here. We need \nbetter border security, and those amendments passed this morning \noverwhelmingly on a bipartisan basis. We need to work with employers to \nmake sure they are following the law in the people that they hire. We \nare considering now an amendment, a bipartisan amendment, so \nagricultural workers can come here to harvest the fruit and vegetables \nthat are an important part of our lives and our economy and not be \narrested for doing it--giving them a chance. We are also going to \naddress, before this day is over, whether we will make criminals of all \nof the people who are here.\n  I certainly hope those who are following this debate understand that \nif the 11 million undocumented are to come out of the shadows and be \npart of America, they won't do it with the threat of going to jail or \nbeing deported. What we need to do is establish a sensible, tough, but \nfair process so that those who have come, who work hard, pay taxes, \nraise their families, obey the law, learn English, and want to be part \nof America have a chance. They can be given a chance over a longer \nperiod of time than those who go through the regular legal process. \nThat is only fair. They should not be able to jump in front of others \nin line. But ultimately if we give them a path to legalization, a path \nto dignity, we will be a better nation for it.\n  They want to be part of America and its future. They left their home \ncountries, as many of our parents and grandparents did, to come to this \ngreat Nation. We see it in the hundreds of thousands who have come out \nin the streets of major cities, as they stand and say in Spanish: Si, \nse puede--yes, we can. They chant, as they do in Chicago: USA, USA--\nthat they love this country as much as almost any other citizen. Giving \nthem a chance to become an important part of America's future will make \nus an even stronger country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

So says Sergeant Hughes's wife, Sara \nHughes, on her husband's time in the Kentucky Army National Guard. She \ncontinues, ``He will never have to re-enlist or extend his contract, \nfor it has been extended forever.''\n  On March 19, 2005, Sergeant Hughes and three other Kentucky Guard \nsoldiers were traveling south in a Humvee, escorting a 30-truck convoy \nto Camp Liberty, the loading and unloading zone for supply trucks near \nthe Baghdad International Airport.\n  Suddenly, at a point about 30 miles from Camp Liberty, an explosive \ndevice hidden in a car detonated. The other soldiers in the Humvee were \ninjured; Sergeant Hughes, of Lebanon, KY, was killed. He had served his \nNation as a citizen-soldier for almost 4 years. He was 21 years old.\n  For his valorous service, Sergeant Hughes was awarded the Bronze Star \nMedal, the Purple Heart and the Combat Action Badge. He had previously \nreceived the Army Good Conduct Medal, and he was awarded the Kentucky \nDistinguished Service Medal, for demonstrating all the qualities of a \ngreat soldier, remaining combat-focused while decisively engaged with \nthe enemy, performing his duties and accomplishing his mission.\n  Adam, as his family and friends called him, was inspired to enlist in \nthe Kentucky National Guard after his time in Junior ROTC at Marion \nCounty High School, where he graduated in 2002. After Sergeant Hughes's \ndeath, the flag outside Marion County High flew at half-staff in his \nhonor and memory.\n  SFC Twymon Ray, Jr., also from Lebanon, KY, served with Sergeant \nHughes and reports that one couldn't have asked to work alongside a \nfiner soldier. Sergeant Hughes excelled at whatever task was put before \nhim. When given an order, he would often reply with the rejoinder, \n``Gotcha, boss, gotcha covered.''\n  On March 18, 2005, the day before the fatal attack, Sergeant Hughes \nand his unit were leading a convoy when they came upon another convoy, \nheaded in the opposite direction, that was under attack. Being in the \nlead Humvee, Sergeant Hughes's team moved forward to engage the \nterrorists, a group of three or four cars with gunmen in their trunks.\n  As the terrorist drivers weaved between the tractor-trailers, the \ngunmen would open the trunks and fire at the truck drivers. Sergeant \nHughes, who had volunteered to serve as his unit's gunner that day, \nengaged two of the cars, immediately drawing fire from both sides of \nthe road.\n  SGT Brian Mattingly, Sergeant Hughes's team leader, recalls hearing \nshots ``ping'' off the armor of the Humvee he and Adam were in. The \nteam was able to rescue two Iraqi-national truck drivers who had been \ntargeted by these malicious killers. Sergeant Hughes was successful in \nchasing the enemy off and allowing both convoys to continue on their \nway without further attack.\n  During his downtime in Iraq at Camp Anaconda, Adam built a desk and \nbook shelf from plywood the squad had acquired to hold his treasured \npictures of his wife, Sara, and their young son, Peyton. Adam was also \na cook. He asked his mother and grandmother to send him a frying pan, \nand he would fry up potatoes after a unit run to Baghdad to pick up \nfood and other supplies.\n  Adam Hughes also used his downtime in Iraq to work on his Humvee or \nplay video games. He grew up as an avid outdoorsman, and especially \nenjoyed hunting and fishing.\n  Sergeant Hughes was laid to rest last year in Holy Name of Mary \nCemetery, outside Lebanon, KY. I was honored to be one of the many who \nwent to pay my respects that day to a courageous American hero. A lot \nof people love and miss Adam Hughes, and they will remember his \nbravery, his can-do optimism, and his sacrifice.\n  CPT Lawrence Joiner, commander of Sergeant Hughes's company, \nremembered Adam for his quiet and shy disposition, saying, ``Words \ncannot express our love and brotherhood. . . . He will forever be a \npart of our lives.''\n  Adam was blessed to have a loving family and many friends. His wife \nSara is present today, and we thank her for sharing her memories of her \nhusband with us. I also commend Mrs. Hughes for her tremendous \ncompassion for the families of other Kentucky Guard soldiers who have \nfallen in service of our country, which she has shown by attending \nfunerals and helping other soldiers' families cope with their loss.\n  Mrs. Hughes has brought her son, Peyton, who is almost 2 years old, \nto the Capitol today to honor his father.

The Hughes family is lucky \nto have such friends during this difficult time.\n  Adam also leaves behind a loving family: his mother, Karen Hill; his \nfather, John Hughes; and his two sisters, Nikki Hill and Claire Hughes.\n  ``There are no great words in a time of deep tragedy.

Mr. President, I returned on Saturday evening from a trip \nto Pakistan, Afghanistan, Iraq, Turkey, and England. The trip was led \nby a very dear friend of mine and a great leader of this Senate who \nhappens to be the Presiding Officer at the moment, Senator Warner of \nVirginia, and it included Senator Sessions, Senator Thomas, Senator \nBingaman, Senator Salazar, in addition to myself.\n  I know if the Presiding Officer was allowed to speak in the position \nin which he sits that he would be the first to acknowledge that this \nwas one of the most extraordinary trips either one of us has ever taken \nin the 28 years we have served together in the U.S. Senate.\n  The focus of the trip was to assess the situation in Afghanistan and \nIraq. We also conveyed to the men and women of our Armed Forces the \nextraordinary support for them in the Congress and throughout the \nNation, regardless of our debates and differences over Iraq policy.\n  In meeting with our troops, including many from my home State of \nMichigan, it was they who lifted our spirits. As always, I came away \ndeeply impressed by the professionalism, dedication, and high morale of \nour troops. They are truly America's finest.\n  The situation in Afghanistan is hopeful. President Karzai has led his \nnation with a firm and steady hand. He has successfully, albeit \ngradually, neutralized the warlords and demobilized and disarmed their \nforces. The Taliban has indeed regrouped to some extent and, together \nwith a much weakened al-Qaida, are capable of causing casualties among \nthe Afghan Army and coalition and NATO forces, but they are not a \nthreat to the Afghan nation.\n\n  Meanwhile, the Afghan Army is growing stronger, the training of the \nAfghan police is improving, a large number of provincial reconstruction \nteams are helping with local governance, and NATO is assuming more of \nthe burden of providing security throughout the country. Serious work \ndoes remain, including the need to deal with poppy cultivation and the \ndrug traffickers. But overall the situation in Afghanistan provides \ngrounds for optimism.\n  Sadly, the same cannot be said of Iraq. The situation in Iraq is \ndeeply troubling and threatens to grow worse. Since the recent attack \non the Golden Mosque in Samarra, there has been a huge increase in \nsectarian violence. The increase is so significant that our senior \nmilitary leaders in Iraq say it has replaced the insurgent attacks on \nIraqi and coalition forces as the No. 1 security problem there.\n  Although there has been some progress in training the Iraqi Army, \neven a stronger Iraqi Army cannot prevent a civil war. Only the \npolitical and religious leaders and the police can do that. The police \nare not making significant progress in coming together as a cohesive \nforce. In some critical areas, including Baghdad, where the militias \ncontinue to dominate, the police are not reliable and are still likely \nto respond to the sectarian calls of the clerics and the militias \ninstead of the government.\n  Do we need to succeed in Iraq now that we are there? Yes, because the \noutcome there will have a major effect on the region and on our own \nsecurity. I define success as a stable Iraq with a government of \nnational unity supported by a reliable national army and police who are \nnot weakened by sectarian fissures.\n  To achieve that success, General Casey, the Commander of U.S. and \ncoalition forces in Iraq, reiterated to us that there is no military \nsolution to the violence without a political solution.\n  We need to do everything we can to help the Iraqis achieve a prompt \npolitical solution, which means the quick formation of a government of \nnational unity involving representatives of the three main Iraqi \nfactions. It also means a highly sectarian individual would not be \nheading up the Ministry of Defense or the Ministry of the Interior. The \nalternative to a prompt formation of a government of national unity by \nIraqi leaders is a continuation of this drift to all-out civil war.\n  In Baghdad we met with Prime Minister Jaafari, who was nominated by \nthe dominant Shiite faction--the United Iraqi Alliance--as their \ncandidate for Prime Minister in the new government. Although he was \nconfident that a national unity government would be formulated by the \nend of April, his optimism was not widely shared by others we met. \nMoreover, his one-vote victory for the nomination to continue on as \nPrime Minister is being contested from both within and without the \nShiite coalition. I shared with him the letter to President Bush that \nSenators Collins, Jack Reed, and I had written, the bottom line of \nwhich is that:\n       A prompt political settlement is not only essential to the \n     Iraqis, it is a condition of our continued presence.\n\n  I told him his ``end of April'' commitment to President Jaafari, in \nmy judgment, met that test of a prompt political settlement.\n  We also met with leaders from the two main Sunni Arab parties: Mr. \nHashimi and Mr. Samarai of the Iraqi Islamic Party, and Mr. Mutlak of \nthe Iraqi Dialogue Council. They were not optimistic about the \nnegotiations and forcefully advocated a decisional role rather than a \nfacilitating role for the United States in the negotiations. Mr. Mutlak \nargued:\n\n       You are responsible for this mess and you must correct what \n     you have done. You have to dictate the result.\n\n  The Sunni leaders were also of the view that Iraq has been in the \nmidst of a civil war between the militias and the innocent Iraqis for \nsome time, and they voiced their concern about Iranian influence over \nthe Shiite parties. I told them, and I know the other members of our \ncodel, of our delegation told them as bluntly as we know how that their \ndictator was removed at a great loss of American blood and treasure and \nthat the Iraqis and only the Iraqis will decide their own fate, and \nthat our continued presence should depend on their promptly choosing a \npath of reconciliation and unity against violence and terror.\n  On our second day in Iraq we met with the U.S. Ambassador to Iraq, \nZalmay Khalilzad. One constant theme we found in Iraq and elsewhere in \nthe region was the high regard with which all hold our Ambassador, Mr. \nKhalilzad. Unfortunately, although the parties are finally talking, \nmore than 3 months after the elections, Ambassador Khalilzad was not \nencouraging that a political solution is in sight. He is putting modest \npressure on the Iraqis. For instance, he told the Iraqis our response \nto continued deadlock of Iraq's political leaders might not be to their \nliking. He has told the Iraqi political leaders: It is your decision, \nand after you make it, we will make our own decision in response.\n\n  Although his statement is on the right track, it is still too subtle. \nIt is too oblique. The political leaders of Iraq are deadlocked, \nfeuding while Iraq descends toward all-out civil war. There is little \nchance of achieving a government of national unity without our \npointedly and forcefully persuading the parties to make the compromises \nnecessary to achieve it.\n  But what is the leverage that could be used to pointedly persuade the \nIraqi leaders to make those needed compromises? We can't dictate to \nthem\n\n[[Page S2405]]\n\nwho should be their leaders. That would undermine the President's \nbelatedly arrived at explanation for his decision to attack Iraq, which \nis replacing a brutal dictator with a democracy. Yes, there should be a \nneed to apply pressure. The prospect of sectarian clashes and the \nspecter of civil war should be sufficient incentives on their own to \nend the deadlock. But, so far, they don't appear to be.\n  To help break the political gridlock, a combination of carrots and \nsticks is required. The carrot is the provision of economic development \nfunds, particularly from neighboring wealthy countries, on the \ncondition that a national unity government is created and produces a \ncoherent economic plan. The biggest stick is clearly telling the Iraqis \nthat our continued presence in Iraq is dependent upon their promptly \nputting together a government of national unity.\n  Sadly, the rhetoric of the President and the administration has often \nworked against the pressure which needs to be applied against the Iraqi \nleaders.\n  The President recently asked the American people, for instance, for \ntheir patience. I believe instead he should be telling the Iraqi \nleaders bluntly and openly that the American people are understandably \ndownright impatient with Iraqi leaders fiddling while Baghdad is \nburning.\n  The Secretary of State has said we are in Iraq as long as needed. I \nbelieve she should be telling the Iraqi leaders that our continued \npresence is dependent upon their doing what only they can do: reach an \nagreement on a government of national unity. That political settlement \nis not only the best hope, it is the only hope of ending the insurgency \nand the sectarian strife. The pressure to reach an agreement on a \ngovernment of national unity needs to be applied clearly and \nforcefully, pointedly and publicly, not just by President Bush but also \nby the leaders of Iraq's neighbors.\n  In our meeting with the Prime Minister of Turkey, Mr. Erdogan, we \nurged him to do just that, and he said he would. The leaders of all of \nIraq's neighboring countries need to do the same because an unstable \nand civil war-torn Iraq threatens them even more than us.\n  Is there a risk in this course of forcefully pressing Iraqi leaders \nto agree on a national unity government? Is there a risk in following \nthat course? The answer is yes. But there is a greater risk in \ncontinuing on the current course of political gridlock while sectarian \nfires threaten to burn out of control.\n  The President needs to act based on the reality that we confront in \nIraq. He recently said if there were a premature departure of American \ntroops that ``Iraq would become a place of instability.''\n  Would become? Iraq is a place of grave instability, and to use the \nwords of Ambassador Khalilzad in an interview he gave with a London \nnewspaper: ``Iraq is moving towards civil war.''\n  My conclusion is this: President Bush needs to forcefully transmit a \nmessage to the Iraqis in plain and simple language: your survival as a \nnation depends on your working things out together. Your survival as a \nnation is in the hands of your political leaders, not our military. \nAlong with Senator Collins and Senator Jack Reed, as I indicated, we \nwrote the President on March 10, 2006, and ended with the following \nthoughts:\n\n       We urge you to make it clear to the Iraqis how important it \n     is to us that they achieve a political settlement, form a \n     unity government, and make the necessary amendments to their \n     Constitution. We believe it is essential that the Iraqi \n     leaders understand that our continued presence is not \n     unconditional, and that whether they avoid all-out civil war \n     and have a future as a Nation is in their hands. If they \n     don't seize that opportunity, we can't protect them or save \n     them from themselves.\n\n  We ended:\n\n       The bottom line is this: The United States needs to make it \n     clear to Iraqi leaders that a prompt political settlement is \n     not only essential to them, it is a condition of our \n     continued presence.\n\n  We all want to succeed in Iraq, regardless of the positions we took \ngoing in. Whether we favored or opposed our intervention, and whether \nwe are critics or supporters of the administration's policies since \nthen, we all want to succeed. We all want to try to leave Iraq in \nbetter condition, obviously, than we found it. But to maximize the \nchances of success, we need to maximize pressure on the leaders of Iraq \nto end their political deadlock. The insurgents and outside terrorists \nare not going to be defeated and civil war is not going to be averted \nif Iraqi leaders are at war with themselves. They should know that if \nthey squander the chance to bring political unity to Iraq, we cannot \nand will not protect them from their own folly.\n  Let me close by thanking our Presiding Officer for leading, again, \none of the most extraordinary visits to a foreign country that I have \never participated in. His leadership was essential to making the visits \nthat we were able to make and for all of us to come back with greater \ninformation and with thoughts about where the future lies.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent at this time that the letter \nthat I referred to from the three Senators be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                                  Committee on Armed Services,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 10, 2006.\n     The President,\n     The White House,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: There is a consensus among our senior \n     military commanders that a political settlement involving the \n     three main Iraqi groups is essential for defeating the \n     insurgency and that the Iraqis need to agree on a government \n     of national unity and make significant compromises to amend \n     their Constitution to achieve such a political settlement. A \n     political settlement is also essential to prevent all-out \n     civil war and is a critical element of our exit strategy for \n     our troops.\n       In the midst of the spiral of violence, it is clear to us \n     that we must act to change the current dynamic in Iraq and \n     that the only thing that can produce that change is a \n     political settlement that is accepted by all the major \n     groups.\n       But an Iraqi political settlement won't happen without \n     pressure from the United States. We can't make them form a \n     unity government, we can't decide who fills what positions in \n     that government, and we can't write the amendments to their \n     Constitution for them.\n       By a 79-19 vote last year, the Senate said that:\n       ``The Administration should tell the leaders of all groups \n     and political parties in Iraq that they need to make the \n     compromises necessary to achieve the broad-based and \n     sustainable political settlement that is essential for \n     defeating the insurgency in Iraq, within the timetable they \n     set for themselves.''\n       We urge you to make it clear to the Iraqis how important it \n     is to us that they achieve a political settlement, form a \n     unity government, and make the necessary amendments to their \n     Constitution. We believe it is essential that the Iraqi \n     leaders understand that our continued presence is not \n     unconditional, and that whether they avoid all-out civil war \n     and have a future as a nation is in their hands. If they \n     don't seize that opportunity, we can't protect them or save \n     them from themselves.\n       The bottom line is this: The U.S. needs to make it clear to \n     Iraqi leaders that a prompt political settlement is not only \n     essential to them, it is a condition of our continued \n     presence.\n           Sincerely,\n     Carl Levin.\n     Susan M. Collins.\n     Jack Reed.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank the Chair again for his leadership, not only on \nthis one trip but for his leadership in the Senate on so many matters \nof national security, including the ongoing effort that all of us are \nparticipating in to find a positive outcome in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burr). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak in \nmorning business for 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, this coming month it will be 2 years since \nthe body of a young woman named Dru Sjodin was found in Crookston, MN.\n\n[[Page S2406]]\n\nDru Sjodin was a young woman, a college student at the University of \nNorth Dakota, who walked out of a North Dakota shopping center at about \n5 o'clock in the afternoon. She was abducted, a search was made for \nher, and some months later her body was found near Crookston, MN. She \nhad been brutally murdered.\n  I have visited with her parents a number of times. The more I have \ncome to know the details of her abduction and her murder--and since \nthat time I have come to know the details of other abductions and \nmurders, in many cases of young children in our country--it is clear \nthat Congress needs to take some action to deal with some of these \nissues.\n  What happened to Dru Sjodin was a vicious, almost unspeakable crime \nfor which a man will soon be tried for murder.\n  The man who has been arrested and will be on trial shortly for the \nmurder of Dru Sjodin is Alfonso Rodriguez, Jr. He has served prison \ntime for rape. He was sentenced to 23 years in prison for a violent \nrape. At the end of his sentence, he was deemed by prison officials--\nincluding psychiatrists and psychologists--to be at high risk of \nreoffending.\n  Despite that, he was let out of prison with little or no supervision. \nThe State's attorney in the jurisdiction where he was prosecuted was \nnot notified of his pending release. He was released without any \nsignificant supervision. And within 6 months--it is alleged--he \nmurdered Dru Sjodin.\n  I have proposed a piece of legislation called Dru's Law, and gotten \nit passed by the Senate twice. It still has not passed the House. Dru's \nLaw is title II in a comprehensive piece of legislation reported out \nOctober of last year by the Senate Judiciary Committee, yet that bill \nhas also not been brought to the floor of the Senate.\n  Let me describe the legislation I put together because I was \nastounded when I took a look at Federal and State laws that so little \ninformation is available about those who have committed violent sexual \noffenses.\n  First of all, there has not been a national database of convicted sex \noffenders. A year ago, I met with the Attorney General and talked to \nhim about Dru's Law. When the Attorney General took office he began the \ndevelopment of a national database, administratively. We need to do \nthat in law. And provisions of Dru's Law would require the development \nof a national database of sex offenders that is accessible to the \npublic. So the bill requires the development of a national database of \nsex offenders accessible to the public.\n\n  Second, it requires States to notify prosecutors of impending release \nof high-risk sex offenders. When we have sex offenders who have \ncommitted violent acts, there is a substantial amount of information \ndemonstrating it is very likely, upon release, they will recommit those \nviolent acts. When seen by psychiatrists and psychologists and \nevaluated for high-risk activities upon their release, it seems to me \nwhen those high-risk offenders are about to be released from prison, \ntheir names should be given to the local State's attorney where they \nwere prosecuted so the State's attorney would have the time and \ncapability to determine whether they wanted to seek civil commitment, \nwhich is to say further incarceration to protect the public. That is a \nprocedure that many States have allowed.\n  In this case, the alleged murder by Alfonso Rodriguez, who the \nexperts alleged would be at great risk for reoffending, if he had been \ncivilly committed, he would not have been on the streets.\n  What is happening too often now, violent sex offenders are let out of \nprison at the end of the term without so much as a wave, ``so long, \ngood luck.'' That is not what should happen, and this brings me to the \nthird piece of the bill. If, in fact, a high-risk sex offender is \nreleased from prison, there must be monitoring by the States upon their \nrelease for at least 1 year.\n  Martha Stewart is put in prison and let out of prison and she wears \nan ankle bracelet. Martha Stewart is wearing an ankle bracelet, and \nhigh-risk sex offenders are let out of prison with a wave, ``so long, \nsee you later.'' Then they abduct and murder children. It is not just \nDru Sjodin. I can go through an entire list of young people who have \nbeen abducted and murdered by people we knew about, people whose names \nwe had, people who had been serving time in prison but were let out \nwith a wave, to say, ``so long, see you later.''\n  Now, I mentioned that Dru's Law, which has the three provisions I \ndescribed, has twice been passed by the Senate by unanimous consent. \nBut the House has not taken it up and as a result it is not now law.\n  I have not stopped trying to get Dru's Law passed. In fact, Dru's Law \nhas now been incorporated into S. 1086, the Sex Offender Registration \nand Notification Act, has been authored by Senators Hatch and Biden, \nboth former chairmen of the Senate Judiciary Committee. It is \nlegislation I fully support. It is terrific legislation. I commend both \nof them for doing a great job.\n  Title II of that legislation incorporates all of Dru's Law. That \nlegislation is cosponsored also by Senator Specter, who is the current \nchairman of the Judiciary Committee. And I'm happy to say that S. 1086 \npassed out of the Judiciary Committee in October of last year.\n  Yet S. 1086 has not been considered by the full Senate. I don't \nunderstand that. The majority leader has told us what we are going to \nconsider. We are going to consider constitutional amendments on gay \nmarriage, constitutional amendments on flag desecration. The list goes \non and on and on, but we do not have time to consider this? This is \nimportant. This is life or death in many instances.\n  We have had time for a free trade agreement with the country of \nBahrain. Boy, that is a priority. What would have happened if we had \nnot had a trade agreement with Bahrain? We passed the Delaware Water \nGap National Recreation Area Improvement Act. We did the Benjamin \nFranklin National Memorial Commemoration Act. We have done a lot of \nthings here, but we did not have time to bring up S. 1086, the Sex \nOffender Registration and Notification Act? I don't understand that.\n  There is a recent study that found 72 percent of the highest risk \nsexual offenders reoffend within 6 years of being released from prison. \nThe Bureau of Justice Statistics has determined that sex offenders \nreleased from prison are over 10 times more likely to be arrested for a \nsexual crime than individuals who have no record of a sexual assault.\n  This legislation is endorsed by a good many people. Dru's Law has 18 \ncosponsors in the Senate. Senators Hatch and Leahy have worked closely \nwith me to pass Dru's Law separately, as a standalone bill.\n  Mark Lunsford, the father of 9-year-old Jessica Lunsford, is a strong \nsupporter of this. Jessica Lunsford, this country might remember, was \nabducted a year or so ago from her bedroom in her Florida home. Her \nbody was found a month later. The crime was committed by a 46-year-old \nconvicted sex offender with a 30-year criminal history. After \ncommitting the assault of Jessica and the murder of Jessica, John \nCouey, the man who committed this crime, fled across State lines to \nSavannah, GA. Had he not been recaptured, he very likely would have \nreoffended in Georgia, as well.\n  Mr. Lunsford wrote me a letter about Dru's death:\n\n       If my daughter's death is going to have any meaning, it \n     will be efforts such as yours that strengthen existing laws \n     by making our streets safer for all children. My heart \n     continues to break as I mourn the loss of my beautiful little \n     girl. I do not want other families to suffer as mine has done \n     and I believe that your effort will go far toward that \n     important goal.\n\n  This bill is endorsed by Marc Klaas, the father of 12-year-old Polly \nKlaas, who was kidnaped and murdered by a previously diagnosed sex \noffender. Mr. Klaas wrote:\n\n       I would like to reiterate my full support of this important \n     effort.\n\n  It does not take the recitation of 100 cases, but let me mention \nSarah Michelle Lunde, 13 years old. She disappeared and was found dead. \nDavid Onstott, a convicted sex offender, who once had a relationship \nwith the girl's mother, has confessed to killing her.\n  Jetseta Gage of Cedar Rapids, IA, was abducted, sexually assaulted, \nand murdered. Roger Paul Bentley was arrested for that crime, a \nconvicted sex offender on Iowa's sex registry.\n\n[[Page S2407]]\n\n  The list goes on and on and on and on. I held a meeting in Fargo, ND, \nabout a year ago to describe how important it is to track sex \noffenders' movements across State lines. I held a town meeting in \nFargo, ND, to talk about the issue of violent sex offenders. This was \nan outgrowth of the information I had developed as a result of Dru \nSjodin's murder.\n  Before that meeting in Fargo, I checked the registry in North Dakota \nto find out the names of convicted sex offenders living within walking \ndistance of the place I was going to have a meeting.\n  One name kind of jumped out to me and I described the case to the \npeople at the meeting: Joseph E. Duncan. I did not know him, I had \nnever previously heard of him. But in 1980 when Joseph Duncan was a 16 \nyear old, he abducted a 14-year-old boy who had been walking in his \nneighborhood, sexually assaulted the boy twice at gunpoint, pled guilty \nto rape in the first degree, and was sentenced to 20 years in prison. \nHe was released from prison July 14, 2000, after completing a 20-year \nsentence. Because he completed his full term, he was released without \nparole and without probation. He went to live in North Dakota within \nwalking distance of city hall in Fargo.\n  So I mentioned to the people in Fargo about five cases of people who \nwere convicted sex offenders who lived within walking distance of city \nhall, just to describe the people who were living in our midst. What I \ndidn't know when I mentioned it that day in Fargo was that 1 month \nearlier, Joseph E. Duncan had been charged with molesting a 6-year-old \nboy at a playground just across the river in Detroit Lakes, MN. He \nappeared in court on April 5, 2005. A county judge set the bail at \n$15,000 and Duncan was released after paying the cash. A friend \napparently posted the cash for him.\n  The next I heard of this man was July 2. He was arrested in Idaho for \nkidnaping 8-year-old Shasta Groene and her 9-year-old brother Dylan \nGroene. The children had been missing since May 16 when the bound and \nbludgeoned bodies of their mother, older brother, and mother's \nboyfriend were found at their rural home. This case is another tragic \nreminder of the urgent need. Duncan has now been charged with abducting \nand molesting this young girl, three counts of first-degree murder.\n  These predators, in many cases, are not strangers. We know who they \nare. They have been in prison. They have violently molested, violently \nsexually assaulted other people. I am not necessarily suggesting we put \nthem in prison and throw away the key, but I am saying when we know \nsomeone is a violent sexual predator and they are about to be released \nfrom prison and the psychiatrists tell us they are at high risk for \nreoffending and recommitting another violent sexual act, then it seems \nto me the local people ought to be notified to determine whether the \nState's attorney wishes to recommit them for a civil commitment to \nprotect society at large. And, second, if that person is released, it \ncannot any longer be ``so long and good luck,'' with nothing much more \nthan a wave. We cannot do that. There must be a high level of \nmonitoring.\n  Kids are dying. People are being murdered. We have not had a national \nregistry of sex offenders that is complete and that works. We let \npeople out of prison who we know are going to offend again, or at least \nwe know will offend again, and we let these people out of prison with \nvirtually no monitoring at all by the Government.\n  Again, isn't it interesting, Martha Stewart--and, incidentally, I \ndon't even watch her television show, but she sure got a lot of press \nfor going to prison. Martha Stewart goes to prison, and when she is let \nout, she is walking around with an electronic ankle bracelet. Yet these \npeople are going to prison and they come out after having been guilty \nof violent sex offenses, they are judged to be at risk for committing \nanother sexual offense, and they do not wear any electronic bracelet, \nany electronic monitoring device. It is ``so long, see you later.''\n  That has to change. That is what Senator Hatch and Senator Biden say \nin their bill. It is what I say in Dru's Law. And it is long past the \ntime for the majority leader to schedule this for a debate in the \nSenate.\n  Last October, this Hatch-Biden bill was passed by the Senate \nJudiciary Committee. This is bipartisan. It has strong support in the \nSenate. There is no longer any excuse for that not to come to the \nSenate and to be debated and passed. Will it take the next vicious \nmurder, the next brutal murder of some young child, to understand that \nviolent sexual predators exist and are being let out of prison with \nlittle monitoring? I hope not. I hope before we have the next set of \nheadlines the majority leader will decide this represents a priority, a \npriority far higher than some of the other priorities he has suggested \nfor floor action, and that we can see in the Senate very soon the \nlegislation offered by Senator Hatch and Senator Biden.\n  I commend them for the legislation they have written. I appreciate \nthe fact that title II is Dru's Law. I have worked with them, as have \nmany of my colleagues. They have done this country a great service by \nputting S. 1086 together. Now the majority leader can do this country a \ngreat service by scheduling the Senate's consideration of this bill, \nafter these many months following its favorable reporting from the \nSenate Judiciary Committee.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, the Judiciary Committee has just \nconcluded a markup on the immigration bill. For those who may be \nwatching on C-SPAN2, a markup means we take a bill, which was the \nchairman's mark in this situation, a bill which my staff and I have \nconstructed, taking parts of legislation introduced by Senator McCain \nand Senator Kennedy and legislation introduced by Senator Kyl and \nSenator Cornyn, and amalgamated it into one bill with some other \nprovisions which had been suggested by other Senators.\n  We had hearings on the issue. As is customary, we heard both from the \nadministration and from outside witnesses. We had a series of markups. \nThen, today, in an unusual Monday session, we convened at 10 o'clock \nthis morning, and had a working quorum present by 10:10. We concluded \nright at 6 p.m. this afternoon and reported the bill out.\n  It is a very emotional issue. It is a very contentious issue. The \nPresident called for a civil debate, and we reached that objective. We \nhad a very civil debate. It is expected that there will be considerable \ncontroversy when the bill reaches the Senate floor. That is to be \nexpected on a matter as charged and as controversial as is this bill. \nIt is my expectation that the Senate will work its will and will enact \nlegislation. Then, under our bicameral system, we will go to work with \nthe House of Representatives, which has a substantially different \napproach, having passed a bill that is an enforcement bill. Our \nlegislation is comprehensive, including a temporary guest worker \nprogram and an approach to deal with the approximately 11 million \nundocumented workers in the United States.\n  On the subject of the 11 million undocumented workers, it had been my \nhope that we would have been able to reach an accommodation between \nMcCain-Kennedy and Kyl-Cornyn.\n  Last week, and on Saturday and Sunday, the staff was here working \nfull time, late every night. I was in town all of last week, Monday \nthrough Thursday, until Friday morning, trying to come up with an \naccommodation which would deal with the elements of Kyl-Cornyn.\n  There is obvious concern that we not produce a bill which would be \njustifiably categorized as amnesty, and I believe we have a bill which \nis not justifiably categorized as amnesty. We have a provision that \npeople who were among the undocumented aliens will have to pay a fine, \nwill have a criminal background check, will have to be at work for 6 \nyears, and will have to earn their path to citizenship.\n  The option of having the undocumented aliens return home is a very \ndifficult decision. There is no doubt they have violated the law of the \nUnited States by coming in without complying with our immigration \nprocedures. They have come in because there has been a demand for the \nworkers, because people have wanted to give them work. The employers \nhave given them work. But to expect them to come forward and to \nidentify themselves if they know they are going to be sent home is \nunrealistic.\n  It is obviously highly undesirable to create a fugitive class in \nAmerica. We do not want 11 million fugitives, which is what we have at \nthe present time. It could be possible to make arrests and to have \ndeportation orders. But it is unrealistic to say we are going to find \nthe 11 million, and that we are going to have facilities to detain \nthem. If you detain somebody, you have to have a detention facility. \nYou have to have beds. You have to be able to house them until \ndeportation proceedings are concluded, and that takes some time. The \napproach we have undertaken is to try to have them come forward, and \nhave them come forward in a context where we are not rewarding their \nillegal conduct.\n  There are people who have waited outside the country for lawful \nadmittance; in some countries, people have been waiting since 1983. \nUnder the provisions of the bill which we passed out of the committee, \nthe 11 million undocumented workers go to the back of the line. They \nwill have to pay a fine, they will have to undergo a criminal \nbackground check, they will have to earn their way by working, and if \nthey are out of work, they are subject to arrest and deportation at \nthat point.\n\n  We are open to suggestions, as to any Senators who have ideas. We are \nnot in concrete. If somebody has better ideas, there will be full \nopportunity to offer amendments on the Senate floor.\n  Title III, which relates to worksite enforcement, requires Social \nSecurity number identification, which we did not report out because \nthat is a matter under the jurisdiction of the Finance Committee, and \nthe Finance Committee rules require any amendments to those laws to be \nsigned by 11 members of the committee, a majority of the committee.\n  Senator Grassley gave us a report on the status in the Finance \nCommittee. They did not have their work finished, so the Judiciary \nCommittee could not take it up. There is a jurisdictional issue with \nthe Finance Committee asserting jurisdiction and perhaps preferring to \noffer their amendments on the floor.\n  We did not take up title VII, which is judicial reform, because there \nis considerable controversy about the chairman's mark on those \nprovisions.\n  We have included a modification in appeals to the federal circuit \ncourts after the immigration judge has ruled, after the Board of \nImmigration Appeals has ruled. We have consolidated those actions in \nthe Federal Circuit. We have heard from a number of judicial officials. \nWe heard from the chief judge of the Federal Circuit that with \nincreased resources, the court can handle the additional cases. But \nwith regard to the changes we proposed in trying to provide more \nindependence for immigration judges and in increasing the number of \njudges on the Board of Immigration Appeals so there are enough judges \nto write opinions, to try to cut down on the backlog and the number of \nappeals to the circuit courts, we ought to find out more.\n  We are noticing a hearing for next Monday morning where we will have \nan opportunity to hear from the judges, who have already written us: \nthe chief judge of the Second Circuit, and a judge from the Seventh \nCircuit. We will hear from the chief judge of the Federal Circuit, and \nconsider further the viewpoints of the Department of Justice and others \non the issue of the independence of the immigration\n\n[[Page S2409]]\n\njudges on the Board of Immigration Appeals.\n  We have operated with the knowledge that the majority leader filed a \nbill under rule XIV and announced that would be the bill which would be \ntaken up if the Judiciary Committee did not report out a bill. I think \nwe have produced a bill which is the product of serious debate. I would \nhave preferred more time, but as reported in the press today, we are \noperating under considerable pressure and we responded in a major way. \nSenators who had amendments to offer were heard and heard fully. There \nwas an obvious effort to make the discussion as focused and as brief as \npossible. But every Senator who wanted recognition was recognized. \nSenators were permitted to speak, which is their right under committee \nprocedure, until they had concluded. I think it is a major bill. The \nfull Senate will have the opportunity to work its will.\n  I would talk longer, but the majority leader has scheduled another \nmeeting at 6:30--a few minutes from now--to take up a number of \nprovisions of the bill. My attendance is required there, so I shall \nconclude.\n  In the absence of any Senator seeking recognition, I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for up \nto 10 minutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We are in morning business.\n  The Senator from Kansas is recognized.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I want to follow the chairman of the \nJudiciary Committee and make brief comments about the immigration bill \nthat came out of our committee with a strong, bipartisan vote.\n  It is a big issue. It is a tough issue. It is a tough issue that is \nconfronting America. I believe that is what this body should be about--\ndealing with big, tough issues confronting America. That is what the \ncommittee came through and did.\n  The bill that came out of the committee today is not the final \nproduct. I think it needs substantial adjustment. Hopefully, during the \n2-week period we are going to be discussing this bill on the floor, we \nwill have a lot of discussion and we will get a final product that we \ncan agree on that strengthens the immigration system.\n  Currently, our system is not working. It has not worked for some \nperiod of time. It has not worked for the country. It has not worked \nfor the people wanting to come into the country. It needs to be \nchanged. There is no question about it.\n  One specific item I wish to talk about is the need for comprehensive \nreform. The reason we need it is because of our past experience, when \nwe have had just pieces of comprehensive reform.\n  A quick bit of history: In 1986, we had 3 million undocumented \nindividuals in the United States, and Ronald Reagan put forward an \namnesty program. In 1996--we seem to do this in 10-year increments--\npeople were upset we had 7 million undocumented immigrants in the \nUnited States--3 million in 1986; 7 million in 1996--and we put forward \nan enforcement program and passed it into law and toughened up \nenforcement because that was seen as the need and the answer.\n  So we had an amnesty program in 1986, without enforcement; we had an \nenforcement program in 1996, without some sort of legalized system for \npeople to get into the country. We had 3 million undocumented; we had 7 \nmillion undocumented. We are at 2006, and we have 11 million \nundocumented, and people are saying what we need is tougher \nenforcement. We did do that in 1996, and we increased the number of \nthose undocumented whom we have in the country.\n  Now we have to increase enforcement. I think we have to do more than \njust border enforcement, though. We have to do interior enforcement and \nintegrating our tax system and Social Security system along with the \nimmigration system so we can catch people at the workplace, we can \ncatch people in a place where they will be interior in the country and \nstrengthen our enforcement that way. We have to get that done. So we \nhave to strengthen enforcement.\n  But, at the same time, you have to have some way to bring people into \na legalized system. President Bush has talked about a guest worker \nprogram. Others have talked about a circular program where you can come \nin, work for a period of time, and leave. Others have talked about a \nsystem where you can earn your citizenship by working here. That is \nwhat was basically passed in the committee bill, with much tougher \nenforcement and a way of being able to get the 11 million into a system \nwhere they can get into a legalized status and out of the shadows. That \nis what we want to take place.\n\n  We also have in the bill more interior enforcement. We have \nprovisions that have yet to be worked out on Social Security and \nimmigration enforcement that are being talked about with the chairman \nof the Finance Committee.\n  My reason for outlining that is that this is a big step we have taken \ntoday out of the Judiciary Committee. I serve on that committee. But it \nis not the final step. The President needs to engage in these \ndiscussions and negotiations, hopefully, as well as the House \nleadership, as we debate on the Senate floor one of the biggest issues \nfacing this country today and its future. And make no mistake about it, \nthis will affect the future makeup of the United States. It is a major \nissue.\n  I think it is one we can be proud of, that this is a nation of \nimmigrants. We can be humbled by all of our humble beginnings that each \nof us came from and have grown in this country. Once given freedom and \nliberty, people can do amazing things. We have seen that time and \nagain, the story of people who have come to the United States.\n  The final point I want to make is a philosophical one. One of the key \nmeasures in any society is what you do for the so-called least of \nthese. It is what you do for those who are not in the Chair presiding \nin the Senate, even with the humble roots that he came from, or other \nindividuals, it is what you do for the least of these, what you do for \nthe huddled masses. That really is a key hallmark and a key measure for \nsociety. Those huddled masses that we enshrined in the Statue of \nLiberty are a key indicator of what we have stood for so much in the \npast.\n  Categories of people who are in the least of these status generally \nare referred to as widows and orphans and the foreigner amongst you. \nThey are considered the least of these. People who have difficulty with \nstatus, difficulty having laws applied to them, have difficulty \naccessing the system are considered the least of these.\n  And what do we do. Today we took a step in dealing with the 11 \nmillion population, we believe, of undocumenteds in this country, \ntrying to deal with them as beautiful, unique individuals. And then we \nhave to, as well, deal with these as a nation of laws. We have to be a \nnation of laws. We can't just say: Well, the winds are this way or that \nway, and we have decided we are going to do this. We have to be a \nnation of laws. We have to get to a system that we can have people \nbelieve in and say this is a system of laws that will work, and yet \nstill deal with our aspiration as a society to deal with people in \ndifficult circumstances, the so-called least of these.\n  I think we have struck that balance today as a start. We have a long \nway to go to finish. We are heading toward the higher aspirations of \nwhat this country is about. It will be a very difficult and visceral \ndebate, as people's passions are strong. It does amaze me that passions \nfrequently change from the macro to the micro on an immigration debate. \nIn a macro debate, people say: We need to be a nation of laws. On a \nmicro basis, if it is their neighbor next door that is working and \ndoing construction work, they say: Look, leave him alone. But on a \nmacro basis, I want to deal with this on a tough situation. I have seen \nthat so much, of individuals who will say on a macro basis: We need to \nhave a tough set of laws, but don't pick on this individual I know \npersonally and I really care for. They should have a chance to \nexperience the American dream.\n  We are off to a good start of having a wholesome, full debate that is \ndignified, that is important, that deals with the highest aspirations \nof this\n\n[[Page S2410]]\n\ncountry and yet maintains and tries to get us back through the \nimmigration system into a nation of laws and not situations where they \nare just thrown to the side.\n  Our current system is such, with the complexity and the time waits in \nit that a person may come here legally but their spouse can't be here \nlegally for 7 to 10 years. So frequently the spouses decide, let's get \nthere any way we can. Or you will find an agricultural worker in a \nsystem saying that it is just so complicated that we are going to go \naround the system to the point that half to three-fourths of our \nagricultural workers, foreign-born agricultural workers, are \nundocumented illegals. Yet without them you don't run the agricultural \nsystem. You could say that is a bad place to be in, and it is. But I \nthink it also tells us the path to change that we have to get to be \nable to make a legal system that does work and that can get most people \ninto it. We need to do so to be compassionate and a nation of laws.\n  It will be a tremendous debate. It is an important one for the \ncountry. It is an important one for the Republican Party, for us to \nhave a good, full debate about this topic and how we move forward with \nit. I think we are going to have it, and it is going to be one of the \nmost dignified and important moments in debates for this Senate during \nthis term of Congress.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I want the record to reflect that my dear \nfriend, Senator Jay Rockefeller, is unable to be on the floor tonight \nbecause of a medical condition. It is nothing that won't be resolved \nquickly, but he is unable to be here today. He asked me to read, \nverbatim, a statement he would give if he were here tonight.\n  Mr. President, this is a floor statement on the passing of Erma Ora \nByrd, read by Harry Reid, as written by Jay Rockefeller:\n\n       My dear friend and revered colleague of more than two \n     decades has suffered a grievous loss, and I ask my colleagues \n     to join Sharon and me in mourning the passage of Erma Ora \n     Byrd, the wife and soul mate of West Virginia Senator, Robert \n     C. Byrd.\n       Before Robert Byrd was a Senator, before he was an \n     attorney, before the West Virginia Legislature named him the \n     West Virginian of the 20th Century, Erma recognized something \n     extraordinary in this son of the Winding Gulf coalfields. \n     What we see today, she saw then in the gas station attendant \n     and welder and butcher's apprentice who became her husband. \n     Those of us who had the privilege of knowing Erma, also know \n     that this was hardly the last time her vision proved \n     extraordinary. Throughout her life, her intelligence and \n     common sense made her a close partner to one of America's \n     most influential men. As Senator Byrd once said: ``She is not \n     only my wife, but also my best counselor.''\n       Yet, as sharp as Erma was in finding her husband, Senator \n     Byrd was equally astute. Not only was Erma a wise counselor, \n     but she was also a constant source of support. A proud coal \n     miner's daughter from Stotesbury, WV, she gave unhesitatingly \n     and without reserve. She was the support system that got him \n     from Capitol Hill to law school at the end of a hard day, and \n     to the many meetings and appearances his job required. Always \n     the model of grace and dignity, she was an extraordinary \n     mother, grandmother and great-grandmother. She made Robert C. \n     Byrd a better father, a better Senator, and a better man. In \n     many ways, Erma Byrd was the quintessential West Virginia \n     woman, teaching her family to work hard and care deeply, all \n     the while giving unceasingly to those around her.\n       Their marriage was not some practical partnership--it was a \n     love-match. After nearly 69 years of marriage, Senator Byrd \n     still radiated, in the words of John Cheever, the deep and \n     indisguisable joy of someone who has just fallen in love. \n     Together, they shared the triumphs and setbacks of political \n     life, always celebrating not elective office but the \n     opportunity to help people in their home State, for which \n     they cared so deeply.\n       Together, they knew tragedy as well, with the devastating \n     and untimely death of a beloved grandson. For a time, Senator \n     Byrd even gave up playing his fiddle as the music became too \n     much to bear. But they found solace in each other, in family, \n     and in their truly extraordinary faith in God.\n       During one of my last visits with Erma, I was sitting on my \n     couch being charmed, as everyone always was, by her warmth \n     and wit as we talked about everything in the world except the \n     United States Senate. She was a welcome reminder that life \n     existed outside our work and that delight was best discovered \n     in mountain flowers and close family and old friends.\n       Just a few weeks ago at my home, Senator Byrd spoke \n     lovingly and movingly about what we now know to be Erma's \n     final days. Even as Erma's mind and body failed her, he felt \n     profoundly that their hearts are forever linked and their \n     souls will recognize each other always. You could see that as \n     she suffered, he suffered, as she endured, he endured.\n       All the while Senator Byrd maintained a daunting Senate \n     schedule, as she had wanted him to do, and every evening he \n     returned home to his one true love.\n       As Erma's hardship is over now and she is in the loving \n     arms of the Lord, Senator Byrd will have the complete support \n     of West Virginia and his Senate family as he bears the new \n     hardship of this loss, but with the added grace of Mrs. Byrd \n     watching over him.\n       The circle has been broken. But we take strength from the \n     sure knowledge that, in years to come, a better home awaits \n     all of us, and for Senator Byrd his life will be complete \n     again.\n\n  Mr. President, that ends the statement of Jay Rockefeller.\n  Speaking for myself as the Democratic leader and as someone who has \nlearned so much about the Senate from Robert C. Byrd, I recognize that \nat 7:20 p.m. on this past Saturday night, Erma Byrd, the wife of our \nown Senator Robert Byrd, passed away. Mrs. Byrd had been struggling \nwith illness for quite some time. But after years of pain and \ndiscomfort, she has found peace.\n  On behalf of the Senate, I offer our condolences to this good man, \nSenator Byrd, his daughters Mona and Marjorie, and to his dozens of \ngrandchildren and great-grandchildren. It is our prayer that they, too, \nfind peace and comfort during these difficult days.\n  This is a sad time for the Senate family. Erma's passing is a loss \nfor all of us. She was a special person and will be missed. She touched \nthe lives of everyone she met. She touched my life. My colleague from \nWest Virginia, Senator Rockefeller, had the privilege of knowing Erma \nbetter than most, and that has been certainly addressed in the \nstatement I read for Senator Rockefeller.\n  As I indicated, he is not able to be here today because he is \nrecovering from back surgery, but he asked that I read this tribute to \nErma, which I was so happy to do.\n  We are recognizing the loss of Erma Byrd, and in so doing, we have to \nmention the greatness of Senator Byrd, running for his ninth term for \nthe Senate--ninth term. It has never happened before. I marvel at what \nI have learned from Senator Byrd. I can remember as though it were \nyesterday when he decided he was no longer going to be the Democratic \nleader. Senator Dole wanted to do a luncheon in recognition of Senator \nByrd over in the Russell Building. It was a wonderful occasion. We \nlearned about Senator Byrd more than we had known. We thought we knew \nhim well. But he told us that day that we would learn some things we \ndidn't know, and we did.\n  What a marvelous man. He could leave his home in Virginia for his \nhome in West Virginia and back, 4 hours one way, 4 hours back, recite \npoetry over and back and never recite the same poem twice. He is a man \nwith a mind that I have never seen before. He is an expert in \nShakespeare. This man is so brilliant that he gave lectures here \ndealing with the line-item veto where he based his 10 lectures on the \nrise and fall of the Roman Empire. He could recite from memory every \nruler that Rome had. His lectures were so dynamic that at the \nUniversity of Nevada-Las Vegas, a professor taught classes to his \ngraduate students based only on Senator Byrd's lectures.\n  I can remember going to a parliamentary exchange in West Virginia \nwhere we exchanged with British Parliamentarians. Senator Byrd stood \nand recited from memory the reign of the British monarchs, their names, \nhow they spelled their names, the years they were in power, and what \nthey had done. Unbelievable.\n  The reason I mention this is that Senator Byrd did not get there \nalone. He was supported--and that is an understatement--by Mrs. Byrd. \nHis greatness suggests her greatness. I had the\n\n[[Page S2411]]\n\ngood fortune to travel with the Byrds when her health was better. Their \nrelationship is just as Jay Rockefeller said--people married for nearly \n60 years who were like teenagers--teenagers in love.\n  I know Senator Byrd is a better person because of the person he chose \nto be his wife, but as a result of that, all of us are better people \nbecause of the influence Erma Byrd had on Robert C. Byrd.\n  My thoughts go to Robert Byrd. I spoke with him yesterday. He was \nstrong, resilient, saying this is what Erma would want, for him to be \nstrong. I haven't heard his voice as powerful as it was yesterday, at 2 \nor so in the afternoon, for a number of years because he suffered the \npain his wife suffered. We all felt that. Her pain is past. Senator \nByrd's pain is past.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

March 2006 marks the 60th anniversary of what is regarded \nas one of the most influential speeches of the 20th century. March 5, \n1946, Winston Churchill gave his famous ``Iron Curtain'' speech at \nWestminster College, in Fulton, MO. Historians date the beginning of \nthe cold war to this speech.\n  In this speech Mr. Churchill introduced to the world the phrase \n``Iron Curtain'' to describe the division between Western powers and \nthe area controlled by the Soviet Union. This speech not only marked \nthe onset of the cold war but drew attention to the unique relationship \nbetween the United States and Great Britain. This special relationship \nspans three eras from Winston Churchill and FDR to Ronald Reagan and \nMargaret Thatcher and now to George W. Bush and Tony Blair.\n  In celebration of this historic event and the special relationship \nbetween our Nation and Great Britain, the Howard H. Baker Jr. Center \nfor Public Policy at the University of Tennessee and the Churchill \nArchives Centre at Cambridge University, the United Kingdom, have come \ntogether for a stellar international conference and to honor one of \nAmerica's greatest statesmen and one of Tennessee's greatest sons, the \nHonorable Howard H. Baker, Jr.\n  This premier occasion has brought together two great universities and \ntwo great centers, each dedicated to preserving and presenting their \ncomplementary historical resources. This coming together has formed a \nnew partnership for the 21st century and will support an ongoing, \ntrans-Atlantic and international educational alliance.\n  Here are excerpts from the Iron Curtain speech:\n\n       The United States stands at this time at the pinnacle of \n     world power. It is a solemn moment for the American \n     democracy. For with this primacy in power is also joined an \n     awe-inspiring accountability to the future. As you look \n     around you, you must feel not only the sense of duty done, \n     but also you must feel anxiety lest you fall below the level \n     of achievement. Opportunity is here now, clear and shining, \n     for both our countries. To reject it or ignore it or fritter \n     it away will bring upon us all the long reproaches of the \n     aftertime.\n       From Stettin in the Baltic to Trieste in the Adriatic, an \n     iron curtain has descended across the Continent. Behind that \n     line lie all the capitals of the ancient states of Central \n     and Eastern Europe.\n       The safety of the world requires a new unity in Europe, \n     from which no nation should be permanently outcast. It is \n     from the quarrels of the strong parent races in Europe that \n     the world wars we have witnessed, or which occurred in former \n     times, have sprung.\n       Fraternal association requires not only the growing \n     friendship and mutual understanding between our two vast but \n     kindred systems of society, but the continuance of the \n     intimate relationship . . .\n       Beware, I say; time may be short. Do not let us take the \n     course of allowing events to drift along until it is too \n     late. If there is to be a fraternal association of the kind I \n     have described, with all the extra strength and security \n     which both our countries can derive from it, let us make sure \n     that that great fact is known to the world, and that it plays \n     its part in steadying and stabilizing the foundations of \n     peace. There is the path of wisdom. Prevention is better than \n     cure.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/03/27/senate-section/article/S2411-2", "month": "03", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2411]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                LOCAL RADIO BROADCAST EMERGENCY SERVICES\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, on Wednesday, March 15, 2006, I joined \nSenator Snowe and Senator Baucus in introducing S. 2418, a bill to \npreserve local radio broadcast emergency and other services and to \nrequire the Federal Communications Commission to conduct a rulemaking \nfor that purpose.\n  Growing up in my home town of Pascagoula, MS, I had my own radio \nshow. Through local radio, I had the opportunity to have a voice in my \ncommunity. Local radio keeps communities informed about what is going \non in their back yards, and gives local leaders an opportunity to \ncommunicate with their supporters.\n  Over the years, I have been actively voicing my concerns on the issue \nof media ownership. I believe that the problem of the pervasiveness of \nindecency in broadcasting is related to my concerns about media \nownership. When media conglomerates become too large, they are less \nresponsive to the concerns of the American viewing public and less \naccountable to local communities. Media companies which use publicly \nowned airwaves must become more responsive to public needs, respectful \nof local values and reflective of community standards which seem to be \nconstantly ignored by executives in east and west coast high-rise \noffice buildings.\n  In order to ensure that radio remains an independent source of \ninformation for local communities, I am pleased to introduce a bill to \npreserve local radio broadcast emergency and other services and to \nrequire the Federal Communications Commission to conduct a rulemaking \nfor that purpose.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/03/27/senate-section/article/S2411-3", "month": "03", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2411-S2412]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                    A COLORADO LEADER: MONTE PASCOE\n\n Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I rise today to honor a good and \ndecent man, who left an indelible mark on Colorado, but who sadly left \nus suddenly and too soon.\n  Monte Pascoe of Denver died unexpectedly on March 2, at age 71, \nleaving behind his wonderful wife Pat, children Sarah, Ted and Will, a \nbrother Patrick, and a legacy as a ``servant leader,'' a model we would \nall do well to follow.\n  Monte was a friend and mentor to me. He was a lawyer who worked on \nwater and natural resource issues, helping protect the natural heritage \nof our great State of Colorado. He served as the executive director of \nthe Colorado Department of Natural Resources, a post I held in later \nyears. He was a longtime member of the Denver Board of Water \nCommissioners; member of the Colorado School of Mines board; president \nof the Iliff School of Theology; and chairman of the Colorado Water \nQuality Commission.\n  Monte led the Colorado Democratic Party as its chairman during the \nearly and mid 1970s, when Colorado elected such illustrious public \nservants as Gary Hart, Pat Schroeder and Tim Wirth to the U.S. Senate \nand House of Representatives; Dick Lamm to the Governor's mansion; and \nmy good friend Ruben Valdez as the first Hispanic Speaker of the \nColorado House of Representatives.\n  In 1969, Monte ran for the Denver Board of Education, losing in a \ncampaign defined by the issue of the segregation of public schools. \nMonte fought the good fight, standing firm for equality in access to \npublic schools. Even though he lost that election, he helped organize \nthe legal effort which eventually led to the desegregation of Denver \nschools.\n  In 1983, Monte ran for mayor of Denver among a crowded field that \nincluded the eventual winner, former U.S. Secretary of Energy and \nTransportation, Federico Pena.\n  Monte stood beside his wife Pat during her own distinguished career \nin the Colorado State Senate.\n  Monte was a community leader in the best sense of the word, active in \nhis church, Montview Presbyterian Church, and numerous nonprofit and \ncommunity organizations.\n  Up until his death, Monte, along with his friend of over 30 years, Ed \nBenton,\n\n[[Page S2412]]\n\nwalked from his home to his law firm, Ireland Stapleton Pryor & Pascoe, \nwhere he had worked since 1960.\n  Monte was born Jan. 4, 1935, in Ames, IA. His family moved to Denver \nwhen he was a young boy, settling in the Park Hill neighborhood. He \ngraduated from East High School and went to Dartmouth College, where he \nmet Pat, and earned his law degree from Stanford University.\n  We in Denver and Colorado counted on Monte and turned to him when a \ntask needed to be done, or a problem solved, or a perspective gained. \nHe carried out his role as a ``servant leader'' with humor, grace, \nselflessness and humility. Our community will miss him tremendously, \nand our thoughts and prayers are with his wonderful family.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/03/27/senate-section/article/S2412-1", "month": "03", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2412]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO GARLAND RASH\n\n Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, today I would like to share with you \nGarland Rash's inspiring story of bravery and determination that saw \nhim use his remarkable talent for woodwork to serve his country during \nthe dark days of World War II.\n  Born in 1924, Garland was raised in Drew County, AR, where he put \nhimself through school and developed an interest in carpentry. Like so \nmany other Americans, he was horrified at the attack on Pearl Harbor in \n1941 and immediately set out to aid in the country's war effort. This \nled him to California, where he dedicated himself to building wooden \nracks that could be used to raise ships out of the water to be \nrepaired.\n  Garland soon realized during a visit home on Mother's Day in 1943 \nthat he wanted to do more for his county. That summer, he enlisted in \nthe Navy and underwent a grueling period in boot camp. Garland was then \nassigned to the 116th Naval Battalion as part of the construction unit \nof the Navy, nicknamed the ``Seebees.''\n  After more training in Rhode Island and Bay St. Louis, Garland was \nshipped to Pearl Harbor where he, alongside many other talented \ncarpenters, was part of a covert operation to equip U.S. military \nplanes with a more advanced type of engine. While there, Garland \ndecided to collect several pieces of wood and Plexiglas from the debris \nof the 1941 bombing. During his nonworking hours, Garland used these \npieces to fashion two wooden boxes, using parachute scraps for the \nlining and Plexiglas from windshields to create a beautiful inlaid \nmosaic pattern on the lid.\n  While in Pearl Harbor, a young marine named Bob Crosby, brother of \nfamed singer Bing Crosby, was struck by the workmanship of these boxes. \nHe asked Garland whether he would be willing to sell one to him and \nGarland agreed. Though Garland never saw him again, Bob Crosby would go \non to become an accomplished actor and musician through the 1950s.\n  Garland continued his distinguished military service in Iwo Jima, the \nPhilippines, and Japan where he and his fellow American troops accepted \nthe surrender of Japanese forces in 1945. After returning to the United \nStates in December of that year, Garland resumed his relationship with \nKathleen Lawson, a woman he had dated while on leave from the Navy \nduring the war. They were married on March 1, 1946.\n  Today, their home in Monticello, AR, is filled with loving pictures \nof several grandchildren and great-grandchildren. Remarkably, Garland \nmanaged to hold on to the other wooden box that he carved from the \nrubble of Pearl Harbor and keeps it today as a remembrance of the war \nand his service.\n  Looking at this box today, I, like Bob Crosby so many years ago, am \namazed by the extraordinary craftsmanship, and I am awestruck knowing \nits historical significance. Garland, like so many World War II \nveterans, is truly a part of the ``greatest American generation'' and I \nhope you will join me in paying tribute to his extraordinary service to \nthis Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/03/27/senate-section/article/S2412-2", "month": "03", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2412]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RECOGNIZING DARLYS J. BAUM\n\n Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate \nDarlys J. Baum on her retirement from the South Dakota Housing \nDevelopment Authority after 30 years of dedicated service to our State. \nDar has served under six South Dakota Governors. Prior to being named \nexecutive director in 1995, Dar served as deputy executive director for \n11 years. Before that, she served in various capacities, including \ndirector of rental housing programs.\n  In addition to her duties as executive director, Dar found the time \nto bring South Dakota's rural housing perspective to regional and \nnational boards. She served as a member of Fannie Mae's National \nHousing Impact Advisory Council from 2002-2003 and as a member of the \nBoard of Directors of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Des Moines from \n2002-2004.\n  Under Dar's leadership, the South Dakota Housing Development \nAuthority issued nearly $2.27 billion in long-term and $1.95 billion in \nshort-term home ownership bonds. During this time, 23,869 families and \nindividuals took advantage of SDHDA's low-interest mortgage loan \nopportunities, accounting for more than $1.8 billion in loans \npurchased. Additionally, more than $12.8 million was loaned to 7,602 \nfamilies for downpayment and closing cost assistance.\n  Working with lenders, service providers, and realtors, Dar helped \ncreate the Homeownership Education Resource Organization, HERO, to \nprovide high-quality home buyer education. Pursuing the American dream \nof homeownership can be a daunting challenge for many families, and \nhome buyer education services can help walk these families through the \nhome buying process.\n  Since Dar became executive director, SDHDA allocated more than $16.4 \nmillion in housing tax credits for 89 developments across South Dakota. \nNearly 3,300 affordable housing units were created or preserved, \ntotaling more than $242 million in project costs.\n  During that same time, SDHDA used the HOME Investment Partnership \nProgram for 939 HOME-assisted units in 88 multifamily developments, \nreceiving more than $39 million in funding for construction or \nrehabilitation. Also, more than $1.6 million in HOME funding was \nutilized for homeownership rehabilitation in 222 homes. Total \ndevelopment costs contributed to South Dakota's economy from the HOME \nProgram were more than $102 million during Dar's tenure as executive \ndirector.\n  Dar was instrumental in helping lead the charge to end homelessness \nin South Dakota. She helped form the statewide Housing for the Homeless \nConsortium and the Governor's Interagency Council on Homelessness. \nThese organizations were created to unite those who work to provide \nshelter, employment opportunities, food, education, health care, and \nsupport for those who are homeless or at risk of becoming homeless. \nSince its creation, the Housing for the Homeless Consortium has been \nawarded about $6.5 million through the Continuum of Care Grant Program, \nwhich is a competitive grant program administered through the U.S. \nDepartment of Housing and Urban Development.\n  As you can see, under Dar's extraordinary leadership, the South \nDakota Housing Development Authority has done an impressive amount of \nwork on South Dakota's housing needs. I, again, want to thank Dar for \nher tireless efforts to improve the housing opportunities available to \nSouth Dakota families. My staff and I have always highly valued her \nadvice on so many important housing issues. Dar has a unique ability to \ngenerate creative solutions and bring people together in partnerships \nthat solve so many critical housing problems. Dar Baum's commitment and \ndedication to public service is an example for others in public service \nto emulate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/03/27/senate-section/article/S2412-3", "month": "03", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2412]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/03/27/senate-section/article/S2412-4", "month": "03", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2412-S2413]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations and two withdrawals which were referred to the appropriate \ncommittees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n[[Page S2413]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/03/27/senate-section/article/S2412-4", "month": "03", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2412-S2413]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations and two withdrawals which were referred to the appropriate \ncommittees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n[[Page S2413]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/03/27/senate-section/article/S2413-1", "month": "03", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2413]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n               MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE DURING ADJOURNMENT\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                         ENROLLED BILLS SIGNED\n\n  Under the authority of the order of the Senate of January 4, 2005, \nthe Secretary of the Senate, on March 17, 2006, during the adjournment \nof the Senate, received a message from the House of Representatives \nannouncing that the Speaker pro tempore (Mr. Aderholt) had signed the \nfollowing enrolled bills:\n\n       S. 2275.

Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n      By Ms. Snowe:\n  S. 2457. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code to provide \nincentives for supplying health insurance to employees of small \nemployers, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise to introduce legislation that would \naddress the crisis that faces small businesses when it comes to \npurchasing quality, affordable health insurance. This isn't a new \ncrisis. Nearly 46 million Americans are uninsured, and we've now \nexperienced double digit percentage increases in health insurance \npremiums in four of the past five years.\n  Last year, I introduced the Small Business Health Fairness Act, S. \n406, which would allow small businesses to pool together, through \nnational Association Health Plans, also known as Small Business Health \nPlans, SBHPs, to offer uniform health insurance products to their \nemployees. Small businesses would receive the same benefits currently \nenjoyed by larger employers and union plans under Federal law.\n  I am encouraged by the considerable progress that has been made on \nSBHPs in this Senate. I would like to commend Senator Mike Enzi for his \ncontinuing commitment to the SBHP issue, and for marking-up SBHP \nlegislation in the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee. \nPlain and simple, the Senate must take up--and pass--SBHP legislation \nto provide small businesses with much-needed, long-awaited relief.\n  While I continue to believe that SBHPs are a crucial solution to the \nsmall business health insurance crisis, we in Congress must look for \nother means by which to encourage small businesses to offer health \ninsurance. I believe that we should do this by: 1. providing targeted \ntax incentives that encourage the smallest businesses to offer health \ninsurance; and 2. using the tax code to inject much-needed competition \nin dysfunctional State small group markets.\n  The Small Business Health Insurance Relief Act of 2006 would achieve \nboth of these objectives. First, I propose a targeted tax credit that \nwould encourage our Nation's smallest businesses to offer health \ninsurance as a workplace benefit.\n  Study after study tells us that the smallest businesses are the ones \nleast likely to offer insurance and most in need of assistance. \nAccording to the Employee Benefit Research Institute, of the working \nuninsured, who make up 83 percent of our Nation's uninsured population, \n60.6 percent either work for a small business with fewer than 100 \nemployees or are self-employed.\n  Small businesses in my own State of Maine have it particularly bad. \nLast summer, the Maine Center for Economic Policy, MECEP, reported a 15 \npercent average premium increase for small businesses in Maine over the \npast three years. The MECEP report also highlighted several other \nalarming trends: Half of the small businesses surveyed raised \ndeductibles over the past three years. Over one quarter have either \nincreased co-payments or reduced coverage, or have delayed pay raises \nto cover increased costs. Eight percent of Maine's small businesses \nhave dropped health coverage entirely.\n  Furthermore, coverage trends for small businesses are getting worse, \nnot better. According to the Kaiser Family Foundation's Employer Health \nBenefits 2005 Annual Survey: only 47 percent of the smallest employers, \nthose with 3 to 9 workers, now offer health insurance as a workplace \nbenefit. This is down from 52 percent in 2004, and 58 percent in 2002. \nIn sharp contrast, 98 percent of larger businesses, those with 200 or \nmore workers, offer health insurance as a benefit.\n  The targeted tax incentives in my bill would help ensure that our \nNation's smallest businesses can offer health insurance--in the same \nway that larger businesses currently do. My legislation targets small \nbusinesses with 50 or fewer employees because these are the small \nbusinesses most desperately in need. The maximum tax credit under the \nproposal would be $1,500 for single coverage and $3,000 for family \ncoverage. The tax credit would phase out as a business increases in \nsize. Notably, my proposal is neutral between types of insurance: small \nbusinesses and their employees can choose\n\n[[Page S2418]]\n\nwhat works best for them--traditional employer-sponsored health \ninsurance or health savings accounts, HSAs.\n  Under my legislation, a small business with five employees would be \neligible for a per-participant tax credit of $3,000 for a family health \ninsurance plan, and a potential total tax credit of $15,000. Small \nbusinesses cite escalating cost as the number one impediment to \nproviding health insurance. Putting $15,000 in the hands of a small \nbusiness owner could certainly help to overcome this barrier.\n  My proposal would also allow small businesses to establish cafeteria \ntax plans so that they can provide their employees with nontaxable \nbenefits. Under current law, many larger businesses and the Federal \nGovernment enable their employees to purchase health insurance and \nother qualified benefits with tax-free dollars. However, small \nbusinesses face difficulty in offering cafeteria plans because they \nmust satisfy strict nondiscrimination rules under the tax code. \nAlthough these non-discrimination rules serve a legitimate purpose, \nmany small businesses simply cannot satisfy those mechanical rules \nbecause, through no fault of their own, they have relatively few \nemployees and a high proportion of owners considered highly compensated \nindividuals. This makes it difficult for small firms to offer benefits \nthrough a cafeteria plan.\n  It is vital that we allow small businesses to offer their employees \nnontaxable benefits so that they can effectively compete with their \nlarger counterparts. Small businesses are the engine that drives \neconomic growth and job creation, and it is critical that we put them \non an equal footing with large businesses in the quest for talent.\n\n  Second, my legislation also would provide a necessary reform of the \nState small group health insurance markets. Plain and simple, there is \nno competition in the small group market, and coverage and \naffordability are real problems. I recently requested, along with \nSenators Christopher Bond and Jim Talent, that the Government \nAccountability Office, GAO, survey: 1. the number of insurance carriers \nlicensed in the small group market; 2. the largest carriers and their \nmarket share; 3. the market share of the five largest carriers in the \nsmall group market; and 4. the combined market share of all Blue Cross \nand Blue Shield, BCBS, carriers in each State.\n  The GAO reported a frightening consolidation of control over State \ninsurance markets. The five largest carriers now have more than 75 \npercent market share in 26 States, up from 19 in 2002, and more than 90 \npercent market share in 12 States, as opposed to 7 in 2002. In Maine, \nBCBS carriers now have a 63 percent market share, up from 39.1 percent \nin 2002, and the five largest carriers have a 98 percent share. Across \nthe country, BCBS carriers now control 44 percent of small group \nmarket, up from 34 percent in 2002.\n  To counter this market consolidation, my legislation would provide \ninsurers with a 50 percent tax deduction for claims and expenses \nincurred in serving the small group market and Small Business Health \nPlans, SBHPs. I believe this incentive will serve as a powerful \nmotivator for new insurers to enter this dysfunctional marketplace.\n  My legislation would reduce barriers insurance companies face in \nentering new markets. Specifically, it would provide a tax credit to \ndefray the cost of State licensing requirements. Under the proposal, an \ninsurer can claim a tax credit of the lesser of 50 percent of qualified \ncosts or $10,000 to cover the administrative costs and expenses \nincurred in satisfying State licensing requirements. Available with \nrespect to each State in which an insurer operates, this incentive \nshould encourage a host of insurers to provide products in the State \nsmall group market.\n  Finally, my legislation would establish a pilot grant program for \nSmall Business Development Centers to provide educational programs to \nsmall businesses designed to increase awareness regarding health \ninsurance options available in their areas. Recent research has found \nthat with a short, less than 10 minute education session, organizations \ncan increase small business knowledge and interest in offering health \ninsurance by about 33 percent.\n  Together with SBHP legislation, I believe that these proposals could \nhelp to solve the small business health insurance crisis. I look \nforward to working in a bipartisan fashion, with my colleagues on both \nthe Finance and HELP Committees to push these proposals through the \nSenate.\n  The time for words has long passed. Now is a time for action. The \nSenate must take action this year to provide small businesses with \nmuch-needed relief.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of my bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2457\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

This bill would repeal restrictions on the release of \ncrime gun trace data from the Federal Government to State and local \npolice.\n  It goes without saying that the more we understand a problem and its\n\n[[Page S2423]]\n\nsources, the more proficient we will be in our attempt to create a \nsolution that works. That is especially true when talking about guns \nthat are used to commit crimes. One study has shown that 1.2 percent of \ngun dealers sell 57 percent of guns later traced to criminal \ninvestigations.\n  The State that I have the honor of representing in the Senate, New \nJersey, has some of the strictest gun laws in the country, yet \nhundreds, if not thousands, of off-limit customers, such as those under \nage or those who do not have a license, wind up with such weapons each \nmonth. And the overwhelming majority of guns used to commit crimes in \nour State's cities were originally sold in compliance with the law in \nother States.\n  In fact, a large majority of the guns used to commit crimes in Jersey \nCity, Newark, and Camden traveled up the East Coast along I-95, which \nhas been called the ``Iron Pipeline.'' This is truly a paradox that has \nnot only frustrated law enforcement agents, but elected officials too.\n  That is why the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives's \nCrime Gun Trace Reports (CGTRs) were created to provide information to \nthree different audiences: Federal, State, and local law enforcement \nagencies; federal Firearm Licensees (FFL); and the public, Congress, \nand State and local authorities.\n  According to the reports released in July 2002, 85 percent of the \ntraced guns used to commit crimes in Jersey City and Newark, and 77 \npercent of those used in Camden, were originally purchased outside of \nNew Jersey. And more than 67 percent of crime guns recovered in Jersey \nCity were originally purchased more than 250 miles away.\n  This is exactly the type of information that assists law enforcement \nofficials in placing local crime guns in a regional and national \nstrategic enforcement context and would allow Federal, State, and local \nelected officials to develop national, regional, and local strategic \nresponses to gun crime.\n  Unfortunately, every year for the past few years Republicans in the \nHouse have slipped a provision into law to prohibit the release of this \ninformation to anyone other than ``. . . a Federal, State, or local law \nenforcement agency or a prosecutor solely in a criminal investigation \nor prosecution.'' This amendment effectively prohibits information from \nreaching Congress, and State and local authorities, and the public.\n  This even limits how Federal, State and local law enforcement \nagencies can use these Crime Gun Trace Reports. It only allows law \nenforcement agencies to use these reports to investigate a crime that \nhas already been committed.\n  So, it only allows law enforcement officials to retroactively punish \ncrime, rather than proactively preventing it from happening in the \nfirst place.\n  That is why I am introducing legislation to make this gun crime data \npublic again. It will not only help law enforcement prosecute gun \ncrimes, but will also increase public awareness about where these guns \noriginated.\n  Until now, the restrictions have been imposed through the annual \nappropriations process, which means they end at the end of each fiscal \nyear, or September 30. However, the House Judiciary Committee will hold \na hearing tomorrow on legislation that would write these restrictions \ninto law permanently.\n  Why is this information being concealed from the American people? It \ncertainly contains no classified or sensitive national security \nmaterial. The taxpayers have paid for information to be collected and \nthe reports to be prepared, so why do they not deserve access to the \ninformation? And why is it illegal for Federal, State and local \npolicymakers and law enforcement officials to use these reports in the \nway they were envisioned: to better understand and combat the scourge \nof gun violence that plagues our cities?\n  Denying police access to this information about crime gun traces \nhelps no one but the bad guys. Our families' safety should never take a \nbackseat to the demands of radical interest groups seeking only to \nfurther their own narrow agenda. Congress needs to pass my \nlegislation--instead we need to stand up for our families. I urge my \ncolleagues to join me in this important effort.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2460\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Res. 405\n\n       Whereas the airborne forces of the United States Armed \n     Forces have a long and honorable history as units of \n     adventuresome, hardy, and fierce warriors who, for the \n     national security of the United States and the defense of \n     freedom and peace, project the effective ground combat power \n     of the United States by Air Force air transport to the far \n     reaches of the battle area and, indeed, to the far corners of \n     the world;\n       Whereas August 16, 2006, marks the anniversary of the first \n     official validation of the innovative concept of inserting \n     United States ground combat forces behind the battle line by \n     means of a parachute;\n       Whereas the United States experiment of airborne infantry \n     attack began on June 25, 1940, when the Army Parachute Test \n     Platoon was first authorized by the United States Department \n     of War, and was launched when 48 volunteers began training in \n     July of 1940;\n       Whereas the Parachute Test Platoon performed the first \n     official Army parachute jump on August 16, 1940;\n       Whereas the success of the Parachute Test Platoon in the \n     days immediately preceding the entry of the United States \n     into World War II led to the formation of a formidable force \n     of airborne units that, since then, have served with \n     distinction and repeated success in armed hostilities;\n       Whereas among those units are the former 11th, 13th, and \n     17th Airborne Divisions, the venerable 82nd Airborne \n     Division, the versatile 101st Airborne Division (Air \n     Assault), and the airborne regiments and battalions (some as \n     components of those divisions, some as separate units) that \n     achieved distinction as the elite 75th Ranger Regiment, the \n     173rd Airborne Brigade, the 187th Infantry (Airborne) \n     Regiment, the 503rd, 507th, 508th, 517th, 541st, and 542nd \n     Parachute Infantry Regiments, the 88th Glider Infantry \n     Regiment, the 509th, 551st, and 555th Parachute Infantry \n     Battalions, and the 550th Airborne Infantry Battalion;\n       Whereas the achievements of the airborne forces during \n     World War II provided a basis of evolution into a diversified \n     force of parachute and air assault units that, over the \n     years, have fought in Korea, Vietnam, Grenada, Panama, the \n     Persian Gulf Region, and Somalia, and have engaged in \n     peacekeeping operations in Lebanon, the Sinai Peninsula, the \n     Dominican Republic, Haiti, Bosnia, and Kosovo;\n       Whereas the modern-day airborne force that has evolved from \n     those World War II beginnings is an agile, powerful force \n     that, in large part, is composed of the 82nd Airborne \n     Division, the 101st Airborne Division (Air Assault), and the \n     75th Ranger Regiment which, together with other units, \n     comprise the quick reaction force of the Army's XVIII \n     Airborne Corps when not operating separately under a regional \n     combatant commander;\n       Whereas that modern-day airborne force also includes other \n     elite forces composed entirely of airborne trained and \n     qualified special operations warriors, including Army Special \n     Forces, Marine Corps Reconnaissance units, Navy SEALs, Air \n     Force combat control teams, all or most of which comprise the \n     forces of the United States Special Operations Command;\n       Whereas in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks on the \n     United States on September 11, 2001, the 75th Ranger \n     Regiment, special\n\n[[Page S2424]]\n\n     forces units, and units of the 82nd Airborne Division and the \n     101st Airborne Division (Air Assault), together with other \n     units of the Armed Forces, have been prosecuting the war \n     against terrorism by carrying out combat operations in \n     Afghanistan, training operations in the Philippines, and \n     other operations elsewhere;\n       Whereas in the aftermath of the President's announcement of \n     Operation Iraqi Freedom in March 2003, the 75th Ranger \n     Regiment, special forces units, and units of the 82nd \n     Airborne Division, the 101st Airborne Division (Air Assault) \n     and the 173rd Airborne Brigade, together with other units of \n     the Armed Forces, have been prosecuting the war against \n     terrorism, carrying out combat operations, conducting civil \n     affair missions, and assisting in establishing democracy in \n     Iraq;\n       Whereas the airborne forces are and will continue to be at \n     the ready and the forefront until the Global War on Terrorism \n     is concluded;\n       Whereas of the members and former members of the United \n     States combat airborne forces, all have achieved distinction \n     by earning the right to wear the airborne's ``Silver Wings of \n     Courage'', thousands have achieved the distinction of making \n     combat jumps, 69 have earned the Medal of Honor, and hundreds \n     have earned the Distinguished-Service Cross, Silver Star, or \n     other decorations and awards for displays of such traits as \n     heroism, gallantry, intrepidity, and valor;\n       Whereas the members and former members of the United States \n     combat airborne forces are members of a proud and honorable \n     fraternity of the profession of arms that is made exclusive \n     by those distinctions which, together with their special \n     skills and achievements, distinguish them as intrepid combat \n     parachutists, special operation forces, and (in former days) \n     glider troops; and\n       Whereas the history and achievements of the members and \n     former members of the airborne forces of the United States \n     Armed Forces warrant special expressions of the gratitude of \n     the American people as the airborne community celebrates \n     August 16, 2006, as the 66th anniversary of the first \n     official jump by the Army Parachute Test Platoon: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates August 16, 2006, as ``National Airborne \n     Day''; and\n       (2) requests that the President issue a proclamation \n     calling on Federal, State, and local administrators and the \n     people of the United States to observe ``National Airborne \n     Day'' with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url":

Mr. President, I want to take a few moments to comment on \nthe resolution that was just agreed to with regard to Graceland.\n  As famous as the White House, as beloved as Wrigley Field, each year \nover 600,000 people from around the world travel to Memphis, TN, to see \nGraceland, the legendary home of the King of Rock.\n  Today, I am pleased to introduce and pass the Senate resolution \nhonoring Graceland as a National Historic Landmark.\n  On behalf of my fellow Tennesseans, I extend my thanks to Secretary \nNorton for recognizing this unique contribution to American culture, \nand the extraordinary influence of the man who made it his own, Elvis \nAaron Presley.\n  Born on January 8, 1935, in a 2-room house in East Tulepo, MS, Elvis \nand his family moved to Memphis when he was 13. Six years later--with \nthe help of Sam Phillips, Sun Records, and his recording of ``That's \nAll Right''--Elvis became a star.\n  From that moment on his fame only grew, propelling him into the small \npantheon of American icons who single-handedly remade popular culture.\n  In the 1960s, Leonard Bernstein was moved to remark, ``Elvis is the \ngreatest cultural force in the 20th century. He introduced the beat to \neverything music, language, clothes. It's a whole new social \nrevolution.''\n  John Lennon famously said, ``Before Elvis, there was nothing.''\n  Elvis fused the styles of gospel country, and rhythm and blues. His \ninstinctual style revolutionized rock'n roll and drove it to the center \nof popular culture.\n  Through his enormous talent, drive, and charisma, Elvis achieved \nremarkable success over 2 decades earning 97 gold albums, 55 platinum \nalbums, 25 multi-platinum albums, 51 gold singles, 27 platinum singles, \n7 multi-platinum singles, and album sales exceeding 120 million copies.\n  When the 21-year-old star appeared on the Ed Sullivan Show in 1956, \n82.6 percent of the viewing public tuned in.\n  Thirteen years later Elvis opened in Las Vegas, selling out a 2,000 \nseat showroom, 2 shows a night, for 4 weeks straight.\n  He became the most successful performer in Las Vegas history, \nsurpassing Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, or Barbra Streisand.\n  In 1973 Elvis performed the now legendary ``Aloha from Hawaii, via \nSatellite.'' The concert was beamed worldwide, attracting the largest \ntelevision audience to date, estimated at 1.5 billion viewers.\n  Elvis was only 36 when he received the prestigious Recording \nAcademy's Lifetime Achievement Award.\n  In 2004, the Recording Industry Association officially certified \nElvis Presley as the No. 1 solo artist in U.S. history.\n  Elvis was, and remains, a genuine cultural force. Millions of fans \nfrom around the world have traveled to Graceland to feel a little \ncloser to this American icon. And his music continues to course through \nAmerican life.\n  Bruce Springsteen once said, ``There have been a lotta tough guys. \nThere have been pretenders. And there have contenders. But there is \nonly one King.''\n  And there's only one Graceland that preserves the King's memory.\n  I commend my colleagues for recognizing this singular cultural \nlandmark.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/03/27/senate-section/article/S2426-1", "month": "03", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2426]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       CONGRESSIONAL GOLD MEDAL ON BEHALF OF THE TUSKEGEE AIRMEN\n\n  Mr. FRIST.
