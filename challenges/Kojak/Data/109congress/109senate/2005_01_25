We will remain in session until \nthat debate is used or yielded back over the course of the afternoon or \ninto the evening.\n  Tomorrow morning, for the information of our colleagues, the consent \nagreement allows for 40 minutes of closing remarks, and I now ask \nunanimous consent that the time, 60 minutes, be equally divided prior \nto the vote on the nomination.

I expect that tomorrow morning we would begin that final \ndebate on the Rice nomination immediately upon convening. I will be \ntalking with the Democratic leadership, but I would like to convene and \ngo straight to that debate.\n  I would also add that the Nicholson nomination for Secretary of \nVeterans Affairs was reported yesterday. We will be asking for a short \ntime agreement on that nomination. As I mentioned yesterday, as the \nnominations do come from committee, we do want to consider them as soon \nas possible on the floor of the Senate.\n  Lastly, I remind my colleagues there will be additional nominations \nthis week, and although this week will be a shorter week--we will be in \nsession today and tomorrow--we will be seeking agreements over the \ncourse of this afternoon and tomorrow to proceed on these other \nnominations.\n  Mr. President I have a brief opening statement, but I would like to \nturn to the assistant Democratic leader.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/01/25/senate-section/article/S373-7", "month": "01", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S373]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ORDER OF PROCEDURE\n\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Mr. President, when Soviet troops reached Auschwitz in \nJanuary 1945, they found only a few thousand thin, frail, emaciated \nsurvivors. SS soldiers, determined to carry out the final solution, had \nforced most of the surviving prisoners on a long death march into the \nheart of the Reich.\n  As they retreated, the German forces destroyed most of the warehouses \nand many of the documents at Auschwitz. But what they left stunned even \nthe battle-hardened Soviet troops. One soldier describes the camp's \ninmates as ``skin and bones [who] could hardly stand on their feet.''\n  Soviet troops discovered hundreds of men's suits, more than 800,000 \nwomen's outfits, and more than 14,000 pounds of human hair.\n  One survivor recalls:\n\n       What was Auschwitz? It was hell. Hell. A death factory. If \n     you weren't gassed, you were exhausted to death. If you \n     weren't exhausted to death, you starved. If you didn't \n     starve, you died of disease.\n\n\n[[Page S374]]\n\n\n  It was at Auschwitz that Joseph Mengele performed his horrific \nexperiments, injecting the hearts of live children with chloroform and \nperforming all sorts of bizarre and vile surgeries on twins and \npregnant women.\n  It was at Auschwitz that the Nazi killing machine first discovered \nand perfected the use of Zyklon-B to gas their innocent captives by the \nhundreds every day.\n  It was at Auschwitz that doomed prisoners, trapped inside the gas \nchambers with only a few choking minutes left to live, found the \nstrength to scratch into the walls the words: Never forget.\n\n  This week, on January 27, the world will commemorate the 60th \nanniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz and the 1.5 million victims, \nmost of them Jewish, who perished in the death machine's fires.\n  Vice President Dick Cheney is leading an American delegation to stand \nalongside the 2,000 survivors, as well as surviving Red Army soldiers. \nHe will be joined by Lynne, his wife, numerous world leaders, and by \nthe Nobel Peace Prize Laureate Elie Wiesel.\n  It will be a time for reflection, a time for remembrance but also for \ndetermination--determination that mankind will never again stand by as \ninnocents perish in the monstrous designs of tyrants and despots.\n  It will be a time to recommit ourselves to the battle against \nintolerance, against fanaticism and hatred, all of which can so easily \npoison the hearts of the most seemingly civilized men and women.\n  As Kofi Annan declared yesterday during the United Nations General \nAssembly first ever recognition of the Holocaust:\n\n       The evil that destroyed 6 million Jews and others in those \n     camps is one that still threatens all of us today.\n\n  Indeed, if you think of areas around the world, you think of the \nDarfur region today in western Sudan. To the innocents who perished, to \nthose who survived and to the victims of genocide who now cry out, \nAmerica's leaders hear your plea. We will never forget, and we will not \nstand by.\n  Auschwitz taught us that the war against tyranny is more than a war \nof territory, more than a war of geographic boundaries. It is a war \nagainst evil itself. As Justice Robert Jackson solemnly inveighed to \nthe world at the start of the Nuremberg trials:\n\n       The wrongs which we seek to condemn and punish have been so \n     calculated, so malignant, so devastating that civilization \n     cannot tolerate their being ignored, because it cannot \n     survive their being repeated.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/01/25/senate-section/article/S374-1", "month": "01", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S374]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     NOMINATION OF CONDOLEEZZA RICE\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, over the course of today, we will be \nconsidering the nomination of Condoleezza Rice to be Secretary of \nState. I want to be the first on this floor and on this day to honor \nCondoleezza Rice with our expression of strong support. She is an \noutstanding choice, and the American people are fortunate to have a \npublic servant of her talent and her intellect.\n  During her tenure as National Security Adviser, Dr. Rice has been a \nsteady and trusted adviser, a confidante of the President of the United \nStates. In a role of crafting policy and helping guide decisionmaking, \nshe has demonstrated extraordinary skill. But this should come as no \nsurprise. Dr. Rice is a woman of remarkable accomplishments. Throughout \nher life, she has applied her razor-sharp mind and her steely \ndetermination to reach the highest peaks of achievement. And it started \nearly.\n  Dr. Rice was born in Birmingham in 1954. By the age of 3, she was \nalready a piano prodigy, playing hymnals for her family. By age 5, she \nwas playing right alongside her mother on the church organ bench. At \n19, Condoleezza Rice earned her bachelor degree in political science \ncum laude, Phi Beta Kappa from the University of Denver, and just a \nyear later her master's from Notre Dame. At the young age of 26, having \nearned her Ph.D., Dr. Rice became an assistant professor at Stanford \nUniversity. A decade later, Dr. Rice was elevated to the post of \nprovost, which at Stanford and most universities is the equivalent of \nthe chief operating officer of the university.\n  From 1989 to 1991, Dr. Rice served the first Bush administration as \nDirector and then as Senior Director of Soviet and East European \nAffairs at the National Security Council. During this time, Dr. Rice \nbrought her considerable expertise in Eastern European affairs to the \nadministration's handling of the collapse of the Berlin Wall, Germany's \nreunification, and the transition of the Soviet Union to the Russian \nFederation. This, combined with her years of foreign policy experience, \nparticularly in the post-9/11 context, makes her distinctly qualified \nto lead the Department of State.\n  We are a nation at war. As Secretary of State, Dr. Rice will be a key \nplayer in winning this war. She will have the responsibility of \nadvancing democracy and freedom across the globe, not only to protect \nus from attack but to fulfill America's unique moral purpose. Outlaw \nregimes must be confronted. Dangerous weapons of proliferation must be \nstopped. Terrorist organizations must be destroyed. Dr. Rice has both \nthe ability and the experience, from fighting the Cold War through \nfighting this war on terror, to meet these daunting challenges.\n  Dr. Rice possesses a rare combination of management and \nadministrative experience, of public policy expertise, of high academic \nachievement and, not least importantly, a graciousness that will serve \nAmerica's interests well in these difficult and challenging times. \nAmerica needs a leader of her caliber.\n  Dr. Rice has said that while growing up, her dad John and her mother \nAngelena taught her that in a country where racial segregation and Jim \nCrow were an ugly fact of life, she had to be twice as good to get \nahead. I think it is fair to say she has surpassed this high charge.\n  Dr. Rice is an author, a classically trained pianist, an ice skater, \nand tennis player. She speaks Russian fluently and is an avid fan of \nfootball. In fact, we are grateful she has set aside at least for the \nmoment her ambition to become commissioner of the National Football \nLeague.\n  A woman of deep faith in God, liberty, and freedom, Condoleezza Rice \nwill protect and serve our national interests. I should also note Dr. \nRice would be the first African-American woman to serve as Secretary of \nState. I urge the Senate to give Dr. Rice their strong support. I hope \nand expect to see her confirmed swiftly so she can begin addressing the \nurgent threats and challenges that face our Nation.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/01/25/senate-section/article/S374-2", "month": "01", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S374]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Vitter).

Mr. President, I thank the majority leader for his very \nstrong support of President Bush's nominee, Dr. Condoleezza Rice. I \nlike to think of her as a Coloradan. In Colorado, we are extremely \nproud of her record.\n  I rise today in strong support of President Bush's nominee for \nSecretary of State, Dr. Condoleezza Rice. I ask my colleagues to join \nme in approving this nominee so that she can assist President Bush in \nmaking his version of a more secure, democratic, and prosperous world \nfor the benefit of the American people and the international community \na reality.\n  As many already know, Dr. Rice was born and raised in Alabama. In \n1969, her father moved their family to Colorado to take an academic \nposition at the University of Denver. Dr. Rice soon enrolled in \nDenver's St. Mary's Academy, an independent Catholic school and the \nfirst integrated school she attended. After high school, she earned her \nbachelor's degree in political science, cum laude and Phi Beta Kappa, \nfrom the University of Denver in 1974 and returned a few years later to \nget her Ph.D. from the Graduate School of International Studies at the \nUniversity of Denver in 1981.\n  Dr. Rice may have only spent a few years in Colorado but we in \nColorado are certainly proud of what she has accomplished and like to \nconsider her a daughter of the Centennial State.\n\n[[Page S375]]\n\n  Clearly, Condoleezza Rice is eminently qualified for the post of \nSecretary of State. I know many of my colleagues are aware of her years \nat Stanford University, including her service as provost. In addition, \nshe served on the National Security Council during George H. W. Bush's \nadministration as Director of Soviet and Eastern European Affairs, \nwhich witnessed the fall of the Berlin Wall. She has come full circle \nsince then and again served on the National Security Council but this \ntime as the national security adviser to our current President and has \ndone a magnificent job during very turbulent times.\n  Since then, Dr. Rice has consistently provided the President with \nsound advice on national security and foreign policy. She has been \nbalanced, fair, and determined to ensure that President Bush received \nthe best possible advice.\n  Some have questioned Dr. Rice's role as national security adviser and \nhow she shaped the Bush administration's policies since the tragedy of \nSeptember 11, 2001--specifically, our action against the Saddam Hussein \nregime. I believe she was instrumental in encouraging the President to \nutilize every diplomatic approach possible. We should not forget that \nPresident Bush went to the United Nations, secured a Security Council \nresolution demanding disarmament, and worked with our closest allies to \nensure that Saddam Hussein complied with his obligations. The President \nalso sought authorization from this Congress, which over three-quarters \nof this body supported. Unfortunately, Saddam Hussein would not keep \nhis end of the bargain and we were left with no choice but military \naction. I am thankful during this turbulent period that Dr. Rice \nensured the President received advice from multiple viewpoints so he \ncould make the bold decisions necessary for our security.\n  The Hussein regime is now out of power. The former dictator and \nkiller of thousands is sitting in prison and the first democratic \nelections in Iraq are about to take place. Our Nation is more secure \nbecause a dangerous regime, with a history of aggression and links to \nterrorist organizations, is no longer in power.\n  Today, America has demonstrated its resolve in the global war on \nterror. American troops and their coalition allies have achieved this \nhistoric effort thanks to their sacrifice.\n  As democracy in Iraq succeeds, a message will be sent forth that \nfreedom can be the future of every nation and that freedom improves the \npeace and security of the United States.\n  I am certain Dr. Rice will present this powerful message abroad with \nskill and determination. Just as importantly, Dr. Rice understands that \nsuccessfully fighting the war on terror is not solely a military task. \nDr. Rice will seek to use our powerful diplomatic leverage to better \nprotect our Nation. She will also guide our Nation's diplomatic efforts \nto solve regional and civil conflicts in the Middle East, between \nIsrael and its Arab neighbors, in Sudan, Congo, and Liberia, in the \nBalkans, in Cyprus, in Haiti, in Northern Ireland, and elsewhere. Her \nleadership in the important multilateral discussions with the North \nKoreans on their pursuit for weapons of mass destruction will be \npivotal.\n  There are also other challenges which Dr. Rice must tackle with our \nsocial and economic development programs that the State Department \nmanages. The promotion of free trade and investment worldwide, the \nfight against HIV/AIDS, and the implementation of the Millennium \nChallenge Account are but a few ways we can seek to provide our friends \nand allies around the globe with much needed stability and vitality.\n  When the President announced his intention to nominate Dr. Rice to be \nSecretary of State, he spoke of relying on her counsel, benefiting from \nher experience, and appreciating her sound and steady judgment. I am \npleased that the President has sought to replace our current Secretary \nof State, Colin Powell, with another so well equipped for the \nchallenges that lie ahead.\n  I would be remiss if I did not thank Secretary Powell for his service \nto our great Nation. He has given so much of himself while serving \nduring his long and distinguished military career before finally \nleading the Department of State. These two Americans are two of our \nbest. We are privileged that while Secretary Powell steps down to \npursue new challenges, the United States has someone of Dr. Rice's \ncredentials to continue to carry the torch of liberty abroad.\n  I urge my colleagues to confirm Condoleezza Rice as our 66th \nSecretary of State.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/01/25/senate-section/article/S375-1", "month": "01", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S375-S376]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          SIXTIETH ANNIVERSARY OF THE LIBERATION OF AUSCHWITZ\n\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, historians Will and Ariel Durant have \ntold us, ``The present is the past rolled up for action and the past is \nthe present unrolled for understanding.'' In our search for \nunderstanding and guidance for our actions, we are pausing today to \ncommemorate one of the darkest moments of modern history, the Nazi \nHolocaust, the effort by the Nazi regime to exterminate the Jewish \npeople. Six million Jews were sent to their death before the end of the \ndeath camps. Sixty years ago today, the Auschwitz death camp was \nliberated, bringing an end to the slaughter of well over 1 million \npeople at that location alone. As unfathomable as that reality is, we \nneed to seek to understand it in order to prevent it. I am not sure if \nwe can ever truly understand it.\n  In some ways it is kind of bizarre, but we need to understand that \nwhile genocide in Germany, Cambodia, Rwanda, and elsewhere may end up \nas a kind of mass insanity in some almost bizarre way, it begins in a \nterribly misplaced idealism.\n  The Khmer Rouge thought that returning Cambodia to its rural \nbeginnings was the way to create a good society. They became so \nconvinced that modernity was destroying their people that they \nattempted to forcibly empty the cities and kill anyone with a \nprofessional degree or anyone who even wore glasses. They even kept \ncareful records of those they killed because they assumed history would \nhonor them for their actions. The Germans kept records, too. It is \ndifficult for me to fathom they would believe that history would honor \nthem for their actions.\n  The situation in Rwanda dates back to the colonial period, when \nEuropean colonial powers favored Tutsis over Hutus. When independence \nwas hastily granted and the Europeans departed, a seesaw of vengeance \nand reprisals began, which escalated unchecked for 30 years. When \nhistoric anger boiled over, with the failure of the international \ncommunity to step in, a terrible period of violence claimed over half a \nmillion people.\n  The fact that genocide could happen in an industrialized, cultured \nnation that had produced Beethoven and Goethe is especially chilling. \nAs we read the various accounts of what was happening in the Third \nReich, it astounds us that people could come to such conclusions. It \nastounds us that so many good people could do nothing, did nothing. \nWhile millions were slaughtered, they turned their backs and shut their \neyes.\n  Auschwitz was not conceived as a death camp. It was part of Hitler's \nand Albert Speer's master plans for bold new Nazi ``Cities of the \nEast'' that would express their vision for society. Such projects \nrequired slave labor for which Jews and others were likely candidates. \nThe rise of democratic socialism in Germany was in part a reaction to \ntheir hatred of communism in the Soviet Union. So they had a strategy \nto empty the lands of Poland and Russia for resettlement by an expanded \nGermany. Such was their grandiosity that human beings became objects to \nbe used for their plans and obstacles to be destroyed. They dehumanized \nthe Jewish people.\n  The lessons of these three examples is: Hatred combined with any \nnumber of other circumstances can explode into genocide. Even as the \nsituations in Darfur and elsewhere continue, we would be naive and \nfoolish to believe that mankind has ``learned its lesson.''\n\n[[Page S376]]\n\nFirst, we need to go on the moral offensive whenever hatred arises. \nThat is why I have risen on the floor several times to decry the growth \nof antisemitism in Europe. Even on American college campuses, \nantisemitism is raising its ugly head today. We need to speak out. We \nneed to put a cork in the bottle. We need to make sure it does not \nspread.\n  Second, I think we need to understand that with American power comes \nresponsibility. In concert with our allies in the U.N., we must be \nprepared to intervene when we can to prevent bad situations from going \nover the abyss into genocide. Diplomacy is by its nature slow and \ncautious while situations such as these are fast moving and can \ndegenerate overnight. We need to find ways to respond quickly. The \nhistory of the quick action of the British in 1941 to stop the Farhud, \na genocidal program against Iraqi Jews, is an event deserving more \nattention and more study.\n  There is one other reason for us to focus on these monstrously evil \nevents. They provide stirring examples of the nobility and resiliency \nof human beings as well: The story of ``Schindler's List'', the \ncompassionate soldiers who liberated the concentration camps. Soviet \ntroops liberated Auschwitz on January 27, 1945, and were able to save \nabout 7,000 prisoners from certain death. The stories of surviving \nprisoners themselves are remarkable. Those who managed to maintain \ntheir humanity in the most inhumane of circumstances inspired us all.\n  Victor Frankl offered this recollection:\n\n       We who lived in concentration camps can remember the men \n     who walked through the huts comforting others, giving away \n     their last piece of bread. They may have been few in number, \n     but they offer sufficient proof that everything can be taken \n     from a man but one thing: the last of the human freedoms--to \n     choose one's attitude in any given set of circumstances, to \n     choose one's own way.\n\n  Frankl also wrote:\n\n       A thought transfixed me: for the first time in my life I \n     saw the truth as it is set into song by so many poets, \n     proclaimed as the final truth by so many thinkers. The truth \n     that love is the ultimate and highest goal to which man can \n     aspire. Then I grasped the meaning of the greatest secret \n     that human poetry and human thought and belief have to \n     impart: The salvation of man is through love and in love.\n\n  The Holocaust and similar events discourage us with the realization \nof the extent of evil of which people are capable, and we must guard \nagainst it vigilantly. But they also display the highest and best human \nbeings can rise to, which gives us courage and hope.\n  We will never, ever forget man's inhumanity to man in the Holocaust. \nWe reflect on the liberation of Auschwitz, so we assure that we never \nforget. But at the same time we have a sense of courage and hope that \nin the worst of circumstances man can still turn to love and to faith \nand to salvation.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, as most of today's program will be based \non Condoleezza Rice and her appointment to be Secretary of State, I \nrise to make some comments to show my admiration for Ms. Rice and my \nsupport for her to serve in this task. I certainly cannot think of a \nbetter candidate. I rise to offer my strong support for Dr. Rice \nbecause I believe she not only brings a remarkable record of public \nservice and academic credentials to this position, but also great \nexperience and integrity in troubled times, times of war.\n  I find it troublesome that we are here today, unfortunately, not so \nmuch to debate the qualifications of Dr. Rice, even though they are \ncertainly impressive and she is equal to the task. Instead, to some \nextent we have chosen to return, at this time, to the honored position \nof trying to score political points by distorting the record of the \nPresident's decision to use force in Iraq. The ongoing operations in \nboth Iraq and Afghanistan are critical components to the global war on \nterrorism, a war with the purpose of fundamentally changing the \nenvironment which has given rise to the power of the extremists in that \npart of the world. It remains an aggressive effort, not only to bring \nto justice the perpetrators of 9/11 but also the nations that aid and \nsupport them.\n  There has been a great deal of discussion, of course, with Dr. Rice \nabout the facts that brought us into Iraq. The fact is, at that time \neveryone involved--whether it was the United States, whether it was \nBritain, whether it was the CIA--had this view of what the world was \nand that is what it was based on. Some of those views turned out not to \nbe correct, but at the time that was the information we had.\n  So I certainly hope we can move forward here. I agree, everyone \nshould have a right to say what they choose with regard to these \nnominations. On the other hand, they ought to be here for the purpose \nof examining those persons for that task, and not talking about the \npolitics of all the surrounding issues.\n  I also have to say I am not at all surprised that someone nominated \nto serving on the Cabinet would be supportive of the President. If you \nwere President, would you appoint people who disagreed with you and \nwould not be with you, who would not support your positions? Of course \nnot. So that is where we are.\n  At any rate, I support the decision to use force, supporting the \naction in Iraq today. We have to finish our work there. I think we are \noffering freedom and hope to the people of these poor and oppressed \ncountries. The best way is to neutralize the effect of fanatical Islam. \nWe continue to make progress with other nations, and that is great.\n  Dr. Rice has performed admirably in her role as National Security \nAdviser and will continue to serve the country well as Secretary of \nState. I urge my colleagues to join me in support of this nomination \ntoday and move it on down the line.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/01/25/senate-section/article/S376-2", "month": "01", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S376-S377]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        ISSUES FACING THE SENATE\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I also wish to take a few minutes, as \nothers have, to talk about some of the issues that will be before us. \nWe have a great opportunity now to move forward on these issues, many \nof which we have discussed in the last session. Many are ready to be \nacted upon, and I hope we can do that.\n  We need to talk about taxes and simplifying taxes. We need to talk \nabout ensuring that we have the tax support there to create jobs and \nstrengthen the economy. We seem to be moving in the right direction. I \nthink the tax reductions have proven themselves to be useful, but many \nof them, particularly on taxes such as the estate tax, unless that is \nmade permanent so people can have confidence in their investments, they \nreally do not fully do what we hoped they would do.\n  We need to continue to work to keep America safe; security is \nprobably our top priority. We have made a considerable amount of change \nin that area. We need to continue to evaluate that, of course, and \nensure that we have the best.\n  I hope we can come back to deal with the issue of energy--clean, \neconomic energy. That is, again, one of the basic issues in creating \njobs, in growing an economy, and one that we have worked on now for \nseveral years.\n  We had a long meeting yesterday. We had a series of meetings to talk \nabout the need for conservation, to talk about the need for efficiency. \nWe talked about the need for alternative sources of energy--renewable \nenergy as well as domestic production. Those things are so important. \nYet, somehow, we have not been able to move forward. I cannot think of \nanything that is more important to us than to have a policy with \nrespect to the future, to be able to look into the future with regard \nto energy.\n  I suspect most of my friends here would agree that as they go home \nand meet with people, one of the issues that is most often talked about \nis the cost of health care. It is a tough issue. I think we have a good \nhealth care system, probably the best in the world, but we are getting \nto the point where access to that system is being limited by the cost. \nI am not just talking about Medicare or Medicaid; I am talking about \nhealth care generally. I am talking about families on the ranch,\n\n[[Page S377]]\n\nfor example, when they have to pay for their own and it costs $15,000 a \nyear for insurance. I am talking about the things we might do to give \nmore tax-free savings accounts so these insurance policies can be more \nfor coverage of catastrophic events and be less expensive and we can \nhave more ownership in them. Those are the kinds of things we need to \ntake a look at.\n  We need to promote agriculture in our trade programs that will be \ncoming up. Agriculture is a very difficult issue with respect to \nforeign trade, but it is very important.\n  I spent some time in Argentina at the global warming meeting and I \ngot some insight as to what is happening in Brazil and Argentina in \nterms of livestock production, and it is going to be enormous. We have \nto be prepared.\n  Obviously, we will be talking about changes in Social Security. We \nwill be meeting with the President today, with the Finance Committee, \nto get better ideas of what the details are, but clearly we need to do \nsomething there.\n  The highway bill--we have gone several years without the highway bill \nwe passed some time ago. Can you think of anything more important in \nour communities than to maintain and develop new highways and keep them \nup? We have not done that, and we need to do it.\n\n  Tort reform--whether it is broad, whether it is class action suits, \nwhether it is malpractice in health care--these are issues we need to \naccomplish. We talk about them, we argue about them, and then we walk \naway from them. It seems to me there are a number of those issues where \nwe ought to just buckle down and come to the snugging post and do some \nthings that need to be done.\n  Spending? I don't think any of us deny that we need to do something \nabout spending. We need to do something about the deficit that we have \ncreated--that we have created. We need to do some things there.\n  I think we have some real opportunities to do some more than we have \nin the past. We have a chance to move forward.\n  Class action is apparently going to be out here soon. Clearly, there \nare some changes that need to be made. The whole tort reform area is \ndifficult. Nevertheless, we ought to be able to do that.\n  Those are the things I hope we can take a long look at. I know we all \nhave some different ideas about what the priorities ought to be. But it \nis pretty clear some of these things need to be handled. There are \ndifferent views about how they need to be handled, but something needs \nto be done about them, and it is our responsibility to do that. We can \nfuss and have disagreements and walk off the floor and all that sort of \nthing, but the fact is, it is our responsibility to do things. It is \nour opportunity to do them now. I look forward to a productive session. \nI hope we can get started very soon.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise according to the order to speak \nas in morning business, but I will be addressing my remarks to the \nnomination of Dr. Rice to be Secretary of State.\n  First, in supporting Dr. Rice's nomination, I wish to set this in \ncontext. President Bush was reelected last November. He took the oath \nof office last Thursday and swore to protect and defend the \nConstitution of the United States. The Constitution and the laws give \nhim the authority to nominate people who he wants to take leadership \npositions in his administration.\n  We, now, have our constitutional responsibility in the Senate of the \nUnited States to advise and consent. But I have always believed that \nour responsibility to advise and consent does not mean we have to agree \nwith every opinion or every action the nominee has ever taken, but that \nnominee deserves the benefit of the doubt and our responsibility is to \ndetermine whether the nominee is fit for the position for which the \nPresident has nominated him or her, and whether the nominee, in our \njudgment, will serve in the national interest. Of course, I conclude \nthat Dr. Condoleezza Rice met that standard at least and much more.\n\n  Second, this element of the context in which this nomination is put \nbefore us. We are at war. It is a war unlike any we have ever fought \nbefore. Here I speak of the world war with Islamic terrorism. It is \njoined on battlefields in places like Iraq, of course, but it is being \nfought in the shadows and corners against an enemy that is driven by \nfanaticism and acts without regard to human life--others or their own.\n  I embrace the best tradition of American foreign policy that says and \nalways has said that partisanship should end at the Nation's shores. \nNote this: It doesn't say policy differences should end; it doesn't say \nideological differences should end; it says partisanship should end at \nthe Nation's shores, particularly so when our Nation is engaged in war, \na global war on terrorism, a war in Iraq in which Americans have lost \ntheir lives in the cause of freedom and in protection of our security.\n  What I wish to say here is that the nomination of Secretary of State \nin a second term of a President naturally is an opportunity, \nappropriately, for people to raise questions about the foreign policy \nof that administration. But in the final analysis, I hope it is also an \nopportunity around this very qualified nominee for us to come together \nand say to one another and to the world, both our enemy and our allies, \nthat in the final analysis Americans will stand shoulder to shoulder \nagainst terrorism, against the enemy in pursuit of the freedom and \nliberty and opportunity that Dr. Rice spoke about in her opening \nstatement before the Foreign Relations Committee and that President \nBush spoke about in his inaugural address last week.\n  One of the great strengths which Condoleezza Rice will bring to the \noffice of Secretary of State is that the world knows she has the \nPresident's trust and confidence. I respect the right of any of my \ncolleagues, of course, to reach a different decision today and to \noppose this nomination, but I hope and believe that the Senate today \nacross partisan lines will resoundingly endorse this nomination and \nsend the message to friend and foe alike that while we have our \ndisagreements, ultimately what unites us around this very qualified \nnominee in this hour of war is much greater than that which divides us. \nIn times like these, it is important that the world not only know that \nthis Secretary of State has the ear of the President, but that she has, \nif you will allow me to put it this way, America's heart--a heart that \nbeats with the freedom and security and opportunity that we dream of \nfor our own people and for the people of the world.\n  In the world today, we face a time of grave peril but also great \npromise. It is in many ways, it seems to me, like the time our \npredecessors faced after the Second World War at the outbreak of the \nCold War. As then, now it is a hostile ideology which threatens freedom \naround the world as terrorism has replaced communism as liberty's \nforemost foe. Now, as then, it is the United States that must show \nleadership and resolve as the world's strongest nation in the face of \nthis danger from terrorism to life and liberty--not just ourselves but \neveryone who does not exactly agree with the terrorists. Now, as then, \nthe President and Members of Congress must depend on the advice and \ncounsel of the Secretary of State as we craft the policies with \nan unblinking resolve that will rally our friends and rattle our \nenemies, that will diminish--we pray, eliminate--the perils we face and \nrealize the extraordinary promises of our time.\n\n  The very first Secretary of State, Thomas Jefferson, once wrote:\n\n       We confide in our strength without boasting of it. We \n     respect that of others without fearing it.\n\n  Jefferson's 18th century insights will serve us well in the face of \nthe 21st century threats we confront. I know Dr. Rice understands and \nappreciates that well.\n  Economic development and trade and foreign direction investment and \nthe spread of modern technology and telecommunications have raised the \nstandard of living throughout the world and connected people of the \nworld as never before. But too many nations and people have been left \nbehind because of failed governments or failed economies. They have \nbecome breeding\n\n[[Page S378]]\n\ngrounds for terrorists who threaten us all.\n  Today, there is hope. Members of democracy are beginning to glow \nwhere that powerful light has existed little or none before. The \nAfghans and the Palestinians have recently held successful elections. \nThis Sunday, Iraq will hold a historic democratic election. I know the \ncircumstances are difficult there, but having been there myself just a \nfew weeks ago I can speak with some confidence that the turnout will be \nlarge and the affirmation of the Iraqi people for a better and freer \nfuture will be clear.\n  Whether these embers grow into beacons for the rest of the Arab world \nor fade into dark and cold will depend uniquely upon strong, skillful \nAmerican leadership and diplomacy. I conclude that Dr. Condoleezza Rice \nis capable of such leadership.\n  Nuclear proliferation threatens the world as Iran and North Korea and \nothers strive to develop deadly weapons which will make the arms race \nof the Cold War look sane in comparison. In response to these dangers, \nPresident Bush in his inaugural address and Dr. Rice in her testimony \nbefore the Senate Foreign Relations Committee last week have set down \nsome basic principles which will guide our foreign and defense policy. \nThey are based on values and hopes that have defined America: freedom, \nopportunity, faith, and community.\n  Let me read a paragraph of Dr. Rice's opening statement before the \nForeign Relations Committee last Tuesday:\n\n       In these momentous times, American diplomacy has three \n     great tasks.\n       First, we will unite the community of democracies in \n     building an international system that is based on our shared \n     values and the rule of law.\n       Second, we will strengthen the community of democracies to \n     fight the threats to our common security and alleviate the \n     hopelessness that feeds terror.\n       Third, we will spread freedom and democracy throughout the \n     globe. That is the mission that the President has set for \n     America in the world--and a great mission of American \n     diplomacy today.\n\n  Let me read a few words from President Bush's inaugural last \nThursday:\n\n       We are led by events and common sense to one conclusion. \n     The survival of liberty in our land increasingly depends on \n     the success of liberty in other lands. The best hope for \n     peace in our world is the expansion of freedom in all the \n     world. This is not primarily the task of arms, though we \n     will defend ourselves and our friends by force of arms \n     when necessary. Freedom by its nature must be chosen and \n     defended by citizens and sustained by the rule of law and \n     the protection of minorities. Democratic reformers facing \n     oppression, prison or exile can know America sees you for \n     who you are--future leaders of your free country. The \n     rulers of outlaw regimes can know that we still believe, \n     as Abraham Lincoln did, that those who deny freedom to \n     others deserve it not for themselves, and under the rule \n     of a just God cannot long retain it.\n\n  These principles and policies are neither Republican nor Democratic; \nthey are American. In fact, the words spoken by President Bush last \nThursday could just as easily have been spoken by some of the great \nDemocratic Presidents such as Woodrow Wilson, Franklin Roosevelt, Harry \nTruman, and John F. Kennedy. In fact, similar words were spoken by each \nof those Democratic Presidents at times of crisis--times of crisis \nsimilar in many ways to our own.\n  I hope, therefore, that we will now come together to implement those \nprinciples and policies in a way that will spread hope and security and \nbuild bridges throughout the world, that the President will reach out \nto Members of both parties in Congress, and we in turn will reach out \nhalfway at least and meet him to implement these stirring, uniquely \nAmerican goals and policies and principles with real programs that are \neffective public diplomacy and outreach of economic development of \ntrade, of rule of law, of ultimately, most importantly, the spread of \nfreedom and democracy. I conclude that Dr. Condoleezza Rice is uniquely \nprepared by ability and experience to lead this effort as Secretary of \nState.\n  I want to say a final word about Dr. Rice herself, whom I have come \nto know over the years.\n  President Bush has clearly nominated Dr. Rice to be Secretary of \nState because he values her experience, he knows her skill, and he \ntrusts her counsel. No one believes this President chose this nominee \nfor Secretary of State for reasons of gender or race. No one here will \nvote for her in this Senate for reasons of gender or race. But the fact \nis that Dr. Condoleezza Rice is an African-American woman. I believe, \nin addition to every other standard by which we judge and respond to \nthis nomination, we should celebrate the fact that when she is \nconfirmed, another barrier will be broken in American life. We should \ncelebrate this fact because Dr. Rice's life speaks to the promise of \nAmerica, and in very personal terms says to people throughout the world \nwhat America is about and what we hope for them.\n\n  Let us speak directly. Dr. Rice, born in 1954 in the then racially \nsegregated South, knew the sting of bigotry. No one on the day of her \nbirth could have rationally predicted she would grow up to be the \nSecretary of State of the United States of America. But she was blessed \nwith great natural abilities, with a strong family, with an abiding \nfaith in God. She worked hard, as others worked in her time, to break \nthe barriers of segregation to establish the rule of law to create \nopportunities. She has earned the nomination the President has given \nher.\n  Just as no one in Birmingham, when this African-American girl was \nborn in 1954, could have dreamed she would grow up to be Secretary of \nState of the most powerful country in the world, there are babies being \nborn today in Baghdad and Ramallah and Kabul and Riyadh and in \ncountries and cities throughout the world where no one could dream they \nmight grow up to be President of their nation or Prime Minister or \nForeign Minister or president of a high-tech enterprise or a professor \nat a great university. They will if we, working with the people of \ntheir countries, will it.\n  A great man once said if you will it, it is no dream. In this hour \nwhen our security is being threatened, the promise of opportunity can, \nin response to the source of those threats, become real for tens of \nmillions of children being born and growing up in places today where \nthere is no freedom and no hope. That is the great mission our country \nhas today. Dr. Rice understands that. Her life, as I said, speaks to \nbrave men and women of color who, like Dr. Rice, have worked to change \nour Nation. Now she can, and I believe will, help lead our Nation to \nchange the world, and in doing so enhance our values and protect our \nsecurity for our children and grandchildren, as well.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the nomination of Dr. Condoleezza \nRice to be Secretary of State.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I thank the Chair. I yield myself as much time as I may \nrequire of the time on our side.\n  Mr. President, I have the pleasure and honor today of speaking in \nsupport of the nomination of Dr. Condoleezza Rice to be our Secretary \nof State.\n  As a result of her distinguished career as National Security Adviser \nto\n\n[[Page S379]]\n\nPresident Bush and her earlier assignment on the NSC, she is well known \nto most Members of the Senate. I admire her accomplishments, and I am \nparticularly thankful for the cooperation she has provided to the \nSenate Foreign Relations Committee and to me personally.\n  The enormously complex job before Dr. Rice will require all of her \ntalents and experience. American credibility in the world, the progress \nin the war on terrorism, and our relationships with our allies will be \ngreatly affected by the Secretary of State's actions and the \neffectiveness of the State Department in the coming years. Dr. Rice is \nhighly qualified to meet those challenges. We recognize the deep \npersonal commitment necessary to undertake this difficult assignment, \nand we are grateful that a leader of her stature is willing to step \nforward.\n  I had the good fortune to get to know Dr. Rice before she assumed the \npost of National Security Adviser to President Bush. Before President \nGeorge W. Bush was elected, I enjoyed visits with Dr. Rice when we both \nattended Stanford University meetings on foreign policy hosted by \nformer Secretary of State George Shultz. Secretary Shultz, a close \nfriend of many of us in the Senate, was a very early supporter of the \nthen-Governor Bush of Texas. He recognized Dr. Rice's prodigious \ntalents and encouraged her leadership within the Bush foreign policy \nteam. At the Stanford University meetings, Dr. Rice's analytical \nbrilliance and broad knowledge of world affairs were evident. During \nthe campaign for the Presidency of George Bush, she established a \ntrusted relationship with then-Governor Bush that has carried through \nin her work as National Security Adviser to President Bush.\n  Last week, the Committee on Foreign Relations held exhaustive \nhearings on this nomination. Dr. Rice fielded questions on every \nimaginable subject for more than 10\\1/2\\ hours over 2 days. All 18 \nmembers of our committee took advantage of the opportunity to ask Dr. \nRice questions. At the hearings, she responded to 199 questions, 129 \nfrom Democrats and 70 from Republicans. In addition, in advance of the \nhearings, members of the committee submitted 191 additional detailed \nquestions for the record to Dr. Rice. Members received answers to each \nof those questions. Thus, Dr. Rice responded to a total of 390 \nquestions from Senators.\n\n  In American history, few Cabinet members have provided as much \ninformation or answered as many questions as Dr. Rice answered during \nthe confirmation process. She demonstrated that her understanding of \nU.S. foreign policy is comprehensive and insightful.\n  Our hearings served not only as an examination of Dr. Rice's \nsubstantial qualifications but also as a fundamental debate on the \ndirection of American foreign policy. I believe this debate was useful \nto the Senate and to the American people. Having the opportunity to \nquestion a Secretary of State nominee is a key aspect of congressional \noversight of any administration's foreign policy. Dr. Rice \nenthusiastically embraced this function of the hearing, and at many \npoints she engaged in theoretical exchanges on national security \nchoices.\n  Dr. Rice emphasized that support for freedom, democracy, and the rule \nof law would be at the core of U.S. foreign policy during her watch. \nShe said:\n\n       In these momentous times, American diplomacy has three \n     great tasks. First, we will unite the community of \n     democracies in building an international system that is based \n     on our shared values and the rule of law. Second, we will \n     strengthen the community of democracies to fight the threats \n     to our common security and alleviate the hopelessness that \n     feeds terror. And third, we will spread freedom and democracy \n     throughout the globe.\n\n  The Secretary of State serves as the President's top foreign policy \nadviser, as our Nation's most visible emissary to the rest of the \nworld, and as manager of one of the most important departments in our \nGovernment. Any one of these jobs would be a challenge for even the \nmost talented public servant, but, as I told Dr. Rice during our \nhearings, the Secretary of State, at this critical time in our history, \nmust excel in all three roles.\n  Since 2001, we have witnessed terrorists killing thousands of people \nin our country and the destruction of the World Trade Center and a part \nof the Pentagon. We have seen U.S. military personnel engaged in two \ndifficult and costly wars. We have seen the expansion of a nihilistic \nform of terrorism that is only loosely attached to political objectives \nand is, therefore, very difficult to deter. We have seen frequent \nexpressions of virulent anti-Americanism in many parts of the Islamic \nworld. We have seen our alliances, our international standing, and our \nFederal budget strained by the hard choices we have to make in response \nto terrorism.\n  In this context, many diplomatic tasks must be approached with \nurgency. In particular, our success in Iraq is critical. The elections \nscheduled for January 30 must go forward, and the United States must \nwork closely with Iraqi authorities to achieve the fairest and the most \ncomplete outcome. At the same time, we must understand that those \nforces that want to keep Iraq in chaos will commit violence and \nintimidation. Both Iraqis and the coalition will have to be resilient \nand flexible in the elections' aftermath.\n  The Bush administration and the State Department also must devote \nthemselves to achieving a settlement of the Arab-Israeli conflict; to \ncoming to grips with the nuclear proliferation problems in Iran and \nNorth Korea; to continuing urgent humanitarian efforts in Sudan, the \nIndian Ocean region, and elsewhere; to maintaining our commitment to \nthe global fight against AIDS and other infectious diseases; to \nadvancing democracy in Afghanistan, Ukraine, and elsewhere; to \nrepairing alliances with longstanding friends in Europe; to \nreinvigorating our economic and security relationships in our own \nhemisphere; and to engaging with rapidly changing national powers, \nespecially China, India, and Russia.\n\n  Even though this list of diplomatic priorities is daunting, it is not \nexhaustive, and it does not anticipate unforeseeable events. Just weeks \nago, none of us could have predicted a tragic earthquake and a tsunami \nwould change the face of the Indian Ocean region. Our efforts must \ninclude the expansion of our foreign policy capabilities so we are \nbetter prepared for crises that cannot be averted and better able to \nprevent those that can be.\n  With this in mind, I would observe that Congress must improve its own \nperformance in foreign affairs, particularly in the area of \nlegislation. The enthusiasm for engaging in the details of U.S. foreign \npolicy the Senate demonstrated last week, and will again demonstrate \ntoday, too often has been absent when it is time to perform our \nlegislative duties.\n  Even as Senators have cited shortcomings of administration policy in \nresponding to extraordinarily difficult circumstances in Iraq and \nelsewhere, the Senate has allowed partisan fights and unrelated \ndomestic legislation and disagreements over that legislation during the \nlast Congress to delay the far simpler task of passing the foreign \naffairs authorization bill, for example. Now, this bill includes new \ninitiatives and funding authority related to the security and \nproductivity of our diplomats, our outreach to the Muslim world, our \nnonproliferation efforts, our foreign assistance, and innumerable other \nnational security priorities. Yet politically motivated obstacles were \nthrown in the path of the bill almost cavalierly, as if Congress's duty \nto pass foreign affairs legislation had little connection to our \nsuccess in Iraq or in our war against terrorism.\n  Even as we do our duty to oversee the foreign policy performance of \nthe executive branch, we must take a sober look at our own performance. \nWe must critique ourselves with the same diligence that we have applied \nto the administration. Every Senator should reflect on the troubling \nfact that we have not passed a comprehensive foreign assistance bill \nsince 1985. This means that for 20 years we have depended primarily on \nstopgap measures and bandaids applied during the appropriations process \nto govern one of the major tools of U.S. foreign policy.\n  Only 24 Members of the current Senate body were here the last time we \npassed a comprehensive foreign aid bill. Our single largest foreign \nassistance program, the Millennium Challenge Account, cannot even be \nfound in the core legislation affecting foreign assistance.\n\n[[Page S380]]\n\n  Moreover, many aspects of our foreign assistance law have not been \nupdated since the original Foreign Assistance Act of 1961. Forty-four \nyears ago, when our basic foreign assistance law was written, we were \npreoccupied with the Cold War, terrorism was a rare phenomenon, \nscientists had not identified the HIV/AIDS virus, the illegal trade in \ndrugs was a small fraction of what it is today, dozens of present day \ncountries did not exist, and only one Senator who still sits in this \nbody was present.\n  Congress's most basic responsibility is to write and pass good \nlegislation that provides clear direction to U.S. policy. In the area \nof foreign assistance, however, we are operating under an archaic Rube \nGoldberg contraption that has been patched hundreds of times. Much of \nthe underlying law is irrelevant or redundant. Other parts are \ncontradictory. As a result, the law is a confusing muddle that serves \nneither the interests of U.S. taxpayers nor our national security \ngoals. We are tolerating this legislation of irresponsibility at a time \nof great national vulnerability.\n\n  Congress's failure in this area has more to do with inattention than \nwith disagreement. In both 2003 and 2004, the Senate Foreign Relations \nCommittee passed a foreign affairs authorization bill by a unanimous \nvote. In 2003, we were mere hours away from final Senate passage, when \nthe bill was derailed by unrelated domestic issues.\n  We have not been blocked by intractable policy disagreements but by \nour devaluation of our own legislative role in foreign policy. We need \nto make a bipartisan decision that passing a foreign affairs \nauthorization bill each Congress is as important as passing a defense \nauthorization bill or a homeland security authorization bill. We must \nbe prepared to fulfill our own core national security responsibilities.\n  Dr. Rice indicated her strong support for passage of a comprehensive \nforeign affairs bill. I know we will have a powerful advocate in Dr. \nRice for such action.\n  I would like to emphasize another critical area of national security \npolicy where Dr. Rice's advocacy has been strong, consistent, and \npersuasive. During the Foreign Relations Committee hearings last week, \nI opened the question period with three questions pertaining to the \nNunn-Lugar program and other aspects of our nonproliferation efforts. \nIn each case Dr. Rice expressed the administration's strongest \ncommitment to the programs and to diplomatic objectives in question. \nShe stated:\n\n       I really can think of nothing more important than being \n     able to proceed with the safe dismantlement of the Soviet \n     arsenal, with nuclear safeguards to make certain that nuclear \n     programs facilities and the like are well secured, and then \n     the blending down--as we are doing--of a number of hazardous, \n     potentially lethal materials that could be used to make \n     nuclear weapons, as well as, of course . . . the chemical \n     weapons. . . . It is just an extremely important program that \n     I think you know that we continue to push.\n\n  In fact, the Bush administration has achieved a great deal in the \narea of nonproliferation. Dr. Rice has been a stalwart proponent of a \nrobust Nunn-Lugar program. Chief among these successes is the rarely \nmentioned Global Partnership Against the Spread of Weapons and \nMaterials of Mass Destruction, informally known as ``10 plus 10 over \n10.''\n  Under this agreement, negotiated by the Bush administration, the \nUnited States will spend $10 billion over the next 10 years to \nsafeguard and to dismantle the weapons of mass destruction arsenal of \nthe former Soviet Union. The other members of the G8 agreed \ncollectively to spend another $10 billion over the same time period. \nOur commitment of funds is primarily money that we had planned to spend \nin any event through the Nunn-Lugar program and other associated \nefforts. With this agreement, the President effectively doubled the \nfunds committed to securing weapons of mass destruction in Russia with \nminimal additional obligation to American taxpayers.\n  The Bush administration also has successfully recruited more than 60 \ncountries to join the Proliferation Security Initiative Program that \nhas enhanced our ability to interdict illegal weapons of mass \ndestruction shipments around the world. Through the Energy Department, \nit established the Global Threat Reduction Initiative, which aims to \nsecure high-risk nuclear and radiological materials globally. It has \nfacilitated at several junctures the acceleration of Nunn-Lugar work at \ncritical chemical weapons destruction facilities at Shchuchye in Russia \nthrough personal intervention by the President and by Dr. Rice. It \nfinalized the deal with Libya to lay open that country's weapons of \nmass destruction programs. And it advocated passage of the IAEA \nadditional protocol which greatly expands that international agency's \nability to detect clandestine nuclear activities.\n\n  It secured the passage of U.N. Security Council Resolution 1540 in \nApril 2004, which for the first time declared that weapons of mass \ndestruction proliferation is illegal. It has also provided constant \nencouragement to the promising talks between India and Pakistan that \nrepresent the best chance in years to reduce tensions between these \nnuclear powers.\n  The President supported, through personal communication to \ncongressional leaders, and signed into law the Nunn-Lugar Expansion \nAct, which establishes the authority to use Nunn-Lugar moneys and \nexpertise outside the former Soviet Union.\n  In these cases and others, the President and his administration have \nembraced diplomacy and skillfully employed multilateralists in support \nof important nonproliferation objectives. I believe Dr. Rice's strong \nstatements of support for nonproliferation programs last week \ndemonstrate the Bush administration's continuing commitment to these \nvital objectives.\n  Last November, I introduced two new bills to strengthen U.S. \nnonproliferation efforts, and I will be introducing these bills again \nthis week. They represent the fourth installment of the Nunn-Lugar \nlegislation that I have offered since 1991. In that year, former \nSenator Sam Nunn of Georgia and I authored the Nunn-Lugar Act, which \nestablished the Cooperative Threat Reduction Program. That program has \nprovided U.S. funding and expertise to help the former Soviet Union \nsafeguard and dismantle an enormous stockpile of nuclear, chemical, and \nbiological weapons, the means of delivery, and related materials.\n  In 1997, Senator Nunn and I were joined by Senator Domenici in \nintroducing the Defense Against Weapons of Mass Destruction Act, which \nexpanded Nunn-Lugar authorities in the former Soviet Union and provided \nweapons of mass destruction expertise to first responders in American \ncities.\n  In 2003, Congress adopted the Nunn-Lugar Expansion Act, which \nauthorized the Nunn-Lugar program to operate outside the former Soviet \nUnion to address proliferation threats.\n  The bills I am introducing this week would strengthen the Nunn-Lugar \nprogram and other nonproliferation efforts and provide them with \ngreater flexibility to address emerging threats. To date, the Nunn-\nLugar program has deactivated or destroyed 6,564 nuclear warheads, 568 \nICBMs, 477 ICBM silos, 17 ICBM mobile missile launchers, 142 bombers, \n761 nuclear air-to-surface missiles, 420 submarine missile launchers, \n543 submarine-launched missiles, 28 nuclear submarines, and 194 nuclear \ntest tunnels. The Nunn-Lugar program also facilitated the removal of \nall nuclear weapons from Ukraine, Belarus, and Kazakhstan. And after \nthe fall of the Soviet Union, these three nations emerged as the third, \nfourth, and eighth largest nuclear powers in the world. Today, all \nthree are nuclear weapons free as a result of the cooperative efforts \nunder the Nunn-Lugar program.\n\n  In addition, the program provides the primary tool with which the \nUnited States is working with Russian authorities to identify, to \nsafeguard, and to destroy Russia's massive chemical and biological \nwarfare capacity. Countless individuals of great dedication, serving on \nthe ground in the former Soviet Union and in our Government, have made \nthe Nunn-Lugar program work. Nevertheless, from the beginning we have \nencountered resistance to the concept in both the United States and \nRussia.\n  In our own country opposition has sometimes been motivated by false \nperceptions that Nunn-Lugar money is foreign assistance or by the \nbelief that Defense Department funds should only be spent on troops, \nweapons, or other warfighting capabilities. Until recently, we also \nfaced a general disinterest in nonproliferation which made gaining \nsupport for Nunn-Lugar funding and activities an annual struggle.\n\n[[Page S381]]\n\n  The attacks of September 11 changed the political discourse radically \non that subject. We have turned a corner. The public, the media, and \npolitical candidates are now paying more attention. In a remarkable \nmoment in the first Presidential debate of 2004, both President Bush \nand Senator Kerry agreed that the No. 1 national security threat facing \nthe United States was the prospect that weapons of mass destruction \nwould fall into the hands of terrorists. The 9/11 Commission weighed in \nwith another important endorsement of the Nunn-Lugar program saying \nthat:\n\n       Preventing the proliferation of [weapons of mass \n     destruction] warrants a maximum effort--by strengthening \n     counterproliferation efforts, expanding the Proliferation \n     Security Initiative, and supporting the Cooperative Threat \n     Reduction Program.\n\n  The report went on to say that:\n\n       Nunn-Lugar . . . is now in need of expansion, improvement \n     and resources.\n\n  The first new bill I have introduced is the Nunn-Lugar Cooperative \nThreat Reduction Act of 2005. This bill, which is cosponsored by \nSenators Domenici and Hagel, would underscore the bipartisan consensus \non Nunn-Lugar by streamlining and accelerating Nunn-Lugar \nimplementation. It would grant more flexibility to the President and to \nthe Secretary of Defense to undertake nonproliferation projects outside \nthe former Soviet Union. It also would eliminate congressionally \nimposed conditions on Nunn-Lugar assistance that in the past have \nforced the suspension of time-sensitive nonproliferation projects.\n  The purpose of the bill is to reduce bureaucratic redtape and \nfriction within our Government that hinder effective responses to \nnonproliferational opportunities and emergencies.\n  At last week's hearing, Dr. Rice reiterated the administration's \nstrong support of the bill. She understands how important it is to \nprevent needless delays in our weapons dismantlement schedule.\n  Our recent experience in Albania is illustrative of the need to \nreduce bureaucratic delays. Last year in 2004, Albania appealed for \nhelp in destroying 16 tons of chemical agent left over from the Cold \nWar. In August of last year, I visited this remote facility, the \nlocation of which still remains classified. Nunn-Lugar officials are \nworking closely with Albanian leaders to destroy this dangerous \nstockpile. But from beginning to end, the bureaucratic process to \nauthorize the dismantlement of chemical weapons in Albania took more \nthan 3 months, largely because of requirements in current law. \nFortunately, the situation in Albania was not a crisis. But we may not \nbe able to afford these timelines in future nonproliferation \nemergencies.\n  The second piece of legislation that I will introduce is the \nConventional Arms Threat Reduction Act of 2005 or CATRA. This \nlegislation, cosponsored by Senator Domenici, is modeled on the \noriginal Nunn-Lugar Act. Its purpose is to provide the Department of \nState with a focused response to the threat posed by vulnerable \nstockpiles of conventional weapons around the world, including tactical \nmissiles and man portable air defense systems, or MANPADS, as they are \nnow more commonly called. Such missile systems could be used by \nterrorists to attack commercial airlines, military installations, and \ngovernment facilities at home and abroad. Reports suggest that al-Qaida \nhas attempted to acquire these kinds of weapons.\n  In addition, unsecured conventional weapons stockpiles are a major \nobstacle to peace, reconstruction, and economic development in regions \nsuffering from instability. My bill declares it to be the policy of the \nUnited States to seek out surplus and unguarded stocks of conventional \narmaments, including small arms and light weapons and tactical missile \nsystems, for elimination.\n  It authorizes the Department of State to carry out a global effort to \ndestroy such weapons and to cooperate with allies and international \norganizations when possible. The Secretary of State is charged with \ndevising a strategy for prioritizing, on a country-by-country basis, \nthe obligation of funds in a global program of conventional arms \nelimination. Lastly, the Secretary is required to unify program \nplanning, coordination, and implementation of the strategy into one \noffice at the State Department and to request a budget commensurate \nwith the risk posed by these weapons.\n  The Department of State has been working to address the threats posed \nby conventional weapons. But in my judgment, the current funding \nallocation and organizational structure are not up to the task. Only \nabout $6 million was devoted to securing small arms and light weapons \nduring the two-year period that covered FY 2003 and FY 2004. We need \nmore focus on this problem and more funding to take advantage of \nopportunities to secure vulnerable stockpiles.\n  In August, I visited Albania, Ukraine, and Georgia. Each of these \ncountries has large stockpiles of MANPADS and tactical missile systems \nand each has requested U.S. assistance to destroy them. On August 27, I \nstood in a remote Albanian military storage facility as the base \ncommander unloaded a fully functioning MANPAD from its crate and \nreadied it for use. This storage site contained 79 MANPADS that could \nhave been used to attack an American commercial aircraft or \ninstallation. Fortunately, the MANPADS that I saw that day were \ndestroyed on September 2, but there are many more like them throughout \nthe world. Too often, conventional weapons are inadequately stored and \nprotected. This presents grave risk to American military bases, embassy \ncompounds, and even targets within the United States. We must develop a \nresponse that is commensurate with the threat.\n  I am offering these two bills, with the hope of passing them at the \nearliest opportunity. I anticipate and welcome strong support from \nMembers of the Senate that reflects the priority status of U.S. non \nproliferation efforts.\n  Mr. President, I would like to highlight another topic that is \ncritical to U.S. foreign policy. This is our effort to lead the global \nfight against the horrific HIV/AIDS pandemic. During the hearings on \nDr. Rice's nomination, she responded to several questions on the \nadministration's Global AIDS initiative. I was pleased that she \nreiterated the administration's strong commitment to fighting AIDS and \nunderscored the importance of paying special attention to the needs of \nwomen, who are contracting AIDS at an accelerated rate.\n\n  In 2003, at the administration's urging, Congress passed \ncomprehensive legislation that created the Office of the Global AIDS \nCoordinator and pledged $15 billion over five years to address the HIV/\nAIDS crisis. We must be mindful of the President's observation that, \n``Time is not on our side,'' in combating this disease. In Africa, \nnearly 10,000 people contract the HIV virus each day. The United States \nhas a clear moral obligation to respond generously and quickly to this \ncrisis.\n  The United States has acted with unprecedented urgency in combating \nHIV/AIDS globally, and the President's emergency plan for HIV/AIDS \nRelief is showing clear signs of progress. In the first 8 months of the \nPresident's emergency plan, the United States has supported bilateral \nprograms in 15 of the most afflicted countries in Africa, Asia and the \nCaribbean to provide anti-retroviral treatment to those living with \nHIV/AIDS. I am pleased with the emergency plan's deep commitment to \ninternational cooperation. In fact, tomorrow, at the World Economic \nForum in Davos, Switzerland, Ambassador Tobias will be joining the \nleaders of the World Health Organization, UNAIDS, and the Global Fund \nto report on the progress that has been made in making drug treatment \navailable to the developing world.\n  The Senate Foreign Relations Committee continues to work closely with \nthe administration to make the fight against HIV/AIDS a priority. \nCharged with the oversight of the President's initiative, we will \ncontinue to hold hearings and briefings on the subject of AIDS and the \nprogress of the President's emergency plan for AIDS Relief. In 2004, \nfor instance, we held a hearing focused on the intersection of HIV/AIDS \nand hunger. At this hearing, Ambassador Randall Tobias, the Global AIDS \nCoordinator, and Jim Morris, Executive Director of the World Food \nProgram, testified about the devastating effects that the HIV/AIDS \ncrisis is having on agricultural workers and the food supply in sub-\nSaharan Africa. In addition, we explored the special nutritional needs \nof individuals who are taking antiretroviral medication.\n\n[[Page S382]]\n\n  We are just beginning to understand how women, and young girls in \nparticular, are especially vulnerable to HIV and AIDS, due to a \ncombination of biological, cultural, economic, social and legal \nfactors. Young girls constitute 75 percent of new infections in South \nAfrica among individuals between 14 and 25 years of age. In Malawi, the \nNational AIDS Commission has said that HIV and AIDS is killing more \nwomen than men, and that HIV-positive girls between 15 and 24 years of \nage outnumber males in the same age group by a six to one margin. Even \nin the United States, the disease is having a devastating effect on \nwomen, and is the leading cause of death among African American women \nages 25 to 34.\n  Not only are women and girls more vulnerable to infection, they are \nalso shouldering much of the burden of taking care of sick and dying \nrelatives and friends. In addition, in the vast majority of cases, they \nare the caretakers of the estimated 14 million children who have been \norphaned by this pandemic. Grandmothers often take the responsibility \nof caring for grandchildren, and older female children often take care \nof their younger siblings.\n  One such young girl is Fanny Madanitsa. Fanny is a 16-year-old girl \nliving in Malawi with her two younger sisters and a brother. Life has \nbeen difficult for Fanny and her siblings since they lost their parents \nto AIDS. As the oldest child, Fanny must deal with the stress of taking \ncare of her younger siblings. They live in a modest house and share one \nbed. Fanny dreams of being a nurse, but reaching this goal will be a \nchallenge for her. She cannot always attend classes, as she sometimes \nhas to look after her siblings. Because money is scarce, she has a \ndifficult time paying for school materials and other costs of her \neducation.\n  But Fanny is more fortunate that many girls in similar circumstances. \nWith the help of her Village AIDS Committee, a community-based \norganization that has organized to take care of the orphans in its \nvillage, Fanny and her siblings receive food, soap, school materials \nand also medicines. Through the Village AIDS Committee, which receives \nsupport from Save the Children, the community assists Fanny in watching \nher siblings so she can attend school.\n  Last June, I introduced the Assistance for Orphans and Other \nVulnerable Children in Developing Countries Act of 2004. I will \nreintroduce this bill in the coming days. It was written with the \nsupport of the administration, and I have received letters from both \nthe State Department and USAID endorsing its passage. My bill would \nrequire the United States Government to develop a comprehensive \nstrategy for providing assistance to orphans and would authorize the \nPresident to support community-based organizations that provide basic \ncare for orphans and vulnerable children.\n\n  Furthermore, my bill aims to improve enrollment and access to primary \nschool education for orphans and vulnerable children by supporting \nprograms that reduce the negative impact of school fees and other \nexpenses. It also would reaffirm our commitment to international school \nlunch programs. School meals provide basic nutrition to children who \notherwise do not have access to reliable food. They have been a proven \nincentive for poor and orphaned children to enroll in school.\n  In addition, many women and children who lose one or both parents \noften face difficulty in asserting their inheritance rights. Even when \nthe inheritance rights of women and children are spelled out in law, \nsuch rights are difficult to claim and are seldom enforced. In many \ncountries it is difficult or impossible for a widow--even if she has \nsmall children--to claim property after the death of her husband. This \noften leaves the most vulnerable children impoverished and homeless. My \nbill seeks to support programs that protect the inheritance rights of \norphans and widows with children. I know that Dr. Rice is supportive of \nthis legislation, and I am hopeful that, with bipartisan action, it \nwill become law early this year.\n  The AIDS orphans crisis in sub-Saharan Africa has implications for \npolitical stability, development, and human welfare that extend far \nbeyond the region. Turning the tide on this crisis will require a \ncoordinated, comprehensive, and swift response. I know Dr. Rice shares \nthe view that fighting Global AIDS must be a priority for U.S. foreign \npolicy. I am hopeful that, with the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS \nRelief, the Global Fund, and Congressional initiatives, we can make \ngreat strides together in the battle against this pandemic.\n  In addition, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record an \neditorial that I co-authored in the January 19 edition of the \nWashington Post with Patty Stonesifer, co-chair and President of the \nBill and Melinda Gates Foundation.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Jan. 19, 2005]\n\n                      In the Footsteps of History\n\n                          (By Dorothy Height)\n\n       When Condoleezza Rice is sworn in as secretary of state, \n     she will be following in the footsteps of Mary McLeod \n     Bethune, the founder of the National Council of Negro Women. \n     Mrs. Bethune was the first black woman to be called upon for \n     policy help by the White House, when Republican President \n     Calvin Coolidge asked her to take part in a conference on \n     child care in 1928. She went on to work with Republican and \n     Democratic presidents while always fighting to advance the \n     interests of black women and children.\n       From Sojourner Truth speaking out in the abolitionist \n     movement, to Constance Baker Motley as a voice in the \n     courtroom to Shirley Chisholm as a candidate for president, \n     African American women have braved a world that did not \n     welcome their participation.\n       Ms. Rice will be the first woman of color to assume the \n     highest diplomatic post in the U.S. government. As secretary \n     of state, she will face challenges that confront women \n     everywhere. As we engage the Muslim and Arab worlds, efforts \n     are being renewed to suppress women's participation in \n     education, politics and civil society. In Africa, HIV and \n     AIDS are ravaging a generation of women and leaving millions \n     of orphans to be comforted. In Central and Eastern Europe, \n     women and girls are being sold into prostitution.\n       Despite the challenges she will face, Ms. Rice's \n     appointment is a time for women of color to smile. Our nation \n     finally will put forward a face that reflects the hopes of \n     generations of black women to sit at the table of national \n     and global affairs and participate as equals.\n       Many women sacrificed to make this moment possible. I pray \n     that Ms. Rice will use this profound honor and heavy burden \n     to represent our country with compassion, strength and \n     integrity, while seeking peaceful solutions and working to \n     make the world a better place for all people.\n\n  Mr. LUGAR. This editorial entitled ``Speeding an AIDS Vaccine'' lays \nout the case for improved global coordination in this area. Achievement \nof an AIDS vaccine would save millions of lives and billions of dollars \nin treatment costs in the coming decades. I am pleased that the Bush \nadministration, through the NIH, already has taken the initiative to \nestablish one Vaccine Research Center and has unveiled support for a \nsecond one. These centers are a critical element in improving global \ncooperation on the development of an AIDS vaccine.\n  Mr. President, I have cited just a small sample of critical issues on \nwhich work in both the executive and legislative branches is proceeding \nwith good results. From my own conversations with Dr. Rice, I am \nconfident that she understands that the President's foreign policy can \nbe enhanced in the second term by a closer working relationship with \nCongress. In moving to head the State Department, she understands that \nmuch of this communication will depend on her. Last week's hearings \nwere an excellent start. Her attitude throughout these arduous hearings \nwas always accommodating and always respectful of the Senate's \nconstitutional role in the nomination process. From the start she made \nclear her desire to have a wide-ranging discussion of U.S. foreign \npolicy and to take all the questions that members wanted to ask.\n  If confirmed, it will be her duty to use the foundation of these \nhearings to build a consistent bridge of communication to the Congress. \nAs legislators, we have equal responsibility in this process. We have \nthe responsibility of educating ourselves about national security \nissues, even when they are not the top issues in headlines or polls. We \nhave the responsibility to maintain good foreign affairs law, even when \ntaking care of this duty yields little credit back home. We have the \nresponsibility to ensure that our first impulse in foreign affairs is \none of bipartisanship. And we have the responsibility to speak plainly \nwhen we disagree with the administration, but to avoid inflammatory \nrhetoric that is designed\n\n[[Page S383]]\n\nmerely to create partisan advantage or settle partisan scores.\n  I believe that we have the opportunity with the beginning of a new \nPresidential term to enhance the constructive role of Congress in \nforeign policy. We have made an excellent start during the past week. I \nthank all 18 Senators who participated in the Foreign Relations \nCommittee hearings and all Senators who will join in the debate today. \nI strongly urge Members to vote in favor of the nomination of Dr. Rice \nto be Secretary of State. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time \nallotted for Democratic Members under the agreement regarding the Rice \nnomination be modified as follows: The time for Senator Lieberman be \nallocated to Senator Bayh; Senator Dayton be allocated 15 minutes, 5 \nminutes from Senator Boxer's time and 10 minutes from the time \ncontrolled by Senator Durbin.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I commend my friend and colleague, the \nchairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, for the way he conducted \nthe hearings on the nomination for Secretary of State. I think many of \nus who were not members of the committee but followed the hearings very \nclosely were enormously impressed by the conduct of the hearings, by \nthe flexibility he showed in permitting Senators to follow up on \nquestions so we could reach the real nub of the situation and yet to \nmove the hearings along in a timely way. That is part of the long \ntradition that is associated with the chairman of the committee, and it \nis one of the reasons, among others, that he is held in such high \nregard and respect in the Senate.\n  I intend to oppose Condoleezza Rice's nomination. There is no doubt \nthat Dr. Rice has impressive credentials. Her life story is very \nmoving, and she has extensive experience in foreign policy. In general, \nI believe the President should be able to choose his Cabinet officials, \nbut this nomination is different because of the war in Iraq.\n  Dr. Rice was a key member of the national security team that \ndeveloped and justified the rationale for war, and it has been a \ncatastrophic failure, a continuing quagmire. In these circumstances, \nshe should not be promoted to Secretary of State.\n  There is a critical question about accountability. Dr. Rice was a \nprincipal architect and advocate of the decision to go to war in Iraq \nat a time when our mission in Afghanistan was not complete and Osama \nbin Laden was a continuing threat because of our failure to track him \ndown. In the Armed Services Committee before the war, generals advised \nagainst the rush to war, but Dr. Rice and others in the administration \npressed forward anyway despite the clear warnings.\n  Dr. Rice was the first in the administration to invoke the terrifying \nimage of a nuclear holocaust to justify the need to go to war in Iraq. \nOn September 9, 2002, as Congress was first considering the resolution \nto authorize the war, Dr. Rice said: We do not want the smoking gun to \nbecome a mushroom cloud.\n  In fact, as we now know, there was significant disagreement in the \nintelligence community that Iraq had a nuclear weapons program, but Dr. \nRice spoke instead about a consensus in the intelligence community that \nthe infamous aluminum tubes were for the development of nuclear \nweapons. On the eve of the war many of us argued that inspectors should \nbe given a chance to do their job and that America should share \ninformation to facilitate their work.\n  In a March 6, 2000, letter to Senator Levin, Dr. Rice assured the \nCongress that the United Nations inspectors had been briefed on every \nhigh or medium priority weapons of mass destruction missile and UAV-\nrelated site the U.S. intelligence community has identified. In fact, \nwe had not done so. Dr. Rice was plain wrong.\n  The Intelligence Committee report on the prewar intelligence at page \n418 stated:\n\n       Public pronouncements by Administration officials that the \n     Central Intelligence Agency had shared information on all \n     high and moderate priority suspect sites with United Nations \n     inspectors were factually incorrect.\n\n  Had Dr. Rice and others in the administration shared all of the \ninformation, it might have changed the course of history. We might have \ndiscovered that there were no weapons of mass destruction. The rush to \nwar might have been stopped. We would have stayed focused on the real \nthreat, kept faith with our allies, and would be safer today.\n\n  America is in deep trouble in Iraq today because of our misguided \npolicy, and the quagmire is very real. Nearly 1,400 of our finest men \nand women in uniform have been killed and more than 10,000 have been \nwounded. We now know that Saddam had no nuclear weapons, had no weapons \nof mass destruction of any kind, and that the war has not made America \nsafer from the threat of al-Qaida. Instead, as the National \nIntelligence Council recently stated, the war has made Iraq a breeding \nground for terrorism that previously did not exist.\n  As a result, the war has made us less secure, not more secure. It has \nincreased support for al-Qaida, made America more hated in the world, \nand made it much harder to win the real war against terrorism, the war \nagainst al-Qaida.\n  Before we can repair our broken policy, the administration needs to \nadmit it is broken. Yet in 2 days of confirmation hearings, Dr. Rice \ncategorically defended the President's decision to invade Iraq, saying \nthe strategic decision to overthrow Saddam Hussein was the right one. \nShe defended the President's decision to ignore the advice of GEN Eric \nShinseki, the Army Chief of Staff, who thought that a large number of \ntroops would be necessary if we went to war.\n  She said:\n\n       I do believe that the plan and forces that we went in with \n     were appropriate to the task.\n\n  She refused to disavow the shameful acts of torture that have \nundermined America's credibility in Iraq and the world.\n  When Senator Dodd asked her whether in her personal view, as a matter \nof basic humanity, the interrogation techniques amounted to torture, \nshe said:\n\n       I'm not going to speak to any specific interrogation \n     techniques . . . The determination of whether interrogation \n     techniques are consistent with our international obligations \n     and American law are made by the Justice Department. I don't \n     want to comment on any specific interrogation techniques.\n\n  This is after Senator Dodd asked about water-boarding and other \ninterrogation techniques. She continued:\n\n       I don't think that would be appropriate, and I think it \n     would not be very good for American security.\n\n  Yet, as Secretary of State, Dr. Rice will be the chief human rights \nofficial for our Government. She will be responsible for monitoring \nhuman rights globally, and defending America's human rights record. She \ncannot abdicate that responsibility or hide behind the Justice \nDepartment if Secretary of State.\n\n  Dr. Rice also minimized the enormous challenge we face in training a \ncompetent Iraqi security force. She insisted 120,000 Iraqis now have \nbeen trained, when the quality of training for the vast majority of \nthem is obviously very much in doubt.\n  There was no reason to go to war in Iraq when we did, the way we did, \nand for the false reasons we were given. As a principal architect of \nour failed policy, Dr. Rice is the wrong choice for Secretary of State. \nWe need, instead, a Secretary who is open to a clearer vision and a \nbetter strategy to stabilize Iraq, to work with the international \ncommunity, to bring our troops home with dignity and honor, and to \nrestore our lost respect in the world.\n  The stakes are very high and the challenge is vast. Dr. Rice's failed \nrecord on Iraq makes her unqualified for promotion to Secretary of \nState and I urge the Senate to oppose her nomination.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, First let me thank my colleagues, Senator \nBoxer and Senator Durbin for making available this time for me to \naddress the Senate regarding this nomination. I rise today to oppose \nthe nomination of national security adviser Condoleezza Rice for \nSecretary of State. I do so because she misled me\n\n[[Page S384]]\n\nabout the situation in Iraq before and after the congressional \nresolution in October of 2002 authorizing that war, a resolution that I \nopposed. She misled other Members of Congress about the situation in \nIraq, Members who have said they would have opposed that resolution if \nthey had been told the truth, and she misled the people of Minnesota \nand Americans everywhere about the situation in Iraq before and after \nthat war began.\n  It is a war in which 1,372 American soldiers have lost their lives, \nand over 10,000 have been wounded--many of them maimed for life. \nThousands more have been scarred emotionally and physically. All of \nthose families and thousands of other American families whose loved \nones are now serving in Iraq are suffering serious financial and family \nhardships, and must wonder and worry every day and night for a year or \nlonger whether their husbands, wives, fathers, mothers, sons, and \ndaughters are still alive, will stay alive, and wonder when they will \nbe coming home. For many, the answer is: Not soon.\n  I read in today's Washington Post that the Army is planning to keep \nits current troop strength in Iraq at 120,000 for at least 2 more \nyears. I did not learn that information as a Member of Congress. I did \nnot learn it as a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee where I \nregularly attend public hearings, classified meetings, and top secret \nbriefings. I did not learn it from the U.S. military command in Iraq \nwith whom I met in Baghdad last month. I read it in the Washington \nPost, just as I read last weekend that the Secretary of Defense \nhas created his own new espionage arm by ``reinterpreting an existing \nlaw,'' without informing most, if any, Members of Congress and by \nreportedly ``reprogramming funds appropriated for other purposes;'' \njust as I learned last weekend by reading the New York Times that the \nAdministration is exploring a reinterpretation of the law to allow \nsecret U.S. commando units to operate in this country.\n\n  I also learned of official reports documenting horrible abuses of \nprisoners, innocent civilians as well as enemy combatants, at numerous \nlocations in countries besides the Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq, which \ndirectly contradicts assurances we have been given repeatedly by \nadministration officials in the Senate Armed Services Committee.\n  I might as well skip all the Senate Armed Services Committee hearings \nand meetings and top secret briefings and just read the papers--and \nthank goodness for a free and vigilant press to ferret out the truth \nand to report the truth, because we cannot get the truth from this \nadministration.\n  Sadly, the attitude of too many of my colleagues across the aisle is: \nOur President, regardless whether he is wrong, wrong, or wrong, they \ndefend him, they protect him, and they allow his top administration \nofficials to get away with lying. Lying to Congress, lying to our \ncommittees, and lying to the American people. It is wrong. It is \nimmoral. It is un-American. And it has to stop.\n  It stops by not promoting top administration officials who engage in \nthe practice, who have been instrumental in deceiving Congress and the \nAmerican people and, regrettably, that includes Dr. Rice.\n  Dr. Rice, in a television interview on September 8, 2002, as the \nadministration was launching its campaign to scare the American people \nand stampede Congress about Saddam Hussein's supposedly urgent threat \nto our national security, shrewdly invoked the ultimate threat, that he \npossessed or would soon possess nuclear weapons. She said that day:\n\n       We don't want the smoking gun to be a mushroom cloud.\n\n  Soon thereafter she and other top administration officials cited \nintercepted aluminum tubes as definite proof that Saddam Hussein had an \nactive nuclear weapons program underway. Dr. Rice stated publicly at \nthe time the tubes:\n\n     . . . are only really suited for nuclear weapons programs, \n     centrifuge programs.\n\n  In late September of 2002, shortly before we in Congress were to vote \non the Iraq war resolution, Dr. Rice invited me, along with I believe \nfive of my Senate colleagues, to the White House where we were briefed \nby her and then-CIA Director George Tenet. That briefing was \nclassified. What I was shown and told conformed to Dr. Rice's public \nstatements, with no qualification whatsoever. Now, of course, we have \nbeen told, after an exhaustive search for 18 months by over 1,400 \nUnited States weapons inspectors, that Saddam Hussein did not have an \nactive nuclear weapons development program underway and that he \napparently possessed no weapons of mass destruction of any kind. We \nhave also been told that in the fall of 2002, right at the time of my \nmeeting in the White House, right at the time of the Senate and the \nHouse's votes on the Iraq war resolution, the top nuclear experts at \nthe U.S. Department of Energy and officials in other Federal agencies \nwere disagreeing strongly with Dr. Rice's claim that those aluminum \ntubes could only have been intended for use in developing nuclear \nweapons materials.\n  That expert dissent and honest disagreement--a different point of \nview--was not communicated to me then nor was it brought to me later. I \nreceived no phone call or letter saying: Senator Dayton just wanted to \ncorrect a mis-impression that I unintentionally gave you at that \nmeeting. I now have information that contradicts what we were told \nthen. I still believe in my own views but I want you to be aware of \nothers before you cast the most important vote of your Senate career or \neven a call or communication after that vote was cast. There was \nnothing.\n  When Senator Boxer rightly pressed Dr. Rice on this point in the \nForeign Relations confirmation hearing, there was no admission even \nthen of any mistake. In fact, she replied: ``I really hope that you \nwill refrain from impugning my integrity. Thank you, very much.''\n  There is a saying that we judge ourselves by our intentions; others \njudge it by our actions.\n  I don't know what Dr. Rice's intentions were, but I do have direct \nexperience with her actions. There was no slight misunderstanding, or a \nslip, or even a mistake that was limited to one meeting. This was a \npublic statement made repeatedly by Dr. Rice and similar words by Vice \nPresident Cheney and even by President Bush as part of an all-out \ncampaign, which continues even today, to mobilize public support and \nmaintain public support for the invasion of Iraq and for continuing war \nthere regardless of what the facts were then, or are now, and it has \nbeen done by misrepresenting those facts, by distorting the facts, by \nwithholding the facts, by hiding the truth, by hiding the truth in \nmatters of life and death, of war and peace, that profoundly affect our \nnational security, our international reputation, and our future well-\nbeing--and will for many years to come.\n  I don't like to impugn anyone's integrity. But I really do not like \nbeing lied to repeatedly, flagrantly, intentionally. It is wrong. It is \nundemocratic. It is un-American, and it is dangerous. It is very \ndangerous, and it is occurring far too frequently in this \nadministration.\n  This Congress, this Senate must demand that it stop now. My vote \nagainst this nomination is my statement that this administration's \nlying must stop now. I urge my colleagues to join me in this demand, \nDemocrat, Republicans, Independents. All of us first and foremost are \nAmericans. We must be told the truth--for us to govern our country and \nto preserve our world. That is why we must vote against this \nnomination.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that an editorial \nby Dorothy Height of the Washington Post of January 19 be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Jan. 19, 2005]\n\n                      In the Footsteps of History\n\n                          (By Dorothy Height)\n\n       When Condoleezza Rice is sworn in as secretary of state, \n     she will be following in the footsteps of Mary McLeod \n     Bethune, the founder of the National Council of Negro Women. \n     Mrs. Bethune was the first black woman to be called upon for \n     policy help by the White House, when Republican President \n     Calvin Coolidge asked her to take part in a conference on \n     child care in 1928. She went on to work with Republican and \n     Democratic presidents while always fighting to advance the \n     interests of black woman and children.\n       From Sojourner Truth speaking out in the abolitionist \n     movement, to Constance Baker Motley as a voice in the \n     courtroom to Shirley Chisholm as a candidate for president,\n\n[[Page S385]]\n\n     African American women have braved a world that did not \n     welcome their participation.\n       Ms. Rice will be the first woman of color to assume the \n     highest diplomatic post in the U.S. government. As secretary \n     of state, she will face challenges that confront women \n     everywhere. As we engage the Muslim and Arab worlds, efforts \n     are being renewed to suppress women's participation in \n     education, politics and civil society. In Africa, HIV and \n     AIDS are ravaging a generation of women and leaving millions \n     of orphans to be comforted. In Central and Eastern Europe, \n     woman and girls are being sold into prostitution.\n       Despite the challenges she will face, Ms. Rice's \n     appointment is a time for women of color to smile. Our nation \n     finally will put forward a face that reflects the hopes of \n     generations of black women to sit at the table of national \n     and global affairs and participates as equals.\n       Many women sacrificed to make this moment possible. I pray \n     that Ms. Rice will use this profound honor and heavy burden \n     to represent our country with compassion, strength and \n     integrity, while seeking peaceful solutions and working to \n     make the world a better place for all people.\n\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the President's nomination of Dr. \nCondoleezza Rice to be Secretary of State presents the Senate with a \ndifficult decision. Dr. Rice will bring an impressive set of public \npolicy and academic credentials to the job of Secretary of State. Her \npersonal story is inspiring. Nonetheless, Dr. Rice's record on Iraq \ngives me great concern.\n  In her public statements, she clearly overstated and exaggerated the \nintelligence concerning Iraq before the war in order to support the \nPresident's decision to initiate military action against Iraq. Since \nthe Iraq effort has run into great difficulty, she has also attempted \nto revise history as to why we went into Iraq.\n  I approach this issue as the ranking member of the Armed Services \nCommittee and as a member of the Intelligence Committee. Both \ncommittees have devoted a great deal of time over the last 2 years to \nissues concerning Iraq, including the Intelligence Committee inquiry \ninto prewar intelligence.\n  These inquiries indicated major problems with the intelligence on \nIraq and how it was exaggerated or misused to make the case to the \nAmerican people of the need to initiate an attack against Iraq. Dr. \nRice is a major player in that effort--a frequent and highly visible \npublic voice.\n  Dr. Rice is not directly responsible for the intelligence failures \nprior to the Iraq war. The intelligence community's many failures are \ncatalogued in the 500-page report of the Senate Intelligence Committee. \nBut Dr. Rice is responsible for her own distortions and exaggerations \nof the intelligence which was provided to her.\n  Here are a few of those exaggerations and distortions.\n  One of the most well known was the allegation that Iraq was trying to \nobtain uranium from Africa, which was cited to demonstrate that Iraq \nwas reconstituting its nuclear weapons program. But our intelligence \ncommunity did not believe it was true, and took numerous actions to \nmake its concerns known--even urging the British not to publish the \nallegation in September of 2002.\n  So how did it happen that President Bush in his January 28, 2003, \nState of the Union speech said that ``The British government has \nlearned that Saddam Hussein recently sought significant quantities of \nuranium from Africa''?\n  When the CIA saw a draft of the President's Cincinnati speech for \nOctober 7, 2002, it asked the White House to delete the allegation that \nIraq had been seeking uranium from Africa, and the White House did \nremove the reference entirely.\n  On October 5, 2002, the CIA sent a memo explaining its views to \nSteven Hadley, Dr. Rice's deputy. It sent another memo to Dr. Rice and \nto Mr. Hadley on October 6, again expressing doubt about the reports of \nIraq's attempt to get uranium from Africa.\n  Finally, George Tenet, the Director of Central Intelligence himself, \npersonally called Mr. Hadley to urge that the uranium allegation be \nremoved from the speech--which it was.\n  This was not just some routine staff action or a low-level CIA \nanalyst who called the National Security Council. It was a memorandum \nfrom the CIA to Dr. Rice, and the Director of Central Intelligence \nhimself who called Dr. Rice's deputy to make it clear what his concerns \nwere and to request the removal of the allegation.\n  Yet just 3\\1/2\\ months later the White House put the African uranium \nallegation back into a draft of the State of the Union speech. That \ndraft made no mention of the British. It was a reference like the one \nthat was removed from the Cincinnati speech a few months before. It \nasserted in that draft what purported to be the view of the U.S. \nGovernment--that Iraq had been trying to obtain uranium from Africa.\n  According to Director Tenet, shortly before the speech was delivered, \nthe CIA received portions of the draft of the State of the Union to \nreview, including the allegation about uranium from Africa. A senior \nCIA staff member called the National Security Council staff to repeat \nhis concerns about the allegation. Instead of removing the text from \nthe speech, the National Security Council and the White House changed \nthe text to make reference to the British view, suggesting, of course, \nthat the United States believed the British view to be accurate.\n  That formula was highly deceptive. The only reason to say the \n``British have learned'' that Saddam Hussein was seeking uranium from \nAfrica was to create the impression that we believed it.\n  But our intelligence community did not believe it. Indeed, they had \nattempted to dissuade the British from publishing the allegation in \nSeptember, and they successfully made several high-level interventions \nwith the White House in October to have the allegation removed from the \nPresident's Cincinnati speech. Concerning the British report, Director \nTenet said the CIA ``differed with the British on the reliability of \nthe uranium reporting.''\n\n  What was the role of Dr. Rice in all of this? I asked her in my \nquestions for the record whether she was aware the intelligence \ncommunity had doubts about the credibility of the reports, and if not, \nhow she could not know, given all of the activity prior to the \nPresident's October 7 Cincinnati speech, including the memo to her.\n  In response, Dr. Rice said, ``I do not recall reading or receiving \nthe CIA memo,'' and ``I do not recall Intelligence Community concerns \nabout the credibility of reports about Iraq's attempts to obtain \nuranium from Africa either at the time of the Cincinnati speech or the \nState of the Union speech.''\n  Frankly, I am surprised and disappointed that the National Security \nAdviser would not remember an issue of this magnitude.\n  However, it was not only the President who made that allegation, Dr. \nRice made it herself in an op-ed in the New York Times on January 23, \n2003, 5 days before the State of the Union speech, and 3\\1/2\\ months \nafter the same allegation had been removed from the Cincinnati speech \nat the CIA's request. She wrote that Iraq's declaration to the U.N. \n``fails to account for or explain Iraq's efforts to get uranium from \nabroad.''\n  Another question I asked Dr. Rice for the record was whether, prior \nto the January 2003 State of the Union speech, she had discussed with \nSteven Hadley, her Deputy, the choice of wording in that portion of the \nspeech and whether she was aware that the language had been changed to \nrefer to the British rather than stating it as the U.S. Government's \nview. In her response she said:\n\n       Yes, I did discuss with Stephen Hadley concerns the \n     intelligence community had about protecting sources and \n     methods regarding reports on Iraq's attempts to procure \n     uranium from Africa. These concerns were addressed by citing \n     a foreign government service. I do not recall any discussion \n     of concerns about the credibility of the report.\n\n  However, the CIA requested on three separate occasions that the \nreference in the Cincinnati speech be removed entirely because the CIA \nhad doubts about the credibility of the reports.\n  In Dr. Rice's answers to my questions, while she failed to remember \nall the direct interventions by the CIA to have the uranium allegation \nremoved from the President's Cincinnati speech, including a CIA memo to \nher, she instead relied on a single sentence from\n\n[[Page S386]]\n\nthe October 1, 2002, national intelligence estimate, asserting that \n``Iraq also began vigorously trying to procure uranium and yellow \ncake'' from Africa.\n  There are four problems with her answers. First, after that national \nintelligence estimate was produced, the CIA made its multiple \ninterventions with the National Security Council, including two memos \nand the call from DCI Tenet to Dr. Rice's Deputy, to have the uranium \nallegation removed from the draft October 7 Cincinnati speech because \nof the doubts about the credibility of the reports. It was then \nremoved.\n  So the CIA's doubts about the reporting and the White House's removal \nof that allegation from the Cincinnati speech came after the hastily \nassembled national intelligence estimate of October 1, 2002.\n  Second, according to George Tenet, the Director of Central \nIntelligence, the CIA's concerns were with the credibility of the \nreports, not with sources and methods. In a statement issued in July of \n2003, he said the CIA received portions of the draft speech shortly \nbefore it was given and that the CIA officials ``raised several \nconcerns about the fragmentary nature of the intelligence with the \nNational Security Council colleagues.'' In that statement he made no \nfewer than five references to CIA doubts about the reliability of the \nintelligence. He did not mention concerns about protecting sources and \nmethods.\n  Third, in relying on one erroneous sentence in the NIE, Dr. Rice did \nnot mention the opposing sentence in that same NIE written by the State \nDepartment's Bureau of Intelligence and Research, which stated that \n``the claims of Iraqi pursuit of natural uranium in Africa are, in \nINR's assessment, highly dubious.'' So the NIE, which she referred to, \nalso contained an explicit dissenting view on the issue of African \nuranium, but she ignored that portion of the NIE.\n\n  Finally, and most significantly, if the State of the Union speech was \nrelying upon that one sentence in the national intelligence estimate, \nit would have presented the allegation about Iraq seeking African \nuranium as something the United States believed rather than something \nthe ``British have learned.''\n  That is where Dr. Rice's answers unravel. If the NIE's erroneous \nstatement that ``Iraq also began vigorously trying to procure uranium \nore and yellow-cake'' from Africa was the basis for the State of the \nUnion speech representations, that speech would not have relied on the \nBritish view. It would have been stated as our own view. The problem is \nthat it was not our view. The statement about the British learning of \nIraq's efforts to obtain uranium in Africa was a conscious effort to \ncreate an impression that we believed something that we actually did \nnot believe.\n  Now, there are other examples in which Dr. Rice exaggerated the \nintelligence or overstated the case to help persuade the public of the \nneed to go to war against Iraq. Let me cite a few.\n  On September 8, 2002, Dr. Rice said on CNN:\n\n       We do know that there have been shipments going into . . . \n     Iraq, for instance, of . . . high quality aluminum tubes that \n     are only really suited for nuclear weapons, centrifuge \n     programs.\n\n  On July 30, 2003, she said that ``the consensus view of the American \nintelligence agency'' was that the aluminum tubes ``were most likely \nfor this use''--meaning for centrifuges to make nuclear weapons.\n  However, contrary to her claim, there was no certainty and no \nconsensus view within the intelligence community about the use of the \naluminum tubes. In fact, there was a fundamental disagreement, and the \nDepartment of Energy, which has the Nation's foremost centrifuge \nexperts, and the State Department did not believe the tubes were \nintended for centrifuges. They believed the tubes were intended for \nconventional artillery rockets. Their disagreeing views were explicitly \nincluded in the October 2002 national intelligence estimate.\n  In my questions for the record, I asked Dr. Rice why she had said \nthere was a consensus when there was none. Her answer did not respond \nto my question. So the question remains: Why did she say there was a \nconsensus when there was not a consensus, and why did she say they were \n``only really suited for nuclear weapons'' when they were, in fact, not \nonly suitable for other purposes but, indeed, had been used for other \npurposes by Iraq--namely, for conventional artillery rockets?\n  In summary, Dr. Rice made the public case against Iraq as having \nreconstituted its nuclear weapons program far stronger than was \nsupported by the classified intelligence. She exaggerated and distorted \nthe facts and the intelligence provided to her in order to help \nconvince the American public of the need to go to war.\n  Dr. Rice has also not been forthcoming on the question of when she \nknew of the differences within the intelligence community relative to \nthe intended use of the aluminum tubes. Senator Biden asked Dr. Rice in \na written question before the confirmation hearings whether she knew of \nthe long-standing debate within the intelligence community at the time \nof her September 8, 2002 statement that the aluminum tubes ``are only \nreally suited for nuclear weapons programs, centrifuge programs,'' and \nwhen President Bush said four days later that ``Iraq has made several \nattempts to buy high-strength aluminum tubes used to enrich uranium for \na nuclear weapon.''\n  She simply ducked the issue, and quoted a passage from the October \n2002 NIE about a number of alleged Iraqi uranium enrichment \nactivities--including the aluminum tubes--noting that the Department of \nEnergy believed the tubes ``probably are not part of'' the nuclear \nprogram. She never answered the question of whether she was aware of \nthe debate when she and the President made their erroneous statements.\n  One more example. On November 15, 2002, Dr. Rice said Saddam Hussein \nhad been ``helping some al Qaeda operatives gain training in CBRN \n[Chemical, Biological, Radiological or Nuclear weapons].''\n  On March 9, 2003, shortly before the war, she made a statement about \nthe links between Saddam and al Qaeda, including a ``very strong link \nto training al Qaeda in chemical and biological weapons techniques.''\n  On September 7, 2003, she said:\n\n     we know there was training of al Qaeda in chemical and \n     perhaps biological warfare.\n\n  Those comments indicated certainty that Iraq provided training in \nchemical and biological weapons to al-Qaida. But the CIA had said that \nthe reports of training came from sources of ``varying reliability,'' \nand were ``contradictory,'' as the Senate Intelligence Committee report \nmakes clear.\n  Dr. Rice took what was a possibility and portrayed it as a fact.\n  Prior to the war, senior administration officials repeatedly and \npublicly stated that the reason the United States had to be prepared to \nuse military force, and then go to war against Saddam, was to disarm \nIraq of its weapons of mass destruction, which Saddam was said to be \nlikely to provide to terrorists like al-Qaida.\n  Before the war, Dr. Rice said the following, on September 25, 2002: \n``This is a matter of disarming the Iraqi regime, because that's the \ndanger, is that Saddam Hussein with nuclear, chemical, biological \nweapons will be a threat to his people, his neighbors, and to us.''\n  On March 9, 2003, just 10 days before the start of the war, she said: \n``What the President is saying to the American people is . . . `I will \nnot stand by until the moment when Saddam Hussein is good at delivering \nbiological weapons, by unmanned aerial vehicles.' ''\n  On April 10, 2003 Ari Fleischer, the President's spokesman, \nsummarized the point succinctly: ``We have high confidence that they \nhave weapons of mass destruction. That is what this war was about and \nit is about.''\n  When questioned about this issue at her confirmation hearing on \nJanuary 18, Dr. Rice joined the effort to rewrite the history of the \npublicly stated reasons for attacking Iraq. She said: ``It wasn't just \nweapons of mass destruction. . . . It was the total picture, Senator, \nnot just weapons of mass destruction, that caused us to decide that, \npost-September 11th, it was finally time to deal with Saddam Hussein.''\n  The simple fact is that before the war, the administration repeatedly \nand dramatically made the case for war on the issue of Iraq possessing \nand continuing to develop weapons of mass destruction, and the \nlikelihood that Saddam Hussein would provide those weapons to \nterrorists like al Qaeda. For Dr.\n\n[[Page S387]]\n\nRice to suggest that there were many other, equally compelling, reasons \nto go to war simply does not square with the reality of how the \nadministration persuaded the American people and the Congress of the \nneed for war. Her suggestion is an effort to revise the history of the \nadministration's presentations to the American people.\n  Dr. Rice again engaged in revisionist history about the Iraq military \ncampaign during her nomination hearings before the Senate Foreign \nRelations Committee on January 18, 2005. Dr. Rice claimed: ``This was \nnever going to be easy; it was always going to have ups and downs.''\n  Dr. Rice's statement is striking, not because of its substance, but \nbecause of how it stands in contrast to what the administration was \ntelling Congress and the American people in the months before the \ninvasion of Iraq.\n  The administration downplayed the difficulties of invading Iraq by \nclaiming that we would be greeted as ``liberators'' by the Iraqi \npeople. When Army Chief of Staff General Eric Shinseki predicted that \n``several hundred thousand soldiers'' probably would be needed for the \noccupation of Iraq following the fall of Saddam Hussein, senior Defense \nDepartment officials rejected General Shinseki's assessment. Instead, \nDeputy Secretary of Defense Wolfowitz told the House Budget Committee \nbefore the start of the war: ``I am reasonably certain that they [the \nIraqi people] will greet us as liberators, and that will help us to \nkeep requirements down.'' He also said that ``the notion of hundreds of \nthousands of American troops is way off the mark.''\n  Vice President Cheney also repeated this claim to downplay the cost \nof regime change in Iraq. During an appearance on NBC's ``Meet the \nPress'' on March 16, 2003, the Vice President said: ``The read we get \non the people of Iraq is there is no question . . .  they will welcome \nas liberators the United States when we come to do that.''\n  It was precisely the administration's rose-colored conviction that \nour troops would be hailed by the Iraqi people as liberators that \nresulted in the inexcusable failure to plan for a difficult and costly \noccupation of Iraq following the end of major hostilities.\n  Similarly, administration officials grossly underestimated the costs \nto the American people of rebuilding Iraq. In March 2003, Deputy \nSecretary of Defense Wolfowitz testified before Congress that Iraq \n``can really finance its own reconstruction, and relatively soon.'' The \nnext month, in April 2003, the head of the U.S. Agency for \nInternational Development publicly estimated that the American \ntaxpayers' portion of Iraqi reconstruction costs would be $1.7 billion, \nadding that there were ``no plans for any further-on funding for \nthis.'' Instead, Congress has approved over $20 billion in \nreconstruction funds for Iraq, and the final bill for the American \ntaxpayer could reach hundreds of billions of dollars.\n  The Administration used the same rose-colored glasses in estimating \nthe cost of rebuilding Iraq. Dr. Rice said there were always going to \nbe ``ups and downs''. But before the war, the administration never \ntalked about, never planned for, and never prepared the American people \nfor the ``downs'' of rebuilding Iraq. It only focused on the ``ups''. \nSo I find Dr. Rice's latest assessment that the administration never \nthought that the post-Saddam period was going to be easy to be \nstartlingly at odds with the administration's claims in making the case \nfor the Iraq war in the first place.\n  One of my main concerns about this administration, including Dr. \nRice, is that there appears to be no accountability for the many \nmistakes.\n  Consider the case of George Tenet, the former Director of Central \nIntelligence, who covered the administration's exaggerations on Iraq. \nPresident Bush had been publicly saying things like ``on any given \nday,'' Saddam could provide WMD to terrorists, and that Saddam ``would \nlike nothing more than to use a terrorist network to attack and kill \nand leave no fingerprints.'' President Bush repeatedly indicated that \nSaddam might give WMD to terrorists without provocation.\n  On October 7, 2002 DCI Tenet sent a letter to the Senate Intelligence \nCommittee declassifying portions of its new National Intelligence \nEstimate on Iraq. That letter made clear that the intelligence \ncommunity believed it was unlikely that Saddam would share WMD with \nterrorists, and said it would be an ``extreme step'' and a ``last \nchance to exact vengeance'' if the U.S. had already attacked Iraq.\n  So there was a clear inconsistency between the views of the \nintelligence community and the public comments of the President. Yet, \nincredibly, on October 8, 2002, just a few days before the Senate was \nto vote on the resolution to authorize the use of force against Iraq, \nDCI Tenet issued a statement to the press saying ``there is no \ninconsistency'' between the views in the letter and the President's \nviews, which was simply false. Its motivation was transparent: An \nhonest acknowledgment of inconsistency might have had a negative effect \non the Senate vote.\n  Instead of being held accountable for that critical misstatement, and \ninstead of being held accountable for the October 2002 NIE, which was \nrife with errors, all in the direction of making Iraq more threatening, \nincluding erroneous statements not based on the underlying \nintelligence, George Tenet was awarded the Presidential Medal of \nFreedom by President Bush. That is not accountability. Accountability \nfor mistakes and failures, no matter how serious, is not the hallmark \nof this administration.\n  Dr. Rice's exaggerations and distortions concerning Iraq were an \nimportant part of the administration's effort to convince the American \npeople of the need to go to war. Few things are as fateful as that \ndecision.\n  Finally, Secretaries of State must be strong enough to tell a \nPresident what he may not want to hear. There is admittedly one recent \nglimmer of hope in that regard.\n  In response to my written question, Dr. Rice did acknowledge that \n``there is of course a distinction'' between Saddam Hussein and al \nQaeda when it comes to the war on terrorism. That stands in contrast to \nPresident Bush's claim on September 25, 2002, that ``[Y]ou can't \ndistinguish between al Qaeda and Saddam when you talk about the war on \nterror.''\n  But that glimmer of independence is not enough to change my view that \nDr. Rice should not be confirmed as Secretary of State.\n  The Bush administration's prewar distortions and exaggerations of \nintelligence concerning Iraq's weapons of mass destruction and ties to \nal Qaeda were the publicly stated basis for initiating the war.\n  I ask unanimous consent the questions and answers I asked of Dr. Rice \nalso be printed in the Record following my statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burr). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. LEVIN. Finally, I think I have 1 additional minute. I will use \nthat to conclude.\n  Voting to confirm Dr. Rice as Secretary of State would be a stamp of \napproval for her participation in the distortions and exaggerations of \nintelligence that the administration used before it initiated the war \nin Iraq, and the hubris which led to the administration's inexcusable \nfailure to plan and prepare for the aftermath of the overthrow of \nSaddam Hussein, with tragic ongoing consequences.\n  I believe we must do all we can to support our troops in their \nefforts to create a democratic government in Iraq, despite the \ncircumstances we are in. But I cannot, in good conscience, give my \napproval to the mistakes and misjudgments that helped to create those \ncircumstances. I will, therefore, vote against the confirmation of Dr. \nRice to be Secretary of State.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n  Questions for the Record From Senator Carl Levin to Dr. Condoleezza \n   Rice, and Her Responses (in Conjunction With Her Nomination To Be \n                          Secretary of State)\n\n\n                          Uranium From Africa\n\n       1. The CIA had sent a memo to you and Mr. Hadley on October \n     6, 2002 concerning a draft of the President's scheduled \n     October 7, 2002 Cincinnati speech. That memo included an \n     explanation of the reasons why the CIA believed the reference \n     to Iraq's attempts to obtain uranium from Africa should be \n     deleted. The CIA had sent a previous memo to Mr. Hadley (and \n     Mr. Gerson, who was the speechwriter) the day before that \n     memo sent to you, again expressing its doubts about the \n     reports of Iraq's attempts to get uranium from Africa. \n     Finally, the Director of Central\n\n[[Page S388]]\n\n     Intelligence, George Tenet, called Mr. Hadley directly to ask \n     that the reference to uranium from Africa be deleted from the \n     October 7 speech. As a result of the CIA's multiple \n     expressions of its doubts about these reports, the reference \n     was deleted, and the October 2002 speech made no mention of \n     Iraq's purported attempts to obtain uranium from Africa. \n     Given all this and other activity, were you aware at that \n     time (October 2002) that the Intelligence Community had \n     doubts about the reports of Iraq's purported efforts to \n     obtain uranium from Africa? Were you aware prior to January \n     28, 2003, the date of the President's State of the Union \n     speech?\n       Answer: I do not recall Intelligence Community concerns \n     about the credibility of reports about Iraq's attempts to \n     obtain uranium from Africa either at the time of the \n     Cincinnati speech or the State of the Union speech. I would \n     note that the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence report \n     on prewar intelligence assessments on Iraq stated:\n       ``When coordinating the State of the Union, no Central \n     Intelligence Agency (CIA) analysts or officials told the \n     National Security Council (NSC) to remove the `6 words' or \n     that there were concerns about the credibility of the Iraq-\n     Niger uranium reporting.''\n       2. Prior to the State of the Union speech (January 28, \n     2003), did you ever discuss with the Director of Central \n     Intelligence, George Tenet, the Intelligence Community's \n     doubts about reports of Iraq's attempts to get uranium from \n     Africa? If so, when was the first time you discussed the \n     matter with him, and how many times did you discuss the issue \n     prior to the State of the Union?\n       Answer: I do not recall discussing Intelligence Community \n     doubts about such reports with Director Tenet prior to the \n     State of the Union.\n       3. Prior to the State of the Union speech of January 2003, \n     did you ever discuss with Stephen Hadley, your deputy, the \n     choice of wording for the speech concerning Iraq's purported \n     attempts to obtain uranium from Africa? Prior to the speech, \n     were you aware that the language had been changed to make \n     reference to the British having learned of such efforts, \n     rather than stating it as the US Government view?\n       Answer: Yes, I did discuss with Stephen Hadley concerns the \n     Intelligence Community had about protecting sources and \n     methods regarding reports on Iraqi attempts to procure \n     uranium from Africa. These concerns were addressed by citing \n     a foreign government service. I do not recall any discussion \n     of concerns about the credibility of the reports.\n       4. Were you at all involved in the decision-making process \n     about the phraseology of the wording for the January 28, 2003 \n     State of the Union speech concerning Iraq's purported \n     attempts to obtain uranium from Africa (``The British \n     government has learned that Saddam Hussein recently sought \n     significant quantities of uranium from Africa'')? Who was the \n     author of the wording, and was the author aware that the CIA \n     had serious doubts about the claim at least as early as \n     September 2002?\n       Answer: Yes, I did discuss with Stephen Hadley concerns the \n     Intelligence Community had about protecting sources and \n     methods regarding reports on Iraqi attempts to procure \n     uranium from Africa. The State of the Union speech was \n     prepared by the President's speechwriters, in coordination \n     with other members of the executive branch. I do not know who \n     actually authored the words about Iraq's attempts to procure \n     uranium from Africa.\n       5. On July 13, 2004 you said the following on Face the \n     Nation: ``What I knew at the time is that no one had told us \n     that there were concerns about the British reporting.'' Given \n     all the activity indicating CIA doubts and concerns about the \n     claim, including a CIA memo sent to you in early October \n     2002, how could you not know of the doubts and concerns?\n       Answer: I do not recall reading or receiving the CIA memo \n     of October 2002. However, I was aware of the October 2002 \n     National Intelligence Estimate stating ``Iraq also began \n     vigorously trying to procure uranium ore and yellowcake; \n     acquiring either could shorten the time Baghdad needs to \n     produce nuclear weapons.''\n       6. On June 8, 2003, on ABC's This Week with George \n     Stephanopoulos, you said ``At the time the State of the Union \n     address was prepared, there were also other sources that said \n     that they were, the Iraqis were seeking yellow-cake, uranium \n     oxide, from Africa. And that was taken out of a British \n     report. Clearly, that particular report, we learned \n     subsequently, subsequently, was not credible. . . . The \n     intelligence community did not know at that time or at levels \n     that got to us that this, that there was serious questions \n     about this report.''\n       How could you say such a thing when, before the State of \n     the Union speech, the CIA had told the British of its doubts \n     about the claim and urged them to remove it from their \n     dossier; when the Director of Central Intelligence had \n     personally called your Deputy, Stephen Hadley; when the DCI \n     had sent a memo on October 5 to Mr. Hadley; and when he sent \n     another memo to you and Mr. Hadley on October 6, all \n     explaining why the claim should be removed from the \n     President's October 7 Cincinnati speech, which it was. How \n     can you claim that ``the intelligence community did not know \n     at that time or at levels that got to us that this, that \n     there was serious questions about this report''?\n       Answer: National Intelligence Estimates represent the \n     authoritative judgment of the Intelligence Community. CIA \n     also provided information citing Iraq's attempts to procure \n     uranium from Africa to the White House four days before the \n     State of the Union speech. I would also note that the Senate \n     Intelligence Committee concluded that no CIA analysts or \n     officials expressed doubt about the uranium reporting when \n     coordinating on the State of the Union speech.\n\n\n                          Iraq: Aluminum Tubes\n\n       7. On July 30, 2003, you said ``the consensus view of the \n     American intelligence agency'' [sic] was . . . that the \n     aluminum tubes ``were most likely for this use,'' meaning for \n     centrifuges to make nuclear weapons. However, there was no \n     consensus view on the use of the aluminum tubes; there was a \n     fundamental disagreement within the Intelligence Community, \n     and the Department of Energy and the State Department did not \n     believe the tubes were intended for centrifuges. Given that \n     there was no consensus, why did you say there was?\n       Answer: The October 2002 National Intelligence Estimate \n     established the Intelligence Community's authoritative \n     assessment on the aluminum tubes issue. It stated:\n       ``Most agencies believe that Saddam's personal interest in \n     and Iraq's aggressive attempts to obtain high-strength \n     aluminum tubes for centrifuge rotors--as well as Iraq's \n     attempts to acquire magnets, high-speed balancing machines \n     and machine tools--provide compelling evidence that Saddam is \n     reconstituting a uranium enrichment effort for Baghdad's \n     nuclear weapons program. (DOE agrees that reconstitution of \n     the nuclear program is underway but assesses that the tubes \n     are probably not part of the program.)'' A footnote noted \n     INR's alternative view to the NIE's authoritative assessment.\n\n\n               No Distinction Between Iraq and al Qaeda?\n\n       8. Do you make any distinction between Saddam Hussein and \n     al Qaeda when it comes to the war on terror, or do you think \n     they are indistinguishable?\n       Answer: Yes, there is of course a distinction, but Saddam \n     Hussein did harbor terrorists and had many other ties to \n     terrorists, including contacts with al Qaeda, as the 9-11 \n     Commission recognized. And he was an avowed enemy of America \n     and of our allies. The possibility that an outlaw state might \n     pass a weapon of mass destruction to a terrorist is the \n     greatest danger of our time.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the \nSenate reconvenes at 2:15, the following be the order of speakers: \nSenator McConnell, Senator Byrd, Senator Hagel, Senator Allen, Senator \nBoxer, Senator Alexander, Senator Durbin, a Republican Senator, and \nSenator Feinstein.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. No objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LUGAR. I thank the Chair. This will be helpful, I believe, so \nSenators can allocate their time. I would comment to the Chair this \nmeans that essentially the period from 2:15 to approximately 5 o'clock \nwill be consumed by these Senators. But the order allows for 9 hours of \ndebate, which means theoretically there could be 4 more hours-plus \nafter that to accommodate other Senators.\n  Mr. President, I also ask unanimous consent that during quorum calls \nthe time be charged equally against both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. BAYH. I ask my colleague from Texas, which of us was on the floor \nfirst?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I do not know. I thought I was \nsupposed to speak at 12:15, but if----\n  Mr. BAYH. I thought I was supposed to speak at 12:10. So I guess the \ntrains are not running on schedule today.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask the distinguished chairman, are \nthere any other speakers or are Senator Bayh and I the last two?\n  Mr. LUGAR. My information is at some point Senator Salazar wishes to \nspeak before the luncheons.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I would suggest, then, that Senator Bayh go next and \nI be able to follow him.\n  Mr. LUGAR. And then Senator Salazar be accommodated. I ask unanimous \nconsent that be the order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Texas for her \ncourtesy, and I pledge I will do my best to finish in 10 minutes or \nless.\n\n[[Page S389]]\n\n  It is a pleasure to be on the floor today with my friend and \ncolleague from Indiana. I have often thought that events around the \nworld, and particularly in Iraq, would have gone so much better if \nthose in a position to make policy for our country had listened to his \nwise counsel and advice. It is not often I find myself in disagreement \nwith my friend, but on this occasion I do.\n  I rise to express my opposition to the nomination of Condoleezza Rice \nand her proposed promotion to that of the position of Secretary of \nState--not because I object to her personally; I do not; not because I \noppose the mission of establishing freedom and democracy in Iraq; on \nthe contrary, I support it; but because I believe she has been a \nprincipal architect of policy errors that have tragically undermined \nour prospects for success in this endeavor.\n  Those in charge must be held accountable for mistakes. We must learn \nfrom them, correct them, so we may succeed in Iraq. If the President of \nthe United States will not do this, then those in the Senate must.\n  The list of errors is lengthy and profound, and, unfortunately, many \ncould have been avoided if Dr. Rice and others had only listened to the \ncounsel offered from both sides of the aisle.\n  From the beginning of this undertaking, we have had inadequate troop \nstrength to accomplish the mission. The mission was, of course, not to \nsimply realize regime change in Iraq but, instead, to recognize and \naccomplish nation building at its most profound. We violated a \nfundamental tenet of planning for war, which is to plan for the worst \nand hope for the best. Instead, all too often in Iraq we have hoped for \nthe best and, instead, are reaching the worst.\n  The advice to have greater troop strength was not partisan. Our \ncolleagues, Senator McCain, Senator Hagel, and others, virtually \npleaded with the administration to provide for greater security through \ntroop strength on the ground. Those pleas fell on deaf ears.\n  We have never had a realistic plan for the aftermath of this \nconflict. The State Department made plans. They were disregarded. The \nCIA warned of the potential for a growing insurgency. Their concerns \nwere dismissed. Senator Lugar held hearings that were prescient in this \nregard, pointing out the importance of planning for the aftermath and \nthe inadequacy of the preparation for the aftermath before the war. The \nresults of those hearings were ignored.\n  This is no ordinary incompetence. Men and women are dying as a result \nof these mistakes. Accountability must be had. We dismissed the Iraqi \nArmy.\n  In my trip to Iraq in December, one of our top ranking officials told \nme there that things today in Iraq would be 100-percent better--100-\npercent better--if we had only not dismissed the Iraqi Army; not the \ngenerals, not the human rights violators, not those who should be held \naccountable for their own actions, but the privates, the corporals, the \nlieutenants, the captains, those who should be on our side providing \nfor stability and security in Iraq and now, tragically, are being paid \nto kill Americans because we sent them home and said they had no future \nin the Iraq that we were hoping to build.\n  Likewise, we disqualified all former Baathists from serving even in \nlower levels of the bureaucracy in that country. They could have helped \nus run the nation. They could have helped us to reassure the Sunni \ncommunity that we wanted to reincorporate them in the future of Iraq. \nInstead, many of them are fighting us today in Iraq as well.\n  All of these mistakes have substantially undermined our prospects for \nsuccess, and tragically so. The chaos that has arisen from the lack of \nsecurity and stability has fed this insurgency.\n  I asked one of our top ranking officials in Iraq in December which \nwas growing more quickly, our ability to train Iraqis to combat the \ninsurgency or the insurgency itself? His two-word response: The \ninsurgency. Unfortunately, in some regards we have even succeeded in \ndiscrediting the very cause for which we are fighting and dying today. \nI listened intently to the President's inaugural address on the steps \nof this Capitol in which he spoke repeatedly about the need to advocate \nfreedom and liberty and democracy around the world, not only because it \nis in our interest but because it is in the interest of peace and \nstability across the planet as a whole. In that regard he is right.\n\n  But I could not help but recall the words of a member of the Iraqi \nElectoral Commission, a Turkoman from Kirkuk, who finally looked at me \nin Baghdad and said: Senator, you do not understand. For too many of my \npeople, when they hear the word ``democracy,'' they think violence, \nthey think disorder, they think death and economic disintegration.\n  It does not get much sadder than that. It is heartbreaking that the \nsacrifices that have been made, the idealism of our troops, America's \nprospects for success in Iraq, our very standing in the world, have too \noften been undercut by ineptitude at the highest levels of our own \nGovernment.\n  I think of a visit, 6 months ago, with some of our colleagues to \nWalter Reed Army Hospital to visit with some of the soldiers who have \nreturned. They are constantly on my mind. I think of their idealism, \ntheir heroism, their perseverance in the face of an adversity that \nthose of us who are not there can hardly imagine.\n  We have a moral obligation to provide better leadership than that \nwhich has been provided in this conflict. Too often this administration \nhas suggested that the refusal to admit error, to learn from error, to \ncorrect error is a virtue. When lives and limbs are at stake, it is \nnot.\n  As a former executive of our own State, I have always believed that \naccountability for performance is vitally important to success. If this \nPresident will not provide it, then it is up to those of us in the \nSenate to do so.\n  I believe with all of my heart that our country is strongest when we \nstand for freedom and democracy. We are attempting to accomplish the \nright thing in Iraq. We have been the authors of much of our own \nmisery. As a result of that, I cannot find it in my heart or in my mind \nto vote for the promotion of Dr. Rice. Accountability is important. I \nwill vote no and urge my colleagues to do the same.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I have listened to some of the debate \non this nomination. It is unfortunate that we have lost focus about \nwhat we should be doing in the confirmation of the Secretary of State. \nI don't think rehashing potential mistakes some think may have been \nmade in the war on terrorism, specifically in Iraq, is something that \nshould be brought up as a reason to vote against Condoleezza Rice for \nSecretary of State.\n  I, for one, will say mistakes have been made. I don't think war is \never perfect. You can't make an outline and say this is how a war is \ngoing to go and expect it to go in that exact way. However, I don't \nthink anyone could have anticipated all that has happened or the kind \nof enemy that we face. An enemy that is willing to blow itself up to \nkill innocent people requires a different strategy and approach. We are \nmaking the adjustments.\n  One of the leaders who has kept a steady focus on the war on \nterrorism and our efforts in Iraq is the woman who is before us today. \nIt is Condoleezza Rice who has kept the steady aim and helped our \nPresident see all of the minefields out there. This has strengthened \nour country, to stay the course in the war on terrorism. The \nstabilization of Iraq is a step forward to promoting peace worldwide.\n  Condoleezza Rice is absolutely the most qualified person to succeed a \nwonderful Secretary of State, Colin Powell. What do you want in a \nSecretary of State? What do you look for? What would foreign leaders \nlook for in a Secretary of State?\n  No. 1: Somebody who has a deep understanding of foreign policy. \nCondoleezza Rice has had a 25-year career in foreign policy, an \nexemplary academic background, graduating with a Ph.D. in international \nstudies with a Russian focus--concentration on Russian history and \nRussian relations--cum laude and Phi Beta Kappa. She has the absolute \nability to do this job, unquestionably, and she has the experience. For \n25 years she has served three Presidents, been a key adviser in the one \nof the most tumultuous times of our history, and after 9/11, brought \nour country together by focusing on an\n\n[[Page S390]]\n\nenemy that is a new kind of enemy. Condoleezza Rice has done that, and \nshe has done a great job.\n  No. 2: In looking for a Secretary of State, you want someone who is \nknown to our country and known to foreign leaders. She will not be a \nstranger, speaking for our President. She is known to foreign leaders \nbecause as national security advisor, she has dealt with foreign \nleaders throughout the world. She has strong working relationships with \nworld leaders, foreign ministers, national security advisers, and our \nclosest allies. These relationships have been developed for over a \nquarter of a century. They will be valuable assets to our country and \nto her.\n  Having been a Soviet affairs specialist, who worked during the Cold \nWar, she helped guide our Nation's efforts to promote freedom and \ndemocracy throughout that part of the world in the emerging Soviet \nrepublics. She helped guide our Nation to promote freedom throughout \nthe world, by stressing the virtues of democracy, defying those who \nsuggested that communism was here to stay and Eastern Europe could not \nbe liberated. With the unification of Germany and the collapse of the \nSoviet Union, the Reagan administration made history with Condoleezza \nRice in a key position.\n  No 3: You want a Secretary of State to be a trusted adviser to the \nPresident. There is no doubt the President and Dr. Rice know each other \nwell. The President trusts her. And when foreign leaders talk to \nCondoleezza Rice, they will know she is speaking for the President, \nthrough offers made and pronouncements stated. Being a trusted adviser \nto the President is very important.\n  And, No. 4: You need someone who can manage a very large and \nimportant department of our Government with offices strewn throughout \nthe world and with ambassadors reporting affairs in those countries. It \nwill be important to have someone who is a good manager. She has served \nas Provost of Stanford University during her 6 years there, managing a \ndiverse population.\n\n  On a personal note, I wrote a book called ``American Heroines,'' and \none of the interviewees I had was Condoleezza Rice. I was talking to \ncontemporary women who have broken barriers, and I interviewed \nCondoleezza Rice. I asked her the question: What is the best \npreparation for the rough and tumble of your job? She said: Without a \ndoubt, being provost of Stanford University, because I dealt with 1,400 \nvery smart people who were basically independent contractors, and I had \nto learn when to persuade, when to inform, and when to demand.\n  If that isn't a recipe for Secretary of State, I don't know one: When \nto persuade, when to inform, and when to demand. Diplomats need to know \nwhen to do each of these and she has honed these skills during her time \nas National Security Adviser, and most certainly while managing the \n1,400-member faculty at Stanford University.\n  She has become a person uniquely qualified for this position. I am so \nproud to support her. She is a woman who is unflappable and has \ncomported herself with dignity through the most trying times, through \ntrying hearings and trying questioning. She has dealt with the largest \ncrisis that we have had in our country, surely in the last 25 years, 9/\n11, finding out who the enemy is, where that enemy was being trained, \nand trying to make sure that we had a strategy to combat it.\n  Condoleezza Rice will be a great Secretary of State. She will make \nher mark on this position as some of the best Secretaries of State in \nour history have done. She has the capability. She has the trusted ear \nof the President. She has the knowledge of foreign policy from 25 years \nof experience and relationships with heads of state and foreign \nministers, friend and enemy alike, and will work well with them.\n  She is going to collaborate when collaboration is called for in our \nforeign policy but more importantly, she will protect America when it \nis necessary.\n  I am proud of this nomination. I am proud of the President for \nbringing her in as National Security Adviser, working with her, \nlearning from her and teaching her at the same time. The relationship \nis perfect for the new challenge she will face.\n  She is up to this challenge. I have every faith in her. I hope our \ncolleagues will look to the future, look to what she can do, and will \nnot rehash things in the past for which she was not responsible. She \ndeserves the opportunity to represent our country, and, more important, \ngive the President of the United States the person he wants in this \njob. As we face a very difficult 4 years, he deserves to have the \nperson he chose. I hope the vote will be overwhelming.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nColorado.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I rise today in relation to the \nnomination of Dr. Rice to be Secretary of State. Section 2 of Article \nII of the Constitution obligates the Senate to advise and consent on \nthe President's nominees for his cabinet.\n  That is a solemn duty, to be sure. So let me be clear up front that I \nwill give my consent to Dr. Rice's nomination. I believe she is \nqualified for this important post and I am hopeful she will do an \noutstanding job advancing the interests and ideals of this great \ncountry.\n  As a U.S. Senator, given the gravity of the situation facing the \nUnited States in Iraq, I also want to take this moment to meet my \nobligation to advise Dr. Rice and the President.\n  I do this for one reason. We all serve here at the pleasure of the \ncitizens of our States. Our efforts fail or succeed based on the \ninformed consent of those citizens. Nowhere is that more clear than in \nthe areas of war and peace. The consequences of war are clear. Like so \nmany American families, my family knows the pain and sacrifice of war. \nMy relatives have been killed on the soils of Europe and other places.\n  In World War II, we lost nearly half a million Americans. In the war \nin Iraq, we have lost 1,371 soldiers and more than 10,000 have been \nwounded. I visited some of our young brave men and women at Walter Reed \nArmy Medical Center a few weeks ago and saw the struggles and pains of \nthem and their families as they suffered from the wounds of war.\n  I support our troops and I pray and hope that their efforts in Iraq \nwill have not been in vain and that the elections next week will usher \nin a new and free democracy in that nation.\n  Nor do I rise today out of some partisan spirit. In fact, over the \nlast 3 weeks I have very publicly and very clearly spoken in favor of \ntwo other cabinet nominees. This is a patriotic obligation, not a \npartisan exercise.\n  As we look to the future, I believe strongly we must reflect on the \npast and constantly review and assess our performance for lessons \nlearned for the American people. In fact, no one does a better job of \nthis than the United States military. It invests great manpower and \nhours in after-action reviews to ensure that its doctrine, planning and \nexecution were as good as it could have and should have been.\n  Such an after-action review for the aministration would, I think, \nreveal clear concerns. There has been a general lack of candor--to our \ntroops and their families, to our taxpayers and even, to some extent, \nto ourselves. Only by addressing this failure can we hope to ensure the \ncontinued informed consent of the American people for this historic \nundertaking in Iraq.\n  This morning's paper reports that the Army is preparing to keep the \nlevel of U.S. troops in Iraq unchanged through the next 2 years. It is \ntroubling because our troops have been told so many different things so \nmany times that I fear they no longer know what lies ahead in their \nfuture.\n  I have to believe that was a troubling headline to read for the \n150,000 families--including the more than 2,000 in Colorado--who have \nloved ones deployed to Iraq and the thousands of others who know that \ntheir loved ones will be redeploying to Iraq for a second or even a \nthird tour.\n  This morning's newspaper also reports that the administration will \nseek an additional $80 billion for ongoing operations in Iraq. This is \nover and above the more than $149 billion already appropriated for this \neffort. Compare that with what the aministration told the American \npeople on January 19, 2003, when it said that this entire effort would \ncost less than $50 billion.\n  I remind my colleagues that each and every dollar of this operation \nis money added to the deficit. That is money borrowed from foreign \ngovernments that will have to be paid for by our children.\n\n[[Page S391]]\n\n  As troubling as that deficit is, we will soon be faced with the \nchallenge of deciding how to pay for many domestic issues, including \nmost importantly, the health care our veterans have earned, and some \nare arguing we should tell the American people and our veterans that we \nsimply cannot afford a level of care they have come to expect.\n  Lastly, I am concerned about what can only be called a lack of \ncandor--and urgency--with ourselves and our decisions.\n  What else could explain the massive intelligence failures that \npreceded\n9/11--the failure to see what was coming from al-Qaida, despite the \nyears of its hateful rhetoric and despicable actions. And what else can \nexplain the slowness in creating the Department on Homeland Security, \nor the lack of support for the 9/11 Commission and its clarion call for \nintelligence reform in the face of this hateful enemy. And what else--\nunless it was that, counter to all warnings from our military, we \nconvinced ourselves that this effort in Iraq would be over in weeks, \nnot years--can account for the fact that now, nearly 2 years since the \nstart of this operation, our troops do not have the armor they need?\n  I end where I began, Mr. President. My advice is simple. To succeed \nin Iraq and elsewhere in the world, we need to heed the lessons learned \nover the past years. We need to be sure our intelligence is sound \nbefore we commit our troops, ensure our troops are prepared, and ensure \nour citizens are informed.\n  Educated, as she was, in Denver, I am confident Dr. Rice took to \nheart the candor and straight talk that we value in the West and in \nColorado. Those will be important attributes for her to employ as she \nbecomes Secretary of State.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I ask the Chair how much time remains on \nboth sides of the aisle for debate this afternoon?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority has 3 hours 35 minutes. The \nminority has 3 hours 39 minutes.\n  Mr. LUGAR. I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/01/25/senate-section/article/S391-1", "month": "01", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S391]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to declare my unqualified \nsupport for the President's nominee to be America's 66th Secretary of \nState, Dr. Condoleezza Rice.\n  Dr. Rice's fitness for the job is plain to every Member of this \nChamber. She has excelled in the foreign policy arena for 25 years and \nserved three Presidents. She has built lasting, personal relationships \nwith world leaders and foreign policymakers throughout the world. She \nhas been one of the main authors of America's new approach to foreign \npolicy in the aftermath of September 11. Most importantly, she has the \ncomplete trust and confidence of the President, and is perfectly poised \nto follow his leadership as America promotes freedom and democracy \nacross the globe. Dr. Rice is the ideal person to lead the State \nDepartment at this time. The Department's mission will be to shatter \nthe barriers to liberty and human dignity overseas, and Dr. Rice has \nalready broken many barriers in her relatively short lifetime.\n  This remarkable woman was born in Birmingham, AL, in the same year \nthat the Supreme Court of the United States handed down its Brown v. \nBoard of Education decision. Few then would have believed that a young \nAfrican-American girl, born under the heavy hand of Jim Crow, could one \nday become this Nation's chief diplomat. But Dr. Rice's mother, a music \nteacher named Angelina, and her father, the Reverend John Rice, knew \ntheir Condi was meant for great things, and Reverend Rice nicknamed his \ndaughter ``Little Star.''\n  Dr. Rice may not have inherited great financial wealth from her \nparents, but she did inherit a love of learning. Her parents were both \neducators and made sure their only child could read prodigiously by age \n5. At age 3, she had begun the piano lessons that would one day lead to \nher accompanying world-renowned cellist Yo-Yo Ma. She excelled in \nschool and received her bachelor's degree with honors at the age of 19. \nShe went on to earn her master's and Ph.D. in international studies, \nand later became, at age 38, the youngest provost in the history of \nStanford University.\n  Her accomplished career led to her appointment as Assistant to the \nPresident for National Security Affairs in 2001. In that role, Dr. Rice \nhas been at the center of some of the most important foreign policy \ndecisions since President Harry Truman, George Marshall and Dean \nAcheson navigated the beginning of the Cold War.\n  In the past 4 years, she has helped formulate a national security \nstrategy to protect the United States by draining the swamps that \npermit terrorism to flourish. She has been a key architect of the \nPresident's two-state solution in the Middle East--a policy that led to \nthe first free and democratic Palestinian elections ever.\n  She has helped develop a more secure relationship between the United \nStates and Russia, leading to record reductions in that country's \namount of nuclear warheads. She has helped craft the important six-\nparty talks designed to end North Korea's nuclear program.\n  She was at the center of the President's successful operation to \nremove the Taliban from Afghanistan and enable the Afghan people to \npractice democracy for the first time ever.\n  I might say, just having been in Afghanistan within the last couple \nof weeks, it is an enormous success story that we all have a right to \nfeel proud about.\n  She led the effort to remove Saddam Hussein from power in Iraq, \neliminate the possibility of his ever unleashing weapons of mass \ndestruction, and liberate over 25 million Iraqis from his reign of \nterror.\n  We need Dr. Rice's leadership at this crucial time in America's \nhistory. As President Bush so eloquently stated last week in his second \ninaugural address, our country's safety is inextricably tied to the \nprogress of freedom in faraway lands. Those lands are not so far away \nanymore. Two vast oceans are no defense against a small band of \nterrorists with a dirty bomb, a vial of ricin, or boxcutters.\n  In the post-September 11 world, our national security depends heavily \non our foreign policy, and our foreign policy will be determined \nlargely by our national security needs. Because the light of liberty \nchases away the shadows of resentment, intolerance, and violence that \nlead to attacks on America, it is in America's interests to promote \nfreedom and democracy in every corner of the globe.\n  Democracy and economic development are crucial components to winning \nthe global war on terror. Soon, if we finish our mission, Iraq will be \na beacon of economic and political freedom in the Middle East, and the \nrogue despots of the region will watch helplessly as their citizens \ndemand the freedoms and economic prosperity enjoyed by their Iraqi \nneighbors. That day will be very uncomfortable for them--and a victory \nfor the free world.\n  The Department of State must be a primary actor in this mission, \nbecause American diplomacy will be the primary force to create a world \nmore favored toward freedom. The global war on terror requires us to \ncooperate with other nations more than any other global conflict \nbefore. It requires focus in parts of the world that were unfamiliar to \nmany Americans 3 years ago. We will need to argue the virtues of \nliberty and democracy to an audience that may be hearing such arguments \nfor the first time.\n  America will need to rely on the multinational institutions that have\n\n[[Page S392]]\n\nserved her so well in the past to succeed in this new era. Our \nrelations with NATO, the European Union, and other partners must be \nreassured and reaffirmed. And, just as we formed coalitions of the \nwilling to liberate Afghanistan and Iraq, we should continue to \ncultivate alliances of democracies when the need arises, to serve as an \nexample to the world that the best method of governing is to seek the \nconsent of the governed.\n  For all of these hard tasks before us, I can think of no better \nperson to ensure success than Dr. Rice. Her personal courage is \neclipsed only by her professional pre-eminence. Her parents aptly named \nher ``Condoleezza'' after the Italian musical term ``con dolcezza'' \nwhich is a direction to play ``with sweetness.'' But she is also \nbrilliant, compassionate, and determined to advance the President's \nvision of a world free from despotism.\n  The State Department will play the lead in American foreign policy. \nIts foreign-service officers are the face of America to millions \nworldwide. What better way to empower them than by confirming the \nPresident's most-trusted advisor as Secretary of State?\n  I wish to address briefly the criticisms that some of my colleagues \nhave directed at Dr. Rice. As far as I can tell, no one has impugned \nher ability or moral integrity. Most of the criticisms seem to rest on \nthe concern that she will not make it her primary mission as Secretary \nof State to disagree with the President.\n  Think about that. Some would suggest that the Secretary of State's \njob is to oppose the President's policies. The Senate has not attempted \nto so micromanage the relationship between the President and a cabinet \nofficer since passing the Tenure of Office Act.\n  Let me be clear to my colleagues: It is the role of the President to \nset foreign policy. It is the role of the Secretary of State to execute \nit.\n  Of course, as America's top diplomat, Dr. Rice will be expected to \nbring her expertise on a wide variety of issues to the table. The \nPresident has chosen her because he values her opinion. But all foreign \npolicy decisions ultimately rest with the President. For some to \nsuggest that a Secretary of State should be some kind of agitator-in-\nresidence, constantly complicating the implementation of policy, is \nirresponsible.\n  Furthermore, Dr. Rice enthusiastically subscribes to President Bush's \ndoctrine of spreading liberty. She was in the White House on September \n11 when it was feared the building would come under attack. From a \nbunker beneath the White House, she watched the footage of those two \nplanes striking the Twin Towers over and over. She was with the \nPresident that night, when he first formulated the policy that America \nwould make no distinction between the terrorists who committed those \nevil acts and those who harbored them.\n  Dr. Rice was with the President during Operation Enduring Freedom. \nShe was with him when he made the case to the United Nations that \nSaddam Hussein must face serious consequences. And she was with the \nPresident when he decided to liberate Iraq and the world from Saddam \nHussein's evil intent.\n  After sharing so many searing experiences, President Bush and Dr. \nRice now share a vision for responding to them. This should be no \nsurprise.\n  Like the President, Dr. Rice realizes that the challenges we face \ntoday are daunting and will take generations to overcome. Winning the \nGlobal War on Terror and spreading peace and freedom will not be easy. \nBut few things worth doing are. This administration has taken the long \nview, and is committed to a long-term strategy, the reward for which is \nyears in the future. Posterity will thank them, and this Congress, for \nseeing the fight through.\n  The liberation of Iraq was the right thing to do. We removed a tyrant \nwho had both the means and the motive to attack America or her \ninterests. I urge my colleagues who focus only on the setbacks, \nmistakes, or tragedies of Operation Iraqi Freedom: Take the long view.\n  If there had been as many television cameras at Omaha Beach on D-Day \nas there are in this chamber today, General Eisenhower would have been \nfired before sunset. War is messy, but history tells us we must see our \nfights through to the end. The goal of spreading peace and freedom in \nthe Middle East is too important to suffer hypercritical, politicized \nattacks.\n  I am happy to praise Dr. Rice today. My experiences with her over the \nyears justify every word I have said. But we should not be debating her \nnomination today. This Senate should have confirmed her on January 20.\n  Finally, I wish to leave you with a question for every Member of this \nbody to ponder. It is too easy to snipe from the sidelines at nominees \nlike Dr. Rice, who are willing to make great sacrifices to serve their \ncountry. So I ask, what positive actions can this Senate take to \nfurther the spread of peace, liberty and democracy over the globe?\n  I would refer my colleagues to the Asia Freedom Act of 2004, which \nSenator Lugar and I proposed last November. The act provides an \nintegrated and coherent framework for U.S. policy towards North and \nSoutheast Asia. It ties U.S. foreign aid to commitments from \ngovernments in the region to better their records in democracy, civil \nliberties, cooperation in the global war on terror, and several other \nareas. It requires the State Department to judge these governments not \nby what they say, but rather the concrete actions they undertake to \nfurther democracy, security and stability in the region.\n  This act would contribute to the march of freedom from sea to sea. \nThis is the kind of business this Senate should be focusing on. \nAdvancing freedom, attacking terrorism and ending tyranny is the \nmission of our time. I have no doubt that this Senate recognizes that \nand will act with commensurate speed and wisdom.\n  America has passed weighty tests before. Sixty years ago, emerging \nwearily from a great war, this country began the struggle with another \nseemingly entrenched enemy--the Soviet Union and its scourge of \nCommunism. When that battle began, Americans could not know when it \nwould end. But they knew they had to fight it. In 1947, President Harry \nTruman spoke to a joint session of Congress about this new Cold War. He \nsaid, ``Great responsibilities have been placed upon us by the swift \nmovement of events. I am confident that the Congress will face these \nresponsibilities squarely.''\n  Now it falls to us to face our responsibilities just as squarely. We \ncan, we will, and we must.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Isakson). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, how much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time is 60 minutes.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, in Federalist No. 77, Alexander Hamilton wrote:\n\n       It will readily be comprehended, that a man who had himself \n     the sole disposition of offices, would be governed much more \n     by his private inclinations and interests, than when he was \n     bound to submit the propriety of his choice to the discussion \n     and determination of a different and independent body, and \n     that body an entire branch of the legislature. The \n     possibility of rejection would be a strong motive to care in \n     proposing.\n\n  Although Hamilton explains the importance of the role of the Senate \nin the appointment of officers of the United States, neither he nor the \nConstitution is specific about what criteria Senators must use to judge \nthe qualifications of a nominee. The Constitution only requires that \nthe Senate give its advice and consent. It is therefore left to \nSenators to use their own judgment in considering their vote. The \nfactors involved in such judgments may vary among Senators, among \nnominees, and may even change in response to the needs of the times.\n  The position of Secretary of State is among the most important \noffices for which the Constitution requires the advice and the consent \nof the Senate. It is the Secretary of State who sits at the right hand \nof the President during meetings of the President's Cabinet. The \nSecretary of State is all the more important today, considering the \nenormous diplomatic challenges our country will face in the next 4 \nyears.\n  I commend the Foreign Relations Committee for its work in bringing \nthe\n\n[[Page S393]]\n\nnomination of Dr. Condoleezza Rice to the Senate. Chairman Richard \nLugar conducted 2 days of hearings for this nominee and the debate that \nbegan in the committee on this nomination is now being continued on the \nfloor of the Senate. Senator Biden also provided a voice in great \nforeign policy experience during those hearings. I was particularly \nimpressed by Senator Boxer who tackled her role on the committee with \npassion and with forthrightness, as did Senator Kerry.\n  There is no doubt that Dr. Rice has a remarkable record of personal \nachievement. She obtained her bachelor's degree at the tender age of \n19--get that. Speaking as someone who did not earn a bachelor's degree \nuntil I had reached 77 years of age, I have a special appreciation for \nDr. Rice's impressive academic achievement. It was a remarkable \nachievement indeed.\n  She then obtained a doctorate in international studies and quickly \nrose through the academic ranks to become provost of Stanford \nUniversity. Dr. Rice has also gathered extensive experience in foreign \npolicy matters. She is a recognized expert on matters relating to \nRussia and the former Soviet Union. She has twice worked on the \nNational Security Council, once as the senior adviser on Soviet issues \nand most recently for 4 years as National Security Adviser.\n  Dr. Rice has had ample exposure to the nuances of international \npolitics and by that measure she is certainly qualified for the \nposition of Secretary of State.\n\n  The next Secretary of State will have large shoes to fill. I have \nclosely watched the career of Colin Powell since he served as National \nSecurity Adviser to President Reagan and we worked together during the \nSenate consideration of the INF treaty of 1988. Colin Powell \ndistinguished himself in his service as chairman of the Joint Chiefs of \nStaff, particularly during the 1991 Gulf War. When his nomination came \nbefore the Senate in 2001, I supported his confirmation and I supported \nit strongly based upon the strength of his record.\n  The vote that the Senate will conduct tomorrow, however, is not \nsimply a formality to approve of a nominee's educational achievement or \nlevel of expertise. I do not subscribe to the notion that the Senate \nmust confirm a President's nominees barring criminality or lack of \nexperience. The Constitution enjoins Senators to use their judgment in \nconsidering nominations. I am particularly dismayed by accusations I \nhave read that Senate Democrats, by insisting on having an opportunity \nto debate the nomination of Dr. Rice, have somehow been engaged in \nnothing more substantial than ``petty politics,'' partisan delaying \ntactics. Nothing, nothing, nothing could be further from the truth.\n  The Senate's role of advice and consent to Presidential nominations \nis not a ceremonial exercise. Here is the proof. Here is the record. \nHere is the document that requires more than just a ceremonial \nexercise.\n  I have stood in the Senate more times than I can count to defend the \nprerogatives of this institution and the separate but equal--with \nemphasis on the word ``equal''--powers of the three branches of \nGovernment. A unique power of the legislative branch is the Senate's \nrole in providing advice and consent on the matter of nominations. That \npower is not vested in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, it is \nnot vested in any other committee, nor does it repose in a handful of \nSenate leaders. It is not a function of pomp and circumstance, and it \nwas never intended by the Framers to be used to burnish the image of a \nPresident on Inauguration Day. Yet that is exactly what Senators were \nbeing pressured to do last week, to acquiesce mutely to the nomination \nof one of the most important members on the President's Cabinet without \nthe slightest hiccup of debate or the smallest inconvenience of a \nrollcall vote.\n\n  And so, Mr. President, we are here today to fulfill our \nconstitutional duty to consider the nomination of Dr. Rice to be \nSecretary of State.\n  I have carefully considered Dr. Rice's record as National Security \nAdviser in the 2 months that have passed since the President announced \nher nomination to be Secretary of State, and that record, I am afraid, \nis one of intimate--intimate--involvement in a number of administration \nforeign policies which I strongly oppose. These policies have fostered \nenormous opposition, both at home and abroad, to the White House's view \nof America's place in the world.\n  That view of America is one which encourages our Nation to flex its \nmuscles without being bound by any calls for restraint. The most \nforceful explanation of this idea can be found in the ``National \nSecurity Strategy of the United States,'' a report which was issued by \nthe White House in September 2002. Under this strategy, the President \nlays claim to an expansive power to use our military to strike other \nnations first, even if we have not been threatened or provoked to do \nso.\n  There is no question, of course, that the President of the United \nStates has the inherent authority to repel attacks against our country, \nbut this National Security Strategy is unconstitutional on its face. It \ntakes the checks and balances established in the Constitution that \nlimit the President's ability to use our military at his pleasure and \nthrows them out the window.\n  This doctrine of preemptive strikes places the sole decision of war \nand peace in the hands of a President--one man or woman--and undermines \nthe constitutional power of Congress to declare war. The Founding \nFathers required that such an important issue of war be debated by the \nelected representatives of the people, the people out there, in the \nlegislative branch precisely, because no single man could be trusted \nwith such an awesome power as bringing a nation to war by his decision \nalone. And yet that is exactly what the National Security Strategy \nproposes.\n  Not only does this pernicious doctrine of preemptive war contradict \nthe Constitution, it barely acknowledges the Constitution's existence. \nThe National Security Strategy makes only one passing reference, one \nsmall passing reference, to the Constitution. It states that \n``America's constitution''--that is ``constitution'' with a small \n``c''--``has served us well''--as if the Constitution does not still \nserve this country well. One might ask if that reference to the \nConstitution is intended to be a compliment or an obituary.\n  As National Security Adviser, Dr. Rice was in charge of developing \nthe National Security Strategy. She also spoke out forcefully in favor \nof the dangerous doctrine of preemptive war. In one speech, she argues \nthat there need not be an imminent threat before the United States \nattacked another nation. ``So as a matter of common sense,'' said Dr. \nRice, on October 1, 2002, ``the United States must be prepared to take \naction, when necessary, before threats have fully materialized.'' But \nthat ``matter of common sense'' is nowhere to be found in the \nConstitution. For that matter, isn't it possible to disagree with this \n``matter of common sense''? What is common sense to one might not be \nshared by another. What's more, matters of common sense can lead people \nto the wrong conclusions. John Dickinson, the chief author of the \nArticles of Confederation, said in 1787, ``Experience must be our only \nguide; reason may mislead us.''\n\n  As for me, I will heed the experience of the Founding Fathers as \nenshrined in the Constitution over the reason and ``common sense'' of \nthe administration's National Security Strategy.\n  We can all agree that the President, any President, has the inherent \nduty and power to repel an attack on the United States. He doesn't have \nto call Congress into session to do that. That is a matter that \nconfronts the Nation immediately and the people and our institutions \nare in imminent danger.\n  But where in the Constitution can the President claim the right to \nstrike another nation before it has even threatened our country, as Dr. \nRice asserted in that speech? To put it plainly, Dr. Rice has asserted \nthat the President holds far more of the warpower than the Constitution \ngrants him.\n  This doctrine of attacking countries before a threat has ``fully \nmaterialized'' was put into motion as soon as the National Security \nStrategy was released.\n  Beginning in September 2002, Dr. Rice also took a position on the \nfrontlines of the administration's efforts to hype the danger of \nSaddam's weapons of mass destruction. Dr. Rice is responsible for some \nof the most overblown rhetoric that the administration used to scare \nthe American\n\n[[Page S394]]\n\npeople into believing there was an imminent threat from Iraq. On \nSeptember 8, 2002, Dr. Rice conjured visions of American citizens being \nconsumed by mushroom clouds. On an appearance on CNN, she warned, ``The \nproblem here is that there will always be some uncertainty about how \nquickly he,'' meaning Saddam, ``can acquire nuclear weapons. But we \ndon't want the smoking gun to be a mushroom cloud.''\n  Dr. Rice also claimed that she had conclusive evidence about Iraq's \nalleged nuclear weapons program. During that same interview, she also \nsaid:\n\n       We do know that he is actively pursuing a nuclear weapon. \n     We do know that there have been shipments going into . . . \n     Iraq, for instance, of aluminum tubes . . . that are really \n     only suited for nuclear weapons programs.\n\n  Well, my fellow Senators, we now know that Iraq's nuclear program was \na fiction. Charles Duelfer, the chief arms inspector of the CIA's Iraq \nSurvey Group, reported on September 30, 2004 as follows:\n\n       Saddam Husayn ended the nuclear program in 1991 following \n     the Gulf War. [The Iraq Survey Group] found no evidence to \n     suggest concerted efforts to restart the program.\n\n  But Dr. Rice's statements in 2002 were not only wrong, they also did \nnot accurately reflect the intelligence reports of the time. \nDeclassified portions of the CIA's National Intelligence Estimate from \nOctober 2002 make it abundantly clear that there were disagreements \namong our intelligence analysts about the state of Iraq's nuclear \nprogram. But Dr. Rice seriously misrepresented their disputes when she \ncategorically stated:\n\n       We do know that [Saddam] is actively pursuing a nuclear \n     weapon.\n\n  Her allegation also misrepresented to the American people the \ncontroversy in those same intelligence reports about the aluminum \ntubes. Again, Dr. Rice said that these tubes were ``really only suited \nfor nuclear weapons programs.'' But intelligence experts at the State \nDepartment and the Department of Energy believed that those tubes had \nnothing to do with building a nuclear weapon, and they made their \ndissent known in the October 2002 National Intelligence Estimate. This \nview, which was at odds with Dr. Rice's representations, was later \nconfirmed by the International Atomic Energy Agency and our own CIA \narms inspectors.\n  Well, Dr. Rice made other statements that helped to build a case for \nwar by implying a link--a link--between Iraq and September 11. On \nmultiple occasions, Dr. Rice spoke about the supposed evidence that \nSaddam and al-Qaida were in league with each other. For example, on \nSeptember 25, 2002, Dr. Rice said on the PBS NewsHour:\n\n       No one is trying to make an argument at this point that \n     Saddam Hussein somehow had operational control of what \n     happened on September 11, so we don't want to push this too \n     far, but this is a story that is unfolding, and it is getting \n     clear, and we're learning more. . . . But yes, there clearly \n     are contact[s] between Al Qaeda and Iraq that can be \n     documented; there clearly is testimony that some of the \n     contacts have been important contacts and that there is a \n     relationship there.\n\n  Well, what Dr. Rice did not say was that some of those supposed links \nwere being called into question by our intelligence agencies, such as \nthe alleged meeting between a 9/11 ringleader and an Iraqi intelligence \nagent in Prague that has now been debunked. These attempts to connect \nIraq and al-Qaida appear to be a prime example of cherry-picking \nintelligence to hype the supposed threat of Iraq while keeping contrary \nevidence away from the American people, wrapped up in the redtape of \ntop secret reports.\n  Dr. Rice pressed the point even further, creating scenarios that \nthreatened tens of thousands of American lives, even when that threat \nwas not supported by intelligence. On March 9, 2003, just 11 days \nbefore the invasion of Iraq, Dr. Rice appeared--where?--on Face the \nNation. What did she say? She said:\n\n       Now the al-Qaida is an organization that's quite dispersed \n     and--and quite widespread in its effects, but it clearly has \n     had links to the Iraqis, not to mention Iraqi links to all \n     kinds of other terrorists. And what we do not want is the day \n     when Saddam Hussein decides that he's had enough of dealing \n     with sanctions, enough of dealing with, quote, unquote, \n     ``containment,'' enough of dealing with America, and it's \n     time to end it on his terms, by transferring one of these \n     weapons, just a little vial of something, to a terrorist for \n     blackmail or for worse.\n\n  How scary is that?\n  But the intelligence community had already addressed this scenario \nwith great skepticism. In fact, the CIA's National Intelligence \nEstimate from October 2002 concluded that it had ``low confidence'' \nthat Saddam would ever transfer any weapons of mass destruction--\nweapons that he did not have, as it turned out--to anyone outside of \nhis control. This is yet more evidence of an abuse of intelligence in \norder to build the case for an unprovoked war with Iraq.\n  And what has been the effect of the first use of this reckless \ndoctrine of preemptive war? In a most ironic and deadly twist, the \nfalse situation described by the administration before the war, namely, \nthat Iraq was a training ground for terrorists poised to attack the \nUnited States, is exactly the situation that our war in Iraq has \ncreated.\n  But it was this unjustified war that created the situation that the \nPresident claimed he was trying to prevent. Violent extremists have \nflooded into Iraq from all corners of the world. Iraqis have taken up \narms themselves to fight against the continuing U.S. occupation of \ntheir country.\n  According to a CIA report released in December 2004, intelligence \nanalysts now see Iraq, destabilized by the administration's ill-\nconceived war, as the training ground for a new generation of \nterrorists. That is from the report ``Mapping the Global Future: Report \nof the National Intelligence Council's 2020 Project,'' page 94.\n  It should be profoundly disturbing to all Americans if the most \ndangerous breeding ground for terrorism has shifted from Afghanistan to \nIraq simply because of the administration's ill-advised rush to war in \nMarch 2003.\n  Dr. Rice's role in the war against Iraq was not limited to building \nthe case for an unprecedented, preemptive invasion of a country that \nhad not attacked us first. Her role also extends to the \nadministration's failed efforts to establish peace in Iraq.\n  In October 2003, 5 months after he declared ``mission accomplished,'' \nthe President created the Iraq Stabilization Group, headed by Dr. Rice. \nThe task of the Iraq Stabilization Group was to coordinate efforts to \nspeed reconstruction aid to help bring the violence in Iraq to an end.\n  But what has the Iraq Stabilization Group accomplished under the \nleadership of Dr. Rice? When she took the helm of the stabilization \ngroup, 319 U.S. troops had been killed in Iraq. That number now stands \nat 1,368, as of today, Tuesday, January 25, 2005. More than 10,600 \ntroops have been wounded, and what horrible wounds. The cost of the war \nhas spiraled to $149 billion. That is $149 for every minute since Jesus \nChrist was born. And the White House is on the verge of asking Congress \nfor another $80 billion.\n  Despite the mandate of the Iraq Stabilization Group, the situation in \nIraq has gone from bad to worse. More ominously, the level of violence \nonly keeps growing week after week after week, month after month, and \nno administration official, whether from the White House, the Pentagon, \nor Foggy Bottom has made any predictions about when the violence will \nfinally subside.\n  Furthermore, of the $18.4 billion in Iraqi reconstruction aid \nappropriated by Congress in October 2003, the administration has spent \nonly $2.7 billion. Now, with these funds moving so slowly, it is hard \nto believe that the Iraq Stabilization Group has had any success at all \nin speeding the reconstruction efforts in Iraq. For all of the hue and \ncry about the need to speed up aid to Iraq, one wonders if there should \nbe more tough questions asked of Dr. Rice about what she has \naccomplished as the head of this group.\n  There are also many unanswered questions about Dr. Rice's record as \nthe National Security Adviser. Richard Clarke, the former White House \ncounterterrorism adviser, had leveled scathing criticism against Dr. \nRice and the National Security Council for failing to recognize the \nthreat from al-Qaida and Osama bin Laden in the months leading up to \nthe September 11, 2001, terrorist attack. In particular, Mr. Clarke \nstates that he submitted a request on January 25, 2001, for an urgent \nmeeting of the National Security Council on the threat of al-Qaida.\n  However, due to decisions made by Dr. Rice and her staff, that urgent \nmeeting did not occur until too late. The meeting was not actually \ncalled until September 4, 2001.\n\n[[Page S395]]\n\n  Mr. Clarke, who was widely acknowledged as one of the Government's \nleading authorities on terrorism at that time, told the 9/11 Commission \nhe was so frustrated with those decisions that he asked to be \nreassigned to different issues and the Bush White House approved that \nrequest.\n  Dr. Rice appeared before the 9/11 Commission on April 8, 2004, but, \nif anything, her testimony raised only more questions about what the \nPresident and others knew about the threat to New York City and \nWashington, DC, in the weeks before the attacks, and whether more could \nhave been done to prevent them.\n  Why wasn't any action taken when she and the President received an \nintelligence report on August 6, 2001, entitled ``Bin Laden Determined \nto Attack Inside the United States''? Why did Dr. Rice and President \nBush reassign Richard Clarke, the leading terrorism expert in the White \nHouse, soon after taking office in 2001? Why did it take 9 months for \nDr. Rice to call the first high-level National Security Council meeting \non the threat of Osama bin Laden?\n\n  As the Senate debates her nomination today, we still have not heard \nfull answers from Dr. Rice to these questions.\n  In addition to Mr. Clarke's criticism, Dr. David Kay, the former CIA \nweapons inspector in Iraq, also has strong words for the National \nSecurity Council and its role in the runup to the war in Iraq. When Dr. \nKay appeared before the Senate Intelligence Committee on August 18, \n2004, to analyze why the administration's prewar intelligence was so \nwrong about weapons of mass destruction, he described the National \nSecurity Council as the ``dog that didn't bark'' to warn the President \nabout the weaknesses of those intelligence reports.\n  Dr. Kay continued:\n\n       Every President who has been successful, at least that I \n     know of, in the history of this republic, has developed both \n     informal and formal means of getting checks on whether people \n     who tell him things are in fact telling him the whole truth. \n     . . . The recent history has been a reliance on the NSC \n     system to do it. I quite frankly think that that has not \n     served this President very well.\n\n  What Dr. Kay appeared to state was his view that the National \nSecurity Council, under the leadership of Dr. Rice, did not do a \nsufficient job of raising doubts about the quality of the intelligence \nabout Iraq. On the contrary, based upon Dr. Rice's statements that I \nquoted earlier, her rhetoric even went beyond the questionable \nintelligence that the CIA had available on Iraq in order to hype the \nthreats of aluminum tubes, mushroom clouds, and connections between \nIraq and September 11.\n  In light of the massive reorganization of our intelligence agencies \nenacted by Congress last year, shouldn't this nomination spur the \nSenate to stop, look, and listen about what has been going on in the \nNational Security Council for the last 4 years? Don't these serious \nquestions about the failings of the National Security Council under Dr. \nRice deserve a more thorough examination before the Senate votes to \nconfirm her as the next Secretary of State?\n  Mr. President, accountability has become an old-fashioned notion in \nsome circles these days. But accountability is not a negotiable \ncommodity when it comes to the highest circles of our Nation's \nGovernment. The accountability of Government officials is an \nobligation, not a luxury. Yet accountability is an obligation that this \nPresident and this President's administration appear loathe to fulfill.\n  Instead of being held to account for their actions, the architects of \nthe policies that led our Nation down the road into war with Iraq, \npolicies based on faulty intelligence and phantom weapons of mass \ndestruction, have been rewarded by the President with accolades and \npromotions. Instead of admitting to mistakes in the war on Iraq, \ninstead of admitting to its disastrous aftermath, the President and his \ninner circle of advisers continue to cling to myths and misconceptions.\n  The only notion of accountability that this President is willing to \nacknowledge is the November elections, which he has described as a \nmoment of accountability and an endorsement of his policies. \nUnfortunately, after-the-fact validation of victory is hardly the \nstandard of accountability that the American people have the right to \nexpect from their elected officials. It is one thing to accept \nresponsibility for success; it is quite another to accept \naccountability for failure. Sadly, failure has tainted far too many \naspects of our Nation's international policies over the past 4 years, \nculminating in the deadly insurgency that has resulted from the \ninvasion of Iraq.\n  With respect to this particular nomination, I believe there needs to \nbe accountability for the mistakes and missteps that have led the \nUnited States into the dilemma in which it finds itself today, besieged \nby increasing violence in Iraq, battling an unprecedented decline in \nworld opinion, and increasingly isolated from our allies due to our \nprovocative, belligerent, bellicose, and unilateralist foreign policy. \nWhether the administration will continue to pursue these policies \ncannot be known to Senators today as we prepare to cast our vote. At \nher confirmation hearing on January 18, Dr. Rice proclaimed that our \ninteraction with the rest of the world must be a conversation, not a \nmonologue, but 2 days later, President Bush gave an inaugural address \nthat seemed to rattle sabers at any nation that he does not consider to \nbe free.\n  Before Senators cast their votes, we must wonder whether we are \ncasting our lot for more diplomacy or more belligerence, \nreconciliation, or more confrontation. Which face of this Dr. Jekyll \nand Mr. Hyde foreign policy will be revealed in the next 4 years?\n  Although I do not question her credentials, I do oppose many of the \ncritical decisions Dr. Rice has made during her 4 years as National \nSecurity Adviser. She has a record, and the record is there for us to \njudge. There remain too many unanswered questions about Dr. Rice's \nfailure to protect our country before the tragic attacks of September \n11, her public efforts to politicize intelligence, and her often stated \nallegiance to the doctrine of preemption.\n  To confirm Dr. Rice to be the next Secretary of State is to say to \nthe American people and to the world that the answers to those \nquestions are no longer important. Her confirmation will almost \ncertainly be viewed as another endorsement of the administration's \nunconstitutional doctrine of preemptive strikes, its bullying policies \nof unilateralism, and its callous rejection of our longstanding allies.\n  Dr. Rice's record in many ways is one to be greatly admired. She is a \nvery intelligent lady, very knowledgeable about the subject matter, \nvery warm and congenial, but the stakes for the United States are too \nhigh. I cannot endorse higher responsibilities for those who helped to \nset our great country down the path of increasing isolation, enmity in \nthe world, and a war that has no end. When will our boys come home? \nWhen will our men and women be able to sit down at the table with their \nfamilies and their friends in their own communities again? For these \nreasons, I shall cast my vote in opposition to the confirmation of \nCondoleezza Rice to be the next Secretary of State.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska is recognized.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I rise today in support of President Bush's \nnominee for Secretary of State, Dr. Condoleezza Rice.\n  Hers is a remarkable personal story, from her upbringing in \nBirmingham, AL, during the era of Bull Connor, to the White House, to \nher nomination as Secretary of State. She is a woman of many parts, an \naccomplished musician, a leading academic and policy intellectual, and \na dedicated public official. This is a nomination all of America can be \nproud of.\n  Dr. Rice has served with distinction as assistant to the President \nfor national security, as well as in other National Security Council \npositions. She comes to this job well-qualified and prepared to take on \nher new responsibilities.\n  America's challenges over the next four years will be formidable. \nU.S. foreign policy cannot be separated from our energy, economic, \ndefense and domestic policies. It all falls within the ``arch of our \nnational interest.'' There will be windows of opportunity, but they \nwill open and close quickly.\n  Foreign policy will require a strategic agility that, whenever \npossible, gets ahead of problems, strengthens U.S. security and \nalliances, and promotes American interests, credibility, and global \nfreedom.\n\n[[Page S396]]\n\n  Last week, Dr. Rice faced approximately 11 hours of probing and \ndifficult questions about U.S. foreign policy, including the war in \nIraq. Dr. Rice deserves credit for her thoughtful answers, patience, \nand I might say, grace under that questioning.\n  In her testimony, Dr. Rice said that, ``the time for diplomacy is \nnow.'' She understands that our success in the war on terrorism, Iraq, \nthe Middle East, and throughout the world depends on the strength of \nour alliances. Our alliances should be understood as a means to expand \nour influence, not as a constraint on our power. The expansion of \ndemocracy and freedom in the world should be a shared interest and \nvalue with all nations.\n  Dr. Rice also noted that, ``America and all free nations are facing a \ngenerational struggle against a new and deadly ideology of hatred that \nwe cannot ignore.'' She stressed the importance of public diplomacy to \ncounter this ideology of hate, including increasing our exchanges with \nthe rest of the world. A unilateralist course would only complicate our \nrelations with the Muslim world.\n  Dr. Rice's nomination has offered an opportunity for the Senate to \nconsider not only the merits of the nominee, but the foreign policy \nchallenges that we face. The Senate should be a forum for debate about \nforeign policy.\n  The former Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, J. \nWilliam Fulbright, observed that the Congress has a:\n\n     traditional responsibility, in keeping with the spirit if not \n     the precise words of the Constitution, to serve as a forum of \n     diverse opinions and as a channel of communication between \n     the American people and their government.\n\n  Chairman Lugar's distinguished leadership of the Foreign Relations \nCommittee has been in concert with the former chairman's words.\n  Senator Fulbright received criticism for holding public hearings on \nVietnam, especially with a President of his own party in office.\n  He later wrote that he held those hearings:\n\n     in the hope of helping to shape a true consensus in the long \n     run, even at the cost of dispelling the image of a false one \n     in the short run.\n\n  The Senate should not be party to a false consensus on Iraq. The \nstakes are too high.\n  America is fighting a counter-insurgency war in a complicated and \ndiverse region, in a country with an intense and long standing anti-\ncolonial tradition, deep ethnic and sectarian divisions, and a \npolitical system and culture brutalized for more than three decades by \na tyrannical dictatorship, more than a decade of international \nsanctions, and three costly wars.\n  America's exit strategy for Iraq is linked to the capabilities of the \nIraqi government and security forces to take responsibility for their \nfuture. That has not yet happened. Iraq may be free, but it is not yet \nstable, secure, or governable. Since Iraq's liberation, American and \ncoalition forces are what have held the country together.\n  Despite the sacrifice and courage of our brave men and women fighting \nin Iraq, and the sacrifice and courage of many Iraqis, the Iraqi state \ncannot yet reliably deliver services or security to its people.\n  The elections on January 30 will be a critical benchmark for Iraqi \nsovereignty. Elections alone will not bring stability and security to \nIraq. But they are an essential and historic step.\n  All Americans should be concerned about what is happening in Iraq. \nIraq will influence and constrain America's foreign policy for years to \ncome. It is our top foreign policy priority, and there are no easy \nanswers or easy options.\n  Hopefully, Iraq will someday be a democratic example for the Middle \nEast. But Iraq could also become a failed state. We cannot let this \nhappen.\n  These are big issues that will affect every American in some way. The \nSenate is an appropriate forum to debate our policies that will be \napplied to dealing with these issues.\n  To sustain any foreign policy will require the informed consent of \nthe American people through their voices in Congress. Dr. Rice \nunderstands this clearly.\n  Let me conclude by once again noting that Dr. Rice has the \nintelligence, experience, and integrity for this job. She has the \nPresident's confidence.\n  In my interactions and conversations with Dr. Rice over the last four \nyears, she has always been candid and honest, and she listens. It is \nalso important that Dr. Rice always be brutally frank with the \nPresident. She must give him the bad news as well as the good news, and \nwhen she disagrees with other members of the Cabinet and the President \nand Vice President, she must say so. I believe she will do that.\n  I look forward to working with Dr. Rice in support of American \ninterests and security. I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of her \nnomination.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the distinguished Senator \nfrom Virginia, Mr. Allen.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, I rise today to voice my strong support of \nthe nomination of Dr. Condoleezza Rice to be our next Secretary of \nState. She comes to this position and this nomination with unquestioned \ncredentials and the experience to carry out the U.S. foreign policy \nduring these very trying times. She is, in my view, the personification \nof the American dream. Although she grew up in the days of segregation, \napplying herself and working hard allowed her to advance through \nacademia, and clearly also in this President's administration.\n  The goals of this administration are not just the goals of the Bush \nadministration; they ought to be the goals of America and all other \nfreedom-loving people around the world.\n  Dr. Rice, in her testimony before the Foreign Relations Committee, \ntalked about the advancement of freedom. The President mentioned it \nseveral times in his inaugural address. What we aim to do as Americans, \nfor our own security but also because of our care for fellow human \nbeings here on this Earth, is to make sure they have freedom--freedom \nof opportunity regardless of one's race, ethnicity, gender, or \nreligious beliefs.\n  We are trying to advance what I like to call the four pillars of \nfreedom: No. 1, freedom of religion; No. 2, freedom of expression; No. \n3, private ownership of property; and, No. 4, the rule of law to help \nadjudicate disputes as well as protect those God-given rights.\n  Dr. Rice, through her own life history and through her service to \nthis administration, has the background that is going to help us and \nhelp others during this heroic time.\n  The President nominated Dr. Rice because he trusts her. She has \nprovided him counsel during these turbulent times in our Nation's \nhistory. She was part of the effort in formulating the Nation's \nresponse and ultimately toppling a despotic and repressive regime in \nAfghanistan.\n  Following the 9/11 attacks in the United States, the world recognized \nthe necessity of having a global, international war against terrorism. \nAs National Security Adviser, Dr. Rice had been at the forefront of \nthis effort and advised President Bush on how best to execute the war \non terror and help ensure that the United States is not attacked again.\n  The global war on terror is not over. We all know it is ongoing and \nwe know it is challenging. There have been some criticisms from those \non the other side of the aisle, but there are also positives. It would \nbe nice, once in a while, to talk about some of the positives.\n  We have captured numerous senior-level al-Qaida figures. They have \nbeen killed or they have been captured, and hundreds of others are on \nthe run.\n  We are working with other countries--even those which are not \nnecessarily with us in the military action in Iraq. They are helping in \ntrying to intercept financial assistance to terrorist organizations.\n  Another positive is the fall of the Taliban in Afghanistan, and that \nrepressive regime has been replaced by an unprecedented but promising \ndemocracy in Afghanistan.\n  The Government of Pakistan, which, prior to 9/11, was aligned with \nthat Taliban government in Afghanistan, has become a strong and helpful \nally in the global war against terrorism.\n\n  In Libya, Muammar Qadhafi, who was a thorn in our side--a threat, \nclearly; a terrorist state--has been convinced to give up his nuclear \nambitions and rejoin the world community.\n  And our military has liberated 25 million Iraqis from the murderous \nregime of Saddam Hussein.\n\n[[Page S397]]\n\n  While conditions on the ground in Iraq continue to be difficult--no \none is going to question that--if the Iraqis coalesce around the new, \npopularly elected government, it will likely have the positive \nrepercussions that we would like to see throughout the Middle East \nregion. Shortly they will be having an election.\n  I think Dr. Rice's active role in these events provide her with \nvaluable preparation to serve our country as Secretary of State. Having \nworked closely with President Bush on national security and foreign \npolicy matters for the previous 4 years, Dr. Rice is uniquely qualified \nto communicate this President's message, our position, to capitals \naround the world.\n  All of us are a composition of our life experiences. From rising \nabove discrimination and racism in her youth to her work during the \nfall of the Soviet Union, to her role in liberating the people of \nAfghanistan and Iraq, Dr. Rice is very well prepared to advocate \nfreedom and democracy around the world.\n  Before the Foreign Relations Committee we heard several hours of \ntestimony. We have heard comments in this Chamber. Detractors have used \nsome bump-and-run defenses and tactics against her. Opponents have \nframed the war on Iraq--and Dr. Rice as having stated this--as one \nsolely based on Saddam Hussein's possession of weapons of mass \ndestruction; that our only reason for going in and using military \naction in Iraq was weapons of mass destruction.\n  I will grant you, that was a pressing, salient concern, but that was \nnot the only reason. Weapons of mass destruction was a major reason; \nhowever, this body voted on an authorization measure that outlined a \nmuch broader case. If you want to use a legal term, it was a multi-\ncount indictment against the Saddam Hussein regime.\n  The resolution that we passed by a strong margin noted Iraq's brutal \nrepression of its civilian population and its unwillingness to \nrepatriate non-Iraqi citizens. We all know how they had used weapons of \nmass destruction against their own people.\n  Congress also went on record as supporting using the necessary means \nto enforce multiple United Nations resolutions that had been ignored \nand flouted by the Iraqi regime, including shooting at some of our \nplanes in the no-fly zones in the north and to some extent in the \nsouthern part of Iraq as well.\n  The Iraq Liberation Act of 1998 expressed the sense of Congress that \nit should be the policy of the United States to support efforts to \nremove from power Saddam's regime and promote the emergence of a \ndemocratic government.\n  Senator Byrd--and I was listening to his comments--mentioned common \nsense. I listened to the remarks of the senior Senator from \nMassachusetts, Mr. Kennedy, earlier on. He is criticizing Dr. Rice for \nsupporting President Bush's policies. He said that ``might have changed \nthe course of history had she not given the reasons and the advice that \nshe did to the President.''\n\n  Because of that, that she agrees with President Bush, has been an \narchitect and key adviser, because of that support, because of that \nknowledge, because of the advice she has given in the past and \npresently, she should not be Secretary of State for this President.\n  If one wants to use common sense, why would any Executive bring on a \nCabinet Secretary--particularly one as important as Secretary of \nState--if that person does not share his views, his values, his \nphilosophy, his goals for our country, as well as have that President's \ntrust?\n  Also, looking through the comments that have been made by others, the \njunior Senator from Indiana said why he is going to be voting against \nDr. Rice, complaining that there was too little troop strength, \ndismissal of the Iraqi army, and the refusal to include Baathists in \nthe armies and security efforts there in Iraq. Opponents have held Dr. \nRice personally accountable for the decision to disband the Iraqi army \nand remove members of the Baathist Party from Iraq's government.\n  Let us again use some common sense. When we are reflecting on this \ndecision, it is easy, I suppose, to Monday morning quarterback and \ncriticize and question whether that was wise. But at the time of that \ndecision--it was clear that institutions that were repressing the \npeople of Iraq was the Baathist Party. So the Baathist component of the \ninsurgency, which some are saying should have been incorporated, they \nare the ones who are carrying on these terror attacks--not just on \nAmericans and coalition forces but also on Iraqi civilians.\n  To me, it is illogical to be criticizing Dr. Rice for any of the \ndecisions that were made insofar as Baathists and the security forces \nof Iraq when these same people could have been infiltrating the \nsecurity forces, not knowing what sort of information they might \ntransmit to other guerillas or terrorists on the outside. To criticize \nthat, again, doesn't make much sense to me because they are the ones \nwho are most concerned that the Baathist Party was thrown out of power. \nThey had their good bureaucratic jobs. They had all the power. They had \nall the privileges. To criticize for not incorporating them into the \ninterim government and the security forces doesn't make a great deal of \nsense.\n  You also hear, again, from the junior Senator from Indiana--and \nothers have said this as well--that those in charge must be held \naccountable for the mistakes. That is why they are going to vote \nagainst Dr. Rice. Dr. Rice allowed in the committee hearing of the \nForeign Relations Committee that every decision that was made was not \nthe right decision; that they did it with the best of intentions, the \nright principles, based on the evidence and information they had. But \nif you are going to criticize the pursuit of regime change, the \nliberation of Iraq, the advancement of freedom in countries such as \nIraq, which is in very short order, within a week, going to have \nelections for the first time ever, what is the solution if you are \ngoing to criticize all of this? To tuck tail and run? I don't think \nthat is what the American people want. The American people want to see \nfreedom in Iraq because they recognize it is good for fellow human \nbeings, but also the logic that it also makes this country much more \nsecure.\n\n  In analyzing all of the statements, they are not talking about her \nfitness or her qualifications to serve as Secretary of State. The \nopponents have used this nomination to launch these broadside attacks \non the Bush administration and use the Monday morning quarterback \napproach to dissect every decision out of context. We have heard about \na lot of this, again, in the Foreign Relations Committee.\n  But even there, I want to repeat, Dr. Rice did not say that every \ndecision was perfect. She allowed as much during those hearings. But \nlet us also note that 25 million Iraqis have been freed from Saddam's \nrepressive regime. In 5 days, these people are going to have elections. \nThey are going to be forming their own government. From statements of \nclerics and otherwise, they seem to want a constitution and a \ngovernment that allows for individual rights, where people's rights \nwill be enhanced and not diminished on account of their ethnicity or \ntheir religious beliefs, and also unprecedented opportunities for women \nto serve in government.\n  One other thing to note is with Saddam out of power, which seems to \nbe criticized indirectly, we don't have Saddam's regime giving $35,000 \nto parents to send their children on suicide-murder missions into \nIsrael. Instead of that repressive regime sending terrorist attackers \ninto Israel, also disrupting the whole region, now we have the chance \nof elections in Iraq for the first time ever, a first step towards a \nrepresentative democracy.\n  I ask my colleagues to be cognizant. This is not an agency head. It \nis a Cabinet Secretariat, the Secretary of State, which is arguably the \nmost important Cabinet position in the Government. The Vice President \nobviously is very important, but the Secretary of State, particularly \nin a time with all the diplomatic relations and all the efforts that we \nare going to need to be making and continue to make to get allies, \nconverts, and assistance from other countries around the world, it is \nimportant that the President's representative to the rest of the world \nis a person who advocates and garners further support for our position \nin matters of great consequence to our country.\n\n[[Page S398]]\n\n  I ask my colleagues to be careful in your criticism. People can say \nwhatever they want. They will say something, and I will say that \ndoesn't make sense; here is a more logical approach. That sort of \nbantering back and forth is fine. But in the criticism and statements \nand also trying to divide opinion on this nomination of Dr. Rice, be \ncareful not to diminish her credibility in the eyes of those in \ncapitals around the world. Detractors can do this country a great \ndisservice by playing too hard a partisan game. We need to show a unity \nof purpose to advance freedom. Folks can second-guess, criticize. That \nis all fine. But while doing that, a more positive and constructive \napproach would be to say, here is where a mistake was made; here is \nwhere we need to hitch up; here is the stage of events in Iraq; and \nhere are some positive, constructive ideas to help us achieve this \ngoal; that all Americans, regardless of whether you are Republican, \nDemocrat, Independent, or don't care about politics, all Americans are \ninspired to the idea that our fellow human beings can live in freedom \nand opportunity; that their children are not starving and hungry when \nthey go to bed, where there is a better world.\n\n  Indeed, our new doctrine is peace through liberty, peace through \nstrength. That mattered against the Soviet Union. The doctrine in the \nfuture, in my view, is peace through liberty. As more people are \ntasting that sweet nectar of liberty, it is good for them, and it helps \nour security as a country.\n  As we listen to some of these partisan detractors and statements, be \ncognizant that the rest of the world is watching. Do not diminish Dr. \nRice's credibility in capitals around the world. Also, try to be \npositive in your ideas of where we need to go in the future rather than \njust carping and sniping on decisions made in the past. I do not see \nany value in attacking Dr. Rice personally or inhibiting her ability to \nbring our allies along, on board, whether or not they were in every \naspect of the military action in Iraq.\n  In sum, obviously, I believe Dr. Rice will be an outstanding \nSecretary of State. It is unfortunate some of this has devolved into an \noverly partisan attack. This debate, as it goes forward this afternoon, \nthis evening, and tomorrow, can end on a more positive, constructive \nsense. I ask my colleagues in a respectful way to recognize that \ninspirational path that Dr. Rice has taken to this nomination. Please \nfocus and review her impeccable credentials and experience on the \nmatters of foreign policy. Upon doing so, I believe it is clear she \nshould be confirmed overwhelmingly, strongly, and proudly as our next \nSecretary of State.\n  I ask unanimous consent that an article from today's Wall Street \nJournal by Brendan Miniter entitled ``Woman of the Year, Instead of \nCelebrating Condi Rice, Democrats Nip at Her Ankles,'' be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the Wall Street Journal, Jan. 25, 2005]\n\n                           Woman of the Year:\n\n     Instead of Celebrating Condi Rice, Democrats Nip at Her Ankles\n\n                          (By Brendan Miniter)\n\n       With 24 new women elected to the House and five to the \n     Senate, 1992 was called the ``year of the woman.'' But how \n     much did Barbara Boxer, Patty Murray or Carol Moseley Braun \n     really change the world? Now, though, a woman is on the rise \n     who has already helped reshape geopolitics. Today Condoleezza \n     Rice will face another round of hearings as she prepares to \n     be confirmed as secretary of state--a position Thomas \n     Jefferson, James Madison and James Monroe used as a \n     springboard into the presidency. If Ms. Rice were a Democrat, \n     the media would have dubbed 2005 the ``year of Condi.''\n       Ms. Rice has already exerted tremendous influence on world \n     affairs. As President Bush's national security adviser, she \n     was instrumental in developing the administration's response \n     to 9/11 into a policy that involved more than raiding \n     terrorist camps throughout the world. Ms. Rice, who well \n     understands the larger global political forces at work since \n     the end of the Cold War, was one of a handful of powerbrokers \n     who came to realize the best defense against terrorism was to \n     spread freedom and democracy in the world.\n       There has been some public doubt whether Ms. Rice actually \n     believes in the policies of this administration. But that has \n     been much wishful thinking by administration critics. Before \n     the Iraq war, she passionately made the case for removing \n     Saddam Hussein. Minutes before one speech on the issue--at an \n     event sponsored by the Manhattan Institute--I had the \n     opportunity to talk with her one on one about Iraq. What I \n     quickly realized was that the policy of peace through liberty \n     was something she cared personally about. Now, as she has \n     been tapped to head the State Department and after President \n     Bush dedicated his second inaugural address to the idea that \n     America's best defense is promoting human liberty, there \n     should be little doubt as to the central role Ms. Rice has \n     played and will continue to play in shaping American foreign \n     policy and the global political landscape.\n       Ms. Rice has been loyal to Mr. Bush, but she is an \n     intellectual power in her own right. She has the president's \n     ear and has been deeply immersed in the movement to halt the \n     spread of tyranny by waging a war of ideas since long before \n     Ronald Reagan consigned the Soviet Union to the ash heap of \n     history. This is the year Ms. Rice steps onto the public \n     stage; a year her influence and her intellect is no longer \n     confined to the quiet rooms of power. Her rise deserves to be \n     celebrated.\n       That it isn't--and that Senate Democrats instead are \n     delaying her confirmation--says more about the Bush \n     administration's opponents than it does about her. Every day \n     she must face those who would rather that someone like her--\n     with her intelligence, political savvy and personal appeal \n     (and anyone who has met her knows, she has a warm, personal \n     touch)--hadn't come along at all. So they ignore her, deny \n     her influence or send out a legion of ankle biters who \n     recycle the same complaints that won John Kerry 251 electoral \n     votes--mostly that the administration she serves promotes \n     torture or that she is too much of a hardliner to soothe \n     relations with other nations.\n       These criticisms ring hollow, of course. The Abu Ghraib \n     prosecutions dispel the accusations of systematic torture. As \n     for soothing relations, either foreign leaders see their \n     interests in line with the U.S. or the divisions will \n     persist. France and Germany aren't childishly sulking about \n     some perceived personal rebuke; they genuinely disagree with \n     American policies. Only by subverting American foreign policy \n     could anyone engender the kind of international \n     ``cooperation'' John Kerry and the Democratic establishment \n     so desperately seek.\n       Ms. Rice has persisted in the face of her critics. It is no \n     wonder then, that some on the right speculate that she will \n     one day seek elective office--governor or senator in \n     California, or maybe even the presidency. It is a plausible \n     idea. A high profile and good character translate into \n     political power, and she has enough of both to be a political \n     player. Of course, before doing so she'd have to flesh out \n     her views on a wide range of domestic subjects. It's also one \n     of the reasons Democrats would like to tarnish her now, \n     before she becomes a formidable candidate. It is a fair bet, \n     though, that Ms. Rice isn't now playing for a new job four \n     years out. Serving ably as secretary of state is of paramount \n     importance. Judging by her remarks before the Senate so far, \n     this is something Ms. Rice clearly understands. Which is why \n     we should be celebrating this as the year of Condi Rice.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burns). The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I compliment my colleagues on both sides \nof the aisle for a very good and thoughtful debate today on this \nparticular nominee.\n  I come to the Senate today to report and inform my colleagues on the \nSecretary of State confirmation hearings held in the Foreign Relations \nCommittee last week.\n  By now, everyone knows I posed some very direct questions to Dr. Rice \nabout her statements leading up to the Iraqi war and beyond. As \nNational Security Adviser, Dr. Rice gave confidential advice to the \nPresident regarding the war in Iraq. She also made the case for the war \nin Iraq to the American people through hours of television appearances \nand commentary.\n  My questions, every one of them, revolved around her own words. As a \nresult of my questions and comments at the hearing, I have been hailed \nas both a hero and a petty person. I have been called both courageous \nand partisan. I have been very surprised at this response. Tens of \nthousands of people signed a petition asking me to hold Dr. Rice \naccountable for her past statements.\n  The reason I am so surprised at this reaction is that I believe I am \ndoing my job. It is as simple at that. I am on the Foreign Relations \nCommittee. This is a very high profile nominee. This is a Secretary of \nState nomination in a time of war. My constituents want me to be \nthorough. They want me to exercise the appropriate role of a Senator.\n  Let's look for a moment at what that role is, how it was defined by \nour Founding Fathers. Article II, section 2, clause 2, of the \nConstitution, which I have sworn to uphold, says the President:\n\n     shall nominate, and by and with the Advice and Consent of the \n     Senate, shall appoint Ambassadors, other public Ministers and \n     Consuls, Judges of the Supreme Court, and all\n\n[[Page S399]]\n\n     other officers of the United States, whose appointments are \n     not herein otherwise provided for.\n\n  The Cabinet is covered in Article II, section 2, clause 2, of the \nU.S. Constitution.\n  Now, if you read this, it does not say anywhere in here that the \nPresident shall nominate and the Senate shall confirm. It says the \nPresident ``shall nominate, and by and with the Advice and Consent of \nthe Senate'' shall make the appointments.\n  Why is it our Founders believed it was crucial for the Senate to play \nsuch a strong role in the selection of these very important and \npowerful members of the administration and members of the bench? It is \nbecause our Founders believed that the executive branch must never be \ntoo powerful or too overbearing.\n  In Federal No. 76, Alexander Hamilton wrote:\n\n       It will readily be comprehended that a man who had himself \n     the sole disposition of offices would be governed much more \n     by his private inclinations and interests than when he was \n     bound to submit the propriety of his choice to the discussion \n     and determination of a different and independent body . . .\n\n  In today's vernacular, any President needs a check and balance. That \ncertainly applies today, and it would apply to a Democratic President \nas much as to a Republican President.\n  Our Founders are clear, and the Constitution is clear. Again, it does \nnot say anywhere in the Constitution that a President, Democratic or \nRepublican, has free rein in the selection of his or her Cabinet. That \nis exactly what the Founders did not want. They wanted the President, \nand I will quote Alexander Hamilton again, to ``submit the propriety of \nhis choice to the discussion and determination of a different and \nindependent body.'' And that body is the Senate.\n  It also doesn't say anywhere in the Constitution that the only reason \nfor a Senator to vote no on a Presidential nominee is because of some \npersonal or legal impediment of that nominee. It leaves the door open. \nSenators have to ponder each and every one of these nominations. It is \nvery rare that I step forward to oppose one. I have opposed just a \ncouple. I have approved hundreds.\n\n  Let me be clear. I will never be deterred--and I know my colleagues \nfeel the same, I believe, on both sides of the aisle--I will never be \ndeterred from doing a job the Constitution requires of me or it would \nbe wrong to have taken the oath and raise my right hand to God and \nswear to uphold the Constitution if I did not take this role seriously.\n  I make a special comment to the White House Chief of Staff, who \ncalled Members of the Senate petty for seeking time to speak out on \nthis particular nomination. It is important to know that the White \nHouse Chief of Staff does a great job for the President, but he does \nnot run the Senate. I know he finds the constitutional requirement of \nadvice and consent perhaps a nuisance, and others have as well in the \nWhite House, be they Republicans or Democrats. It is the system of \ngovernment we have inherited from our Founders. As we go around the \nworld, hoping to bring freedom and liberty to people, we better make \nsure we get it right here. This is very important, whether it is fair \nand free elections that really work so people do not stand in line for \n10 hours and wait until 4 in the morning to vote, that we fix that, and \nthat we, in fact, act as a check and balance in these nominations.\n  I have been motivated by a lot of people in my life. One of them is \nMartin Luther King. I wish to share something he said which is not as \nwidely quoted as other things. He said that our lives begin to end the \nday we become silent about things that matter. That is important for \neveryone to take to heart. Sometimes it is easier to be silent, to just \ngo along, even if in your heart you know there are certain issues that \nhave to be put out on the table. But the fact is, our lives begin to \nend the day we become silent about things that matter.\n\n  Why does this nomination matter so much to me and to my constituents \nand to the tens of thousands who signed a petition that they sent to \nme? It is because we are looking at a Secretary of State nomination in \na time of war, someone who is very loyal to this President. And, of \ncourse, the President picked someone loyal to him. I do not fault him \nfor that in any way, shape, or form. But what matters is this war. A \nvery strong majority of Americans are worried about this war, and they \nare worried about what comes next.\n  So, yes, it matters, and it is our job to look at these nominees very \nseriously. I think it would be terribly condescending to have someone \nof the caliber of Dr. Rice, with all her intelligence and \nqualifications and her record of public service with this \nadministration, and not ask the tough questions. That would be \ncondescending. That would be wrong.\n  Now, I am so honored to serve on the Foreign Relations Committee with \nthe Senator from Virginia, who just made a very eloquent talk. I know \nhe would join me in saying that Richard Lugar is one of the fairest \nchairmen with whom we have ever served. He allowed members on both \nsides of the aisle to ask any questions they wanted. He supported our \nright to do so. To me, Richard Lugar is a model chairman. And I want to \nthank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle who asked very important \nquestions of this nominee on everything from exit strategy in Iraq, to \nissues surrounding the torture question, to policies in Latin America, \nto tsunami relief. All of these colleagues from both sides of the aisle \nasked very important questions. As for me, I had five areas of \nquestioning, and I want to lay them out briefly for the Senate.\n  Now, one more point as to why I believed it was so important to ask \nDr. Rice these questions. I think everyone remembers when Dr. Rice went \non television and talked about the mushroom cloud that we could get \ncourtesy of Saddam Hussein--an evil tyrant, absolutely. In my opinion, \nas I said in the committee, he ought to rot. So let's not get confused \non that point. I do not know any American who feels any differently. \nThe question is, How many people had to die? That is an important \nquestion. How many people had to be wounded? That is an important \nquestion.\n  Let me tell you, 1,368 soldiers are dead, as of the latest numbers \nthat we got this morning from the Department of Defense, and 10,502 \nwounded. My understanding is that about a third of them may well come \nhome in tremendous need of mental health counseling to try to help them \ncope with the horrors they have seen, those brave, incredible soldiers. \nAs I said in the committee, and I say it again on the floor of the \nSenate, not one of them died in vain. Not one of them got injured in \nvain because when your Commander in Chief sends you to fight in a war, \nit is the most noble of things to do that. And they have done that.\n  President Bush, in his inaugural address, talked about bringing \nfreedom to countries that do not have it. He did not specify how. Now, \nthe nongovernmental organization, Freedom House, estimates there are 49 \ncountries in the world that are not free. The group believes there are \nanother 54 countries that are considered only partly free. I worry \nabout sending more troops on military missions based on hyped up \nrhetoric. That is why these questions are so important.\n  So the first set of questions that I posed to Dr. Rice had to do with \nher comments about Saddam's nuclear program. On July 30, 2003, Dr. Rice \nwas asked by PBS NewsHour's Gwen Ifill if she continued to stand by the \nclaims made about Saddam's nuclear program in the days and months \nleading up to the war.\n  In what appears to be an effort to downplay the nuclear weapons scare \ntactics, she said:\n\n       It was a case that said he is trying to reconstitute. He's \n     trying to acquire nuclear weapons.\n\n  And then she says:\n\n       Nobody ever said that it was going to be the next year. . . \n     .\n\n  Well, that was false, because 9 months before that, this is what the \nPresident said:\n\n       If the Iraqi regime is able to produce, buy, or steal an \n     amount of highly enriched uranium a little larger than a \n     single softball, it could have a nuclear weapon in less than \n     a year.\n\n  So she tells the American people nobody ever said he would have a \nweapon within a year, when in fact the President himself made that \ncomment.\n  Then, later, a year after she said nobody has ever said this, she \nherself says it:\n\n     . . . the intelligence assessment was that he was \n     reconstituting his nuclear programs;\n\n[[Page S400]]\n\n     that, left unchecked, he would have a nuclear weapon by the \n     end of the year. . . .\n\n  That is what she says to Fox News.\n  So first she says nobody ever said it. We showed her the fact that \nthe President did. And then she contradicts herself. She contradicts \nthe President and then she contradicts herself.\n  Now, this is very troubling. I wanted to give her a chance to correct \nthe record. Did Dr. Rice correct the record? Let me tell you what she \nsaid. She had two responses. First she said to this committee, my \ncommittee:\n\n       The fact is that we did face a very difficult intelligence \n     challenge in trying to understand what Saddam Hussein had in \n     terms of weapons of mass destruction.\n\n  Notice she does not mention the word ``nuclear weapons.'' And she \nsays: We had a very difficult challenge. But that is a contradiction \nbecause on July 31, 2003, this is what she told a German TV station:\n\n       Going into the war against Iraq, we had very strong \n     intelligence. I've been in this business for 20 years. And \n     some of the strongest intelligence cases that I've seen. . . \n     . We had very strong intelligence going in.\n\n  So she tells the committee: We faced a difficult intelligence \nchallenge--when she had told a German TV station: It was the best \nintelligence we ever had. This is contradictory, plus she never ever \naddresses the issue that we asked her about. Why did you contradict the \nPresident and why did she contradict herself?\n  Then she had a second response. She pointed to the Duelfer report and \ncited it but failed to tell the whole story where the Duelfer report \nsaid:\n\n       Saddam Hussein ended the nuclear program in 1991 following \n     the Gulf War.\n\n  There you go. She never said that. She never cited that. She cited \nother quotes from the Duelfer report.\n  So her answers to the questions I asked her, saying once that Saddam \nwould not have a weapon within a year, and another to me saying he \nwould, her answers are completely nonresponsive to the question and \nraise more credibility lapses.\n  Then we have another area of aluminum tubes. On September 8, 2002, \nDr. Rice was on CNN's Late Edition with Wolf Blitzer and made this \nstatement:\n\n       We do know that there have been shipments going . . . into \n     Iraq, for instance, of aluminum tubes that really are only \n     suited to . . . nuclear weapons programs. . . .\n\n  And then President Bush repeated the same thing:\n\n       Our intelligence sources tell us that (Saddam) has \n     attempted to purchase high-strength aluminum tubes suitable \n     for nuclear weapons production.\n\n  I pointed out to Dr. Rice that the Department of Energy thought \notherwise as far back as April 11, 2001. They said the ``specifications \n[for the tubes] are not consistent with a gas centrifuge end use. . . \n.''\n  On May 9, 2001, they said:\n\n       The Intelligence Community's original analysis of these \n     tubes focused on their possible use in developing gas \n     centrifuges for the enrichment of uranium. Further \n     investigation reveals, however, Iraq has purchased similar \n     aluminum tubes previously to manufacture chambers for a \n     multiple rocket launcher.\n\n  In other words, not suitable for nuclear weapons.\n  Then in July 2002, Australian intelligence said tube evidence is \n``patchy and inconclusive.'' And IAEA said they are ``not directly \nsuitable'' for uranium enrichment and are ``consistent'' with making \nordinary artillery rockets.\n  So we laid this all out there for Dr. Rice, and she refused again to \ncorrect the record. She had a chance.\n  This is what she said at the hearing after she saw all of this:\n\n       We didn't go to war because of aluminum tubes.\n\n  That is what she said to the committee. Well, if that is the case, \nwhy did President Bush cite the aluminum tubes in his speech in which \nhe made the case for the war? He said:\n\n       Our intelligence sources tell us that he [Saddam] has \n     attempted to purchase high strength aluminum tubes suitable \n     for nuclear weapons production.\n\n  So you can't say that the aluminum tubes were not a reason for going \nto war when the President used it in his speech where he was building \nsupport for the war. She doesn't answer the question. She doesn't \ncorrect the record. It is very troubling.\n  The third issue I raised was the matter of linking Saddam to al-Qaida \nwhich she did over and over again. I voted for the war against Osama \nbin Laden. I believed the President when he said we are going to get \nhim dead or alive. I thought we wouldn't stop--we wouldn't turn away--\nand that we would not end until we broke the back of al-Qaida.\n  Well, unfortunately, when we went into Iraq--and this was sold to us \nin part by Dr. Rice; she viewed that as her job; I think the President \ngave that job to her--we took our eye off al-Qaida. We took our eye off \nbin Laden. And the consequences are being seen and felt.\n  Dr. Rice told the committee that the terrorists ``are on the run.'' \nThe truth is, they are now in 60 countries when before 9/11 they were \nin 45 countries.\n  I want to read to you a paragraph that best expresses my views on the \nimpact of the Iraqi war on the war against terrorism. It was written by \none of the world's experts on terror, Peter Bergen, 5 months ago:\n\n       What we have done in Iraq is what bin Laden could not have \n     hoped for in his wildest dreams: We invaded an oil-rich \n     Muslim nation in the heart of the Middle East, the very type \n     of imperial adventure that bin Laden has long predicted was \n     the United States' long-term goal in the region. We deposed \n     the secular socialist Saddam, whom bin Laden long despised, \n     ignited Sunni and Shia fundamentalist fervor in Iraq, and \n     have now provoked a ``defensive'' jihad that has galvanized \n     jihad-minded Muslims around the world. It is hard to imagine \n     a set of policies better designed to sabotage the war on \n     terrorism.\n\n  This conclusion was supported by the CIA Director's think tank.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record an article that \ndescribes this recent report that says Iraq has replaced Afghanistan as \nthe training ground for the next generation of ``professionalized'' \nterrorists.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Jan. 14, 2005]\n\nIraq New Terror Breeding Ground; War Created Haven, CIA Advisers Report\n\n                            (By Dana Priest)\n\n       Iraq has replaced Afghanistan as the training ground for \n     the next generation of ``professionalized'' terrorists, \n     according to a report released yesterday by the National \n     Intelligence Council, the CIA director's think tank.\n       Iraq provides terrorists with ``a training ground, a \n     recruitment ground, the opportunity for enhancing technical \n     skills,'' said David B. Low, the national intelligence \n     officer for transnational threats. ``There is even, under the \n     best scenario, over time, the likelihood that some of the \n     jihadists who are not killed there will, in a sense, go home, \n     wherever home is, and will therefore disperse to various \n     other countries.''\n       Low's comments came during a rare briefing by the council \n     on its new report on long-term global trends. It took a year \n     to produce and includes the analysis of 1,000 U.S. and \n     foreign experts. Within the 119-page report is an evaluation \n     of Iraq's new role as a breeding ground for Islamic \n     terrorists.\n       President Bush has frequently described the Iraq war as an \n     integral part of U.S. efforts to combat terrorism. But the \n     council's report suggests the conflict has also helped \n     terrorists by creating a haven for them in the chaos of war.\n       ``At the moment,'' NIC Chairman Robert L. Hutchings said, \n     Iraq ``is a magnet for international terrorist activity.''\n       Before the U.S. invasion, the CIA said Saddam Hussein had \n     only circumstantial ties with several al Qaeda members. Osama \n     bin Laden rejected the idea of forming an alliance with \n     Hussein and viewed him as an enemy of the jihadist movement \n     because the Iraqi leader rejected radical Islamic ideals and \n     ran a secular government.\n       Bush described the war in Iraq as a means to promote \n     democracy in the Middle East. ``A free Iraq can be a source \n     of hope for all the Middle East,'' he said one month before \n     the invasion. ``Instead of threatening its neighbors and \n     harboring terrorists, Iraq can be an example of progress and \n     prosperity in a region that needs both.''\n       But as instability in Iraq grew after the toppling of \n     Hussein, and resentment toward the United States intensified \n     in the Muslim world, hundreds of foreign terrorists flooded \n     into Iraq across its unguarded borders. They found tons of \n     unprotected weapons caches that, military officials say, they \n     are now using against U.S. troops. Foreign terrorists are \n     believed to make up a large portion of today's suicide \n     bombers, and U.S. intelligence officials say these foreigners \n     are forming tactical, ever-changing alliances with former \n     Baathist fighters and other insurgents.\n       ``The al-Qa'ida membership that was distinguished by having \n     trained in Afghanistan will gradually dissipate, to be \n     replaced in part by the dispersion of the experienced \n     survivors of the conflict in Iraq,'' the report says.\n       According to the NIC report, Iraq has joined the list of \n     conflicts--including the Israeli-Palestinian stalemate, and \n     independence movements in Chechnya, Kashmir, Mindanao in the \n     Philippines, and southern Thailand--that have deepened \n     solidarity\n\n[[Page S401]]\n\n     among Muslims and helped spread radical Islamic ideology.\n       At the same time, the report says that by 2020, al Qaeda \n     ``will be superseded'' by other Islamic extremist groups that \n     will merge with local separatist movements. Most terrorism \n     experts say this is already well underway. The NIC says this \n     kind of ever-morphing decentralized movement is much more \n     difficult to uncover and defeat.\n       Terrorists are able to easily communicate, train and \n     recruit through the Internet, and their threat will become \n     ``an eclectic array of groups, cells and individuals that do \n     not need a stationary headquarters,'' the council's report \n     says. ``Training materials, targeting guidance, weapons know-\n     how, and fund-raising will become virtual (i.e. online).''\n       The report, titled ``Mapping the Global Future,'' \n     highlights the effects of globalization and other economic \n     and social trends. But NIC officials said their greatest \n     concern remains the possibility that terrorists may acquire \n     biological weapons and, although less likely, a nuclear \n     device.\n       The council is tasked with midterm and strategic analysis, \n     and advises the CIA director. ``The NIC's goal,'' one NIC \n     publication states, ``is to provide policymakers with the \n     best, unvarnished, and unbiased information--regardless of \n     whether analytic judgments conform to U.S. policy.''\n       Other than reports and studies, the council produces \n     classified National Intelligence Estimates, which represent \n     the consensus among U.S. intelligence agencies on specific \n     issues.\n       Yesterday, Hutchings, former assistant dean of the Woodrow \n     Wilson School of Public and International Affairs at \n     Princeton University, said the NIC report tried to avoid \n     analyzing the effect of U.S. policy on global trends to avoid \n     being drawn into partisan politics.\n       Among the report's major findings is that the likelihood of \n     ``great power conflict escalating into total war . . . is \n     lower than at any time in the past century.'' However, ``at \n     no time since the formation of the Western alliance system in \n     1949 have the shape and nature of international alignments \n     been in such a state of flux as they have in the past \n     decade.''\n       The report also says the emergence of China and India as \n     new global economic powerhouses ``will be the most \n     challenging of all'' Washington's regional relationships. It \n     also says that in the competition with Asia over \n     technological advances, the United States ``may lose its \n     edge'' in some sectors.\n\n  (Mr. MARTINEZ assumed the Chair.)\n  Mrs. BOXER. Here is the thing. Dr. Rice told the American people that \nthere were strong ties between Saddam Hussein's Iraq and Osama bin \nLaden and al-Qaida. These are her words:\n\n       We clearly know that there were in the past and have been \n     contacts between senior Iraqi officials and members of al-\n     Qaeda going back for actually quite a long time.\n       And there are some al-Qaeda personnel who found refuge in \n     Baghdad.\n\n  Now, I want to show a map that the State Department put out, and it \nwas accompanied by a letter from President Bush, a month after 9/11. \nHere is the map. The red indicates where there are al-Qaida cells. \nUnfortunately, we notice the United States is red. That is why we have \nto win this war. This is the list where al-Qaida or affiliated groups \nhave operated, and this is a month after 9/11, put out by this \nadministration. No Iraq. So how do you then go on television, look the \nAmerican people in the eye, and tell them that in fact--and I will go \nback to her quote again:\n\n       We clearly know that there were in the past and have been \n     contacts between senior Iraqi officials and members of al-\n     Qaeda going back for actually quite a long time.\n       And there are some al-Qaeda personnel who found refuge in \n     Baghdad.\n\n  She did not tell the full story there, and I gave her a chance to do \nit.\n  It is really troubling to me. After all this time, these are the \nthings she could have said: I never checked out that map. You are \nright, Senator, there were no al-Qaida there. But she didn't do that. \nShe could have listened to what the experts were saying about how bin \nLaden loathed Saddam Hussein, two despicable tyrants who hated each \nother.\n  Peter Bergen said:\n\n     . . . I met bin Laden in '97 and . . . asked him at the end \n     of the interview . . . his opinion of Saddam Hussein. And \n     [bin Laden] said, ``Well, Saddam is a bad Muslim and he took \n     Kuwait for his own self-aggrandizement.''\n\n  In November 2001, the former head of the Saudi intelligence said:\n\n       Iraq doesn't come very high in the estimation of Osama bin \n     Laden. . . .He thinks of [Saddam Hussein] as an apostate, an \n     infidel, or someone who is not worthy of being a fellow \n     Muslim.\n\n  Then the bipartisan 9/11 Commission says there is ``no \ncollaborative'' relationship between Iraq and al-Qaida, and Dr. Rice \nreceived that memo on September 18, 2001, and still she went before the \nAmerican people. When I asked her about it, she said:\n\n       As to the question of al Qaeda and its presence in Iraq, I \n     think we did say that there was never an issue of operational \n     control . . . that Saddam Hussein had nothing to do with 9/11 \n     as far as we know or could tell.\n       It wasn't a question of operational alliance. It was a \n     question of an attitude about terrorism that allowed Zarqawi \n     to be in Baghdad and to operate out of Baghdad.\n\n  Well, those statements continued to mislead. There is no question \nabout it. When she says there wasn't an operational alliance and she \nbelieved there never was, why was it that aboard the USS Abraham \nLincoln, when President Bush had that famous sign ``mission \naccomplished,'' he said:\n\n       The liberation of Iraq is a crucial advance in the campaign \n     against terror. We have removed an ally of al Qaeda.\n\n  How do you tell the committee that this administration never thought \nthere was an operational link, when the President, standing on the USS \nAbraham Lincoln, was saying mission accomplished, and the major \nfighting is behind us?\n  He said:\n\n       In the war against Saddam, we have removed an ally of al \n     Qaeda.\n\n  It isn't right to continue this kind of talk when you already know \nfrom the 9/11 Commission that it isn't true, and you know from looking \nat the State Department that it wasn't true. Yet it all continues.\n  In her point about allowing Zarqawi to be in Baghdad, she failed to \nmention a CIA document that was reportedly sent to the White House in \nSeptember 2004 that states there is no conclusive evidence that Saddam \nharbored Zarqawi.\n  Last October, a senior U.S. official told ABC News there was, in \nfact, no evidence that Saddam even knew Zarqawi was in Baghdad. So we \nare not being told the whole truth. We are not being given all of the \nfacts. I have to say that I think it is a disservice to the American \npeople.\n  The fourth issue I raised with Dr. Rice concerns U.S. relations with \nIran during the Iraq-Iran war. That sounds like, why would I raise that \nbecause that war was in the 1980s? It is important because, in making \nher case for the war in Iraq, Dr. Rice cited Saddam's deplorable use of \nchemical weapons during the Iran-Iraq war. It certainly was a sin \nagainst humanity. She failed to mention, however, that it was Special \nEnvoy Donald Rumsfeld--here he is in this picture--in December 1983 who \nmet with Saddam 1 month after the United States confirmed he was using \nchemical weapons almost daily against Iran. In an attempt to support \nIraq during that war, Iraq was removed from the terrorism list in 1982. \nNone other than Donald Rumsfeld was giving the good news to Saddam \nHussein and tried to restore full diplomatic relations. As a matter of \nfact, during this whole Iran-Iraq war, we all know the story that \nAmerican firms were selling materials to Saddam Hussein.\n  Now, this is what Dr. Rice said. She said:\n\n       I will say it right now. The U.S. Government has often, as \n     the President said, supported regimes in the hope that they \n     would bring stability. We have been in the Middle East \n     sometimes blind to the freedom deficit. We are not going to \n     do that anymore. What happened with Saddam is probably \n     evidence that that policy was not a very wise policy.\n\n  That is an understatement. It was a horrific policy. It was a \nterrible policy. It was a policy of appeasing Saddam Hussein, making \nsure that he had the weapons, because we were essentially taking his \nside quietly in the Iran-Iraq war, and Donald Rumsfeld was super \ninvolved in it, and here is the picture to prove it.\n  Now, I do appreciate that Dr. Rice said it probably was not a very \nwise policy. I was glad to hear her say that. But you know what. She \ndoesn't explain to us why. When she cited Iraq's use of chemical \nweapons against Iran as a justification for the U.S. attack on Iraq, \nshe doesn't mention that the U.S. Government was working at that very \nsame time to reestablish robust relations with Saddam. Indeed, our own \nGovernment took Saddam off the terror list, and the American people \ndeserve to know that from her, when she advanced this issue as a reason \nfor the war. Full disclosure. Give the whole story.\n  Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n\n[[Page S402]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 24 minutes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I raise the issue of Dr. Rice's opposition \nto a provision in the intelligence reform bill that would have outlawed \nthe use of cruel, inhumane, or degrading treatment of foreign prisoners \nby intelligence officials. The section of this provision is here. It \nwas passed unanimously by the Senate. The overall amendment was written \nby Senators McCain and Lieberman, but this particular provision was \nwritten by Senator Durbin:\n\n       Prohibition on torture or cruel, inhumane, or degrading \n     treatment or punishment.\n       In general, no prisoner shall be subject to torture or \n     cruel, inhumane, or degrading treatment or punishment that is \n     prohibited by the Constitution, laws, or treaties of the \n     United States.\n\n  That is very straightforward. When I asked Dr. Rice, why did you sign \na letter with Mr. Bolton and object to this provision and ask that it \nbe stricken, she had a couple of different responses. The first \nresponse she gave me was:\n\n       This is duplicative of language that was in the Defense \n     Department bill.\n\n  So I checked with the authors of this provision, and I said: Is it \ntrue that this is duplicative? They said the language is in the \nDepartment of Defense, but it does not apply to the CIA and \nintelligence officers who work outside of the DOD. So I explained it to \nher, and she argued with me and she said it is not true, it is \nduplicative. I said: Do you think Senators McCain, Lieberman, and \nDurbin don't know what they are doing when they added this to the \nintelligence bill? She didn't answer. The fact is, this is not \nduplicative. This is necessary so that we cover those intelligence \nofficials who may not be part of the Department of Defense but are part \nof other agencies not covered by the Department of Defense.\n  And then she went on and said:\n\n       We did not want to afford to people who did not--shouldn't \n     enjoy certain protections those protections. And the Geneva \n     Conventions should not apply to terrorists like al-Qaida. \n     They can't or you will stretch the meaning of the Geneva \n     Convention.\n\n  That was her second problem with it, which was that you are granting \nmore rights than the Geneva Conventions. However, this explanation \nmakes no sense because the following language was also part of this, \nwhich is:\n\n       Nothing in this section shall affect the status of any \n     person under the Geneva Conventions or whether any person is \n     entitled to the protections of the Geneva Conventions.\n\n  So she gave two reasons as to why she wrote a letter and demanded \nthis be removed from the intelligence bill, neither of which is true. \nIt is not duplicative, and there is no problem with the Geneva \nConventions because we make a special exception for them.\n  But that is not all. The next day, Dr. Rice came back and changed \nwhat she said the day before. She said she doesn't oppose the \nsubsection that clearly prohibited torture and cruel, inhumane, or \ndegrading treatment. She said she opposes other provisions in the \nsection.\n  Well, Mr. President, this was the operative language of the section. \nThat second day's excuse just doesn't hold up under scrutiny because \nshe wrote in a letter--this is what Dr. Rice wrote to the committee.\n  Mrs. BOXER. This says:\n\n       The administration also opposes [she names the section] \n     which provides legal protections to foreign prisoners to \n     which they are not now entitled under applicable law and \n     policy.\n\n  And she says that section 1095 of the Defense Authorization Act \nalready addresses this issue. So Dr. Rice's own words in the letter \ncontradict what she told the committee.\n  Now, this issue of torture is one that matters. It matters to me for \nmany reasons. The first is it is about our humanity. It is about our \nhumanity. Second is that it is about our soldiers, who may find \nthemselves in captivity and in a circumstance where they might well get \ntreated the way we are treating people we capture. That is why the \nprotective words here and living up to our treaties or obligations of \nour Constitution and international treaties are so important. It is not \nsome vague academic discussion; it is very serious.\n  Now, I went and saw, as many colleagues did, the pictures from Abu \nGhraib prison. As long as I live, they will be seared in my memory. \nThere are a lot more pictures that the public didn't see. I can tell \nyou--and I think I can say this of most of my colleagues I was sitting \nwith from both sides of the aisle--I could barely watch what was shown.\n  I am sometimes torn to talk about what I saw. I have done it in small \ngroups where my constituents have asked me what I saw, but I will not \ndo it today. I do not want to do it, but let it be said that the kinds \nof pictures that I saw do not reflect our country or our values. We \nhave to be united on this.\n  Senator Dodd asked Dr. Rice to please tell us her personal views on \ntorture, and he laid out a couple of examples of torture. She demurred \nand would not respond to those specific questions. I thought that was a \nmoment in time where she could have sent out a signal to the whole \nworld about America. She said for sure that Abu Ghraib was terrible. \nShe was eloquent on the point. In fact, I will read to my colleagues \nwhat she said right after Abu Ghraib:\n\n       What took place at the Abu Ghraib prison does not represent \n     America. Our nation is a compassionate country that believes \n     in freedom. The U.S. government is deeply sorry for what has \n     happened to some Abu Ghraib prisoners and people worldwide \n     should be assured that President Bush is determined to learn \n     the full truth of the prisoner reports in Iraq.\n\n  Those comments at that time were very important. They were the type \nof comments that I think pull us all together. It was a comment that \nreflected humanity.\n  Then we have this language that she writes a couple of months after \nshe makes this beautiful speech in October saying she opposes this \nprovision that says no prisoner shall be subject to torture or cruel, \ninhuman or degrading treatment or punishment that is prohibited by the \nConstitution, laws, or treaties of the United States. She writes a \nletter opposing this section after she makes this beautiful speech.\n  When I asked her to explain it, she gives me reasons that just do not \nhold up, that it is duplicative, which it is not, that she really did \nnot oppose it, which cannot possibly be true because we have her letter \nin writing where she did.\n  There is no doubt that Dr. Rice has the resume, the story, the \nintelligence, and the experience to be Secretary of State. She \ncertainly is loyal to this President, we know that, and I think that is \nimportant. The President wants to have someone who is loyal. He should \nalso want to have someone who will be independent such as Colin Powell \nwas.\n  After 9 hours of grueling questions and answers before the committee, \nshe proved her endurance for the job. In responding to me, she used a \nvery clever tactic that we all learn in politics, which is to go after \nthe questioner, why are you attacking me, and then do not answer the \nquestions. It was OK that she did that. I did not mind that she did \nthat. But she did not answer the questions. That is the point.\n  I believe the committee gave Dr. Rice the opportunity to speak \ncandidly and set the record straight. It is not only my questions. \nSenator Biden asked her how many Iraqi security forces were trained, \nand without blinking an eye she said 120,000. And he said, wait a \nminute--and anyone who knows Senator Biden knows that he kind of roots \nfor someone when they sit in the hot seat--let us really be candid \nhere. He said: I went to Iraq and I was told by the military that there \nis nothing close to 120,000. He said he was told there were 4,000. She \nstuck by the 120,000.\n  Later, when others were asked in the administration, such as \nAmbassador Negroponte, he would not put out a number but he sure did \nnot say 120,000.\n\n  Everyone with a heart and a pulse knows it is not 120,000 trained \ntroops, because as Senator Biden said at that hearing, if there are \n120,000 trained Iraqi troops to protect the Iraqi people, why in God's \nname are we there in the numbers we are and keeping people there, who \nare leaving their families, for extra tours of duty? She would not \nbudge.\n  I am troubled because we gave Dr. Rice every opportunity to speak \ncandidly, set the record straight, and she just did not do that.\n  In her role as National Security Adviser, she was not responsible for \ncoming to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee or the House \nequivalent committee. Now she is going to be responsible for that. She \ncould not have\n\n[[Page S403]]\n\na friendlier chairman than Senator Lugar in terms of being given every \nopportunity to work with our committee. I know Senator Biden and \nSenator Lugar work together just like brothers. This is a very \nbipartisan committee. We are going to see Dr. Rice there very often \nbecause she will be confirmed. I hope when she comes back before the \ncommittee that she will be more candid with the committee.\n  At this time I am judging her on her answers to these questions. She \ndodged so many of them and again resorted to half the story and even \ngot herself in deeper water in some of her responses. So I cannot \nsupport this nomination.\n  The cost of the policy in Iraq, a policy that she embraced \nwholeheartedly, a policy that she did, in fact, bring to the American \npeople and she led them to certain conclusions that turned out not to \nbe true, whether it was the aluminum tubes, the ties to al-Qaida, \nwhether it was her half argument on the Iran-Iraq war, whether it was \nher obvious contradictory statements on we never said he would have a \nnuclear weapon in a year one day and then the next year she said we did \nnot say that, it is too hard to overlook these things.\n  I will close with the Martin Luther King quote, which I will not \nrecite exactly but I do agree that our lives begin to end when we stop \ncaring about things that matter. Accountability matters. Truth telling \nmatters. The whole truth matters. Responsibility matters. The advice \nand consent role of the Senate is one that is really very important. I \nhope my colleagues on both sides will recognize that this Senate is at \nits best when we have some of these tough debates.\n  It is not as if we are having a vote to confirm a Cabinet position \nthat will not have as much reach. It is not as if we are voting to \nconfirm a position where the individual is brand new and does not have \na record. This is a very important position in a time of war where the \nnominee had a record of making many statements to the American people. \nI believe that out of respect for the American people, out of respect \nfor the Senate, out of respect for the Foreign Relations Committee, and \nout of respect to Condoleezza Rice herself, we needed to ask these \nquestions.\n  Now that he is on the floor again, I would say to Senator Lugar what \nI said before, that he is such a fair chairman. All of us on the \ncommittee have such respect for him. I look forward to working with him \non many issues. I think there will be many times where we will be \nvoting the same way. We will not be today, but that is just one time. \nThere will be many other occasions where we will be together.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nTennessee is now recognized.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I rise in support of the nomination of \nDr. Condoleezza Rice to be America's next Secretary of State. President \nBush has made an excellent choice for this preeminent position in his \nCabinet. Her experience as National Security Adviser will make her even \nmore effective than one normally might be. When foreign leaders talk \nwith Dr. Rice, they will know she is speaking with the President's \nvoice.\n  I had the privilege of attending much of the 9-plus hours of \nhearings. Dr. Rice got about every kind of question. She handled the \nquestions, I thought, with dignity, with intelligence, with grace. It \nwas an excellent performance. It augurs well for her time as a U.S. \nSecretary of State. I am proud to support her.\n  The major issue confronting Dr. Rice and our Nation today is the war \nin Iraq. At the hearings to which I just referred, some of my \ncolleagues talked about needing an exit strategy. I disagree. I don't \nbelieve we need an exit strategy in Iraq. We need a success strategy. \nBut such a strategy may mean taking a little more realistic view of \nwhat we mean by success. It is one thing to help people win their \nfreedom, as we did in Iraq. It is another to help a country become a \nstable, pluralistic democracy, a flourishing society. We need to ask \nourselves how many American lives are we willing to sacrifice to do \nthis? How long are we willing for it to take? And what is our standard \nfor success?\n  We should be thinking well beyond Iraq. The next time the opportunity \noccurs for the United States to undertake what we now call regime \nchange, or nation building, what lessons have we learned in Iraq? \nDuring his campaign for the Presidency in 2000, President Bush was \ncritical of nation building. That was before September 11, 2001. Today \nthe situation has obviously changed.\n  Our initial war in Iraq was a stunning success. What came afterwards \nhas been a series of miscalculations. But the United States has engaged \nin nation building more than a dozen times since World War II and, \nbased on those experiences, should we not have anticipated that nation \nbuilding in Iraq would have required more troops, more money, and taken \nlonger than we expected? And what do those lessons say about our future \npolicy toward nation building?\n\n  I asked Dr. Rice about this when she appeared before the Foreign \nRelations Committee. One lesson she said we learned was that we need to \ntrain our own diplomatic personnel with the skills of nation building. \nShe said we need to learn how to help a country set up a new, \nindependent judiciary, how to establish a currency, how to train up \npolice forces, among other things. I am sure other lessons will be \nlearned as we move forward, and we should be humble enough to learn \nthem.\n  I would hope that our experience in Iraq has reminded us of what a \nmajor commitment regime change and nation building require. I hope the \nnext time someone suggests to this President, or to any future \nPresident, that he pursue regime change, that one of his advisers, \nperhaps Dr. Rice, will say: Mr. President, based on the history of \npostwar reconstruction and what we have learned in Iraq, any regime \nchange is likely to take us several years, is likely to cost us \nhundreds of billions of dollars, and require the sacrifice of thousands \nof lives. If it is in our national interest to go ahead, then the \nPresident may decide that, but he needs to have that advice. And we \nneed to discuss that as we did in the hearing the other day.\n  American history is the story of setting noble goals and struggling \nto reach them and often falling short. We sincerely say, in our \ncountry, that anything is possible, that all men are created equal, \nthat no child will be left behind--even though we know down deep we \nwill fall short and we know we will then have to pick ourselves up and \nkeep trying again to reach those noble goals.\n  We also said we want to make the world safe for democracy, and we \nremember an inaugural speech 44 years ago in which a new President \nnamed John F. Kennedy said we would ``pay any price, bear any burden'' \nto defend freedom. And we heard last Thursday President Bush echo those \nsentiments when he said to the people of the world: When you stand for \nyour liberty, we will stand with you.\n  Yet there is obviously a limit to what we can do and to what we are \nwilling to do and to the number of lives we will sacrifice to secure \nthe blessings of freedom and democracy for others. So, now that we have \na new Secretary of State--almost have one--new Iraqi elections within \nthe next few days, and we are about to spend another $80 billion in \nIraq, now is a good time to be clearer about what our success strategy \nwould be in Iraq. When I asked Dr. Rice about this in her hearing, she \nacknowledged we need a success strategy but didn't want to commit to a \ntimetable.\n  In a Washington Post op-ed this morning, two of Dr. Rice's \npredecessors, Secretaries Henry Kissinger and George Shultz, agreed we \nshould not set a specific timetable for pulling out our troops. But \nthey also go further than Dr. Rice did in the hearing in outlining the \nframework for what a success strategy in Iraq might look like.\n  Dr. Kissinger and Dr. Shultz wrote this:\n\n       A successful strategy needs to answer these questions: Are \n     we waging ``one war'' in which military and political efforts \n     are mutually reinforcing? Are the institutions guiding and \n     monitoring these tasks sufficiently coordinated? Is our \n     strategic goal to achieve complete security in at least some \n     key towns and major communication routes (defined as reducing \n     violence to historical criminal levels)? This would be in \n     accordance with the maxim that complete security in 70 \n     percent of the country is better than 70 percent security in \n     100 percent of the country--because\n\n[[Page S404]]\n\n     fully secure areas can be models and magnets for those who \n     are suffering in insecure places. Do we have a policy for \n     eliminating the sanctuaries in Syria and Iran from which the \n     enemy can be instructed, supplied, and given refuge and time \n     to regroup? Are we designing a policy that can produce \n     results for the people and prevent civil strife for control \n     of the State and its oil revenue? Are we maintaining American \n     public support so that staged surges of extreme violence do \n     not break domestic public confidence at a time when the enemy \n     may, in fact, be on the verge of failure? And are we gaining \n     international understanding and willingness to play a \n     constructive role in what is a global threat to peace and \n     security?\n       An exit strategy based on performance, not artificial time \n     limits, will judge progress by the ability to produce \n     positive answers to these questions.\n\n  That is what Secretaries Kissinger and Shultz wrote this morning. I \nask unanimous consent the article be printed in the Record at the \nconclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. When Dr. Rice comes back to the committee as Secretary \nRice--and she will be there often--I hope she will address these \nquestions and say more about what our objectives are. When she does, I \nalso wouldn't mind if she acknowledges when things aren't going well, \nor when we need to change our strategy or tactics because our earlier \napproach is not working. I think such acknowledgments only strengthen \nthe administration's credibility and reassure us that needed \nadjustments are being made.\n  At President Reagan's funeral last June, former Senator Jack Danforth \nsaid the text for his homily was ``the obvious,'' Matthew 5:14-16.\n\n       You are the light of the world. A city built on a hill \n     cannot be hid. No one after lighting a lamp puts it in a \n     bushel basket, but on a lampstand, and it gives light to all \n     in the house. In the same way, let your light shine before \n     others, so that they may see your good works, and give glory \n     to your father in heaven.\n\n  From our beginning, that vision of the city on a hill has helped to \ndefine what it means to be an American and provided America with a \nmoral mission. It helps explain why we invaded Iraq, why we fought wars \n``to make the world safe for democracy,'' and why President Bush said \nlast Thursday:\n\n       All who live in tyranny and hopelessness can know: the \n     United States will not ignore your oppression, or excuse your \n     oppressors.\n\n  It is why we are forever involving ourselves in other nations' \nbusiness. It is why when I was in Mozambique last summer I found 800 \nAmericans, 400 of them missionaries and most of the rest diplomats or \naid workers.\n  But is it possible that too much nation building runs the risk of \nextending too far the vision of the city on the hill?\n  Letting a light shine so others may see our good works does not \nnecessarily mean we must invade a country and change its regime and \nreshape it until it begins to look like us. It may mean instead that we \nstrive harder to understand and celebrate our own values of democracy, \nof equal opportunity, of individualism, of tolerance, the rule of law \nand other principles that unite us and that we hope will be exported to \nother parts of the world. How we ourselves live would then become our \nmost persuasive claim to real leadership in a world filled with people \nhungry to know how to live their lives.\n  For example, in my own experience--and Dr. Rice said at the hearings \nin her experience--we have found that sometimes the most effective way \nto export our values is to train foreign students at our American \nuniversities who then return home to become leaders in their own \ncountries.\n  Of course, we Americans will never say that only some men are created \nequal, that only some children will not be left behind, or that we will \npay only some price to defend freedom. But perhaps we should be \nthinking more about strategies for extending freedom and democracy in \nthe world other than nation building and determine what those \nstrategies are and when they most appropriately might be used.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Jan. 25, 2005]\n\n                Results, Not Timetables, Matter in Iraq\n\n              (By Henry A. Kissinger and George P. Shultz)\n\n       The debate on Iraq is taking a new turn. The Iraqi \n     elections scheduled for Jan. 30, only recently viewed as a \n     culmination, are described as inaugurating a civil war. The \n     timing and the voting arrangements have become controversial. \n     All this is a way of foreshadowing a demand for an exit \n     strategy, by which many critics mean some sort of explicit \n     time limit on the U.S. effort.\n       We reject this counsel. The implications of the term ``exit \n     strategy'' must be clearly understood; there can be no \n     fudging of consequences. The essential prerequisite for an \n     acceptable exit strategy is a sustainable outcome, not an \n     arbitrary time limit. For the outcome in Iraq will shape the \n     next decade of American foreign policy. A debacle would usher \n     in a series of convulsions in the region as radicals and \n     fundamentalists moved for dominance, with the wind seemingly \n     at their backs. Wherever there are significant Muslim \n     populations, radical elements would be emboldened. As the \n     rest of the world related to this reality, its sense of \n     direction would be impaired by the demonstration of American \n     confusion in Iraq. A precipitate American withdrawal would be \n     almost certain to cause a civil war that would dwarf \n     Yugoslavia's, and it would be compounded as neighbors \n     escalated their current involvement into full-scale \n     intervention.\n       We owe it to ourselves to become clear about what post-\n     election outcome is compatible with our values and global \n     security. And we owe it to the Iraqis to strive for an \n     outcome that can further their capacity to shape their \n     future.\n       The mechanical part of success is relatively easy to \n     define: establishment of a government considered sufficiently \n     legitimate by the Iraqi people to permit recruitment of an \n     army able and willing to defend its institutions. That goal \n     cannot be expedited by an arbitrary deadline that would be, \n     above all, likely to confuse both ally and adversary. The \n     political and military efforts cannot be separated. Training \n     an army in a political vacuum has proved insufficient. If we \n     cannot carry out both the political and military tasks, we \n     will not be able to accomplish either.\n       But what is such a government? Optimists and idealists \n     posit that a full panoply of Western democratic institutions \n     can be created in a time frame the American political process \n     will sustain. Reality is likely to disappoint these \n     expectations. Iraq is a society riven by centuries of \n     religious and ethnic conflicts; it has little or no \n     experience with representative institutions. The challenge is \n     to define political objectives that, even when falling short \n     of the maximum goal, nevertheless represent significant \n     progress and enlist support across the various ethnic groups. \n     The elections of Jan. 30 should therefore be interpreted as \n     the indispensable first phase of a political evolution from \n     military occupation to political legitimacy.\n       Optimists also argue that, since the Shiites make up about \n     60 percent of the population and the Kurds 15 to 20 percent, \n     and since neither wants Sunni domination, a democratic \n     majority exists almost automatically. In that view, the Iraqi \n     Shiite leaders have come to appreciate the benefits of \n     democratization and the secular state by witnessing the \n     consequences of their absence under the Shiite theocracy in \n     neighboring Iran.\n       A pluralistic, Shiite-led society would indeed be a happy \n     outcome. But we must take care not to base policy on the wish \n     becoming father to the thought. If a democratic process is to \n     unify Iraq peacefully, a great deal depends on how the Shiite \n     majority defines majority rule.\n       So far the subtle Shiite leaders, hardened by having \n     survived decades of Saddam Hussein's tyranny, have been \n     ambiguous about their goals. They have insisted on early \n     elections--indeed, the date of Jan. 30 was established on the \n     basis of a near-ultimatum by the most eminent Shiite leader, \n     Grand Ayatollah Ali Sistani. The Shiites have also urged \n     voting procedures based on national candidate lists, which \n     work against federal and regional political institutions. \n     Recent Shiite pronouncements have affirmed the goal of a \n     secular state but have left open the interpretation of \n     majority rule. An absolutist application of majority rule \n     would make it difficult to achieve political legitimacy. The \n     Kurdish minority and the Sunni portion of the country would \n     be in permanent opposition.\n       Western democracy developed in homogeneous societies; \n     minorities found majority rule acceptable because they had a \n     prospect of becoming majorities, and majorities were \n     restrained in the exercise of their power by their temporary \n     status and by judicially enforced minority guarantees. Such \n     an equation does not operate where minority status is \n     permanently established by religious affiliation and \n     compounded by ethnic differences and decades of brutal \n     dictatorship. Majority rule in such circumstances is \n     perceived as an alternative version of the oppression of the \n     weak by the powerful. In multiethnic societies, minority \n     rights must be protected by structural and constitutional \n     safeguards. Federalism mitigates the scope for potential \n     arbitrariness of the numerical majority and defines autonomy \n     on a specific range of issues.\n       The reaction to intransigent Sunni brutality and the \n     relative Shiite quiet must not tempt us into identifying \n     Iraqi legitimacy with unchecked Shiite rule. The American \n     experience with Shiite theocracy in Iran since 1979 does not \n     inspire confidence in our ability to forecast Shiite \n     evolution or the prospects of a Shiite-dominated bloc \n     extending to the Mediterranean. A thoughtful\n\n[[Page S405]]\n\n     American policy will not mortgage itself to one side in a \n     religious conflict fervently conducted for 1,000 years.\n       The Constituent Assembly emerging from the elections will \n     be sovereign to some extent. But the United States' \n     continuing leverage should be focused on four key objectives: \n     (1) to prevent any group from using the political process to \n     establish the kind of dominance previously enjoyed by the \n     Sunnis; (2) to prevent any areas from slipping into Taliban \n     conditions as havens and recruitment centers for terrorists; \n     (3) to keep Shiite government from turning into a theocracy, \n     Iranian or indigenous; (4) to leave scope for regional \n     autonomy within the Iraqi democratic process.\n       The United States has every interest in conducting a \n     dialogue with all parties to encourage the emergence of a \n     secular leadership of nationalists and regional \n     representatives. The outcome of constitution-building should \n     be a federation, with an emphasis on regional autonomy. Any \n     group pushing its claims beyond these limits should be \n     brought to understand the consequences of a breakup of the \n     Iraqi state into its constituent elements, including an \n     Iranian-dominated south, an Islamist-Hussein Sunni center and \n     invasion of the Kurdish region by its neighbors.\n       A calibrated American policy would seek to split that part \n     of the Sunni community eager to conduct a normal life from \n     the part that is fighting to reestablish Sunni control. The \n     United States needs to continue building an Iraqi army, \n     which, under conditions of Sunni insurrection, will be \n     increasingly composed of Shiite recruits--producing an \n     unwinnable situation for the Sunni rejectionists. But it \n     should not cross the line into replacing Sunni dictatorship \n     with Shiite theocracy. It is a fine line, but the success of \n     Iraq policy may depend on the ability to walk it.\n       The legitimacy of the political institutions emerging in \n     Iraq depends significantly on international acceptance of the \n     new government. An international contact group should be \n     formed to advise on the political and economic reconstruction \n     of Iraq. Such a step would be a gesture of confident \n     leadership, especially as America's security and financial \n     contributions will remain pivotal. Our European allies must \n     not shame themselves and the traditional alliance by \n     continuing to stand aloof from even a political process that, \n     whatever their view of recent history, will affect their \n     future even more than ours. Nor should we treat countries \n     such as India and Russia, with their large Muslim \n     populations, as spectators to outcomes on which their \n     domestic stability may well depend.\n       Desirable political objectives will remain theoretical \n     until adequate security is established in Iraq. In an \n     atmosphere of political assassination, wholesale murder and \n     brigandage, when the road from Baghdad to its international \n     airport is the scene of daily terrorist or criminal \n     incidents, no government will long be able to sustain public \n     confidence. Training, equipping and motivating effective \n     Iraqi armed forces is a precondition to all the other \n     efforts. Yet no matter how well trained and equipped, that \n     army will not fight except for a government in which it has \n     confidence. This vicious circle needs to be broken.\n       It is axiomatic that guerrillas win if they do not lose. \n     And in Iraq the guerrillas are not losing, at least not in \n     the Sunni region, at least not visibly. A successful strategy \n     needs to answer these questions: Are we waging ``one war'' in \n     which military and political efforts are mutually \n     reinforcing? Are the institutions guiding and monitoring \n     these tasks sufficiently coordinated? Is our strategic goal \n     to achieve complete security in at least some key towns and \n     major communication routes (defined as reducing violence to \n     historical criminal levels)? This would be in accordance with \n     the maxim that complete security in 70 percent of the country \n     is better than 70 percent security in 100 percent of the \n     country--because fully secure areas can be models and magnets \n     for those who are suffering in insecure places. Do we have a \n     policy for eliminating the sanctuaries in Syria and Iran from \n     which the enemy can be instructed, supplied, and given refuge \n     and time to regroup? Are we designing a policy that can \n     produce results for the people and prevent civil strife for \n     control of the state and its oil revenue? Are we maintaining \n     American public support so that staged surges of extreme \n     violence do not break domestic public confidence at a time \n     when the enemy may, in fact, be on the verge of failure? And \n     are we gaining international understanding and willingness to \n     play a constructive role in what is a global threat to peace \n     and security?\n       An exit strategy based on performance, not artificial time \n     limits, will judge progress by the ability to produce \n     positive answers to these questions. In the immediate future, \n     a significant portion of the anti-insurrection effort will \n     have to be carried out by the United States. A premature \n     shift from combat operations to training missions might \n     create a gap that permits the insurrection to rally its \n     potential. But as Iraqi forces increase in number and \n     capability, and as the political construction proceeds after \n     the election, a realistic exit strategy will emerge.\n       There is no magic formula for a quick, non-catastrophic \n     exit. But there is an obligation to do our utmost to bring \n     about an outcome that will mark a major step forward in the \n     war against terrorism, in the transformation of the Middle \n     East and toward a more peaceful and democratic world order.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, it is my understanding that under a \nprevious order I am allowed 20 minutes. Is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I understand Senator Reed of Rhode Island is also on the \nlist to speak. Is he not? I make inquiry of the Chair: Under the order, \nis Senator Reed of Rhode Island also allotted time?\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, if I may respond to the distinguished \nSenator, Senator Reed is on a list but is not designated precisely. \nPerhaps while the speaker is speaking we can work this out.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I recommend that even though he may miss part of my \nspeech.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  President Bush has nominated Condoleezza Rice as Secretary of State. \nIt is one of the highest positions in our Government. She is a person \nof considerable accomplishment and formidable intellect. I have watched \nher service from afar, and this morning I had my first opportunity to \nmeet her personally. Dr. Rice came by my office and we sat down for \nhalf an hour and discussed many different issues. I was impressed with \nher ability and with her forthright approach.\n  I will tell you that I am also troubled. I am troubled because I \nfollowed closely the exchange between Dr. Rice and Senator Boxer during \nthe confirmation hearing before the Foreign Relations Committee. The \nreason I followed this closely was not only because it was important \nand it related to the issue of torture but because it involved an \namendment which I had drafted. As every American I have met, I was \nshocked by the information and photographs that came out of Abu Ghraib; \ntroubled by reports from Guantanamo.\n  As a result, I joined in a bipartisan effort in both the Department \nof Defense authorization bill, as well as later in the intelligence \nreform bill, to put a clear restatement of American law to a vote, that \nthe United States is prohibited from engaging in torture, or cruel, \ninhuman or degrading treatment. It is important to restate this \nprinciple and value so there would be no questions asked as to whether \nthe United States had deviated from the legal standard which we had \nheld for over 50 years--a standard first embodied in the Geneva \nConventions and then in the Convention on Torture, and in other places \nin our laws.\n  My anti-torture amendment passed in the Senate, went to conference on \nthe Department of Defense authorization bill, but it was changed \nslightly from a prohibition to a statement of policy. I didn't care \nmuch for the change, but I accepted it because I thought it still \npreserved the basic goal, which was to restate our country's policy \nagainst torture. The part that did not change was my amendment's \nrequirement that the Department of Defense report regularly on any \nviolations of this policy against torture. That was what happened in \nthe Department of Defense bill.\n  Then came the intelligence reform bill, and I felt it was important \nthat we try again to restate our law of prohibition against torture. It \nwas equally important that the reporting requirements for violations \napply not only to the military agencies as we did in the Defense bill, \nbut also apply to the variety of different intelligence agencies \ncovered by the intelligence bill.\n  I tried with both bipartisan amendments to cover the circumstances of \nthose who would take into detention someone during the course of war in \nIraq or Afghanistan or some other place.\n  This amendment passed and it was sent to conference. I followed the \nconference closely as a Senate conferee and a member of the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee.\n  I was surprised and disappointed to learn as I went to conference \nthat a message had come down from the White House--specifically from \nDr. Rice and OMB Director Joshua Bolten--which said they objected to my \namendment which condemned torture by any American, including members of \nthe American intelligence community.\n\n  I couldn't believe it--they first accepted the underlying policy \ngoals and\n\n[[Page S406]]\n\nthe reporting requirements of this same amendment for the Department of \nDefense, and now they were making an exception when it came to \nintelligence agencies.\n  I have to tell you that I am very troubled by that. When Senator \nBoxer asked repeated questions of Dr. Rice on the issue, she received \nconflicting answers. So I returned to the same question this morning. I \nasked Dr. Rice point blank: Why did you object to that amendment? She \nsaid incorrectly: We had already taken care of that. Your Department of \nDefense amendment took care of intelligence agencies.\n  That is not the case. The Department of Defense amendment which I \noffered, which she should have read and apparently did not read, had \nreporting requirements for the Department of Defense but not for the \nintelligence agencies. My intelligence reform bill amendment would have \nextended these requirements for the intelligence agencies.\n  I am disappointed by that. It is not just another amendment being \noffered on the floor. Taking away any personal pride and authorship in \nthis, it was a timely amendment after the Abu Ghraib prison scandal to \ntry to restate for America and the world where we stood and where our \nprinciples are. Yet this administration opposed it. I am troubled by \nit. I understand Senator Boxer is even more troubled by it.\n  This is a critical moment in our history. It is critical because of \nthe war in Iraq to pick up the morning paper--most Americans probably \ndid as well--and read in this paper that the Pentagon announced there \nwill be 120,000 American soldiers in Iraq for at least 2 more years. It \nis a stunning and sad admission.\n  I remember when the invasion took place. I remember a colleague of \nmine from Indiana--who happens to be the chairman of the committee \nbefore us today, Senator Lugar--and his statement. I don't know if he \nstill holds to this position, but I have quoted him at length. He said \nat the moment of our invasion in Iraq that we are likely to be there \nfor 5 years. When I repeated his statement and believed it to be true, \nmany people said: We are sure you are wrong. We are going to be home \nmore quickly than that. After we knock Saddam Hussein out of power, the \nIraqi people will take over and we will come home.\n  Here we are 2 years in the conflict, 1,400 Americans have been \nkilled, 10,000 or 12,000 injured--more by the day--hundreds of \nincidents of insurgency, terrorism, and we are still there.\n  I went to Litchfield, IL, 3 weeks ago to watch an MP Illinois Guard \nunit go off for their deployment for 18 months. There are 80, all men, \nin this unit. I shook hands with each of them and looked them in the \neye and gave them all my best wishes, as did the crowd at the \nLitchfield High School gym. As I looked at them, I thought: Is there \nany possibility they will be home soon? This report in the morning \npaper says the answer is no.\n  What troubles me is not that it is a situation demanding of \nAmericans. We have risen to challenges before. But what troubles me the \nmost about this is I think it evidences one of the most profound \nfailures in a democracy. When leaders of a democratic government \nmislead the people of the country in relation to a war and an invasion \nof another country, I think that is the lowest point one can reach. \nNote that I said misleading and not intentionally misleading. There is \na big difference.\n  In this situation, it is the argument of President Bush and his White \nHouse that it is true--they misled the American people about the \npresence of weapons of mass destruction, about nuclear weapons, about \naluminum tubes, about connections with al-Qaida, about unmanned aerial \nvehicles. The list goes on and on. But their argument is, well, we had \nintelligence; we received bad information. If we told the American \npeople something was wrong, don't blame us; blame the intelligence \nagencies.\n  That has been the position of the White House. That is a sad defense \nwhen you consider where we are today, with 150,000 American troops with \ntheir lives in danger after being misled by the White House about the \ncircumstances surrounding Iraq.\n  Dr. Rice, as the National Security Adviser, was in the room and at \nthe table when decisions were made. She has to accept responsibility \nfor what she said, which has been quoted at length on the floor. Some \nof the suggestions about nuclear threats, some of the suggestions about \nthe threats of Saddam Hussein out of the mouth of Dr. Rice were just \nplain wrong and repeated. That, to me, is very troubling.\n  Five days from today, Iraq is scheduled to hold its first election in \nnearly half a century. It is a step forward. We want to see this move \ntoward democracy. I hope it is just not an occasion for more \nbloodshed. I hope it is not just an occasion for more bloodshed. It may \nbe.\n\n  We have to ask what kind of election this will be. How many people \nwill vote? That is an indicator of whether the election reflects the \npopular will. Is it an election which will be carried out with \nintegrity? Is it one where the people clearly have a choice and where \nthe election ballots are counted?\n  We have to ask what kind of elections they will be if candidates' \nnames cannot be published, if polling places cannot be designated, and \nwhen few Sunni Muslims are likely to participate. However successful \nthe elections may be, we all know that the bloodshed will not end at \nthat point. Our present policies in Iraq seem unlikely to bring an end \nto the killing there any time soon.\n  Last year, Congress allocated $18 billion for the reconstruction of \nIraq for the basic necessities of life--electricity, clean water. Only \n$2.2 billion of that amount has been spent. Why? Because it is unsafe \nto spend the rest. It is so unsafe that anything we build is likely to \nbe blown up as soon as we build it. The violence we see there reflects \nthe frustration of the people of Iraq who think the occupying United \nStates Army is not improving their lives. We are caught in this vicious \ncircle. We cannot rebuild Iraq because what we build will likely be \ndestroyed, and until we rebuild Iraq, the people will not feel their \nfate has improved by the occupation of the American troops. Maybe this \nelection will change that dynamic. I certainly hope so.\n  Now comes the administration saying they are going to need $80 to \n$100 billion more to continue this war. I was 1 of 23 Senators who \nvoted against the authorization for this war; 1 Republican and 22 \nDemocrats voted against it. After that vote, though, we had an \nopportunity to vote for the money for the troops. I voted for every \nsingle penny this administration has asked for. I will tell you why. I \nthink to myself, what if it were your son or daughter in uniforms \nrisking their lives, would you shortchange them anything? The answer \nis, clearly, no.\n  Yet despite all the money we have put into Iraq, one of the soldiers \nfrom Tennessee stands up and asks the Secretary of Defense a few weeks \nago: Why do I have to dig through junk piles to find pieces of steel to \nprotect my humvee? What is going on, Mr. Secretary? His answer was \nhardly satisfying or responsive. For all the money we have given to \nthis administration, we cannot say they have spent it well when it \ncomes to protecting our troops.\n  I have a friend with a son in uniform, in service in Iraq. He and his \nwife came up with $2,000 to buy body armor for their son, which they \nsent to him in Iraq. We are spending billions of dollars, and \nindividual families have to send body armor to their soldiers.\n  Humvees--I don't have to tell you the story there. In the middle of \nlast year, this administration discontinued armoring humvees even \nthough there were hundreds, if not thousands, still vulnerable. Now \nthey have resumed after that one Tennessee soldier had the courage to \nstand up.\n  Dr. Rice estimates there are 120,000 trained Iraqi forces under arms. \nSenator Biden of Delaware and many others dispute that number. They \nthink it is vastly inflated. When asked whether you would stand and \nallow one of these troops to defend you, these Iraqi forces with their \ncurrent equipment and training, most people honestly answered no.\n  We have had many failures in Iraq. The National Security Adviser to \nthe President who was there as we devised this strategy and executed \nthis strategy now comes before us for a substantial promotion to \nSecretary of State. It is troubling.\n  I am also worried about this whole issue of torture. We will revisit \nthis on\n\n[[Page S407]]\n\nthe nomination of Alberto Gonzales to be Attorney General because his \nfingerprints are all over this administration's torture policy.\n  When members of the Foreign Relations Committee asked Dr. Rice about \ncertain interrogation techniques, whether they constituted torture, she \nsaid it would not be appropriate for her to comment. Yet, I think she \nunderstands, and we understand, that if she is to be successful as the \ndiplomat representing the United States of America, one of the first \nthings she has to try to dispel are those ghastly, horrible images of \nAbu Ghraib. Do not believe for a moment that people across the world \ndismiss that as an aberration of renegade night shift soldiers. They \nbelieve that this is America at work. We know better. We know our \ntroops are better. Our men and women are much better than what was \ndemonstrated at Abu Ghraib, but it is, in fact, an image which haunts \nand will continue to haunt America for years to come.\n\n  Senator Boxer asked Dr. Rice why the administration opposed the \nlanguage I have talked about earlier on prohibiting torture. As I have \nsaid before, I thought her answers were, at best, confusing and \nunresponsive. Frankly, this administration should not waste any time \nrestating the obvious.\n  Every year, our Department of State issues a report card on the \nworld. We stand in judgment of the world on issues of human rights. We \ncall it the ``Country Reports on Human Rights Practices.'' These \nreports are pretty harsh on some countries. They say about these \ncountries around the world that they are involved in torture and \ndegrading treatment, including beatings, threats to detainees and their \nfamilies, sleep deprivation, deprivation of food and water, suspension \nfor long periods in contorted positions, prolonged isolation, forced \nprolonged standing, tying of the hands and feet for extended periods of \ntime, public humiliation, sexual humiliation, and female detainees \nbeing forced to strip in front of male security officers.\n  These are the charges we level against other countries around the \nworld, saying they are engaging in inhumane practices. Do any of these \ntechniques sound familiar? If you pick up the morning paper you will \nsee that our military and intelligence forces were engaged in similar \ntechniques in Iraq and other places around the world. How can we stand \nin judgment of other countries? How can we hold ourselves up as a model \nwhen we are guilty of the same conduct? If there is ever a time when \nthis administration should have embraced my amendments to both the \nDefense bill and the intelligence bill to say what we stand for in this \ncountry, it is now. Unfortunately, they have not.\n  Let me say a word about a recent editorial in the Wall Street Journal \nwhich took me to task because I am condemning torture techniques and \ndemanding accountability for agencies of government that engage in \nthem. I would say to the editors of the Wall Street Journal, it is time \nfor you to make a choice. If you support torture, for goodness' sake, \nmake that your editorial policy; if not, join us in condemning those \nwho violate the standards of this Government, which have held up for \ndecades.\n  Condoleezza Rice, as National Security Adviser, understands what has \nhappened in Iraq and what her new job will require. It will require \ndiplomacy, a diplomacy which failed before our invasion of Iraq. Many \nwho opposed the invasion felt at the time we needed a broader \ncoalition. But the President and his supporters argued about the \ncoalition of the willing--150 nations, whatever the number happened to \nbe. But let's be very honest about that. When you pick up the morning \npaper, whose soldiers are being killed? When you look at the message \nfor supplemental appropriation, whose taxpayer dollars are being spent? \nIt is the Americans. The British have stood by us. Other countries have \nprovided help. But when it comes to carrying this burden, it is \nAmerican soldiers and American taxpayers. Diplomacy had its place \nbefore the invasion of Iraq. It will have its place in the future.\n  I also talked to Dr. Rice about the situation in Sudan. I commended \nthe administration for finally crossing that difficult line which the \nClinton administration refused to cross when it came to Rwanda. The \nClinton administration refused to use the word ``genocide,'' and that \nis what happened in Rwanda. Hundreds of thousands of innocent people \ndied. I commended Dr. Rice because the Bush administration, Secretary \nPowell, has stepped forward and has said clearly this is genocide. But \nit is not enough to just say it when civilized nations who have signed \nthe Genocide Convention step forward and say it is taking place, it \nrequires positive action on our part. There has been very little. \nCalling in the African Union forces is too little, too late. It will \ntake much more. I tried to make that point as clearly as I could.\n  We also discussed at length the AIDS epidemic that faces this world. \nIf there is one thing that Secretary Powell said that I believe will be \nhistoric in its importance, it is his reference to HIV/AIDS and the \nglobal epidemic. Here is what he said. He referred to that epidemic as \n``the greatest weapon of mass destruction in the world today.'' I know \nhe believed it. I have spoken to him about it many times. Every 10 \nseconds another person dies of AIDS in this world. Every 6 seconds \nanother person becomes infected.\n\n  The President pledged $15 billion for this cause. We have fallen \nshort in the first 2 years of reaching a $3 billion target. I have \nasked Dr. Rice, if she is confirmed by the Senate, whether she is \ncommitted to our meeting that obligation. She said she was.\n  We also talked about the role of women in the world, particularly \nwhen it comes to the AIDS epidemic. It is important that we teach \nabstinence and teach moral values and spiritual belief. But it is also \nimportant that we empower women around the world to control their own \nfate and future. We can tell women to be faithful to their partners, \nbut what if their partners are unfaithful to them? We can encourage \ncondom use but must remember that women may not have the ability to \nnegotiate when it comes to that issue, even with their husbands.\n  It is important that our global strategies against HIV/AIDS are \nrealistic. In a speech at the International AIDS Conference in July \n2004, Nelson Mandela reminded us that:\n\n       In the course of human history, there has never been a \n     greater threat than the HIV/AIDS epidemic.\n\n  We have a chance in America, under the President's initiative to \ncontinue to lead, both with our own bilateral aid to individual \ncountries and through the Global Fund. I hope Ms. Rice in that capacity \nwill assume that leadership position.\n  We have to also look to economic development. I said to Dr. Rice, if \nI went to a struggling country anywhere in the world and could only ask \none question to decide the likelihood that they would be able to \ncontrol their problems and their future, it would be this: How do you \ntreat your women? And if women are treated like chattel, like property, \nlike slaves, I can virtually guarantee you that country has little or \nno chance of conquering its problems. How many girls are in school? Are \nthere forced child marriages? Do women enjoy economic opportunities? Is \nmaternal health care a national priority? Give me the answers to those \nquestions and I will give you a pretty good idea as to whether I think \nyour country is moving forward. The President created the Millennium \nChallenge Account, and it has many important initiatives and goals in \nit. I said to her, and I repeat, I think elevating the role of women \naround the world should be one of those goals.\n  The President's new foreign assistance initiative, the Millennium \nChallenge Account embodies an innovative and important initiative.\n  It is a program of immense but as yet completely unrealized \npotential.\n  The Millennium Challenge Account seeks to provide assistance to those \ncountries with a proven record of investing in their own people, as \nwell as meeting other criteria.\n  I would like to apply the same standard to our own foreign assistance \nprograms: Are we investing enough in people?\n  Are we helping build the infrastructure that will help eliminate \npoverty and not merely ease the latest crisis for a few months?\n  Are we making sure that our assistance reaches women in developing \nnations, women who are the key to successful development?\n\n[[Page S408]]\n\n  These same principles must guide us as we seek to help those \ndevastated by the tsunami.\n  For instance, half the people of Aceh, Indonesia, the region hit \nhardest by the tidal wave, lacked clean water before the tsunami.\n  Disasters hit hardest where poverty is greatest, and they affect \nwomen and children most of all.\n  The tsunami swept away entire villages in a matter of minutes. We \nmust commit to helping these regions recover over a period of years.\n  Secretary-designate Rice steps into her position at a critical \njuncture.\n  Well over 1,300 American soldiers, marines, sailors, and airmen have \ndied in Iraq.\n  Nearly 150,000 are still over there.\n   Mr. President, 70,000 people have died in Darfur. Thousands more are \nstill at risk every day. In South Africa, one in three adults are HIV \npositive. In Botswana the numbers are even higher.\n  Over a billion people live on less than a dollar a day. A billion \npeople in the world cannot write their own names or read a single \nsentence.\n  We simply cannot afford to get this wrong. We cannot afford to repeat \nmistakes or to fall short in our commitments. These are matters of \nprofound moral obligation and deepest national security and interest.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that an editorial \nendorsing Dr. Rice for Secretary of State, published in the Evansville \nCourier & Press, on January 24, 2005, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n          [From the Evansville Courier & Press, Jan. 24, 2005]\n\n                               Cool Condi\n\n       Senate Democrats rather churlishly pushed Condoleezza \n     Rice's certain approval as secretary of state over to this \n     week. Perhaps they felt that the gracious gesture of \n     confirming her on Inauguration Day would be interpreted as a \n     sign of weakness by the Bush White House.\n       Democrats on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee seemed \n     disappointed that Rice would not distance herself from, \n     backtrack from or apologize for President Bush's foreign \n     policy. In hearings last week, they failed to force any \n     daylight between Rice and the president. And they tried; one \n     session even ran into the night.\n       Rice's credentials to be secretary of state were not in \n     question. She is a career student of foreign policy and spent \n     the last four years as White House national security adviser. \n     No one who has followed her career was surprised by her \n     performance before the Foreign Relations Committee.\n       She was informed, poised and unflappable, her voice only \n     taking on a slight edge when Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., \n     all but accused her of being a liar--``your loyalty to the \n     mission you were given, to sell this war, overwhelmed your \n     respect for the truth.''\n       Rice's icy response: ``I never, ever lost my respect for \n     the truth in the service of anything.'' In the end, only \n     Boxer and Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., of the 18 committee \n     members, voted against Rice, for whatever significance that \n     symbolic gesture had.\n       Rice defended and endorsed administration positions on \n     Iraq--the war was right even if the intelligence was wrong--\n     and on North Korea, Iran and the Mideast. The consistency is \n     admirable, but it raises the worrisome prospect that there is \n     no fresh thinking on these problems within the \n     administration.\n       That said, she made several worthy commitments. She would \n     work to rebuild relations with our traditional allies, \n     refocus administration attention on neglected Latin America, \n     take an active role in a Mideast settlement and reassert the \n     State Department as ``the primary instrument of American \n     diplomacy''--a clear if diplomatic shot at Donald Rumsfeld \n     and the Pentagon.\n       The Senate should confirm Rice without delay. She needs to \n     get to work.\n\n  Mr. LUGAR. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank my distinguished colleague, the \nchairman, for his great leadership in handling this nomination. That \nleadership is consistent with what I have observed these many years, \nnow being in my 27th year in the Senate, my colleague being a year or 2 \nsenior to me. But on behalf of the Senate and on behalf of the country, \nwe thank you, Mr. Chairman. And I must say, I think your ranking \nmember, in large measure, has been supportive. I am anxious to see how \nthis works out tomorrow. But well done to you, sir, from one old sailor \nto another.\n  I am privileged to join my colleagues today in this very important \ndebate with regard to the nomination of perhaps the most important \nmember of any President's Cabinet, that of Secretary of State.\n  Before referring to Dr. Rice, I would like to pause and express my \nheartfelt appreciation to Secretaries Powell and Armitage. I have been \nprivileged to have known them and worked with them for many years.\n  When I was Secretary of the Navy, while I did not know him at that \ntime, during the war in Vietnam, Secretary Powell was on the very front \nlines of that war. And to this day, in his heart and in other ways, he \ncarries the heavy burdens of that conflict. I have always been so \nimpressed with him. I have worked with him as he rose through the \nranks.\n  I first met him as a colonel and followed his career all the way \nthrough being a four star general, particularly when I was actively \nworking with him and he was the executive military assistant to \nSecretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger. And by his side he wisely chose \nto put Secretary Rich Armitage, another Vietnam veteran who bears the \nscars of that war. They were a magnificent team on behalf of the United \nStates of America, and they both quietly have stepped down in the \nmanner in which they have always conducted their lives. I want to be \namong the many to pay their respects to those two fine public servants \non the eve of confirming the successor to Secretary Powell.\n  I have also known, through the years, the nominee to take Secretary \nArmitage's place, and he is an excellent choice. The President is to be \ncommended.\n  I must refer to history. I love this institution I think as much as \nanyone; not more than anyone, but as much. I respect the heritage and \ntraditions of this Chamber. It is quite interesting, if you go back, \nthe Presidents of the United States--certainly I would yield to the \nchairman; I have the history of these here--Presidents have always had \nthe Senate confirm their Secretary of State on the day of the \ninauguration. It goes quite a ways back in history.\n  I expressed at that time that I regret this Chamber could not act, \nand I continue to express that. I think this debate is an important \none. I do not in any way suggest that this debate not take place, but I \nthink it could have taken place in the ensuing days and weeks following \nthat. But that is history. I did not want this tradition of the Senate \nto be overlooked in the context of these remarks.\n  It is clear from the exhaustive nomination hearings conducted by the \nForeign Relations Committee over the course of 2 days that Dr. Rice is \nextraordinarily capable and qualified. She is as capable and qualified \na candidate as has ever been appointed in my lifetime to this position. \nShe stands with the finest because of her extraordinary record of \nachievements. I say to the chairman, she was reported out of your \ncommittee by a vote of 16 to 2. To me, that is a resounding affirmation \nby bipartisan members of that committee.\n\n  The personal attacks on her character and integrity, we have now \nwitnessed them. I find them somewhat astonishing, the level of the \nattack, particularly as it relates to her lifetime dedication to what \nwe call here in the Senate the standards for truthfulness.\n  And I was delayed, Mr. Chairman, because I had been trying through \nthe day to reach former Secretary of State George Shultz, with whom you \nand I and many others have had so many years of warm and excellent \nrelations--sometimes not so warm, maybe a little heated on occasion, I \nrecall. But Secretary Shultz reminded me that Dr. Rice first met \nPresident Bush in his living room. And the relationship goes way back.\n  So I wrote down just a few of the remarks by that distinguished \nSecretary because it goes to the very heart of the critics who \nchallenge her integrity. He said, without any reservation whatsoever, \nshe was absolutely honest in her convictions and a woman of impeccable \nloyalty and integrity.\n  He said loyalty, of course. But truthfulness will always prevail over \nany degree of loyalty.\n  I found that important, and I wanted to share it with my colleagues. \nShe, in\n\n[[Page S409]]\n\nhis judgment, will rise to the occasion and in due course, if not \nalready, she will receive the trust and confidence of the people of \nthis country, and that her record, as she works through her challenges, \nwill be one that they, the United States of America and its citizens, \ncan be proud of.\n  I thank Secretary Shultz for his remarks.\n  I also thought to myself, the chairman and I have paralleled our \ncareers. One of my Commanders in Chief, actually two times--for a brief \nperiod at the end of World War II and then Korea--was Harry Truman. \nHarry Truman very often had directed at him some remarks which didn't \nexactly reflect with great resounding in his heart. He came out with \nthat priceless statement: If you can't take the heat, get out of the \nkitchen.\n  Well, the most profound thing that I may say today is this Secretary \nof State can take the heat, and she will remain in that kitchen. In my \njudgment, in the vote by the Senate tomorrow, you will find by virtue \nof the size of that vote a statement by this Senate reflecting their \ntrust and their confidence in this distinguished American's record of \nachievement over her lifetime, her entire lifetime, not just that in \npublic office recently.\n  Going back to some of the comments that were leveled at her, the \nessence of the criticism was that she has been less than truthful. It \nturned in large measure on this issue of weapons of mass destruction. \nThat is an issue that I take a back seat to no one on. I tried in every \nrespect with others to be in the very forefront of that debate.\n  I remember one hearing of the Senate Armed Services Committee, and \nDirector Tenet was before the committee. I asked him a question. This \nwas before we had engaged in active military operations to liberate the \npeople of Iraq. The President was there in the final moments of his \ndecisionmaking. I was one of four who worked up a bipartisan resolution \nthat the Senate worked up. Seventy-seven Senators voted for that \nresolution.\n  I said to Director Tenet, the issue of weapons that can bring about \nsuch destruction is important in this debate and this decision process. \nI used the phrase such as ``should we be compelled,'' as the President \nwas, in my judgment, rightfully, to go in and use military power, and \nat such time as the battles have reached a position where the \ntelevision cameras of the world can come in and photograph what is \nthere, will those photographs, the television pictures, carry clearly \nevidence of the existence of weapons of mass destruction. And his \nacknowledgment was: Without a doubt.\n  Now that testimony reflects the best judgment within our Government \nof the situation with regard to weapons of mass destruction. Hussein \nhad defied 17 or 18 United Nations resolutions. Literally because of \nhis defiance and inaction, it propelled this Nation into this war. And \nbecause of his past history with the use of such weapons and the clear \ndocumentation following the 1991 conflict that they were there in some \nmeasure, there was every reason to attach considerable credibility to \nthe prevailing thinking at that time, not only within our Government \nbut many other governments of the world, that these weapons did exist \nin the hands of a despot and in one way or another they could be \nreleased either by him or by surrogates on free nations elsewhere in \nthe world. That is a statement of fact. I question anybody who wants to \ntake me up on that.\n  Against that background, this criticism is made of this distinguished \npublic servant. But it is clear to me that the actions taken by the \nPresident were the correct ones in light of the facts that were known \nto the best of our judgment at that time. It was a strong case to \nutilize force to back up the diplomacy. I mention that ``force to back \nup diplomacy.'' Diplomacy, throughout the history of mankind, can be no \nstronger than the commitment to enforce it, to back it up in the event \nit fails. I think throughout this process we followed that time-honored \ntradition of world powers. We did everything we could to withhold the \nuse of force and to allow diplomacy to work its will. The rest is \nhistory.\n\n  From the time of Iraq's defeat in the first Persian Gulf war in 1991, \nand following his brutal invasion of Kuwait, Hussein followed a pattern \nof deceit, manipulation, and defiance of the international community. \nHe continued to brutally repress his own citizens. He continued to \nsupport terrorist organizations in Palestine and elsewhere. He made a \nmockery of the U.N. sanctions and the U.N. Security Council \nresolutions, as he pursued banned weapons and technologies of mass \ndestruction. He systematically robbed the coffers of the humanitarian \nprograms established to ensure that Iraqi citizens received sufficient \nmedicines and food and other nourishment.\n  Over the course of the next 12 years, since 1991, the Hussein regime \ndefied the will of the international community. Every conceivable \ndiplomatic effort has been expended in an attempt to require him to \ndestroy and account for the weapons of mass destruction he clearly \npossessed in 1991, to account for missing Kuwaiti nationals, and to \ncomply with at least 17 U.N. Security Council resolutions.\n  Prior to 9/11, Saddam Hussein's conduct was of grave concern to the \nUnited States and, indeed, the larger international community. Based on \nhis repressive treatment of his own citizens in defiance of U.N. \nweapons inspectors, it became the policy of the United States, as \nembodied in the Iraq Liberation Act in October of 1998, to actively \nseek regime change in Iraq.\n  In a statement to the Nation shortly after ordering United States \narmed forces to strike Iraq in December 1998, after Saddam Hussein had \nexpelled U.N. weapons inspectors, President Clinton stated the \nfollowing--I might add a personal note. I remember so well our former \ncolleague and dear friend Bill Cohen was Secretary of Defense at that \ntime. I was chairman of the committee.\n  He invited me over several hours before the order was executed to \nutilize force. We sat in that office of the Secretary of Defense which \nI had been in so many times over the years, and he went through very \ncarefully the reason why President Clinton decided to use force. I \nremember saying to him: Well, Mr. Secretary--I obviously said Bill--it \nis on the eve of Christmas. Could not this matter be delayed for a \nbrief period. Let's face it, the world is celebrating one of the great \nreligious and historic precedents. He said: No. We are going to launch \nit.\n  Well, the President said the following as he launched that strike:\n\n       Earlier today I ordered America's armed forces to strike \n     military and security targets in Iraq. Their mission is to \n     attack Iraq's nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons \n     programs and its military capacity to threaten its neighbors. \n     The international community had little doubt then, and I have \n     no doubt today, that left unchecked, Saddam Hussein will use \n     these terrible weapons again . . . The hard fact is that so \n     long as Saddam Hussein remains in power, he threatens the \n     well-being of his own people, the peace of the region, and \n     the security of the world. And, mark my words; he will \n     develop weapons of mass destruction. He did deploy them and \n     he will use them.\n\n  I don't know what additional needs to be said. To me that is very \nclear. It is understandable. It is explicit. It was a proper use of \nPresidential power. Even though he made, I think, at that point a very \ncourageous and proper decision, it did not deter Saddam Hussein.\n  In the post-9/11 world, the thought of a rogue tyrant--one who had \nused weapons of mass destruction in the past--joining forces with \nterrorists was even more unsettling. As the Congress debated the \nresolution to authorize the President to use force in Iraq in October \n2002, our colleague Senator Kerry made the following statement:\n\n       When I vote to give the President of the United States the \n     authority to use force, if necessary, to disarm Saddam \n     Hussein, [it is] because I believe that a deadly arsenal of \n     weapons of mass destruction in his hands is a real and grave \n     threat to our security. . . .''\n\n  In a speech 3 months later at Georgetown University, Senator Kerry \nstated:\n\n       Without question, we need to disarm Saddam Hussein. He is a \n     brutal, murderous dictator, leading an oppressive regime. He \n     presents a particularly grievous threat because he is so \n     consistently prone to miscalculation. And now he is \n     miscalculating America's response to his continued deceit and \n     his consistent grasp of weapons of mass destruction. So the \n     threat of Saddam Hussein with weapons of mass destruction is \n     real.\n\n  Is anyone taking the floor today to suggest that President Clinton \nand others who spoke out so forcibly at that time were untruthful? I \nhear a silence.\n\n[[Page S410]]\n\n  I believe that we should give consideration to this fine public \nservant who is stepping up to become Secretary of State and consider \nthe environment, the state of the knowledge, the statements made by a \nformer President, and statements made by colleagues in the context of \nthe issue of weapons of mass destruction, and I suggest that I do not \nfind any disloyalty or any lack of truthfulness in her remarks publicly \nand throughout this process as it related to the earlier base of \nknowledge on weapons of mass destruction.\n  As a member of the Intelligence Committee in the last Congress, I \nwent through a very careful set of hearings with other members of that \ncommittee, and we issued a report that I think helped explain how the \nmistakes were made with regard to the judgments on weapons of mass \ndestruction, on which I certainly do not find any basis to challenge \nDr. Rice's truthfulness.\n  In retrospect, we were wrong as a Nation, together with other \ncountries, in our assumptions about Saddam Hussein's stockpiles of \nweapons of mass destruction. This shortcoming in our intelligence \nestimates has been the subject of exhaustive investigations by the \nCongress and independent commissions, and it continues with other \ncommissions that are looking at it. We were not alone in those \nassessments. The best estimates of most foreign intelligence agencies, \nincluding those of Britain, Italy, Germany, Russia, and those of the \nU.N., were that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction. How can \nthe critics possibly say that Dr. Rice and others in the administration \nwould intentionally deceive the American people and the world?\n  Hindsight has also revealed several other interesting facts. Saddam \nHussein's strategy of ignoring sanctions and eroding support for them \nover time was clearly working. International will to continue sanctions \nwas waning. What is clear in the findings of the Iraq Survey Group is \nthat it was Saddam Hussein's intent to revive a weapons of mass \ndestruction program, including a nuclear program, once sanctions were \nremoved or sufficiently eroded and the attention of the world was \ndiverted elsewhere. That comes out of that survey group. Our committee \nhad a great deal of work with that group, and I have high respect for \ntheir findings.\n  It is true that we did not find stockpiles of weapons of mass \ndestruction in Iraq. That is a fact. But, we did find clear evidence of \nSaddam Hussein's intent to reconstitute those programs in the future. \nSuch a finding has to be viewed in the context of Saddam Hussein's \nIraqi regime. Saddam Hussein, his repressive policies, his regional \nambitions, and his weapons of mass destruction had killed hundreds of \nthousands of people over three decades. His relationship with \nterrorists--and his direct role as the head of a state that sponsors \nterrorism and engaged in terrorist operations--contributed to death and \ndestruction in Israel and elsewhere. The ultimate intent of his \nterrorist ties was unclear, but very unsettling, in the post 9/11 \nworld.\n  Considering the compelling factual case, assembled over many years, \nour President made the right decision. In a bipartisan vote, 77 Members \nof this body agreed.\n  Iraq was a grave and gathering threat, to its own citizens, to the \nregion, and to the world. The issue of weapons of mass destruction was \na factor, but by no means the only reason for considering the use of \nmilitary force against Iraq--it was one among many concerns.\n  Courageously, our President did act, with the support of the \nCongress, the voice of the American people. It was the right decision. \nThe world is a safer place today and Iraq and the entire Middle Eastern \nregion is a better place without Saddam Hussein. We owe a timeless debt \nof gratitude to those of our military and to other nations whose \nuniformed personnel have borne the brunt of battle, together with their \nfamilies.\n  Dr. Rice has often, in my visits and consultations with her, \nexpressed her concern for those who bear the brunt of war and, indeed, \nalso the tens of thousands of Iraqi citizens who regrettably at this \nvery moment are suffering from the internal strife in that nation on \nthe eve of these historic elections, which will go forward this \nweekend.\n  We have before us an extraordinarily well-qualified nominee to be \nSecretary of State--an educator, a manager, a public servant, a proven \nleader of international renown. Dr. Rice is enormously talented and we \nare fortunate, as a Nation, to have someone of her caliber so willing \nto serve.\n  I strongly support the nomination of Dr. Rice to be Secretary of \nState and urge my colleagues to confirm her appointment quickly and \noverwhelmingly.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana is recognized.\n  Mr. LUGAR. I thank the Senator, my friend and colleague from \nVirginia, for his generous remarks.\n  I ask unanimous consent at this point, to try to formulate the \nprogram for much of the rest of the evening, that following the remarks \nof Senator Feinstein, this be the order of speakers: Senator Stevens; \nReed of Rhode Island; Voinovich; Kerry; Inhofe; a Democratic Senator at \nthis point, if one seeks recognition; Senator Cornyn; once again, at \nthe next point a Democratic Senator, if one seeks recognition; and \nthere may be as many as three additional speakers who have not \ndetermined whether they were prepared to speak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LUGAR. At this point, in trying to formulate for the benefit of \nthe Senators the rest of the program, how much time remains on both \nsides of the aisle at this juncture?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority controls 2 hours 14 minutes; the \nminority controls 1 hour 52 minutes.\n  Mr. LUGAR. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nCalifornia is recognized.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I thank the Chair and the chairman of \nthe Foreign Relations Committee. I had the pleasure of introducing Dr. \nRice to the Foreign Relations Committee. I thought I might just come to \nthe floor of the Senate and share with the Senate as a whole some of my \nfeelings and beliefs about this nominee.\n  I consider myself a friend of Dr. Rice's. She is a fellow \nCalifornian. I have known her. We have participated together in various \nthink tank discussions. I know the bright, incisive mind that she has. \nI also know her background. This is a woman who was born 50 years ago \nin the segregated South, in Alabama. She has been able to reach the \nhighest level of academia and public service. Can you imagine, she went \nto college at the age of 15 and graduated at the age of 19. Not many \npeople know that. In January of 2001, she became the first African-\nAmerican woman to serve as National Security Adviser. She has \ndistinguished herself as a thoughtful, determined, and hard-working \nindividual. Consequently, I believe she can be a strong and effective \nvoice for America's interests abroad.\n  Now, looking at the foreign policy landscape, the United States faces \nseveral very complex challenges in many parts of the world. How we \nrespond to these challenges will have a tremendous impact not only on \nour future, but on the future of the world. If you just take Iraq--and \nwe are coming up to an election--what happens after that election? What \nwill be done with the ``de-Baathification'' policy of Mr. Bremer, which \nI happen to think was a huge mistake? Yes, one of the mistakes the \nadministration made was to effectively remove many managers and \nsupervisors, of virtually all of the significant infrastructure of \nIraq, including the military and the police department.\n  I am one who believes that was a mistake. I am one who believes that \nbecause of that, the Sunni population has become part of the problem \nrather than part of the solution. That needs to be dealt with. I do not \nknow what Dr. Rice will do, but I do know I have had an opportunity to \ndiscuss it with her, and I do believe she knows that it is a \nsignificant problem that needs to be addressed.\n  In the Middle East, there is a real window of opportunity to advance \nthe peace process with the election of Abu Mazen as the President of \nthe Palestinian Authority and Prime Minister Ariel Sharon's plan to \nwithdraw from Gaza. It has also been helped by the fact that the Labor \nParty has become part of the coalition government, thereby giving Ariel \nSharon more flexibility.\n\n[[Page S411]]\n\n  I was very pleased to hear her statements before the Senate Foreign \nRelations Committee in which she said:\n\n       I look forward to personally working with the Palestinian \n     and Israeli leaders, and bringing American diplomacy to bear \n     on this difficult but crucial issue. Peace can only come if \n     all parties choose to do the difficult work and choose to \n     meet their responsibilities. And the time for peace is now.\n\n  That is a quote from the next Secretary of State of the United States \nof America, who has said that she will make a solution to the \nPalestinian-Israeli struggle a major priority. That is a very important \nstep and a very important statement.\n  Iran and North Korea's nuclear weapons programs pose serious risks \nfor peace and stability in the Middle East, in Asia, and they have set \nback efforts to curb nuclear proliferation. Here, there is need for \nconsistent and effective diplomacy, not to further isolate North Korea \nbut rather to convince North Korean leadership that it is in their \ncountry's self-interest to cooperate in dismantling their nuclear \nprograms.\n  I basically believe countries do what they perceive to be in their \nself-interest, not because we tell them to do something, and I look \nforward to an initiative to convince the North Korean leadership that \nit is indeed in their self-interest to rid themselves of a nuclear \nweapons program.\n  In Russia, President Vladimir Putin has consolidated power and taken \nseveral steps calling into question his commitment to democracy, human \nrights, and the rule of law. Dr. Rice has a very strong background in \nSoviet and Russian affairs, and I believe this is going to be a big \nhelp in charting future diplomatic efforts with President Putin.\n  Serious challenges deserve quality leadership. I believe Dr. Rice has \nthe skill, the judgment, and the poise to take on these challenges and \nlead America's foreign policy in the coming years.\n  I understand that some of my colleagues, many of them on my own side, \nhave serious concerns about Dr. Rice's nomination, stating that she was \na key architect of U.S. foreign policy during President Bush's first \nterm. Let me be clear, I believe the key architects were, in fact, the \nPresident, the Vice President, and the Secretary of Defense. Obviously, \nDr. Rice offered advice and counsel as the President's National \nSecurity Adviser, but remember, 78 Members of this body voted to \nauthorize use of force in Iraq based on the intelligence which we \nreceived, which at the time was compelling and chilling but which we \nnow know was not credible and was both bad and wrong.\n  Should Dr. Rice be blamed for wrong and bad intelligence? I think \nnot. That is what intelligence reform was all about. That is what \nimproved oversight over the intelligence community by the Intelligence \nCommittees of both the House and the Senate is really all about, and \nthat is what a new national intelligence director, to coordinate the 14 \nor 15 different agencies is all about.\n  For my part, I will continue to fight for a principled foreign policy \nbased not just on military strength but cooperation, understanding, \nhumility, and a desire to seek multilateral solutions to problems that \nindeed touch on many different nations. I want to see the United States \nreclaim the respect and admiration of the world and once again be seen \nas a champion and a leader of democracy, justice, and human rights. I \nbelieve the best way to do this is by example, by listening and by \nunderstanding that America's great strength is not our military prowess \nbut our sense of justice, freedom, and liberty.\n\n  Importantly, Dr. Rice has the trust and confidence of the President \nof the United States and the world knows that she will have direct \naccess to him. I believe this makes her a very powerful Secretary of \nState. I believe she will assume this office with a new dimension. To \nsee this brilliant, young African-American woman represent our \ncountry's national interests on the world stage can bring about a new \ndimension of American foreign policy. So clearly this is an asset.\n  I did not expect this President of the United States to appoint \nanyone who seriously disagreed with him. The question really is, Is \nthis woman competent? Is she able? Can she handle and lead the enormous \nState Department? I believe the answer to those questions is clearly \nyes. I also believe that she will be able to advocate a course and make \nchanges and adjustments when and where necessary, and enhance the \nability of the United States to restore lost credibility among many \nnations and allies.\n  Indeed, barring serious questions about a nominee's integrity and \nability to serve, a President deserves to have his selections \nconfirmed. There is nothing in Dr. Rice's past performance to suggest \nshe is not capable of performing the job as America's chief diplomat, \nhaving the responsibility to conduct America's foreign policy. There is \nevery reason to believe that she is up for this challenge. No one can \nbe sure if she will succeed.\n  I conclude by saying this: Only time and events will tell if Dr. Rice \nwill indeed make a great Secretary of State. To be sure, her vision, \nthinking, and problem-solving skills will be tested. I believe she is a \nremarkable woman, and I look forward to working with her as the next \nSecretary of State.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nAlaska is recognized.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I rise today in support of Dr. \nCondoleezza Rice's nomination for Secretary of State. I first met Dr. \nRice when she served as the Soviet and East European Affairs adviser \nduring the first Bush administration. Her reputation as an invaluable \nadviser was well established even then. She helped guide that \nadministration through the reunification of Germany, rebellion in the \nBalkans, and the collapse of the Soviet Union. Her unshakable \ncommitment to freedom, democracy, international peace and justice are \nunquestioned.\n  Philip Zelikow, who served with Dr. Rice on the National Security \nCouncil during this time, and is the Executive Director of the National \nCommission on Terrorist Attacks, stated this:\n\n       She believes in empowering people. In international \n     affairs, that means real commitment to liberty and freedom. \n     She sees the message of her life as a message of how to \n     realize a person's potential. No one should ever become the \n     prisoner of other people's expectations.\n\n  Dr. Rice returned to Stanford at the close of the first Bush \nadministration. In 1993, she became the first female and non-white \nprovost in the university's history. She was also the youngest.\n  My daughter, Lily, graduated from Stanford in 2003, so I have a \nunique appreciation for Dr. Rice's accomplishments. During her 6 years \nas provost, Dr. Rice succeeded in restoring Stanford's financial \nposition, and also engaged in one of her passions--sports.\n  A stalwart sports fan, Dr. Rice would regularly be seen cheering the \nStanford Cardinals from the bleachers. I even saw her one day when \nStanford beat UCLA--a terrible day. She was also seen working out with \nthe Stanford football team. Dr. Rice is a role model, especially for \nyoung women. During her time at Stanford she was loved by \nundergraduates and appreciated by faculty members.\n  Dr. Rice has had a profound impact on students across our Nation. A \npolitical science major at nearby Howard University put it best, \nsaying:\n\n       She has opened the door for not only women but minorities \n     in government and, hopefully, she [will] be a role model for \n     women and minorities to achieve high, important positions in \n     government.\n\n  Dr. Rice is also capable of making tough decisions. Up to this point \nshe's had mostly advisory roles in government, and she has served in \nthat capacity with honor, dignity and unwavering dedication. It is \nthose qualities--and her unsurpassed intellectual abilities--that \nprompted Forbes magazine to name her the most powerful woman in the \nworld last year. I believe she is entitled to that acclaim.\n  Dr. Rice is a balanced genius in her own right. And, when the Senate \nconfirms her nomination to become Secretary of State--as I believe it \nwill and should--she will be the boss. The Nation could not be in \nbetter hands. Dr. Rice has my complete support. I look forward to \nworking with her in her new role.\n  I ask unanimous consent it be possible for me at this time to \nintroduce S. 39.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Stevens pertaining to the introduction of S. 39 \nare\n\n[[Page S412]]\n\nlocated in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills and \nJoint Resolutions.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nRhode Island is recognized.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, may I inquire how much time I have been \nallotted?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 30 minutes.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleagues in \ndiscussing the nomination of Dr. Condoleezza Rice for Secretary of \nState of the United States. I must confess, after careful deliberation \nI intend to oppose this nomination.\n  There is no doubt that Dr. Rice is an extraordinarily talented, \ncapable individual. Her credentials as an academic are impeccable. She \nhas a compelling life story. She has done remarkable things in her \nlife. But I believe the best way to judge what would be her performance \nas Secretary of State is looking closely at what she has done as a \nNational Security Adviser under this Bush administration. I think in \nthat regard she leaves some very troubling questions unanswered as her \nnomination comes before us this day.\n  Most of what she did with the President, obviously, as his National \nSecurity Adviser, was confidential and necessarily is not subject to \npublic view. But she has not, in my view, successfully responded to \nobvious questions about inconsistencies in her statements, about \npolicies she advocated, apparently, and about her role in marshaling \ninformation for the President of the United States. In a very \nsimplistic view, I think the National Security Adviser's chief role is \nto make sure the President has every bit of information he needs to \nmake very difficult judgments--not just the information that favors one \nside or the other but all the information. Indeed, not just the bold \nstrokes but the nuances. My sense is that this mission was not \nadequately performed by Dr. Rice.\n  She has been a key figure in the Bush foreign policy establishment \ngoing back years when Governor Bush decided to run for President. She \nis someone who is very close to the President. Again, I think she has \nto be judged on the result of that partnership.\n  One of the aspects that is troubling to me is the fact that Dr. Rice \nhas maintained that Iraq is the central arena in the war on terror, \nwhen, in fact, this is a global, international threat to the United \nStates and that, in fact, it appears that Iraq was not the global \ncenter, the central arena in this war on terror.\n  She applied a doctrine of preemption which is applicable to terrorist \ncells, but I believe she applied it incorrectly in the case of Iraq--at \nleast the administration did, and she was the principal architect or \none of the principal architects of that policy.\n  Many people expressed alternate views about the role of Iraq as a \ncenter of terror. Brent Scowcroft, a predecessor as National Security \nAdviser, pointed out in an editorial:\n\n       An attack on Iraq, at this time, would seriously \n     jeopardize, if not destroy, the global counterterrorist \n     campaign we have undertaken.\n\n  To this date I think it certainly has not advanced the policy we are \nactively pursuing throughout the world.\n  She suggested on several occasions there are strong links between al-\nQaida and Saddam Hussein. On March 9, 2003, on ``Face the Nation,'' Dr. \nRice declared:\n\n       Now the al-Qaeda is an organization that's quite disbursed, \n     and quite widespread in its effects, but it clearly has had \n     links to the Iraqis, not to mention Iraqi links to all kinds \n     of other terrorists.\n\n  On ``Meet the Press'' on September 28, 2003, Dr. Rice said:\n\n       No one has said that there is evidence that Saddam Hussein \n     directed or controlled 9/11, but let's be very clear, he had \n     ties to al Qaeda, he had al Qaeda operatives who had operated \n     out of Baghdad.\n\n  That, in my view, is not accurately reflecting what many other \nsources subsequently confirmed, that, in fact, any ties Saddam Hussein \nhad with al-Qaida were very tenuous if they existed at all.\n  On June 27, 2003, the New York Times reported:\n\n       The chairman of the monitoring group appointed by the UN \n     Security Council to track al Qaida told reporters that his \n     team had found no evidence linking al Qaida to Saddam \n     Hussein.\n\n  And 6 months later, the New York Times further reported:\n\n       CIA interrogators have already elicited from the top al \n     Qaida officials in custody that, before the American-led \n     invasion, Osama bin Laden had rejected entreaties from some \n     of his lieutenants to work jointly with Saddam.\n\n  As far back as November 2002, Europe's top investigator of terrorism \ntold the LA Times:\n\n       We have found no evidence of links between Iraq and al \n     Qaeda. If there were such links, we would have found them. \n     But we have found no serious connections whatsoever.\n\n  But what I think Dr. Rice did publicly, and perhaps even within the \nconfines of the West Wing, is to make the case for these links when the \ncase was at least highly questionable. None of that questioning, none \nof that nuance seemed to have been presented effectively to the \nPresident, certainly not effectively to the public.\n  During her confirmation hearings, Dr. Rice asserted her belief, \nreiterated her belief on the topic of troop strength, that she believed \nthat the levels in Iraq were sufficient from the beginning of the war \nup to and including phase IV operations. Phase IV operations are those \nposthostility operations to stabilize the country. In her phrase she \nsaid that they were ``adequately resourced.''\n  What we have discovered in the months since the successful action \nleading to the fall of Saddam is instability, violence--demonstrating, \nI think, less than adequate forces there in country to deal with these \nproblems.\n  It turns out that in March 2003 when a lieutenant colonel was \nbriefing the issue of phase IV, the postoperation activities of our \nmilitary forces, phase 4-C, the chart was very simple. It said, ``To Be \nProvided.'' Again, I think this is a glaring error. If you are the \nNational Security Adviser, you have to be able to assure the President \nof at least a plan for every contingency, thorough, adequate, with \nsufficient resources and sufficient troops. Since the success of the \nmilitary campaign, we have been, in my view, plagued by insufficient \ntroops. Indeed, it was interesting to note that Ambassador Bremer, just \nlast October, stated:\n\n       We never had enough troops on the ground.\n\n  This, I think, is a glaring mistake. It might have been the decision \nof a principal to overrule their best advice, but that is not the case \nshe is making today as she seeks this nomination for Secretary of \nState.\n  There is another troubling issue and that, of course, is the one that \nreceived quite a bit of notoriety--the appearance in the State of the \nUnion speech of a reference to Iraq attempting to buy yellow cake from \nAfrica even though weeks before that, many weeks before that, the CIA \nclaimed that such an assertion was unsubstantiated.\n  In a July 2003 interview with Jim Lehrer, Dr. Rice stated she either \ndid not see or could not remember reading this CIA clearance memo.\n  I would argue if a piece of information is going to be uttered by the \nPresident of the United States in a State of the Union speech dealing \nwith the critical issues of peace and war, of weapons of mass \ndestruction, of the attempt of one nation to obtain nuclear material \nfrom another, that is a point of information that has to be of concern \nto the National Security Adviser.\n  She claims she delegated it to her deputy, Stephen Hadley. But still \nit is her responsibility. That was a misstatement--a misstatement that \nhad already been pointed out by the CIA before the President made such \na statement before our colleagues in the State of the Union Address.\n  The interesting point to make also is that Mr. Hadley now apparently \nhas been selected to be the National Security Adviser even though if \nthere was a mistake he apparently is the one who is determined to be \nresponsible--at least in Dr. Rice's recollection.\n  There is another issue, too. In October 2003, the White House \nannounced the creation of an ``Iraq Stabilization Group,'' recognizing \nthat something more had to be done to stabilize the situation. Dr. Rice \nwas charged with leading this stabilization group. This group was \ndesigned to coordinate activities there. She was in charge. There were \nfour coordinating committees on counterterrorism, economic development, \npolitical affairs, and creation of clearer messages to the media both \nin the United States and within Iraq.\n\n[[Page S413]]\n\n  There has been no product of this committee, no apparent impact on \npolicy. It is a void in terms of what it has done. Yet this was one of \nher major responsibilities.\n  I think these are serious issues about her stewardship of the very \ncritical role as National Security Adviser and raises serious questions \nin my mind of her capacity to do differently as Secretary of State.\n  She also indicated many times that prior to 9/11 the policy of the \nBush administration--and her advice by inference--was a strong focus on \ncounterterrorism. Yet I understand Dr. Rice was scheduled to deliver a \nspeech on September 11 at Johns Hopkins in which she would indicate the \ncornerstone of the Bush foreign policy was missile defense.\n  Having served in this body during that period of time, I can tell you \nthe emphasis was on missile defense. It was not on counterterrorism. It \nwas not on the old-fashioned kind of boots on the ground, intelligence, \nstriking brigades. It was a multibillion-dollar effort on developing a \nnational missile system. I think her speech scheduled for that day was \nemblematic of what the focus was.\n  Also, before 9/11, the Bush administration was preparing significant \ncuts in the counterterrorism program. Those cuts were obviously \nobviated by the terrible attacks on New York on that dreadful day.\n  Richard Clarke, the counterterrorism expert in the Clinton \nadministration, sent an urgent memo to Dr. Rice directly asking for a \nmeeting of principals about the impending attack by al-Qaida. That was \nJanuary 24, 2001--days after the President took office. There was no \nmeeting with her on such topic until 1 week before 9/11.\n  Internal Government documents show that the Clinton administration \nofficially prioritized counterterrorism as the ``tier I'' priority, but \nwhen the Bush administration took office, top officials downgraded \ncounterterrorism. Even Dr. Rice admitted, ``We decided to take a \ndifferent track.''\n  There again, was the President given the best advice? Was all the \ninformation marshaled so he could make good judgments? Were the people \nwho had viewpoints that might be inconsistent with the group think of \nthe time allowed in? That is a special role of the National Security \nAdviser, and a very difficult role.\n  These are a few of the issues which I think have to be considered \nwith this nomination. There are other issues, too.\n  The President, in my view, is basically replicating his inner circle \nnow in the broader context of the Cabinet. This raises an issue that \nwas identified by John Prados, a senior fellow at the National Security \nArchive at George Washington University. What he said is:\n\n       The administration is setting itself up for a very closed \n     process of creating foreign policy. It's going to eliminate \n     consideration of wider points of view.\n\n  In effect, we are in danger of creating an echo chamber of foreign \npolicy in which one loud voice carries because it reverberates without \ncheck. That, I think, would be a very dangerous situation.\n  There are other areas of concern that I have with respect to Dr. \nRice's nomination. She has excellent access to the President. There are \nfriends of hers who say she and the President have a ``mind meld.''\n  I guess they think alike. But being Secretary of State or being any \nCabinet Secretary is not just having access, rapport, and a sense of \nwhat the boss wants; it is also having the ability and the interest to \ntell hard truths which you know are not going to be accepted well. That \nis something that is important.\n  Again, I don't know. It is hard to predict these things--whether she \npossesses that kind of ability to tell someone whose mind is melded \nwith hers that he is wrong, or she will even understand where policy \nrequires a different perspective.\n  As the New York Times editorial characterized her first term as \nNational Security Adviser, according to their words:\n\n       She seemed to tell [President Bush] what he wanted to hear \n     about the decisions he's already made, rather than what he \n     needed to know to make sound judgments in the first place.\n\n  That type of approach will not serve a Secretary of State very well.\n  She has also broken a longstanding precedent recognized by preceding \nNational Security Advisers who refrain from partisan politics. She gave \nspeeches espousing the administration's policy in key battleground \nStates of Ohio, Florida, and Pennsylvania beginning in May 2004. Her \nactions were sharply criticized by her predecessor, Zbigniew \nBrzezinski, National Security Adviser for President Carter. He stated \nthat ``the national security adviser is the custodian of the nation's \nmost sensitive national security secrets and should be seen as an \nobjective adviser to the President'' and not just another member of the \npolitical team.\n  We have I think serious issues raised by this nomination. No one can \ndeny her ability. But I think she has not successfully explained these \ninconsistencies of statements and these policy mistakes which I believe \nhave seriously eroded our position in the world.\n  She has, along with the President, apparently espoused a unilateral \npolicy that has isolated many of our traditional allies. It has us \ngoing it alone in Iraq at a huge cost. The President is sending up to \nus a supplemental budget of $80 billion. Today, the operations officer \nfor the U.S. Army indicated they assume they will have over 100,000 \ntroops in Iraq not just this year but next year. That means--just doing \nthe arithmetic--that we can expect another $80 billion-plus bill next \nyear, and still we are in a difficult and confusing situation.\n  I think Dr. Rice's nomination recognizes and represents a \ncontinuation of a policy which has us bogged down in Iraq while Iran \nand North Korea continue to advance their nuclear ambitions and while a \ndiminished but still dangerous al-Qaida continues to plot against us.\n  These facts--this strategic situation--I believe requires if not a \nchange in direction at least a realistic reassessment of where we are \nand how we got there.\n  Dr. Rice's nomination does not appear to give hope to this change in \ndirection or realistic reassessment. Therefore, I will vote against \nthis nomination.\n  I yield the remainder of time. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chambliss). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I ask the distinguished Senator from Ohio \nbe recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I rise today to join Chairman Lugar and \nother members of the Foreign Relations Committee to express my strong \nsupport for the nomination of Condoleezza Rice to serve as our next \nSecretary of State.\n  Dr. Rice has the qualifications, the educational background, and \nprofessional experience to serve as an outstanding Secretary of State. \nShe is an academic expert of the former Soviet Union, earning her \ndoctorate before the age of 30, and rising to serve as provost of \nStanford University before turning 40. Her experience as provost at \nStanford University allowed her to have substantial management \nexperience.\n  In addition to her experience in academia, Dr. Rice is an experienced \nprofessional in the national security arena. She served as Director of \nSoviet and Eastern European Affairs at the National Security Council \nunder the administration of President George H. W. Bush and most \nrecently as the National Security Adviser to President George W. Bush.\n  Dr. Rice brings a great deal of talent, skill, and intellect to the \ntable. As our country continues to confront global challenges in Iraq, \nAfghanistan, and other parts of the world, it is essential our \nSecretary of State have the stature, skill, and ability to help protect \nour national security interests and promote the President's vision of \nfreedom and democracy abroad that he so eloquently communicated in his \ninaugural address.\n  This Senator from Ohio shares the President's vision. This vision \nmust be successful so our children and grandchildren are able to live \nin a country free from the fear of terrorism.\n\n[[Page S414]]\n\n  During the last 4 years as National Security Adviser, Dr. Rice has \nplayed a major role in the formulation of our foreign policy, serving \nas a vital part of the administration's effort to promote peace and \ndemocracy throughout the world.\n  Dr. Rice has a close relationship and the confidence of the President \nwhich will serve her well as she assumes the position of Secretary of \nState at home and abroad. She is a good listener, an important trait \nfor someone who is going to be this country's chief diplomat. I know \nthis from contacts with her over the years. I had the pleasure of \nknowing Dr. Rice since joining then Governor Bush as adviser during the \n2000 Presidential elections. I found her ready and willing to work \ntogether on important issues, including United States policy toward \nSoutheast Europe, NATO enlargement, and efforts to combat global anti-\nSemitism.\n  While working with Governor Bush on the campaign trail--and I will \nnot forget in 2000 Dr. Rice knew of my strong concerns with proposed \nlegislation from two respected members of the Senate, Senator Warner \nand Senator Byrd, that would have forced the new American President who \nwas to be elected in 2000--at that stage of the game we were not sure \nwho would be elected in 2000--they were going to force that new \nPresident by July of the first year of his term to decide whether to \nremove United States troops from Kosovo. She listened and became \ninvolved.\n\n  Ultimately, and I remember the debate quite vividly, the provision \nwas defeated with the help of then Presidential candidate George W. \nBush and with the help of then sitting President Clinton.\n  Now, nearly 5 years later I continue to believe it is essential we \nremain engaged in Southeast Europe, particularly as we look to ensure \npeace and security in Kosovo following the violence that erupted last \nMarch. I know Dr. Rice will continue to work on matters important to \nthe stability of this part of the world and I am confident she \nunderstands how important it is for the United States to play a \nleadership role in the Balkans.\n  During her tenure as National Security Adviser, I have worked with \nDr. Rice on other foreign policy priorities, including efforts to bring \nseven new nations into the NATO alliance, strengthening a Europe that \nis whole, free, and at peace. Among these seven countries were the \nBaltic nations of Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia--all countries I \nstrongly believe deserve membership in NATO despite strong objections \nfrom Russia. Again, Dr. Rice was willing to listen and to serve as an \near for the President.\n  I was pleased when the President made clear his support for NATO \nenlargement during a speech in Warsaw, Poland, in June of 2001. At that \ntime there were many people in this country who were concerned that \nbecause the President wanted to move away from the ABM Treaty that he \nmight negotiate with Russia in a quid pro quo for their backing off of \nthe ABM if he would back off from pushing for expansion of NATO, \nparticularly the three countries I mentioned.\n  President Bush made an outstanding speech in Warsaw, Poland, and he \nmade clear his support for NATO enlargement. He remarked at that time:\n\n       I believe the NATO membership for all of Europe's \n     democracies that seek it.\n\n  President Bush went on to say:\n\n       As we plan to enlarge NATO, no nation should be used as a \n     pawn in the agenda of others. We will not create away the \n     fate of free European peoples.\n\n  The seven countries that went in--Slovenia, Slovakia, Bulgaria, \nRomania, Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania--all of those people who have \nrelatives in the United States should know it was Condoleezza Rice who \nworked with the President to prepare that speech so we made it very \nclear he supports the expansion of NATO. And even though our relations \nhave thawed with Russia today, the fact of the matter is, we have \ncontinued to have serious differences of opinion with Russia.\n\n  Again, her special expertise--Think about it. We are going to have a \nSecretary of State who can ponimat po-russki. I think that is very \nimportant. We have not had a Secretary of State who is fluent in \nlanguages as is Dr. Rice. I think some people may not think that is \nimportant, but I will tell you, it is important that people know she \nthinks enough of other languages that she has become an expert in those \nlanguages.\n  Dr. Rice has also worked with me and other colleagues of the Senate \nand the House of Representatives to combat global anti-Semitism. We \nhave made important strides in this effort during the last several \nyears, but there is still more to be done, particularly to establish a \nnew office at the State Department to monitor and combat anti-Semitism. \nDr. Rice has expressed her support for such action, which is called for \nas part of the Global Anti-Semitism Review Act, which the President \nsigned into law on October 16, 2004.\n  I am pleased that Dr. Rice appeared receptive to attending the third \nOSCE conference on anti-Semitism which is scheduled to take place in \nCordoba, Spain this June. Her presence as Secretary of State of the \nUnited States at this conference is essential, as was the presence of \nSecretary Powell at the prior OSCE conference in Berlin, as an example \nof the concern of the United States about the growing menace of anti-\nSemitism. I am confident, under her leadership, this good work will \ncontinue, and I am hopeful we can take it to an even greater level.\n  I say that every one of us here, in one way or another, could be \ncritical of decisions made in U.S. foreign policy. It is easy to be a \nMonday-morning quarterback. As we continue to move forward with efforts \nto promote stability and security in Iraq and the greater Middle East \nand other parts of the world, I think it is an advantage to have \nsomeone serving as Secretary of State who has experience and has seen \nthe pluses and minuses, and had the opportunity to take away lessons \nlearned.\n  She has been there for 4 years. Even though some people do not want \nto admit it, we have had some ups and downs, and she has experienced \nthose. I would rather have somebody who has been there and experienced \nthese things as Secretary of State than bring in some fresh face that \nhas not had that experience. I am sure Dr. Rice has learned some \nimportant lessons during these last 4 years.\n  I agree with the Cleveland Plain Dealer, the largest newspaper in \nOhio, which had an editorial titled, ``A little respect, please: Dems \nshould remove petty obstacles to Rice's confirmation, but she owes \nsenators much better answers as secretary of state.''\n  I ask unanimous consent it be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nA Little Respect, Please: Dems Should Remove Petty Obstacles to Rice's \nConfirmation, but She Owes Senators Much Better Answers as Secretary of \n                                 State\n\n       That said, [Condoleezza Rice]'s performance during nearly \n     11 hours of confirmation hearings before the Senate Foreign \n     Relations Committee last week was more than just \n     disappointing. It was alarming to see an official who played \n     such a central role in crafting U.S. Iraq policy turn vague \n     and uncommunicative when specific questions were asked. \n     Congress deserves fuller responses on critical matters such \n     as the U.S. exit strategy, how soon before adequate numbers \n     of Iraqi security forces are trained and the overall \n     rationale for U.S. engagement in Iraq.\n       Condoleezza Rice ought to make an accomplished secretary of \n     state for reasons that go well beyond having the president's \n     ear. She has the skills, interest and drive to reinvigorate \n     U.S. diplomacy and repair severely frayed international \n     relations. Her communication abilities, personal warmth, work \n     ethic and knowledge, combined with the fervor of her beliefs, \n     could make her a national treasure at a fateful moment when \n     the Iraq war has tarnished American standing in the world. \n     Her stated and obviously heartfelt commitment to foreign \n     engagement, public diplomacy and more U.S. efforts to foster \n     foreign-language study could inject needed fire and focus to \n     the diplomatic arts, as practiced by America.\n       That's why no one seriously opposes Rice's nomination to be \n     this country's chief diplomat, four heartbeats away from the \n     presidency.\n       Democratic senators who are playing juvenile games by \n     delaying her confirmation should lift their objections, \n     forthwith.\n       It's one thing to mount principled opposition to policies \n     or people who could injure American interests. It's quite \n     another to throw monkey wrenches just to hear them clank in \n     the cogs. The handful of Democrats, including Sen. Robert \n     Byrd of West Virginia, who are obstructing Rice's moment must \n     stop, and vote her in.\n       That said, Rice's performance during nearly 11 hours of \n     confirmation hearings before the Senate Foreign Relations \n     Committee\n\n[[Page S415]]\n\n     last week was more than just disappointing. It was alarming \n     to see an official who played such a central role in crafting \n     U.S. Iraq policy turn vague and uncommunicative when specific \n     questions were asked. Congress deserves fuller responses on \n     critical matters such as the U.S. exit strategy, how soon \n     before adequate numbers of Iraqi security forces are trained \n     and the overall rationale for U.S. engagement in Iraq.\n       These are the seminal questions the second George W. Bush \n     administration must answer today, not tomorrow.\n       Rice also must clear up the contradiction she herself put \n     forth to the committee: She cannot be both a ``good soldier'' \n     who molds every public statement to the president's message, \n     and also a Cabinet member who speaks her mind and answers \n     Congress candidly. Rice must choose to be the latter, \n     committing herself to the role that her predecessor and \n     friend Colin Powell performed at State--offering her own \n     voice on U.S. diplomacy, not simply an echo of the Oval \n     Office chorus.\n       If Rice can find her voice--and use it push blinkered State \n     Department underlings to better understand both friends and \n     rivals abroad--these next four years could do much to dispel \n     the international ill will and suspicions aroused by the last \n     four. If she cannot, she will be true neither to herself nor \n     to the trust that is about to be placed in her to manage this \n     nation's foreign relations.\n\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. The first quote is:\n\n       [Dr. Rice]'s performance during nearly 11 hours of \n     confirmation hearings before the Senate Foreign Relations \n     Committee last week was more than just disappointing. It was \n     alarming to see an official who played such a central role in \n     crafting U.S. Iraq policy turn vague and uncommunicative when \n     specific questions were asked.\n       Congress deserves fuller responses on critical matters such \n     as U.S. exit strategy, how soon before adequate numbers of \n     Iraqi security forces are trained and the overall rationale \n     for U.S. engagement in Iraq.\n\n  I share some of those concerns, and so do lots of other members of \nthe Foreign Relations Committee. I think the administration has not \nbeen as candid and forthright with us during the last couple of years \nin regard to some of the questions I and other members of the Foreign \nRelations Committee have asked. I want to make it clear publicly that I \nexpect more candor from this administration during the next 4 years, \nparticularly with members on the Foreign Relations Committee, so we can \nmaintain a bipartisan foreign policy. We have some good people on the \nForeign Relations Committee. There are some Democrats who have been \nvery supportive of the President during the last several years, and \nsome of them, I think, are frustrated that they do not feel they are \ngetting the kind of answers they should be getting. I think that is \nsomething Dr. Rice has to understand if we are going to have this \nbipartisan foreign policy that is so essential to us moving forward to \ndo what the President would like to accomplish.\n  That being said, I agree with the Plain Dealer which also said in \nthat editorial:\n\n       Condoleezza Rice ought to make an accomplished secretary of \n     state for reasons that go well beyond having the president's \n     ear.\n       She has the skills, interest and drive to reinvigorate U.S. \n     Diplomacy and repair severely frayed international relations.\n       Her communication abilities, personal warmth--\n\n  Boy, she is a wonderful person. You feel good when you are around \nher.\n\n       [Her] work ethic and knowledge, combined with the fervor of \n     her beliefs, could make her--\n\n  Listen to this--\n\n     a national treasure at a fateful moment when the Iraq war has \n     tarnished American standing in the world.\n\n  I am continuing to read from the editorial:\n\n       Her stated and obviously heartfelt commitment to foreign \n     engagement, public diplomacy and more U.S. efforts to foster \n     foreign-language study could inject needed fire and focus to \n     the diplomatic arts, as practiced by America.\n\n  I think that is one wonderful editorial in support of her nomination \nfrom Ohio's largest newspaper, the Cleveland Plain Dealer.\n  Dr. Rice has the experience, intellect, and ability to serve our \ncountry well as Secretary of State. She is absolutely qualified to have \nthis job. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting her nomination.\n  I would hope that many of our colleagues on the other side of the \naisle who may have some questions will look beyond some of the things \nwe have heard from the other side of the aisle and support her \nnomination so we send a signal to the rest of the world that we have a \nSecretary of State who has the overwhelming support of the Senate. It \nis so important, I think, to her success as our Secretary of State.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks time?\n  The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, first let me say to the Senator from Ohio, \nMr. Voinovich, I have always considered him to be the expert on the \nBalkans, and it is interesting that he would make the comments about \nDr. Rice and her knowledge of that area. At the conclusion of my \nremarks, I am going to be talking a little bit about West Africa, an \narea in which I have had a lot of personal experience. There again, she \nis an expert.\n  We are presented with an extraordinary opportunity to confirm as \nSecretary of State a truly remarkable American. Dr. Condoleezza Rice is \nno stranger to the international scene. Her long record of \naccomplishments is well known to all of us, and her record of exemplary \nservice to this country is without parallel.\n  As President Bush's National Security Adviser, Dr. Rice has played a \nvital role in protecting our Nation both here and abroad, while \nproviding the President with everything he needed to know to defend the \nAmerican people and advance the cause of freedom. Her experience, along \nwith her prior knowledge, makes Condoleezza Rice the ideal Secretary of \nState for these difficult times.\n  Being the Secretary of State has to be one of the toughest jobs I can \nimagine. The person in that job has to be an expert on everything from \nAlbania to Zimbabwe. Over the last 25 years, Dr. Rice has studied \nforeign policy in the academic world and lived foreign policy in the \ntrenches, and she is a master of it in both theory and practice.\n  In addition to being an expert, the Secretary of State also has to be \nsomething of a salesman. It is not enough to understand every detail of \nAmerica's foreign policy; you also have to be able to explain it to \nothers who might be reluctant or even defiant; and then you have to \nconvince them that joining in our work is the right thing to do. Again, \nDr. Rice possesses this ability in abundance, and I cannot imagine \nanyone more qualified to be the face of America in the world of \ndiplomacy.\n  As if these two jobs were not enough, the Secretary also has to \nmanage an enormous Cabinet Department spread across the globe. Most of \nus have been in many parts of the world where you are dealing with \npeople in each one of these countries. These people are experts, and \nyou have to be more of an expert than they are. Staying on top of the \nday-to-day workings of the State Department would be enough for any \nthree people, apart from the other jobs. But Dr. Rice has proven her \nability in this area as well, managing a giant research university with \ngreat success.\n  Of course, Dr. Rice will face many challenges as Secretary of State: \nthe ongoing military action in Iraq and Afghanistan, our efforts to \nrebuild those countries as we continue to share the joys of freedom, \nthe relationships with our allies that have been strained in recent \nyears, and of course the threat of ideological hatred that we know all \ntoo well.\n  Dr. Rice will also have to rally our allies and coordinate their \nsupport to carry out the global war on terrorism. But Dr. Rice has both \nthe experience and the vision to chart America's course in the \ninternational community. The path ahead of us is clear. It is a path \nthat Dr. Rice knows, believes in, and can articulate better than anyone \nelse. I have no doubt she will continue the great tradition of American \ndiplomacy with honor, confidence, and the utmost dedication.\n  Dr. Rice has faced some intense questioning during the nomination. I \nhave been very proud of her. One of the characteristics of Dr. Rice is \nthat she knows she can stand up against anyone. We have seen this. We \nhave seen it over and over again on television. I said in one of the \nshows not too long ago one of her great characteristics is, she cannot \nbe intimidated. Quite frankly, there are a lot of Senators who don't \nlike someone they can't intimidate, but she cannot be intimidated. I \nwas very proud of her during the process that I was able to watch \nmostly on television. I know Dr. Rice will acquit herself well, as she \nhas thus far.\n  Last week President Bush laid out his vision. He said:\n\n\n[[Page S416]]\n\n\n       It is the policy of the United States to seek and support \n     the growth of democratic movements and institutions in every \n     nation and culture, with the ultimate goal of ending tyranny \n     in our world.\n\n  Dr. Rice helped formulate this vision for our foreign policy, and she \nknows how to make it happen.\n  Senator Voinovich was talking about the Balkans. I have had the \nopportunity over the last 8 years to spend a great deal of time in West \nAfrica. I have to say that 4 years ago last month, I was the first \nvisitor Dr. Rice had in the White House. As she was unpacking her \nthings, I told her about things we were dealing with in countries such \nas Benin, Cote d'Ivoire, Ghana, Nigeria, Congo Brazzaville, Congo \nKinshasa, Gabon. Each country I brought up to her, she knew the history \nof that country, the individuals and problems that are there and how we \nmust deal with the problems. I can't think of anyone who is even \nsimilarly equipped for this job unless we go back to Henry Kissinger.\n  There was an editorial in the Washington Post this morning by Henry \nKissinger and George Shultz. People are struggling to try to find \nreasons that she should not be confirmed. Those reasons all seem to \nboil down to one of the argument on weapons of mass destruction. Why is \nit that she thought there were weapons of mass destruction? That was \nanswered so articulately by Senator John Warner a few minutes ago on \nthe floor when he read the quotations of former President Bill Clinton \nas well as Senator John Kerry when they said: there are weapons of mass \ndestruction. We have to go in and take out Saddam Hussein. And so \neverybody knows that was the prevailing wisdom and it was accurate. \nThere were weapons of mass destruction. Anyway, that argument has been \ndiffused.\n  They are going to say, we want to know a timetable as to when our \ntroops are going to come out. That is what this article was about this \nmorning. It was an editorial by Kissinger and George Shultz. And they \ntalk about it. I will read part of one paragraph:\n\n       An exit strategy based on performance, not artificial time \n     limits, will judge progress by the ability to produce \n     positive answers to these questions. In the immediate future, \n     a significant portion of the anti-insurrection effort will \n     have to be carried out by the United States. A premature \n     shift from combat operations to training missions might \n     create a gap that permits the insurrection to rally its \n     potential. But as Iraqi forces increase in number and \n     capability, and as the political construction proceeds \n     after the election, a realistic exit strategy will emerge.\n\n  This is two people thought to be as knowledgeable as anyone else, \ncertainly, one of those being Henry Kissinger.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print this editorial at the conclusion of \nmy remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. INHOFE. One of the great experiences I had in my career on the \nHill was when I was in the other body. It was about a year before \nformer President Nixon died. No matter what you think of former \nPresident Nixon, I don't think there is anyone who won't tell you that \nhe was the most knowledgeable person on foreign affairs of anyone of \nhis time. He came before the House of Representatives where I was \nserving at the time and gave a 2\\1/2\\ hour talk. He didn't use any \nnotes. He stood up there, stood erect at his age and his health \ncondition, and he took us for 2\\1/2\\ hours all the way around the \nworld, every remote country there was, and talked about the history of \nthat country, the history of our relationship to that country, what our \nrelationship would be and should be with those countries. I don't think \nthere is anyone who can do that today other than the nominee we are \ntalking about today in Dr. Condoleezza Rice. I have seen her do the \nsame thing. We are blessed to have her as our nominee for Secretary of \nState. I am certainly looking forward to serving with her.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Jan. 25, 2005]\n\n                Results, Not Timetables, Matter In Iraq\n\n              (By Henry A. Kissinger and George P. Shultz)\n\n       The debate on Iraq is taking a new turn. The Iraqi \n     elections scheduled for Jan. 30, only recently viewed as a \n     culmination, are described as inaugurating a civil war. The \n     timing and the voting arrangements have become controversial. \n     All this is a way of foreshadowing a demand for an exit \n     strategy, by which many critics mean some sort of explicit \n     time limit on the U.S. effort.\n       We reject this counsel. The implications of the term ``exit \n     strategy'' must be clearly understood; there can be no \n     fudging of consequences. The essential prerequisite for an \n     acceptable exit strategy is a sustainable outcome, not an \n     arbitrary time limit. For the outcome in Iraq will shape the \n     next decade of American foreign policy. A debacle would usher \n     in a series of convulsions in the region as radicals and \n     fundamentalists moved for dominance, with the wind seemingly \n     at their backs. Wherever there are significant Muslim \n     populations, radical elements would be emboldened. As the \n     rest of the world related to this reality, its sense of \n     direction would be impaired by the demonstration of American \n     confusion in Iraq. A precipitate American withdrawal would be \n     almost certain to cause a civil war that would dwarf \n     Yugoslavia's, and it would be compounded as neighbors \n     escalated their current involvement into fullscale \n     intervention.\n       We owe it to ourselves to become clear about what post-\n     election outcome is compatible with our values and global \n     security. And we owe it to the Iraqis to strive for an \n     outcome that can further their capacity to shape their \n     future.\n       The mechanical part of success is relatively easy to \n     define: establishment of a government considered sufficiently \n     legitimate by the Iraqi people to permit recruitment of an \n     army able and willing to defend its institutions. That goal \n     cannot be expedited by an arbitrary deadline that would be, \n     above all, likely to confuse both ally and adversary. The \n     political and military efforts cannot be separated. Training \n     an army in a political vacuum has proved insufficient. If we \n     cannot carry out both the political and military tasks, we \n     will not be able to accomplish either.\n       But what is such a government? Optimists and idealists \n     posit that a full panoply of Western democratic institutions \n     can be created in a time frame the American political process \n     will sustain. Reality is likely to disappoint these \n     expectations. Iraq is a society riven by centuries of \n     religious and ethnic conflicts; it has little or no \n     experience with representative institutions. The challenge is \n     to define political objectives that, even when falling short \n     of the maximum goal, nevertheless represent significant \n     progress and enlist support across the various ethnic groups. \n     The elections of Jan. 30 should therefore be interpreted as \n     the indispensable first phase of a political evolution from \n     military occupation to political legitimacy.\n       Optimists also argue that, since the Shiites make up about \n     60 percent of the population and the Kurds 15 to 20 percent, \n     and since neither wants Sunni domination, a democratic \n     majority exists almost automatically. In that view, the Iraqi \n     Shiite leaders have come to appreciate the benefits of \n     democratization and the secular state by witnessing the \n     consequences of their absence under the Shiite theocracy in \n     neighboring Iran.\n       A pluralistic, Shiite-led society would indeed be a happy \n     outcome. But we must take care not to base policy on the wish \n     becoming father to the thought. If a democratic process is \n     to unify Iraq peacefully, a great deal depends on how the \n     Shiite majority defines majority rule.\n       So far the subtle Shiite leaders, hardened by having \n     survived decades of Saddam Hussein's tyranny, have been \n     ambiguous about their goals. They have insisted on early \n     elections--indeed, the date of Jan. 30 was established on the \n     basis of a near-ultimatum by the most eminent Shiite leader, \n     Grand Ayatollah Ali Sistani. The Shiites have also urged \n     voting procedures based on national candidate lists, which \n     work against federal and regional political institutions. \n     Recent Shiite pronouncements have affirmed the goal of a \n     secular state but have left open the interpretation of \n     majority rule. An absolutist application of majority rule \n     would make it difficult to achieve political legitimacy. The \n     Kurdish minority and the Sunni portion of the country would \n     be in permanent opposition.\n       Western democracy developed in homogeneous societies; \n     minorities found majority rule acceptable because they had a \n     prospect of becoming majorities, and majorities were \n     restrained in the exercise of their power by their temporary \n     status and by judicially enforced minority guarantees. Such \n     an equation does not operate where minority status is \n     permanently established by religious affiliation and \n     compounded by ethnic differences and decades of brutal \n     dictatorship. Majority rule in such circumstances is \n     perceived as an alternative version of the oppression of the \n     weak by the powerful. In multiethnic societies, minority \n     rights must be protected by structural and constitutional \n     safeguards. Federalism mitigates the scope for potential \n     arbitrariness of the numerical majority and defines autonomy \n     on a specific range of issues.\n       The reaction to intransigent Sunni brutality and the \n     relative Shiite quiet must not tempt us into identifying \n     Iraqi legitimacy with unchecked Shiite rule. The American \n     experience with Shiite theocracy in Iran since 1979 does not \n     inspire confidence in our ability to forecast Shiite \n     evolution or the prospects of a Shiite-dominated bloc \n     extending to the Mediterranean. A thoughtful American policy \n     will not mortgage itself to\n\n[[Page S417]]\n\n     one side in a religious conflict fervently conducted for \n     1,000 years.\n       The Constituent Assembly emerging from the elections will \n     be sovereign to some extent. But the United States' \n     continuing leverage should be focused on four key objectives: \n     (1) to prevent any group from using the political process to \n     establish the kind of dominance previously enjoyed by the \n     Sunnis; (2) to prevent any areas from slipping into Taliban \n     conditions as havens and recruitment centers for terrorists; \n     (3) to keep Shiite government from turning into a theocracy, \n     Iranian or indigenous; (4) to leave scope for regional \n     autonomy within the Iraqi democratic process.\n       The United States has every interest in conducting a \n     dialogue with all parties to encourage the emergence of a \n     secular leadership of nationalists and regional \n     representatives. The outcome of constitution-building should \n     be a federation, with an emphasis on regional autonomy. Any \n     group pushing its claims beyond these limits should be \n     brought to understand the consequences of a breakup of the \n     Iraqi state into its constituent elements, including an \n     Iranian-dominated south, an Islamist-Hussein Sunni center and \n     invasion of the Kurdish region by its neighbors.\n       A calibrated American policy would seek to split that part \n     of the Sunni community eager to conduct a normal life from \n     the part that is fighting to reestablish Sunni control. The \n     United States needs to continue building an Iraqi army, \n     which, under conditions of Sunni insurrection, will be \n     increasingly composed of Shiite recruits--producing an \n     unwinnable situation for the Sunni rejectionists. But it \n     should not cross the line into replacing Sunni dictatorship \n     with Shiite theocracy. It is a fine line, but the success of \n     Iraq policy may depend on the ability to walk it.\n       The legitimacy of the political institutions emerging in \n     Iraq depends significantly on international acceptance of the \n     new government. An international contact group should be \n     formed to advise on the political and economic \n     reconstruction of Iraq. Such a step would be a gesture of \n     confident leadership, especially as America's security and \n     financial contributions will remain pivotal. Our European \n     allies must not shame themselves and the traditional \n     alliance by continuing to stand aloof from even a \n     political process that, whatever their view of recent \n     history, will affect their future even more than ours. Nor \n     should we treat countries such as India and Russia, with \n     their large Muslim populations, as spectators to outcomes \n     on which their domestic stability may well depend.\n       Desirable political objectives will remain theoretical \n     until adequate security is established in Iraq. In an \n     atmosphere of political assassination, wholesale murder and \n     brigandage, when the road from Baghdad to its international \n     airport is the scene of daily terrorist or criminal \n     incidents, no government will long be able to sustain public \n     confidence. Training, equipping and motivating effective \n     Iraqi armed forces is a precondition to all the other \n     efforts. Yet no matter how well trained and equipped, that \n     army will not fight except for a government in which it has \n     confidence. This vicious circle needs to be broken.\n       It is axiomatic that guerrillas win if they do not lose. \n     And in Iraq the guerrillas are not losing, at least not in \n     the Sunni region, at least not visibly. A successful strategy \n     needs to answer these questions: Are we waging ``one war'' in \n     which military and political efforts are mutually \n     reinforcing? Are the institutions guiding and monitoring \n     these tasks sufficiently coordinated? Is our strategic goal \n     to achieve complete security in at least some key towns and \n     major communication routes (defined as reducing violence to \n     historical criminal levels)? This would be in accordance with \n     the maxim that complete security in 70 percent of the country \n     is better than 70 percent security in 100 percent of the \n     country--because fully secure areas can be models and magnets \n     for those who are suffering in insecure places. Do we have a \n     policy for eliminating the sanctuaries in Syria and Iran from \n     which the enemy can be instructed, supplied, and given refuge \n     and time to regroup? Are we designing a policy that can \n     produce results for the people and prevent civil strife for \n     control of the State and its oil revenue? Are we maintaining \n     American public support so that staged surges of extreme \n     violence do not break domestic public confidence at a time \n     when the enemy may, in fact, be on the verge of failure? And \n     are we gaining international understanding and willingness to \n     play a constructive role in what is a global threat to peace \n     and security?\n       An exit strategy based on performance, not artificial time \n     limits, will judge progress by the ability to produce \n     positive answers to these questions. In the immediate future, \n     a significant portion of the antiinsurrection effort will \n     have to be carried out by the United States. A premature \n     shift from combat operations to training missions might \n     create a gap that permits the insurrection to rally its \n     potential. But as Iraqi forces increase in number and \n     capability, and as the political construction proceeds after \n     the election, a realistic exit strategy will emerge.\n       There is no magic formula for a quick, non-catastrophic \n     exit. But there is an obligation to do our utmost to bring \n     about an outcome that will mark a major step forward in the \n     war against terrorism, in the transformation of the Middle \n     East and toward a more peaceful and democratic world order.\n\n  Mr. KYL. I rise today in strong support of the nomination of Dr. \nCondoleezza Rice to be the Secretary of State.\n  Dr. Rice has a distinguished, 25-year foreign policy career and has \nserved three Presidents. Over the past 4 years, she has worked closely \nwith the President, as his National Security Advisor, to develop and \nimplement a broad range of foreign policy initiatives--among them, the \nBroader Middle East Initiative, the liberation of Afghanistan from the \nbrutal Taliban regime, the liberation of the Iraqi people from decades \nof tyranny under Saddam Hussein, the signing of the Moscow Treaty with \nRussia, the six-party talks with North Korea, and the Millennium \nChallenge Account, just to name a few.\n  I must say that I was highly disappointed that this body did not vote \non Dr. Rice's nomination last week because of the objections of a few \nMembers. Policy disagreements are one thing; personal attacks are quite \nanother. Our country is at war. We need a Secretary of State who will \nbe able to speak on behalf of the President and who will be able to \ntend to America's fragile alliances. There is no better person for that \njob.\n  Unfortunately, Dr. Rice was unable to attend the swearing-in of \nUkraine's new democratically elected President, Victor Yushchenko. This \nevent, which took place over the weekend, is one of the shining \nexamples of the unmistakable power of freedom and the importance of \nU.S. leadership in promoting it. Dr. Rice, like the President, \nunderstands this vital U.S. role. As she stated in her testimony to the \nSenate Foreign Relations Committee on January 18:\n\n       We must use American diplomacy to help create a balance of \n     power in the world that favors freedom. . . . One of \n     history's clearest lessons is that America is safer, and the \n     world is more secure, whenever and wherever freedom prevails.\n\n  Dr. Rice continued in her statement to discuss the ``three great \ntasks'' of American diplomacy, one of which is to spread freedom and \ndemocracy throughout the world. She noted that, ``No less than were the \nlast decades of the 20th century, the first decades of this new century \ncan be an era of liberty. And we in America must do everything we can \nto make it so.''\n  The administration's actions in its first term--including the removal \nof Saddam's regime in Iraq--adhered closely to the principles \narticulated by Dr. Rice in her testimony, stated by the President in \nhis inaugural address, and those on which our great Nation was founded. \nLife, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness are the inalienable rights \nof every person, not a select few. And when we are able to transform \nwhat Natan Sharansky calls ``fear societies'' into free ones, we will \nnot only do a service to those who are the direct beneficiaries of our \nactions, we will also cultivate an environment in which a lasting peace \nis attainable.\n  President Bush wants Dr. Rice to serve in his Cabinet as the \nSecretary of State. Dr. Rice has served this country ably and honorably \nfor many years. This body should act quickly to confirm her to this new \nposition.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I support the nomination of Condoleezza \nRice to be our next Secretary of State. She will replace a great \npatriot and a man I call my friend, Secretary of State Colin Powell, \nwho has served over the past 4 years with decency, strength and \nselflessness. While I am sad to see him go, I look forward to working \nwith Condoleezza Rice in her new capacity and know she will serve \ntirelessly and thoughtfully in the challenges ahead.\n  As President Bush's national security adviser, Condoleezza Rice was \ninstrumental in developing the nation's response to September 11th. Ms. \nRice understands as good as, or better than anyone, the global \npolitical forces at work. Her great intellect and sound judgment will \nlend themselves well to the office--one which is America's face to the \nworld.\n  She has served our country well in the past, and I have full \nconfidence in Condoleezza Rice's abilities as Secretary of State. I \nurge my colleagues to quickly move to a vote on her nomination and \napprove Ms. Rice as our next Secretary of State.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I stand today to give my strong support for \nPresident Bush's choice to be our next Secretary of State, Dr. \nCondoleeza\n\n[[Page S418]]\n\nRice. I believe that Dr. Rice will be a superb diplomat to lead the \nState Department, while remaining one of the President's principal \nconfidantes and advisers on the challenges to our national security \nthat we will face in the difficult years before us. Indeed, not since \nPresident Nixon nominated his National Security Advisor, Dr. Henry \nKissinger, to the same post, has an administration seen the same \ncontinuity in assigning a key foreign policy advisor to the more public \nrole of principal diplomat.\n  I was pleased that Chairman Lugar and Ranking Minority Member Biden \nexpeditiously moved Dr. Rice's nomination out of their committee last \nweek. I am disappointed that we could not hold this vote last week. At \na time when this Nation is at war, procedural delays on a position as \nimportant as the Secretary of State would appear to inhibit the conduct \nof our foreign policy and would have been of great concern to me and my \nconstituents in Utah, where the sense of fair play is strong, but the \nduty to a Nation at war is even stronger.\n  Yes, I certainly recognize the prerogatives of the Senate for \nthorough and critical debate. I will listen carefully to the debate \ntoday and tomorrow and see if I hear anything that is worthy of \ndelaying this important nomination so critical to the national security \nefforts of the administration. I will listen for arguments I have not \nheard before, on the Senate floor or the campaign trail, and I will be \nopen to all the insights that come from arguments never made before, \nand relevant to this nomination. But I know that I represent the vast \nmajority of all Utahns when I say that confirming a President's \nSecretary of State while we are at war, while the President is \npreparing an aggressive diplomacy that will begin with a trip to Europe \nto meet with key allies next month, is a matter the Senate should take \nexpeditiously.\n  We are at war, in Iraq and around the world. Utah's sons and \ndaughters are paying the price, nobly and selflessly sacrificing for \ntheir duty, and in too many cases, with their lives.\n  For those who wish to debate Iraq policy--and I am the first to \nrecognize that spirited and substantive debate is essential for these \ngrave matters--we have all the opportunities to do so before us, and we \nshould avail ourselves of these opportunities. Many today may use the \nconfirmation process of Dr. Rice to criticize or review Iraq policy. We \nshould confirm Dr. Rice and then continue to debate this subject, as we \nhave done so over the past years.\n  Because I wish a speedy confirmation for Dr. Rice, I will keep my \ncomments about Iraq to a minimum. My statements of support for the \nPresident's policies and my arguments for that support are a matter of \nrecord. I will add to that record in the coming weeks, months and \nyears.\n  For now, I will leave it to this observation. This Sunday the Iraqi \npeople, amidst great insecurity but with even greater resolve, will go \nto vote to choose their National Assembly, one that will write a \nconstitution and set the next elections. Depending on which polls you \nsee, between 67 percent and 84 percent of the Iraqi people want this \nopportunity to vote this coming Sunday, despite the perils many face \nevery day. To see the ideology they are so resoundingly rejecting, I \ndirect my colleagues to the long statement by Abu al-Zarqawi released 4 \ndays ago. It is a statement of extremist, Islamic fascism: In the most \nexplicit manner possible, for 9 pages, it lists all the reasons why the \nIslamic fascists reject democracy, declaring ``fierce war on this \nmalicious ideology'' democracy. That is what we are against. And that \nis what the majority of the Iraqi people utterly reject. And I believe \nthat America's interest--once again--is to stand against the fascists \nwho have declared war on democracy.\n  We are well aware of Dr. Rice's resume and experience. Her academic \ncredentials are remarkable, and her professional experience extensive. \nShe was a senior professional at the National Security Council under \nthe first President Bush, where she worked on Soviet affairs and was \ndirectly involved in our policy of supporting a peaceful reunification \nof Germany at the end of the Cold War. I believe that the successful \nreunification of Germany was the most successful aspect of the first \nPresident Bush's foreign policy, often overlooked because of all of the \ntumult during those crucial years when Soviet communism collapsed. Dr. \nRice's involvement in that policy at that crucial time in Europe's \nhistory demonstrates her experience at shepherding a critical \ntransition between an authoritarian model and a democratic one. While \none should not analogize between German reunification and Iraq's \ntransition today, one can look at Dr. Rice's experience and understand \nwhy the current President Bush chose her first to be his National \nSecurity Adviser during her first term and now has the confidence to \nmake her America's top diplomat.\n  In the last 4 years Dr. Rice has been at the center of this \nadministration's foreign policy. That that policy was a target of \nlegitimate criticism during the past presidential campaign, as well as \nduring the last 2 days of hearings before the Senate Foreign Relations \nCommittee, is to be expected. The candidates presented their \ndistinctively different worldviews throughout last year's campaign, \nduring a difficult war that rages still, and the public made its \nchoice.\n  In the United States Senate, it is our responsibility to debate, \nhonestly, candidly and critically, all aspects of our Nation's foreign \npolicy. My only admonition to my colleagues is that this debate be \nconstructive, that it illuminate rather calumniate, and that, when in \ndisagreement, it provide alternatives. Yes, it is legitimate to review \nthe rationales for war, the flaws in intelligence and the faults in \nrhetoric. I believe Republicans have been quite candid and forthright \nabout doing so. The chairmen and chairwoman of the Senate Armed \nServices, Foreign Relations, Intelligence and Government Affairs and \nHomeland Security Committees have all had hearings, conducted \ninvestigations and released reports critical in various degrees of the \nconduct and implementation of various administration policies. That is \nas it should be, and, for most of us, and certainly for me, it does not \ndetract from our support for the administration's foreign policy at a \ncritical time in this Nation's history.\n\n  Partisan critics of this administration have perpetuated about its \nforeign policy a myth that has morphed into a meme: And that is that \nthis administration has failed at diplomacy. This specious belief that \ndiplomacy can neutralize the dangers and the threats to the \ninternational community is puzzling to me. It is a variant of a theme \nin American foreign policy, deriving from the Wilsonian belief that a \nLeague of Nations to which we submit our sovereign responsibilities can \nprevent conflict. I, and Dr. Rice, do not subscribe to this view, so \noverwhelmingly proved wanting into the historical laboratory that was \nthe 20th century.\n  And yet this meme parroted so often by many in the Democratic party--\nthat this administration has not conducted a robust diplomacy--is \nfalse, simply false. No President more regularly addressed the General \nAssembly in the history of the United Nations than did the current \nPresident Bush. He spoke honestly and, to me, compellingly about that \nbody's many trounced-upon resolutions. He cajoled and he listened and \nhe waited, but at no time did this President suggest that the United \nNations or any ally would be in a position to veto the actions we \ndeemed necessary to protect our national security. No President would \never do so.\n  And while we failed to get Security Council support for our invasion \nof Iraq as President Clinton failed before he belatedly led the attack \non Serbia over Kosovo--this President leads a global war on terrorism \nwhere most of the nations of the world are cooperating with us, in one \nform or another, through intelligence sharing, law enforcement \ncooperation, or any of a number of multilateral initiatives. Disagree \nwith the President's foreign policy if you wish, criticize, if you \nmust, but do not suggest that such a global effort can occur without \nsustained and successful diplomacy.\n  Credit for the diplomacy for the first term of this administration \nmust go to those who formulated the policy, the President and Dr. Rice \nand the rest of the national security team, and to the man who led the \nState Department, Secretary Colin Powell. To this day, the standard for \ndignity and graciousness has been set by Secretary Powell,\n\n[[Page S419]]\n\nwho once again took the call from his country and served it with honor, \ndiligence and character. Secretary Powell assembled a strong team at \nthe Department, and he represented this Nation in a way that made every \none of us proud. Dr. Rice knows that, as she assumes this important \nposition, she follows a decent and serious diplomat and a dedicated \nservant. I have no doubt that she will meet the standard.\n  Dr. Rice will assume the responsibility of Secretary of State while \nwe are at war, with global terrorism and with an insurgency in Iraq \nthat every day puts in stark contrast the darkness of the past \ndictatorship against the light of a hopeful democracy. These next 2 \nyears, I expect, will be some of the most difficult years in this \nNation's foreign policy. We will continue to need the experience and \nwisdom of Dr. Rice as she serves this administration in a new role.\n  That role, as the Secretary of State, will have outstanding \nchallenges. Dr. Rice will need to advance further cooperation of a \nmultinational coalition in the war on terrorism; she will have to renew \na push for more international support for a more effective political \nand economic reconstruction of Iraq; she will need to strengthen U.S. \nsupport for counterproliferation initiatives in Europe and Asia; and \nshe will need to maintain U.S. leadership in the fight against poverty \nand disease. She can count on me for support as she assumes these huge \nand historic responsibilities.\n  In her testimony, Dr. Rice has conceded that our public diplomacy \nneeds serious reconsideration. Many cite ongoing and growing \ndissatisfaction among international audiences regarding the United \nStates. I would caution Dr. Rice against overemphasizing this reality \nas she redesigns our public diplomacy. The U.S. is a source of \nresentment and disparagement among many audiences throughout the world, \nbut many of those audiences are contaminated by the propaganda of their \nown autocratic regimes. Today, more people still want to immigrate to \nthis country than any other nation in the world, and more people take \ninspiration in the institutions that protect and promote our freedoms, \nbe it our Constitution or our free press or our culture of openness. I \nhave long been a strong supporter of public diplomacy. Today's \nchallenges are not only to rebut the ever-growing sophistication of the \nbiases and distortions that compete in global media, but to continue to \nfind new ways to promote the American message and the American story. \nThe days of United States Information Service libraries are over, but \ncultural exchange programs, in particular visitor programs to this \ncountry, must continue and, in my opinion, should grow. I will help Dr. \nRice in any way that I can to reinvigorate our public diplomacy.\n  In the last few years, I believe the State Department has failed to \ngrasp the value of culture of lawfulness programs. These programs use \neducation ministries to advance core primary and secondary curricula on \nanticorruption lessons. It is impossible to advance the rule of law, \nwhich is a fundamental goal of bringing stability in regions we cannot \nafford to lose to anarchy or criminality, without the local population \nlearning the value of clean government. We have seen success with such \nprograms in Italy, Mexico, Colombia and other countries, and yet I have \nseen no enthusiasm from the State Department in making these programs \nan essential aspect of all our foreign assistance planning. Perhaps \nthat is because these programs are so inexpensive, and there is still \nthe bias against programs that don't require billions of taxpayer \nfunds; perhaps the Department does not yet understand the potential for \nthese programs, despite the clear affirmation of the Undersecretary of \nState for Global Affairs, who has spoken eloquently in favor of such \nprograms. I am heartened by Dr. Rice's testimony before the Senate \nForeign Relations Committee last week, she asserted that ``we are \njoining with developing nations to fight corruption, instill the rule \nof law, and create a culture of transparency.'' She has my support, and \nI am going to ask Dr. Rice to study the experience and potential of \nthese culture of lawfulness programs and work with me and other Members \nof Congress to integrate them into our foreign assistance plans.\n  I will work with Dr. Rice in every way that I can to make her mission \na success. Because the mission of the Department of State is to work to \nmanage conflicts so that they do not erupt into violence and war. In a \nworld where we can not control so many factors beyond our shores, we \nneed the very best diplomacy to be constantly working our alliances, \npresenting our policies and engaging those who would challenge our \nsecurity. Dr. Condoleeza Rice has 25 years of experience in advancing \nthe national security of this nation. She has 4 years as the principal \nadvisor to President Bush, as he has charted a foreign policy that has \nresponded to global terror and taken on the most destabilizing regime \nin the Middle East. She has the knowledge and character and experience \nof one who can lead this country in our diplomacy around the world. Dr. \nRice has my strong support.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I appreciate the remarks of the Senator \nfrom Oklahoma. I, too, want to speak on the confirmation of Condoleezza \nRice to serve as Secretary of State. We are all aware, because it has \nbeen the subject of quite a bit of discussion and we have seen her in \naction for the last 4 years at the White House and even before that, of \nDr. Rice's accomplishments. She is a woman of fantastic achievement, a \nprofoundly talented individual who has excelled at virtually everything \nto which she has set her mind. I dare say there are few people in this \nNation's history who would make both an excellent Secretary of State \nand an excellent commissioner of the National Football League. I am \nsure Dr. Rice, in keeping with her stated aspirations, will fill both \nroles with dedication, intellect, and passion in due time.\n  Yet the reaction to this nomination, which you would think would be a \ncause for great celebration, given the historic nature of this \nparticular appointment, is also sadly predictable. For example, it is a \nshame to think that with the overwhelming voice of the people so \nrecently expressed in the recent national elections and with the 109th \nCongress just having begun, with the President having been sworn in \nlast week, with early pledges of bipartisanship and working together in \nthe best interest of the American people, we are yet again already \nseeing the specter of partisan politics being brought to bear on this \nnomination.\n  Of course, the Senate does have a very important role in the \nconfirmation process known as advice and consent. No one is questioning \nthe right of any Senator, indeed the duty of every Senator, to ask hard \nquestions and to determine to the best of their ability the \nqualifications of a nominee to serve in the office to which the \nPresident has chosen to appoint them. But there is a difference between \nexercising the role of advice and consent and the line that seems to \nhave been crossed with impunity when it comes to the attacks we have \nseen on some of the President's nominees. Condoleezza Rice just happens \nto be the one we are focusing on today. We have seen much of the same \nvitriol and poison used to assassinate the character of people like \nAlberto Gonzales, another American success story, a personification of \nthe American dream.\n  I would hope that no one in this body would feel it necessary to \nbring all the left-over angst of the campaign season to bear against a \nbright and honorable nominee such as the one who is presently before \nus. You may disagree with Dr. Rice's view of the world. You may take \nissue with some of her policy preferences. But to impugn her motives or \nthe integrity of a woman held in such high esteem is a tactic that I \nbelieve is simply unacceptable and beneath the dignity of this body. \nYet we see this tactic clearly, again, in the attempt to--first in the \ncommittee hearings, the Foreign Relations Committee, and even on the \nfloor of the Senate--try to tie her actions to the tragic events at Abu \nGhraib prison, the crimes that occurred by a handful of individuals \nthat simply crossed the line between human decency and criminality. \nThey were acts that violated U.S. policy and basic human rights. They \nwere disgusting actions undertaken by sick individuals who are being \ninvestigated and being brought to justice--the most recent of which, of \ncourse, was the conviction and sentencing of Mr. Graner to 10 years in \nprison.\n\n[[Page S420]]\n\n  Now, my colleagues know well that at no point has Dr. Rice ever \nsupported, condoned, or advocated such acts of torture or humiliation. \nI believe to try to link her, through some vague references, to these \ncrimes is nothing more than a blatant attempt to score political \npoints, to somehow demean her in her service, and to taint her \nnomination. It should not be necessary to raise these points, but I \nrealize that in politics, particularly in Washington, a charge \nunanswered is too often a charge believed.\n  Let me just refer to a brief reference in the Schlesinger report--of \ncourse, referring to the former Secretary of Defense, who served on an \nindependent commission with former Defense Secretary Harold Brown, who \nserved in the Carter administration, as well as a former distinguished \nMember of the House of Representatives. They concluded after their \ninvestigation--and this was just one of, I believe, eight \ninvestigations. There are three more that are not yet completed. But \nthis was the conclusion of the independent Schlesinger commission:\n\n       No approved procedures called for or allowed the kinds of \n     abuse that in fact occurred. There is no evidence of a policy \n     of abuse promulgated by senior officials or military \n     authorities.\n\n  So to suggest, to hint, to imply that this nominee, or any senior \nofficials in the Bush administration has condoned or adopted a policy \nthat resulted in the criminal abuses that occurred at Abu Ghraib is \nsimply without foundation and any fact. Indeed, it is a scurrilous \nallegation, and the American people need to understand that. They also \nneed to understand the motives why such allegations are made.\n  In addition to these inappropriate partisan attacks against a nominee \nwho deserves our respect, there are a handful of my colleagues who have \nused this opportunity to roll out the same tired, old arguments \nconcerning the war on terror, and particularly Operation Iraqi Freedom. \nWe know that we are in the midst of a global war on terrorism. This is \nnot just about Afghanistan and Iraq. This is not just about isolated \nincidents of terrorism. This is about a conflict that has been building \nfor more than a decade and, indeed, will likely last a generation.\n  Since America suffered an attack on our own soil in New York in 1993, \nwe have been hit at our embassies in Kenya and Tanzania; we have been \nhit at the Khobar Towers in Saudi Arabia; our Navy was hit at the USS \nCole in Yemen; of course, we had the attacks of 9/11; and Bali, Madrid, \nand in Beslan. The list goes on and on.\n  In the aftermath of the attacks of September 11, President Bush \ndecided, with the authorization of Congress at every turn, that if \ndiplomacy would not yield a pacified Saddam, that if the U.N. declined \nto enforce its own resolutions requiring inspections and disarmament, \nwe would, when necessary, use preemptive action against those who seek \nto harm America and those who threaten world peace and supply sanctuary \nto terrorists.\n  We also decided that it was in America's self-interest to take the \nbattle to the terrorists where they live, where they plot, where they \nplan, and where they train and build weapons--not to wait until we are \nattacked again and where innocent civilians' lives are lost and \ninnocent blood is shed. The post-\n9/11 reality is that America must choose to fight this terrorist threat \non their ground, or they will fight us on ours.\n\n  This is not some grand conspiracy of this current administration or \nany policy which is really strange to history or unknown to history. It \nwas in 1941, after Pearl Harbor, when President Franklin Delano \nRoosevelt said:\n\n       If you hold your fire until you see the whites of their \n     eyes, you will never know what hit you.\n\n  That was Israel's policy in 1981 when it knocked out Saddam's Osirak \nnuclear reactor. The fact that Israel continues to exist today was in \npart because its leaders had the wisdom and courage to take on a \ngrowing threat by the use of preemptive action--sometimes called \npreventive self-defense--whenever it was necessary.\n  No one wants to imagine what could have happened if Iraq's nuclear \nprogram, which was well documented after Saddam invaded Kuwait in 1991, \nwhen we were surprised to learn after we repulsed that attack that \nSaddam's nuclear program was much further along than our intelligence \nauthorities had previously thought. But no one wants to imagine what \nwould have happened if Iraq had continued to develop its nuclear \ncapability, or if they had been able to reconstitute their nuclear \nprogram after we left Iraq in 1991. It was a horrific possibility for \nAmerica and the rest of the world, and indeed a responsibility of the \nleaders of this country and the free world to eliminate this gathering \nthreat.\n  Ms. Rice has also been criticized for the belief that Saddam had \nstockpiles of weapons of mass destruction. But you know what? And the \ncritics know this. The truth is, virtually every intelligence service \nin the world believed that Saddam had these weapons of mass \ndestruction. Indeed, this was one of the premises for the Iraq \nLiberation Act in 1998. It was for the authorization given to then-\nPresident Clinton to use necessary force to remove this threat. Our \nintelligence, though, as we all now know with the benefit of 20/20 \nhindsight, proved to be incorrect--at least at the time that we entered \nIraq--that Saddam had stockpiles of weapons of mass destruction. Of \ncourse, we have been undertaking the necessary reforms both in this \nbody and in the intelligence community to stop that kind of \nintelligence failure from ever occurring again.\n  The critics should not be allowed to rewrite history. The fact is \nthat no one party or person misled the rest of us--Democrat, \nRepublican, or Independent. The truth is, we were all misled by this \nerroneous intelligence, and rather than point the finger of blame where \nno blame is due, what we ought to be about--and, indeed, what we have \nbeen doing--is correcting the reasons for that failure and making sure \nthat it never happens again.\n  Yet even though we did not find stockpiles of WMD, the bottom line is \nthis: This was not the only reason that Congress voted overwhelmingly \nto authorize the use of force against Saddam Hussein. Indeed, there are \nnumerous other reasons set out in the resolution that passed this \nSenate by overwhelming margins. It is beyond debate that Saddam \ncontinued to have the intent to acquire WMD and there is little doubt \nthat but for our intervention and the fact that he was pulled from a \nspider hole and put in prison awaiting future accountability at the \nhands of the Iraqi people that he would have fully reconstituted his \nprogram just as soon as he was able.\n  One does not have to take my word for it. Mr. Duelfer, who succeeded \nMr. Kay, and was in charge of looking into the possibility that Saddam \nhad WMD, concluded in September 2004:\n\n       Saddam wanted to recreate Iraq's WMD capability--which was \n     essentially destroyed in 1991--after sanctions were removed \n     and Iraq's economy stabilized. . . .\n\n  Indeed, that has been the evidence we learned in the oil-for-food \nscandal in the United Nations, that Iraq would siphon off money to \nstabilize and support his failing economy, but his job, he thought, was \nto wait out the sanctions in such a way that once the sanctions were \nremoved he would reconstitute Iraq's WMD capability. To somehow point \nthe finger of blame at this distinguished nominee, where she, like all \nof us, was given the erroneous reports from the intelligence community, \nis simply unjustified and unfounded and indeed, in the end, it is \nrevisionist history.\n  Lest this point be lost in the debate and the fingerpointing, we are \nin Iraq for our own good and for the good of the world, and I might add \nfor the good of the Iraqi people. September 11 taught us all a very \nimportant lesson, that security in the modern world depends on taking \naggressive and focused action to prevent terrorist acts before they \noccur, not just opening a criminal investigation after innocent blood \nis shed.\n  We have marshaled the force of freedom in this fight, one of the most \npowerful weapons that we have in our arsenal, and indeed on this \nSunday, as has been recounted over and over again, the Iraqi people \nwill make their first major step toward self-government as a free Iraq.\n  There are some who continue to argue that we did not have the right \nplan to deal with postwar Iraq. We have hashed that argument out a \nhundred times. Yes, hindsight is always 20/20, and we did not know then \nwhat we\n\n[[Page S421]]\n\nknow now, but that is no real revelation. That really suggests, again, \nanother failure of our intelligence-gathering capability and \nparticularly our HUMINT, our human intelligence capability, which we \nare fixing.\n  I point out that it serves no one's interests, and certainly not the \nnational interest of this country or the interests of the Iraqi people, \nto continue to try to point the finger of blame at past errors, \nparticularly in connection with our intelligence-gathering capability. \nIndeed, even those who did not support the resolution authorizing the \nuse of force must now concede that it is in our best interest not to \nhave Iraq fail and become perhaps a sanctuary for terrorists. Even \nthose who oppose this war should acknowledge at this point that it is \nin our best interest for Iraq to become a working democracy and to \navoid strife and become a free and peaceful nation.\n  It is counterproductive, unless of course one's purpose is merely \npartisan politics, to dwell on the past at the expense of our present \nduty and our plans for the future. It is time to focus on what is our \nduty in Iraq, along with other nations, the coalition and the Iraqi \npeople, and that is to secure Iraq, to help this new democracy take \nroot, and to further the cause of freedom around the globe.\n  There is no question that Iraq continues to be a very fragile place, \nbut in truth, Iraq is making solid progress on a difficult road when \none takes into consideration the fact that Saddam had an iron grip on \npower in this nation a mere 2 years ago. Consider what has been \naccomplished. A valid voter registration list of 14.3 million names has \nbeen completed. More than 500 voter registration centers have been \nestablished to help Iraqis verify their registration status. Iraqis \nwill vote on election day in the thousands of voting centers across \nthat country and in 14 other countries, including the United States of \nAmerica. Candidate lists for 111 political entities have been submitted \nfor the national elections and, in total, 256 political entities, \ncomposed of 18,900 candidates, have registered to compete in 20 \ndifferent elections: The national election, 18 provincial elections, \nand the Kurdistan regional government election.\n\n  These 254 entities include 27 individuals, 33 coalitions, and 196 \nparties, all demonstrating widespread enthusiasm for this opportunity \nthey have for free and fair elections.\n  I believe we will see the true ramifications of freedom in Iraq over \nthe next generation, and I believe this first election is a watershed \nat the beginning of this new generation of a free Iraq.\n  As responsible leaders rise to the forefront and the vestiges of \ntyranny are replaced by a fledgling republic, we will see that the \nvictories won, the hardship that has been endured, and the lives risked \nand indeed tragically lost have not been in vain.\n  Before this election season that just concluded, or I thought \nconcluded on November 2 but which seems to have continued now with \nattacks against the President's nominees--those who were unsuccessful \nin persuading the American public of the correctness of their opinions \non November 2--I never thought I would hear anyone utter what I think \nis one of the most foolish notions yet. And yet I have heard the \nsuggestion made again and again in the context of Dr. Rice's hearing. \nAnd it is the suggestion that Iraq today and the world as a whole is \nworse off than it was with Saddam Hussein in power.\n  Have these people somehow missed the fact that we found unspeakable \nhorrors in Saddam's Iraq, torture cells, rape rooms, execution \nchambers, children's prisons. We found a legacy of terror and fear and \nvestiges of unimaginable cruelty. We have found that more than 1 \nmillion people are simply missing; 300,000 are dead, lying in mass \ngraves throughout Iraq in nearly 100 reported sites, including one that \nI personally viewed a year ago last August. These mass graves are \nsilent monuments to Saddam's ruthlessness left behind for all to see.\n  With due respect for my colleagues who advanced the idea that Iraq or \nAmerica was better off with Saddam Hussein in power, to suggest that \nthe world is safer when despots rule in palaces instead of serving \ntime, being held accountable in jails, is to ignore the bulk, if not \nthe entirety, of human history.\n  It was Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan who enjoined against similar \nforeign policy foolishness in an earlier era when he said:\n\n       Unable to distinguish between our friends and our enemies \n     [you adopt] our enemies' view of the world.\n\n  I think we must also be sobered and cautioned by that injunction, and \nwe should all be responsible enough to not let our desire to score \npartisan political points lapse into adopting our enemy's view of the \nworld.\n  As President Bush urged just last week, America has the moral \nresponsibility to take a stand for liberty as the guiding force in the \nworld and the defining principle of this age. We have the strength and \nthe will to see this purpose through.\n  I urge my colleagues to support a Secretary of State who understands \nthe stakes, who sees the right course, and has the will to follow it.\n  In conclusion, I have talked about the attacks that have been \ndirected on this honorable nominee and why I believe that they are \nunfounded and how I believe those who are disappointed, perhaps, in the \nway the election turned out on November 2 have continued their sort of \npolitical insurgency directed at the President but through his nominees \nfor his Cabinet, and particularly Condoleezza Rice and Alberto \nGonzales. I have said that while it is our responsibility as Senators \nto exercise with diligence our advice and consent function and to ask \nhard questions in good faith, there is a line that should not be \ncrossed, which I believe has been crossed in the attacks made against \nthese nominees, including Condoleezza Rice.\n  One reason I believe that is true is because of the evidence that I \nhave in my hand. This is a solicitation, a fundraising solicitation \nsent out by the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee.\n  I ask unanimous consent this be printed in the Record at the \nconclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. CORNYN. This is over the signature of Senator Barbara Boxer, who \nhas been one of the most acerbic critics of this nominee. But at the \nsame time she argues why this nominee should not be confirmed, she ties \nthis to fundraising efforts by the Democratic Senatorial Committee.\n  She said in part:\n\n       The Republicans were expecting the Senate to confirm Dr. \n     Rice with little debate and questioning from the Foreign \n     Relations Committee.\n\n  I think we found that already not to be true. The distinguished \nchairman, who is in the Chamber now, held lengthy hearings and allowed \nall Senators a chance to ask numerous questions of this nominee, and we \nknow now, from the 9 hours that have been agreed to as part of this \ndebate, that, indeed, there is substantial debate about this nominee. \nBut she goes on, from Senator Boxer's pen:\n\n       They didn't count on me to ask the tough questions. What \n     the Republicans don't realize is, no matter who is in charge \n     in the White House, the role of Congress will always be to \n     act as a check on the Executive branch of government. And \n     when it comes to the President's nominees, the Senate must \n     take its ``advise and consent'' role during the confirmation \n     process seriously.\n\n  I agree with that. I have said as much in my comments today. But what \nI do not agree with, and I think where this fundraising solicitation \ncrosses the line and where it finds itself in company with some of the \npartisan attacks that have been made without substance against this \nnominee, is when it goes on to say to contribute to the Democratic \nSenatorial Campaign Committee, making this part of not only a political \nattack but a fundraising effort by the Democrats in the Senate. That, I \nbelieve, crosses a line that should not have been crossed, and one for \nwhich I believe Dr. Rice is entitled to an apology. To tie the \nconfirmation of the Secretary of State to a fundraising campaign and to \npropagate misinformation or disinformation about this distinguished \nnominee, who is an American success story, in an effort to raise money \nfor the Democratic Senatorial Committee is inappropriate and I think \nwould offend and does offend the American people.\n\n  I believe this offense deserves a quick repudiation by our colleagues \non the\n\n[[Page S422]]\n\nother side of the aisle who maybe were not involved in this and, \nindeed, an apology to Dr. Rice for the way she has been treated.\n  In conclusion, let me say that I have seen, in my relatively short \ntime in the Senate, some pretty rough treatment of the President's \nnominees. We have seen filibusters of judicial nominees when there is a \nbipartisan majority of the Senate to confirm those nominees. Indeed, \nthis has been a part of an unconstitutional burden that neither this \nPresident nor those nominees should have to bear.\n  But we have also seen sort of a character attack on nominees that I \nthink is not only unfair to those nominees but completely unbecoming to \nthe dignity of the Senate and the kind of respect with which they \nshould be treated. It is one thing to disagree about policy; it is one \nthing to ask hard questions. No one is asking anyone to vote against \ntheir conscience on a nominee. But to abuse these nominees in a way \nthat is unfair, not only to them and their family but one that \nmischaracterizes the facts and is part of a disinformation campaign \nwhich is clearly tied to politics, is something we ought to call an end \nto.\n  I had held out some hope, and increasingly it appears to be a vain \nhope, that somehow with the reconvening of this 109th Congress we would \nsee a change in attitude, we would see a willingness to work together.\n  We have seen some comments, some speeches, some promises to that end. \nBut when it comes to this sort of inappropriate political activity and \npoliticizing the confirmation process for America's diplomat in chief \nand the President's other judicial nominees, all I can say is it is a \ncrying shame.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee\n\n       Dear DSCC Friend, The Republicans were expecting the Senate \n     to confirm Dr. Rice with little debate and questioning from \n     the Foreign Relations Committee.\n       They didn't count on me to ask the tough questions. What \n     the Republicans don't realize is, no matter who is in charge \n     in the White House, the role of Congress will always be to \n     act as a check on the Executive branch of government. And \n     when it comes to presidential nominees, the Senate must take \n     its ``advise and consent'' role during the confirmation \n     process seriously.\n       That's why I took a stand last week and voiced my concerns \n     about Dr. Rice's misleading statements leading up to the war \n     in Iraq and beyond. I will continue to make my voice heard on \n     the Senate Foreign Relations committee, but in order to put \n     the brakes on four more years of misdirection in Iraq and \n     reckless policies at home, we need to elect more Democrats to \n     the Senate during the 2006 midterm elections.\n       Because after Dr. Rice is confirmed, the Senate will face \n     many more crucial decisions in the coming months: \n     confirmation of President Bush's choice for Attorney General \n     Alberto Gonzales, social security, Iraq and possibly a \n     Supreme Court nomination. My Democratic colleagues and I will \n     hold the Bush Administration accountable for its decisions. \n     But we will need your help to hold them accountable in the \n     ultimate public hearing: the next midterm elections in 2006.\n       The Republicans want us Democrats to step back and pave the \n     way not only for this one nominee, but for their entire \n     social, economic and international agenda. We have a chance \n     during the midterm elections to make sure the Republicans \n     don't have four years to do so. The DSCC is working every day \n     to recruit the strongest candidates in every Senate race \n     across the country. They are fighting early and fighting \n     hard, but they need your ongoing support today.\n       So while I raise my voice on the Senate floor, I hope you \n     will join us on the campaign trail and send the loudest \n     message of all--one that the Republicans will not be able to \n     ignore--unseating them in the midterm elections and sending \n     more Democrats to the Senate.\n           Yours sincerely,\n                                            Senator Barbara Boxer.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thune). The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I rise to speak in behalf of \nCondoleezza Rice for Secretary of State. I hope the chairman would \nyield to me such time as I might consume.\n  Mr. LUGAR. How much time does the Senator plan to speak?\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. About 10 minutes.\n  Mr. LUGAR. I yield the Senator the time he may need.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished chairman of \nthe Foreign Relations Committee, Senator Lugar. I have had an \nopportunity to work with him in the years I have been in the Senate on \nthe Foreign Relations Committee. He is an outstanding Member and such a \ngood colleague and so knowledgeable on so many issues. It is quite \nwonderful to have his work and the things he has done, particularly the \nincredibly important Nunn-Lugar, or I call it the Lugar-Nunn Act on \nNuclear Proliferation, getting rid of some material in the Soviet \nUnion. I have seen that bill in action and that has been a powerful \ngood to possibly reduce the spread of nuclear weapons around the world. \nI thank my colleague.\n  I rise to express my strong support for the nomination of Dr. \nCondoleezza Rice for the position of Secretary of State. While it is \nregrettable that we are continuing to debate this nomination after 2 \ndays of hearings, I believe it will only confirm what the President has \ndone in making such a great choice. As the first woman to hold the key \npost as the President's National Security Adviser, she has had a \ndistinguished career already in Government, as well as in academics. I \nstill recall her wise and learned comments made nearly a decade ago \nabout how systems failures were occurring at that time in the Soviet \nUnion that led to the fall of the Soviet Union.\n  It wasn't seen at the time. Yet she was able to look at the disparate \nsituations that were happening, saying how systems failures in the \nSoviet Union presaged a place none of us thought possible to fall. And \nshe was seeing that--observing that as an astute observer years ahead \nof her time. That kind of judgment and foresight will be critical in \nthe months and years ahead for the United States.\n  It is a complex job, Secretary of State. I believe she has the \nnecessary talent and experience and is, without doubt, one of the most \nqualified people in the world for this job.\n  Like Secretary Powell, who has done an outstanding job and whose \nhumanity and professionalism and dedication will be sorely missed, she \nrecognizes the deep personal commitment necessary, and this Nation is \ngrateful for someone of her stature who is willing to serve in this \nposition.\n  The Secretary of State serves as the President's top foreign policy \nadviser and in that capacity is this Nation's most visible diplomat \nhere and around the world. It is a position that demands the full \nconfidence of the President, and in Dr. Rice, we know the President \ntrusts her judgment.\n  That relationship is critical when one considers the state of the \nworld in which Dr. Rice will work. According to a recent National \nIntelligence Council report: Not since the end of World War II has the \ninternational order been in such a state of flux. During the past 3 \nyears, we have seen terrorists kill thousands of people in this country \nand around the world. While terrorism will continue to be a serious \nthreat to the Nation's security as well as many countries around the \nworld, genocide--even after Bosnia and Rwanda and even Auschwitz--\ncontinues to this day in Darfur. This proliferation of weapons of mass \ndestruction among rogue regimes continues apace. Meanwhile, in the \nEast, the rise of China and India promises to reshape familiar patterns \nof geopolitics and economics.\n  Still, there is great reason to be encouraged by the world that Dr. \nRice will face. Freedom is on the march in places some had written off \nas potentially unsuitable for democracy. Ukraine's Orange Revolution, \nGeorgia's Rose Revolution, Serbia's Democratic Revolution, and \nsuccessful elections in Indonesia, Malaysia, Afghanistan, and the \nPalestinian Authority demonstrate the longing for democracy that \nembraces the most diverse cultures. Iraq will continue to pose \nchallenges even after the elections at the end of this month.\n  The new Secretary of State will have to engage the United States and \nour allies in working closely with the Iraqis to seize the \nopportunities that lie before them to forge a nation that is free of \nthe past and that is ultimately and uniquely Iraqi. The only exit \nstrategy for the United States and the coalition forces is to ensure \nthat Iraqis are in control of their own destiny.\n  The new Secretary of State must devote her time and resources to \nachieving a settlement in the Arab-Israeli conflict by clearly \narticulating the robust vision of peace in the Middle East. We must not \nonly come to grips with\n\n[[Page S423]]\n\nnuclear proliferation issues in Iran and North Korea, but we must have \nthe moral courage to bring attention to the human rights abuses in both \nof these countries that sustain these nuclear ambitions.\n  Similarly, we must confront the regime in Khartoum where crimes \nagainst humanity must be brought to justice so that urgent humanitarian \nassistance can continue in Darfur and elsewhere in Sudan. There are \nmany actions we can take and must take, especially after we have had \nthe bold initiative to clearly call Darfur for what it is--it is \ngenocide that is happening there. If we are to maintain our credibility \nin this area, we must act decisively.\n  In addition to the humanitarian efforts in the Indian Ocean region \nand elsewhere as a result of the tsunami, I am certain that the new \nSecretary will maintain our commitment to the global fight against AIDS \nand other infectious diseases. But to do so with the kind of prudent \nand result-based efforts that have been so successful in past efforts, \nwe have to maintain a focus and an effort to be able to get things \ndone.\n  Last week, President Bush laid down a marker by which we would define \nwhat it means not to just be an American but a citizen of the world. \nDeclaring in his inaugural address that our liberty is increasingly \ntied to the fate of liberty abroad, he placed the United States on the \nside of democratic reformers and vowed to judge governments by their \ntreatment of their own people.\n  President Bush's vision draws on the wellsprings of our Nation's \nspirit and value. I believe Secretary-designate Rice possesses the \nskills and talents necessary to turn the President's visionary goals \ninto a reality.\n  In her statement before the Foreign Relations Committee, she said, \n``The time for diplomacy is now.'' Her qualifications to carry that \nprescription into practice will be indispensable. She combines a big-\npicture mindset born of academic training with a wealth of hands-on \nexperience at the highest level. Perhaps most importantly, she can \nalways be sure of having the President's confidence and ear.\n  Finally, Dr. Rice's own biography testifies to the promise of \nAmerica. Born and raised in the segregated South, her talent, \ndetermination, and intellect will place her fourth in line to the \nPresidency. She has often said to get ahead she had to be ``twice as \ngood''--and she is that and more.\n  Her childhood shaped her strong determination of self-respect, but it \nwas her parents' commitment to education and her brilliant success at \nit that defined her style.\n  She managed to work her way to college by the age of 15 and graduate \nat 19 from the University of Denver with a degree in political science. \nIt was at Denver that Dr. Rice became interested in international \nrelations and the study of the Soviet Union. Her inspiration came from \na course taught by a Czech refugee. That background will become \nincreasingly important as we deal with the changing dynamics and \nchallenges posed around the world.\n  In short, I am moved to think that she will soon be confirmed as our \n66th Secretary of State, and it will be time for us to move forward. \nShe is already well known to the world. Dr. Rice will now become the \nface of America's diplomacy.\n  We need to support her in every way we can. She can be assured of my \nsupport. As the newly appointed chairman of the Commission on Security \nand Cooperation in Europe, I look forward to working with her and other \nofficials at the State Department to further promote democracy, human \nrights, and the rule of law in Europe and Eurasia. Charged with the \nresponsibility for monitoring and promoting implementation of the \nHelsinki Final Act in all 55 signatory countries, the Commission has \nbeen and will continue to be a force for human freedom, seeking to \nencourage change, consistent with the commitment these countries have \nvoluntarily accepted. As President Ford remarked when signing the \nHelsinki Final Act on behalf of the United States:\n\n       History will judge this Conference . . . not only by the \n     promises we make, but the promises we keep.\n\n  As we approach the 30th anniversary of the historic occasion this \nyear, a number of Helsinki signatories seem determined to undermine the \nshared values enshrined in the Final Act and diminish the commitment \nthey accepted when they joined the Organization for Security and \nCooperation in Europe. It is imperative that the United States hold \nfirm to the values that have inspired democratic change in much of the \nOSCE region. Dr. Rice in her confirmation testimony referred to the \npotential role that multilateral institutions can play in multiplying \nthe strength of freedom-loving nations. Indeed, the OSCE has tremendous \npotential to play even a greater role in promoting democracy, human \nrights, and rule of law in a region of strategic importance to the \nUnited States.\n  I look forward to building upon the partnership forged between the \nHelsinki Commission and the State Department as we stand with oppressed \nand downtrodden people wherever they are in the world.\n  I urge my colleagues to support Dr. Rice for the position of \nSecretary of State. I wish her good luck and Godspeed.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I rise and express my strong support for \nCondoleezza Rice for confirmation as Secretary of State of the United \nStates of America. She is a native of my home state of Alabama and grew \nup in a very difficult time in our State. I remember vividly and was \ntouched by the 16th Street Baptist Church bombing in Birmingham that \noccurred during her youth. Her family later moved to Colorado, I \nbelieve, where she grew up.\n  She is a pianist and a talented person in so many ways. I think few \nwould dispute her talent, her incredible background and personal \nhistory, and the many accomplishments that she has achieved through the \nyears.\n  In the course of doing so, she has won the confidence of the \nPresident of the United States, George W. Bush. He has relied on her \nforeign policy expertise for quite a number of years. He believes she \nis the right person to serve this country today as Secretary of State. \nShe is a perfect fit in this role and I strongly support her \nconfirmation.\n  Condoleezza Rice served as provost at Stanford University. She worked \nin the National Security Council of former President Bush. She has \nserved our current President Bush as National Security Advisor for 4 \nyears. That is an excellent background for the job; that, along with \nher studies in international relations and history, particularly the \nSoviet Union.\n  I remember early on we had a problem with national missile defense \nand the test ban treaty that would have required us to either not \nimplement a national missile defense system or would have required us \nto manipulate it as some sort of test program in a way that was not \nvery practical.\n  She suggested we ought to avail ourselves of the privileges the \ntreaty gave us to give notice and step out of the agreement with \nRussia. It had been signed with the Soviet Union in an entirely \ndifferent global setting. At this point, we were dealing with Russia, \nwhich was friendly in many ways. Many on the other side of the aisle--\nvery much the same ones criticizing her today--were saying that this \nwas just awful. They claimed that it would destabilize relations \nbetween Russia and the United States.\n  I remember seeing Dr. Rice being questioned about that, meeting with \nSenators and discussing it. She listened carefully to the comments \nothers had and then articulated her own considered thoughts with \ncrystal clarity. She was inclined to believe we ought to get out of \nthat treaty. She and the President eventually made the decision to do \nso. They did so in a way of which Russia was accepting. It caused no \nproblems.\n  I remember vividly the warnings from the liberal Members of this body \nthat withdrawing from that treaty, and thus allowing us to build a \nlegitimate national missile defense, was somehow going to cause \npermanent damage to the relationship between Russia and the United \nStates. She concluded that this was not true. In fact, it was not true. \nShe helped execute that action that allows us now to have missiles in \nplace that are capable of knocking down incoming weapons that could \nwreak havoc, nuclear or otherwise, on\n\n[[Page S424]]\n\nthe people of the United States. It is one of many memories I have that \ndemonstrate her capabilities and skill.\n  Partly, I suspect, as a result of her growing up in an area where, \nsadly, everyone was not treated equally, when people were discriminated \nagainst quite significantly and were treated as second-class citizens, \nshe has a deep and abiding respect for liberty. She has a deep and \nabiding respect for the legal system of this country. She believes we \nought to promote liberty, promote equality and promote progress in the \nworld. It is a responsibility this Nation has and that she must \nchampion as she serves as Secretary of State. I have no doubt that she \nis equal to the task.\n  Absolutely we have to be careful. Absolutely there are limits to what \nwe can do as a nation to help other nations. We simply are not able, \nand it would not be wise, even, to attempt to fix all of the problems \nof every nation around the world.\n  I want a Secretary of State who understands America, who understands \nthe values and ideals of this country, and who has values and ideals \nherself, to serve as Secretary of State. I want a Secretary of State \nwho looks forward to seizing opportunities whenever they may appear--\nand we do not know when they will during the course of her service--\nwhere she can promote liberty, freedom, progress and peace throughout \nthe world.\n  When you find liberty and freedom in countries, they usually don't \nfight. It is my impression we have few, if any, examples of war--\ncertainly not in recent memory--that have occurred between two \ndemocratic states. Democratic states somehow are used to working out \ndifficulties within their own country and somehow they are normally \nable to work out difficulties between an opposing state if they are a \ndemocracy.\n\n  It is only when you come up against dictators, these people who are \nused to always doing it their way, who have an obsession with \nexpansionism and oppression of their own people and their own self-\ninterest, those are the ones who are difficult to deal with.\n  Condoleezza Rice understands that. She is a student of history and \ninternational relations. She can help our President make those tough \nchoices. When do we step up to the plate? When do we not step up to the \nplate? How can we be most effective? When should we negotiate? When \nshould we seek the assistance of other nations to negotiate? When \nshould we involve ourselves directly? When, Heaven forbid, should we \nhave go to war?\n  This is the kind of expertise she brings to the table. Her personal \nhistory and her experience as the National Security Advisor to the \nPresident is just the kind of background we need.\n  The State Department is composed of some of the finest people I have \nhad the privilege of knowing. They work extremely hard. They are \nextraordinarily educated and steeped in the countries they have as \ntheir responsibility. They provide a tremendous resource to our Nation. \nPeople forget as they serve around the world--and I have visited them \nas I have traveled--that they are at risk just for bearing the American \nflag and being a representative of this Nation, because they are in \ndangerous places in our world. They do a great job every day. Sometimes \na great organization such as that, that creates and forms itself over \nmany years, develops an inertia, an inability to change, to see new \nideas and new ways of proceeding.\n  Having someone at the helm such as Condoleezza Rice who has been \ninvolved in the National Security Council, she will be perfectly \nrespectful of those fine people who serve in the State Department. She \nwill also have the ability to lift that agency, to transform it into a \nmore nimble and more responsive agency that can help promote American \nideals aggressively throughout the world.\n  I am very proud of her. I am proud that she is from Alabama. I am \nproud that President Bush has chosen to nominate her. I am confident \nshe will be a terrific Secretary of State and very confident she will \nbe confirmed.\n  I am sorry that some of my colleagues on the other side of the \naisle--I guess in response to complaints from those among the hard left \nwho are never happy when America commits itself around the world and \nstands up for its values--have chosen to hold up this nominee. I \nthought she was moving along rather quickly and that we would have \nalready confirmed her by now. But there are those who want to use this \nopportunity to express their views, many of which are not helpful to \nour soldiers who are out in the field executing the policies we voted \non in this body by an overwhelming vote--more than three-fourths. We \nsent them there. Members of this Senate voted overwhelmingly to do so. \nIt is not appropriate to delay Dr. Rice's nomination in order to reopen \nthe debate on our nation's actions in Iraq, particularly when there is \nno likelihood she will be voted down.\n  Some of the comments made to her have not been of the most respectful \nand appropriate kind. Her integrity--perhaps inadvertently, but in \nreality--was questioned. I certainly believe she should have every \nright to push back and defend herself under those circumstances.\n  I am always happy to allow my colleagues to have their say, but it \nhas taken longer than it should. We need to move this nomination \nforward. We need a Secretary of State in place. She will be an \noutstanding Secretary of State. I look forward to seeing her confirmed, \nhopefully no later than tomorrow.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. LUGAR. May I inquire of the Chair, how much time remains on both \nsides of the aisle in this debate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 53 minutes to the majority, and 1 \nhour 22 minutes to the minority.\n  Mr. LUGAR. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, let me comment that we have been privileged to hear \nfrom 22 colleagues today. Thirteen Republicans and nine Democrats have \nspoken on the confirmation. I would comment, it has been my privilege \nto hear more of the testimony while I chaired the hearings and likewise \nthe debate today. On both occasions, we have made clear to colleagues \non both sides of the aisle that there would be ample opportunity, first \nof all, to question Dr. Rice during the confirmation hearings. And, as \nI pointed out earlier in the day, well over 300 questions were raised, \nsome before the hearings, to which she gave response in written \nanswers, and over half of the 300 actually during the hearings in face-\nto-face dialog with Dr. Rice. Let me point that out because I think the \nrecord for this nominee is as full as any confirmation procedure I have \nwitnessed.\n  Today, we have had 22 contributions that were substantial and \nthoughtful. Tomorrow, we will have another hour of debate prior to a \nvote and will come to a conclusion which I pray will bring about the \nconfirmation of Dr. Rice to be our next Secretary of State, and a move \nforward as she assists our President and all of us in the statecraft of \nour country.\n  In any event, I simply point out for the record that as we conclude \nthe debate this evening--and we will do so shortly because no further \nSenators have sought to speak--there was at least on our side of the \naisle 53 minutes available and on the other side 1 hour 22 minutes. \nTherefore, the time that was requested turned out to be more than \nample.\n  I am hopeful our debate will conclude constructively and \naffirmatively tomorrow. We certainly will attempt to work with that. I \nam advised that the distinguished ranking member of the committee, \nSenator Biden, will be present, and he will make a statement tomorrow, \nand that will be important as we conclude our debate.\n  Mr. President, seeing no other Senators who seek recognition, I \nsuggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, Reno, NV, is a wonderful city and a great \nplace to live.\n  The sparkling Truckee River flows through the heart of town. The \ncampus of the University of Nevada sits on a hillside overlooking the \ncity. The Nevada Museum of Art is nearby.\n  And standing on the streets of downtown Reno, one can see majestic \nmountains in every direction, including the peaks of the Sierra Nevada \naround Lake Tahoe. A beautiful city and a fine place to raise a family.\n  But like any other city, Reno has its rough side. In ``Folsom Prison \nBlues,'' Johnny Cash sang, ``I shot a man in Reno, just to watch him \ndie.'' Reno has its share of rundown bars and alleys, where men and \nwomen chase the remnants of broken dreams. This is a world most people \nrarely notice, but where some spend their lives.\n  One who lived in that world was a man named Murray Barr.\n  Murray drank a lot. He was, in fact, an alcoholic, and he was \nhomeless. He slept in the streets and alleys. When he did sleep \nindoors, it was usually in jail or the hospital.\n  But Murray was also a proud Native American, an ex-Marine, and a \nfriend to many who came in contact with him.\n  Murray Barr was a big bear of a man. He barely had a tooth in his \nhead, but when he smiled, he brought joy to the people who cared about \nhim.\n  And many people did care about Murray.\n  Reno Police Officer Patrick O'Bryan crossed paths with Murray many \ntimes--sometimes when he was arresting him or taking him to the \nhospital.\n  O'Bryan--who is known as ``Paddy O'' on the streets of Reno--tried \neverything he could think of to help Murray quit drinking.\n  He told Murray to ``get a life'', ``get a grip'', he threatened him, \nhe pleaded, and he warned Murray that he was killing himself.\n  Sometimes Murray would stop drinking. Once he was on house arrest for \n6 months. He got a job as a cook and showed up on time every day. He \nsaved money. And he stayed sober for 6 months.\n  As long as the system was monitoring him, Murray was okay. He was a \nproud man, and he was not going to let down the people who were \nresponsible for him.\n  But when he had finished serving his sentence, Murray let himself \ndown, and picked up the bottle again.\n  Marla Johns works as a social worker at St. Johns Medical Center in \nReno. Her husband Steve is a Reno cop. They both had a soft spot for \nMurray. They gave him gifts at Christmas--and the gift of their \nfriendship year round.\n  Murray called Marla ``my angel.'' He was protective toward her. Once \nwhen an intoxicated patient started to threaten Marla, Murray stepped \nin front of the man.\n  Marla tried to protect Murray, too. But she felt him slipping away. \n``I always knew Murray's life would be cut short by the choices he was \nmaking,'' she said.\n  Early one morning last spring, Steve called Marla at home. There had \nbeen an announcement at the morning police briefing. Murray had died \nthe night before.\n  Marla and Steve cried. She said, ``There will never be another \nMurray.''\n  But there are many others like him. I have known some of them. We \nhave all known them.\n  Despite the pleas of loved ones and friends, despite their own best \nintentions, they are pulled down, time and again, by their addiction to \nalcohol.\n  We try to help them, just as Murray's friends tried to help him. We \ntry to get them into rehab programs, and we encourage them to try AA. \nWe give them warm clothes and buy them a hot meal. We help them find a \njob or a place to stay.\n  Some manage to escape their addiction. I have to believe that escape \nis a form of grace, a gift from above.\n  Others never find that grace, no matter how badly they might want it. \nAnd no matter how much we try to help, we cannot give them that gift.\n  Maybe the greatest gift we can give them is to see them as \nindividuals--``there will never be another Murray.'' Not just another \nhomeless face on the street, not just another cot in the drunk tank, \nbut a man who was proud of his heritage, who served his country, who \nrefused to let down his friends, some mother's son, maybe somebody's \nbrother or husband.\n  Back in December there was a memorial gathering at First Methodist \nChurch in Reno to mourn the homeless citizens who had died during the \nyear and highlight the need for programs to help them.\n  Officers Johns and O'Bryan told a few stories about their friend \nMurray Barr.\n  I never knew Murray, but I think he would have liked that. He would \nhave been proud to have such good friends.\n  I tell this story as a reminder that we should never assume we know a \nperson's story just because of what is on one fleeting page. And we \nshould never forget that every person is unique.\n  ``There will never be another Murray.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/01/25/senate-section/article/S425-2", "month": "01", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S425-S426]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                RULES OF PROCEDURE, COMMITTEE ON FINANCE\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY.

Mr. President, I rise today to observe a solemn \nanniversary. On January 27, 2005, the world will pause and remember as \nwe mark the sixtieth anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz, the \nmost notorious of Nazi Germany's concentration and death camps.\n  In 1940, Germany established the Auschwitz concentration camp 37 \nmiles west of Krakow in Poland. Formerly a Polish Army barracks, \nAuschwitz was first used as a prison for captured Polish soldiers and \nthose who were considered by the Nazis to be dangerous. The\n\n[[Page S427]]\n\nprison held captive the elite of Poland--their civic and spiritual \nleaders, educated classes, cultural and scientific figures, army \nofficers, and members of the resistance movement. Throughout World War \nII, Auschwitz continued to be used to house prisoners-of-war, gypsies, \nand others who opposed the Nazi regime.\n  In 1942, Germany began to use Auschwitz as one of its principle camps \nto carry out the systematic extermination of Jews across the European \ncontinent. As the Nazis pursued their horrific ``final solution,'' over \none million Jews and tens of thousands of others perished at Auschwitz, \nthe majority of whom were executed in the infamous gas chambers.\n  As the Soviet Army approached at the end of 1944, the Nazis attempted \nto destroy evidence of their atrocities. In late January 1945, the \nGermans evacuated Auschwitz with the SS leading over 50,000 prisoners \non a death march that eventually claimed the lives of thousands more. \nWhen the Soviets finally reached the camp, only a few thousand \nprisoners remained alive to see their liberation.\n  It was some time before the world knew the extent of the atrocities \ncommitted at Auschwitz. But as the truth became known, we made the \npromise to never forget what happened there and at other Nazi \nextermination camps. Today, by marking this somber anniversary, we keep \nthat promise.\n  Yet, it is not enough to simply pause and remember.\n  I have walked that ground in Auschwitz. I have felt the weight of the \nair and seen the ruins of the crematoria. It is an unquestionably \nchilling experience that I have trouble expressing in words.\n  But I do know and understand the words of Auschwitz survivor and \nNobel laureate Elie Weisel, who said, ``to remain silent and \nindifferent is the greatest sin of all.'' It is in that spirit that we \nnot only recall the horrors perpetrated at Auschwitz, but we work to \nensure that such unbridled hatred and evil never again goes unchecked.\n  So, too, we must recognize that hatred does still exist in the world \nand we see signs of it every day. It is our duty as a free people to \nwork against its growth and fight evil wherever it is found. As a \nbeacon of liberty for the entire world, I am inspired by the words \nspoken by President Bush in his Inaugural address last week, ``we \ncannot carry the message of freedom and the baggage of bigotry at the \nsame time.''\n  So, as we mark 60th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz, it is \nnot enough to simply remember, we must be ever vigilant in our fight \nagainst bigotry and hatred both at home and abroad.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to reflect on an important and \nmeaningful anniversary that is being commemorated worldwide this week. \nTwo days from now, January 27, 2005, will mark 60 years since the \nliberation of Auschwitz, the concentration and death camp at which over \n1.1 million innocent men, women, and children were murdered at the \nhands of the Nazis.\n  As many of my colleagues know, I have long felt a very deep and \npersonal connection to the tragedy of the Holocaust. My father, who \nwould later serve two terms in this body, was the Executive Trial \nCounsel at the Nuremberg trials of Nazi war criminals.\n  He left this country for Nuremberg when I was only 1\\1/2\\ years old, \nand he spent the next two years poring over documents and conducting \ninterviews that revealed to him the shocking, staggering process by \nwhich over 6 million people were systematically killed. He found \nhimself face to face with many of the men who had planned and carried \nout Hitler's ``Final Solution.'' He found himself asking, wondering how \nso many human beings many of whom had loving families of their own, had \nbeen educated in universities, had enjoyed the fine arts how could they \npossibly conceive and execute a mass murder on an unimaginable scale? \nHow was it that only a tiny sliver of a minority in Europe stood up \nagainst a plan to wipe out that continent's entire Jewish population, \nas well as Gypsies, the disabled, and homosexuals? And how was it that \nthe United States and its allies failed to act in time to save millions \nof innocent lives?\n  When my father came home from Europe, he didn't have answers to those \nquestions. Indeed, we have continued asking these questions for the \npast six decades. What my father did bring back from Nuremberg was an \nunyielding and firm conviction to teach what he learned to as many \npeople as he could, beginning with the members of his own family. From \nan early age, I can remember learning from my father names of people \nlike Goebbels, Mengele, and Eichmann, and places like Auschwitz, \nMajdanek, and Treblinka.\n  As an Irish Catholic boy growing up in Connecticut, my early \neducation in the history of the Holocaust was something of an anomaly. \nFortunately, this is no longer the case today. Yet there are still \ncommunities, here in America, and even more so around the world, where \nfar too little is known about the Holocaust. More shockingly still, \nthere are those individuals and groups which question or deny the very \nexistence of the Holocaust a charge that is often interwoven with the \nvery same poisonous anti-Semitism that led to this human tragedy.\n  On this anniversary, therefore, it is critical not only to remember \nthose who perished, but to redouble our efforts to enhance and increase \nawareness of the Holocaust. This is particularly important today, as \neach day there remain fewer and fewer living witnesses to the Holocaust \nthose who themselves wore the yellow star and still have prisoner \nnumbers tattooed on their arms.\n  In the effort to keep the memory of the Holocaust alive, we have an \ninvaluable resource located just a few minutes from here, the United \nStates Holocaust Memorial Museum. That museum represents a steadfast \ncommitment by our Nation to ensure that the Holocaust will never, ever \nfade away into the mist of history. I imagine that most, if not all, of \nmy colleagues have already visited the museum. I would certainly urge \nany of my colleagues who might not have done so to visit, and to \nencourage their staffs and their constituents who visit our Nation's \nCapital to do the same.\n  Finally, it is crucial that on this anniversary, we take meaningful \nsteps to address acts of genocide in our own time. Today, in the Darfur \nprovince of Sudan, tens of thousands have already died as a result of a \nmurderous ethnic cleansing campaign by the government-supported \nJanjaweed militias. It is estimated that as many as 350,000 could die \nin the coming months if action is not taken. Certainly, the sheer \nmagnitude of the events in Darfur does not approach that of the \nHolocaust. On a fundamental level, however, the world is facing the \nsame choice we did over 60 years go: do we respond to heinous crimes \nagainst humanity, or do we ignore a growing tragedy until it is far, \nfar too late? This is the challenge that confronts us today, as we \ncommemorate the liberation of Auschwitz and the other Nazi death camps \nto ensure that the cry of ``never again'' does not ring tragically \nhollow.\n  In closing, Mr. President, I would like to note that in addition to \nthe anniversary that we are commemorating this week, today's date marks \na special occasion in the Jewish calendar. Today is the holiday of Tu \nB'Shvat, the traditional New Year for trees. It heralds the coming of \nthe spring, and is an occasion for celebrating renewal, transition, and \nhope. It is my hope that as Americans and people around the world \nreflect on the 60th anniversary of liberation, we can seize this solemn \noccasion to look towards the future, and to plant new seeds of hope, \ntolerance, and justice among all of humankind.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, the world pauses this week to observe the \n60th anniversary of an event that calls for the deepest solemnity and \nreflection. In early 1945, as American and British armies closed in on \nthe Third Reich from the west, Soviet forces were on the march through \nPoland. On January 27, they came to a place called Auschwitz.\n  In the Nazi death industry, Auschwitz was its most productive \nfactory. It is estimated that some one and a half million were murdered \nthere. The victims were Poles, Slavs, Russians, Gypsies, but the \nmajority were Jews. They died from disease, starvation, exposure and \nexhaustion, on the gallows and in front of the firing squads, but \nmostly they were marched into the gas chambers. From the camp's \nestablishment in 1940 until its liberation, the ovens of\n\n[[Page S428]]\n\nAuschwitz operated around the clock, their smokestacks spewing the \nstench of inhumanity across the countryside.\n  The Holocaust is a story of incomprehensible inhumanity, of an act of \nenormity that passed all moral bounds and entered the realm of pure \nevil. It also, however, is a story of incredible heroism, of men and \nwomen who risked their lives, many who sacrificed their lives, for \nothers--not just family and friends, but often total strangers.\n  Some of these heroes are well known to us: Raoul Wallenberg and Oskar \nSchlindler, to name just two. Some are less known, but equally \ndeserving of mankind's gratitude. The American journalist Varian Fry, \nthe beneficiary of a privileged childhood and an Ivy League education, \nrisked his life repeatedly spiriting 2,000 Jews out of occupied France \nthrough the network he created of black-market funds, forged documents \nand secret escape routes. In 1941, in retaliation for an escape by \nothers, a group of Auschwitz prisoners was lined up before a firing \nsquad. At the last moment, the Roman Catholic Priest Maximillian Kolbe \nvoluntarily stepped forward to take a father's place.\n  The names of some heroes will never be known to us. In the weeks \nbefore the liberation, the Nazis began dismantling the machinery of \ndeath at Auschwitz in order to hide their crimes. The gas chambers and \ncrematoria were dynamited, the mass graves were disguised, and the \ninfamous March of Death began. Nearly 60,000 prisoners, already \nweakened by hunger and illness, were driven on foot across the harsh \nwinter countryside to camps within the Reich. The penalty for failure \nto keep up was summary execution.\n  That also was the penalty for the people who offered food, water, \nand--whenever the opportunity arose--escape when this sorrowful parade \npassed through their villages. One survivor of the March of Death, Jan \nWygas, tells of a villager who approached his column of prisoners with \na bottle of water:\n\n       ``Let them drink,'' she said in German to the SS guards. \n     ``They are people, too.'' She gave the water to one of the \n     prisoners. The SS man yelled at her to move back. As she \n     turned to walk away, he shot her in the back of the head. I \n     saw this with my own eyes.\n\n  And yet, despite this brutality heaped on top of brutality, the \npeople of the villages continued to offer aid, in Poland, in Silesia, \neven in Germany itself.\n  Indeed, there are stories of those within the regime who resisted in \nwhatever way they could. In his inspiring Holocaust memoir, ``Anton the \nDove Fancier,'' Bernard Gotfryd tells of the time in 1944 when he was \nsent as a slave laborer to a German aircraft plant. Like his co-\nworkers, Gotfryd did his best to be the worst worker possible, turning \nout defective parts and causing his machine to break down constantly. \nHis stern German supervisor, known only as Herr Gruber, seemed not to \nnotice this widespread incompetence, despite being under constant \npressure to increase production.\n  Once, Gotfryd sprained his ankle so severely he could not walk and \ncould barely stand. In most cases, this disability would have earned a \nprisoner a spot on a train to a death camp. Again, Herr Gruber seemed \nnot to notice.\n  In the summer of 1944, Gotfryd discovered a treasure in the pocket of \nhis work overalls: a sausage and a slab of real bread wrapped in \nnewspaper. The rare and delicious food nourished his body. The \nnewspaper nourished his soul, for it told of the Allied invasion of \nNormandy. The meaning of this message was to hold on, salvation was on \nthe way. Gotfryd knew the messenger could only have been Herr Gruber.\n  From where does this courage, this compassion, this self-sacrifice \nfor total strangers come? None of us can say with certainty, but we all \nare blessed by its presence.\n  On the other hand, the source of the hatred that led one of Europe's \ngreatest powers to enact blatantly discriminatory laws, then to revel \nin a night of shattered windows, and finally to commit mass murder is \nknown to us all too well. It is that particularly virulent and \npersistent form of mindless bigotry called anti-Semitism.\n  One would think that the stories of Holocaust survivors, the \nirrefutable evidence before our eyes for the last 60 years, the \nmemorials at such places as Auschwitz, and the debt we owe 6 million \nvictims would be more than enough to eradicate this scourge. \nTragically, Mr. President, that is not the case.\n  Earlier this month, our State Department released a Report on Global \nAnti-Semitism. This report is the result of the Global Anti-Semitism \nReview Act of 2004, introduced by my distinguished colleague from Ohio, \nSenator Voinovich. I am proud to have been a co-sponsor.\n  To say that the findings of this report are discouraging is a gross \nunderstatement. In country after country around the world, there has \nbeen a sharp increase in both the frequency and severity of anti-\nSemitic incidents in the first years of the 21st Century. Clearly, the \nlessons of the first half of the 20th are in danger of being forgotten.\n  These incidents are not just the random vandalism of Jewish \ncemeteries or synagogues, or the occasional incident of harassment or \nassault, and the perpetrators are not just neo-Nazis or skinheads on \nthe fringe of society. The new strain of this disease combines ancient \nanti-Jewish prejudice with a new demonization of the State of Israel \nand unbridled anti-Americanism, replete with Nazi comparisons and \nsymbolism. In this new anti-Semitism, the extreme right and the extreme \nleft have gone around the bend so far that they now have joined forces.\n  We see evidence of this new anti-Semitism all around us. The \nProtocols of the Elders of Zion is cited with increasing frequency in \nthe Middle East press, instead of being consigned, along with its \nideological sequel, Mein Kampf, to the ash heap of literary history. In \nsome areas of Europe, the swastika replaces the letter ``s'' in anti-\nIsrael and anti-American posters, bumper stickers and buttons. There is \nthe absurd rumor that Jews in New York City had advance warning of the \nSeptember 11 attacks. The Holocaust itself, when not being denied, is \nat least being diminished.\n  The answer is not to silence these despicable ideas but to respond to \nthem. We all have an obligation to history and to humanity to speak \nout, loudly and without exception, to this perversion of the truth and \nthis degradation of civilization.\n  Julia Skalina is an Auschwitz survivor, a native of Czechoslovakia \nwho now lives in my home State, in the city of Portland. She is a \nfrequent speaker at schools in Maine. These are her words: ``I learned \nwhat hatred can do, what people driven by hatred can do. I wish any \nfuture generation should never have to live through what we lived \nthrough.''\n  That wish will come true only if we--all of us--make it so. The \nhorror of the Holocaust and the magnificence of the human spirit that \nit revealed demand this of us.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/01/25/senate-section/article/S428-1", "month": "01", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S428-S429]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       COUNTRY OF ORIGIN LABELING\n\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, yesterday, along with my colleagues \nSenators Johnson, Thomas, Thune, Bingaman, and Dorgan, I introduced a \nbill on country-of-origin labeling. The bill would accelerate the date \nof implementation of mandatory COOL, and expand labeling requirements \nto include processed foods.\n  Country-of-origin labeling is probably one of the most important \nissues for cattle producers in Montana. They raise the best beef in the \nworld, and they are proud of that. They want the American consumer to \nknow that beef in the freezer case is ``Made in the U.S.A''.\n  Of course, I have supported country-of-origin labeling for many \nyears, and I was glad to see it finally pass in 2002 when we passed the \n2002 farm bill. But since then, there have been some folks who won't \nrest until they dismantle the program. The implementation has been \ndelayed, writing the rules has been delayed--well, I say enough is \nenough. Mandatory COOL is the law of the land. Let's get it \nimplemented.\n  We need to get the country-of-origin labeling done. It needs to be \ndone right, and it needs to be mandatory. Getting it done right is the \nkey. I have a concern with the COOL law currently on the books. My \nlegislation begins to fix one part of that law.\n  Right now, very little beef will actually be labeled in the grocery \nstores. The law excludes over half of the beef sold in this country. \n``Processed foods'' includes a big portion of the beef products you and \nI are used to: Beef jerky,\n\n[[Page S429]]\n\nsausage, marinated foods--all of these items would be excluded under \nthe current COOL law. I want to see that fixed, and that is what my \nbill will do. But I do not want mandatory COOL to be delayed any \nlonger. That is why my legislation will implement the mandatory COOL \nlaw, as it is written, 1 year ahead of what the current law says, and \nthen direct USDA to work on including processed foods.\n  Let me be clear. I want to see COOL done right, but under no set of \ncircumstances do I support rolling back country-of-origin labeling. \nCOOL needs to be mandatory. We have tried a voluntary program for 2 \nyears. No one has participated. It is time for the packers and the \nprocessors to realize that Montana's cow/calf producers want labeling. \nThey want to tell consumers where their beef comes from. I support \nthat. I have pushed for mandatory COOL for years, and I will continue \nto do so in this Congress.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/01/25/senate-section/article/S429-1", "month": "01", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S429]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO HOWARD LIEBENGOOD\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I today pay tribute to my friend, Howard \nLiebengood, who died earlier this month. Howard's most recent service \nto the Senate was as Senator Bill Frist's Chief of Staff. I was \nprivileged to meet Howard when I came to the Senate 27 years ago, when \nhe was our Sergeant at Arms. Howard was a treasured and invaluable \nmember of the Senate family who will be greatly missed.\n  As I reflect on the privilege of serving my State and working with so \nmany able and dedicated Senate staffers, Howard Liebengood stands out \nas one of the most effective members of our Senate staff whose \nexemplary career is testimony of his dedication to public service.\n  Howard's hallmark was his ever-present smile and vast knowledge of \nSenate practices and procedures.\n  His air of calm pervaded hot debates on tough issues as he reminded \nus that more challenging issues had been resolved with less acrimony in \ndays past.\n  His outstanding record of service will stand as an everlasting manual \nfrom which present and future generations of Senate staffers can learn. \nHoward made the Senate a better place to work and our Nation a better \nplace to live. His enormous contributions over his lengthy career will \nbe remembered and cherished by his colleagues.\n  My staff joins me in sending our deepest sympathy to the Liebengood \nfamily.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/01/25/senate-section/article/S429-2", "month": "01", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S429]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            FOOD AID FUNDING\n\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, very soon the administration is expected to \nsend to Congress supplemental appropriation requests to address ongoing \nmilitary needs in Iraq and the humanitarian crisis posed by the tsunami \nin the Indian Ocean. My hope is that the administration will include \nadequate food aid funding in that supplemental proposal. Recent press \nreports suggest they may be moving in that direction. If, however, the \nadministration's proposed supplemental fails to provide adequate food \naid funding, it is my intention to offer an amendment that would \nessentially accomplish four things.\n  First, my amendment would provide full funding to meet U.S. food aid \ncommitments from the tsunami under PL-480 title II. Second, my \namendment will replenish PL-480 title II development funds that help \nmeet our ongoing development programs across the globe. Third, it will \nshore up PL-480 title I funds that have been used as a stop-gap measure \nto address the crisis. And finally, it will replenish the Bill Emerson \nHumanitarian Trust, BEHT, so that our aid workers and development \npersonnel can be assured of adequate resources to carry out their \nimportant lifesaving work in future crises.\n  The tsunami brought images of destruction and human suffering on a \nscale that is hard for many of us to imagine. Americans responded with \ngreat generosity by committing unprecedented funds through private \ndonations. Some $50 million, I am told, has been pledged through the \nAmerican Red Cross alone.\n  Federal workers and their cooperators in Washington and around the \nglobe made an extraordinary effort to respond. Food resources that were \nprepositioned, and even some in transit, were shifted to address this \ncrisis. For all their hard work and creativity, I commend them.\n  What concerns me now, however, is how we proceed after the television \nnetworks scale back their coverage. Enormous need will remain even \nafter the emergency is contained. It will be months, perhaps years, \nbefore rice paddies are desalinated, fishing boats are rebuilt and \nfishing nets are repaired. Self-sufficiency will not happen overnight. \nAnd while the people most directly affected by the tsunami are \nstruggling to achieve a measure of self-sufficiency, the dire need for \nfood aid continues in places such as Ethiopia and Sudan and many \nothers. That is why I believe it is so critical that we reinforce our \nfood aid capacity.\n  In his inaugural address, the President spoke forcefully about ending \ntyranny and spreading democracy. Everyone shares those objectives. We \nalso know that those objectives cannot be achieved solely by force or \ngesture politics. They demand a commitment to diplomacy and human \ncompassion. Adequate funding for food aid is central to that process, \nand I invite my colleagues to join me in this effort.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/01/25/senate-section/article/S429-3", "month": "01", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S429-S430]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               ROBERT T. MATSUI UNITED STATES COURTHOUSE\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I have joined Senators Boxer and \nDurbin in introducing legislation that would rename the federal \ncourthouse in Sacramento, CA, in honor of recently deceased U.S. \nRepresentative Robert T. Matsui. This represents a fitting tribute to a \ngreat man and a dedicated public servant.\n  On January 1, 2005, the people of the Sacramento area, the State of \nCalifornia, and the Nation suffered a great loss when Bob Matsui passed \naway. For 26 years in Congress and 7 years before that as a member of \nthe Sacramento City Council, Bob was a reasoned and dependable voice. A \nproblem solver, Bob was a thoughtful and constructive leader who \nbrought people together to find solutions to public policy issues.\n  I had the distinct pleasure of working with Bob on a number of issues \nrelating to our home State of California. I will remember him as a \ngreat human being, as a trusted colleague, as a fine public servant, \nand someone in whom I was proud to place friendship, respect, and \ncollegiality.\n  Proud of his ideals, Bob never let disagreement lead to rancor. The \nsheer number of tributes paid from both sides of the aisle clearly \ndemonstrates the enormous respect he inspired among his colleagues. \nLikewise, the tremendous outpouring of support shown at services held \nin his honor reminds us just how endeared he had become to those he \nrepresented over the years.\n  Bob's path to public service was greatly fueled by experiences in his \nyouth, especially his internment along with thousands of other Japanese \nAmericans during World War II.\n  When he was just six months old, Bob and his family were sent to an \ninternment camp in Northern California, leaving behind their home and \ntheir livelihood. Bob would spend the first four years of his life \nthere.\n  I think this experience had a very sobering impact on his life. But \nrather than let it lead to resentment and hatred, I think it had an \nimpact on his knowing what he wanted to do with his life, and that was \npublic service.\n  In fact, one of Bob's most significant legacies will be the work he \ndid to help the Government make amends with the Japanese Americans who \nwere interned like himself.\n  As a member of Congress, Bob was successful in passing legislation \nthat offered a formal apology from the Government for the internment \nprogram and provided compensation to victims. This is a great legacy \nand it will be remembered well.\n  Bob also excelled in his knowledge and expertise of Social Security \nas well as tax and trade policy. He had an influential place on the \nHouse Ways and Means Committee, which will miss his leadership.\n  The Sacramento area, where Bob was born and which he represented for \nover three decades in public office, shows numerous examples of Bob's \nachievements. From the light-rail train system to comprehensive flood \nprotection, Bob's mark is everywhere.\n\n[[Page S430]]\n\n  The renaming of this particular courthouse in Bob's honor is \nespecially fitting. During his career in Congress, Bob was instrumental \nin obtaining more than $142 million in federal funding for the \ncourthouse.\n  Bob did what he did extraordinarily well. Throughout his career he \nshowed that he was a skilled politician as well as a great policymaker. \nHis constituents considered themselves lucky to have his \nrepresentation, and I consider myself lucky to have known him.\n  Through his many accomplishments, Bob Matsui secured his legacy of \ndevoted public service. I offer my gratitude for his service and \nsupport this legislation in his honor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/01/25/senate-section/article/S430-1", "month": "01", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S430]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n             CONGRATULATIONS TO THE RED ROVER MARCHING BAND\n\n Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, President George W. Bush's \ninauguration ceremony was truly a spectacular event. The sights and \nsounds that thousands of Americans witnessed on Thursday, January 20, \n2005, will remain in their minds forever.\n  The 243 students of the Easton High School Red Rover Marching Band in \nEaston, PA, however, will have the lasting memory of marching up \nPennsylvania Avenue to the White House to perform for the President and \nFirst Lady.\n  The Presidential inauguration is not only a time to peacefully \ncelebrate a transition of power, but it is a time for students and \nbands from all over the nation to perform for the President and the \nFirst Lady. As bystanders and thousands across the country watched the \ninaugural parade, the performers put a face and familiarity to such a \nmomentous event.\n  Prior to the inauguration, on Tuesday, January 18th, 2005, I had the \nopportunity to meet with the students of the Red Rover Marching Band \nand to listen as they practiced for their inaugural performance. The \nRed Rover Marching Band was chosen out of 300 bands from across the \nnation. In our meeting, I could feel the excitement of these high \nschool students as they prepared for the opportunity to display their \ntalents and participate in such an important event. It brings a great \nsense of pride to the residents of Easton and to all Pennsylvanians \nthat the Red Rover Marching Band was selected to represent the musical \ntalents of Pennsylvania youth in the inaugural parade.\n  It is a great honor for the Red Rover Marching Band to participate in \nsuch a dramatic event of pomp and circumstance. I am thankful for the \ntime that they put in practicing and reviewing their song selection. \nThey should be proud to be among the many other top-notch bands that \nperformed before the President and First Lady in the Inaugural Parade. \nTheir hard work certainly paid off. I am pleased that the Red Rover \nMarching Band represented our Commonwealth and specifically Easton, \nPennsylvania on such an historic day in our Nation's history.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/01/25/senate-section/article/S430-2", "month": "01", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S430]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    REMEMBERING G. FRED DIBONA, JR.\n\n Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, today I reflect on the loss of a \ndear friend. On January 11, 2005, G. Fred DiBona, Jr. passed away after \na 15-month battle with cancer. I have known Fred for more than 11 years \nand have developed a close relationship with Fred and his family. The \nDiBona family has suffered a tremendous loss, and I offer them my \ncondolences and deepest sympathy during this difficult time.\n  On February 20, 1951, G. Fred DiBona, Jr. was born in South \nPhiladelphia to Common Pleas Court Judge, G. Fred DiBona and the former \nRose D'Amico. Fred Jr. was raised in Philadelphia, and went on to \ngraduate from South Philadelphia High School and Davis and Elkins \nCollege. He also received a law degree from the Delaware School of Law.\n  At the age of 25, Fred became chairman of the Philadelphia Zoning \nBoard of Adjustment. After a three-year post with the Zoning Board, \nFred served as President of the Philadelphia Port Corporation, \nPresident of the Greater Philadelphia Chamber of Commerce, and finally \nas President and Chief Executive Officer of Independence Blue Cross.\n  With vision and confidence, Fred completely revolutionized \nIndependence Blue Cross. He devoted a great deal of time and energy to \nIndependence Blue Cross, and implemented a vision of trustworthy \ninsurance service to his customers for many years. Throughout his \ncareer, Fred worked vigorously and tirelessly in the pursuit of \nexcellence, and I am grateful for the many years of service he provided \nto his community.\n  Fred will also be remembered for his community activism and \nwillingness to serve on several boards and councils. Specifically, he \nserved consecutive terms as chairman of the Blue Cross and Blue Shield \nAssociation, the country's largest association of private health \ninsurers. He is also a former member of the Harvard Health Policy and \nManagement Executive Council, a group at the Harvard School of Public \nHealth. Fred also served on the boards of Aqua America Inc., Crown \nHoldings Inc., Exelon Corporation, The GEO Group, Inc., and Tasty \nBaking Company. Fred's involvement in civic organizations, including \nthe Peter Nero and Philly Pops Board, displayed his dedication as a \nprofessional to his community.\n  It is noticeable by the several awards that Fred received over the \nyears that his dedication to service graced his community tremendously. \nIn 1995 Fred received the National Patriot's Award from the \nCongressional Medal of Honor Society. In 1996, he received the Thomas \nCahill Leadership Award and the Jewish National Fund Tree of Life \nAward. Fred has also been honored with the Annual Business Leadership \nAward from LaSalle University; the Good Scout Award for the Cradle of \nLiberty Council, Boy Scouts of America; the 95th Annual Whitney M. \nYoung Jr. Leadership Award from the Urban League of Philadelphia; and \nthe 50th annual Business Leader of the Year award from Drexel \nUniversity.\n  Despite his numerous accolades, Fred was an extremely humble man and \na positive role model to others. I was proud to have Fred serve as my \nfirst finance chairman in my 1994 race for the Senate. It was during \nthat time that we began to develop a close relationship.\n  Fred not only leaves behind a legacy, but also a wonderful family. \nFred was a loving husband to Sylvia and father to Fred and Christine. \nMy thoughts and prayers are with the DiBona family during the days and \nmonths ahead.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/01/25/senate-section/article/S430-3", "month": "01", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S430-S431]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    CARROLL COLLEGE FIGHTING SAINTS\n\n Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, with great pride and admiration I \nhonor the Carroll College football team, better known as the Fighting \nSaints who, on December 18, 2004, defeated the University of St. \nFrancis Cougars to win their third consecutive NAIA football \nchampionship. Carroll is the first team to achieve this feat since \nTexas A & I accomplished it in 1974-1976.\n  St. Francis was leading 13-12 with just 1:13 left to play in the game \nand 89 long yards for Carroll College. Without a timeout remaining, \nquarterback Tyler Emmert drove the Saints within field goal range and \nwith ten seconds on the clock to spare, which gave freshmen kicker \nMarcus Miller an opportunity to kick a 32-yard field goal.\n  Along with the honor of being national champions, quarterback Tyler \nEmmert was named the offensive MVP of the NAIA All-American Team. Four \nother team members of the Fighting Saints were also named to the NAIA \nAll-American Team and two received honorable mentions. This great team \nis led by head coach Mike Van Diest who was named 2003 NAIA National \nCoach of the Year and Frontier Conference Coach of the Year. Van Diest \nalso received the Frank Leahy Coach of the Year Award and the Johnny \nVaught Head Coach Award, both presented by the All-American Football \nFoundation. The Carroll College football team was well represented on \nthe 2004 NAIA All-American squad with five players making the first \nteam. The Saints placed three players on offense--lineman Kyle Baker, \nquarterback Tyler Emmert and wide receiver Kevin McCutcheon. Linebacker \nGary Cooper and defensive lineman Kevin Cicero were named to the first-\nteam defense.\n  On this outstanding Carroll team, 23 of the 52 players had never been \nto a\n\n[[Page S431]]\n\nchampionship game before. This victory must be credited to all of the \nplayers on this fine team. At this time I would like to submit a full \nroster of the Fighting Saints to be printed for the Record of the \nSenate following my statement.\n  Carroll College is not known just for their football program. U.S. \nNews and World Report ranked Carroll College as the Fourth Best Western \nRegional Comprehensive College in America's Best Colleges for 2005. The \nTalking Saints forensics team is ranked in the top five of all \nuniversities and colleges in the United States. Their Nursing \nDepartment uses state-of-the-art technology including a $30,000 \nsimulated patient, the most advanced of its kind and the only one in \nthe state of Montana. Nine faculty members received Fulbright \nScholarships, which continues to add to the school's excellent \nreputation. The ABET, Accreditation Board for Engineering and \nTechnology, recently presented Carroll College with its Innovation \nAward in recognition of the creative way that they combined their \nengineering and mathematics curriculums.\n  I congratulate the three-time national champions and the fine \neducational institution of Carroll College.\n  Carroll College 2004 Football Roster, 51-man playoff roster:\n\n       A.J.

Mr. President, I take this opportunity to \nrecognize the 75th anniversary of the Jewish Federation of Silicon \nValley.\n  In 1930, the Jewish Federation of Silicon Valley, JFSV, was \nincorporated into the national Jewish Federation system to promote \nphilanthropic and humanitarian activities in Santa Clara County. For 75 \nyears, JFSV has served as a focal point for the Jewish community in \nSilicon Valley. With a membership of over 13,000, the JFSV is committed \nto preservation and enrichment of Jewish culture, and to expressing \nJewish community concerns about Jewish life in Santa Clara County, the \nUnited States, Israel and throughout the world.\n  Over the past 75 years, JFSV has expanded greatly, and now offers a \nwide variety of programs to its members. The Silicon Valley Young \nAdults Division offers educational and social programs to members ages \n25-40. The Women's Philanthropy Division focuses on community-building, \neducational, social, and cultural enrichment for women, while offering \ngreat networking opportunities to women members. Blue Knot, the Jewish \nTechnology Initiative, creates opportunities for Jewish professionals \nin the technology sector to exchange ideas and expand networks.\n  JFSV is based on the caring philosophies of Klal Yisrael, the \nresponsibility of each Jew for another, and Tikun Olam, repairing the \nworld through social action. JFSV has mentored many members who have \ndedicated themselves to community service in Silicon Valley and the \nGreater Bay Area. Through its outreach, JFSV has successfully enhanced \nsocial and civic participation in the Silicon Valley community.\n  The Jewish Federation of Silicon Valley's service to the Jewish \ncommunity, both in Santa Clara County and nationwide, is truly \ninspiring. I congratulate the Jewish Federation of Silicon Valley on \ntheir 75th anniversary and wish them another 75 years of \nsuccess.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/01/25/senate-section/article/S431-2", "month": "01", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S431]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                40TH ANNIVERSARY OF ANALOG DEVICES, INC.\n\n Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I welcome this opportunity to \nrecognize a significant milestone in the life of a truly innovative \nMassachusetts company. On January 18, Analog Devices, Inc., of Norwood, \nMA celebrated its 40th anniversary.\n  The firm was founded in 1965 by two M.I.T. graduates, Ray Stata and \nMatthew Lorber. It is now the world's largest supplier of some of the \nkey data converters and amplifiers used in nearly every form of \nelectronic communications equipment.\n  Its earnings place it in the top 10 among companies in Massachusetts, \nand it has manufacturing plants and technology design centers in \nMassachusetts and nine other States, including Arizona, California, New \nHampshire, New Jersey, North Carolina, Oregon, Texas, Utah, and \nWashington, as well as 11 other countries.\n  Analog Devices has been in the vanguard of the innovation revolution \nthat has transformed the economy of Massachusetts, and that continues \nto shape the economic future of this country. When I first came to the \nSenate, our State economy was characterized by a reliance on older \nindustries, many of which migrated South, and then overseas.\n  Fortunately, in the decades since then, innovators like Ray Stata and \nMatthew Lorber, began to launch the industries of the future in our \nState, including information technology, electronics, and biomedicine. \nWe still face significant economic challenges, as all States do. But we \ntake great pride in reports that consistently place us among the most \neconomically competitive regions of the country, and we are hopeful \nabout our future.\n  The Analog Devices team has a great deal to celebrate as they \nconclude their 40th year, including several noteworthy recent \naccomplishments.\n  Analog Devices was recognized by its industry peers in the \nMassachusetts Telecommunications Council as State Telecom Company of \nthe Year in 2004.\n  Jerald G. Fishman was named CEO of the Year in 2004 by Electronic \nBusiness magazine, a prestigious industry publication with a large \ncirculation among electronic industry executives.\n  In 2001, in recognition of his enormous contributions and commitment \nto education, the United States Semiconductor Industry Association \nhonored Ray Stata with the prestigious Robert N. Noyce Award.\n  The strong foundation laid by Analog Devices in its first 40 years \nwill bring decades more of creativity, innovation, prosperity, and \ninvestment to our State, and I congratulate this outstanding company \nfor it's done so well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/01/25/senate-section/article/S431-3", "month": "01", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S431-S435]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   EXECUTIVE AND OTHER COMMUNICATIONS\n\n  The following communications were laid before the Senate, together \nwith accompanying papers, reports, and documents, and were referred as \nindicated:\n\n       EC-101.

SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING MULTIEMPLOYER PENSION \n                   PLANS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) Multiemployer pension plans have been a major force in \n     the delivery of employee benefits to active and retired \n     American workers and their dependents for over half a \n     century.\n       (2) There are approximately 1,700 multiemployer defined \n     benefit pension plans in which approximately 9,700,000 \n     workers and retirees participate.\n       (3) Three-quarters of the approximately 60,000 to 65,000 \n     employers that participate in multiemployer plans have fewer \n     that 100 employees.\n       (4) Multiemployer plans allow for greater access and \n     affordability for smaller employers and pension portability \n     for their employees as they move from one job to another, and \n     permit workers to earn a pension where they might otherwise \n     not be able to do so.\n       (5) The 2000-2002 drop in the stock market and decline in \n     equity values has affected all investors, including \n     multiemployer plans.\n       (6) The decline in value sustained by multiemployer defined \n     benefit pension plans have threatened the stability of this \n     private sector source of secure retirement income.\n       (7) Participating employers could face onerous excise taxes \n     and other penalties as a result of the serious, adverse \n     financial impact due to these market losses.\n       (8) In 2004, the United States Senate recognized the \n     severity of this situation and passed by an overwhelmingly, \n     large bipartisan margin of 86 to 9 temporary relief \n     provisions for single and multiemployer defined benefit \n     pension plans.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the Senate--\n       (1) expresses its strong support for multiemployer defined \n     benefit pension plans;\n       (2) recognizes the importance of an environment in which \n     multiemployer plans can continue their vital role in \n     providing benefits to working men and women;\n       (3) recognizes that multiemployer pension plan relief must \n     be designed for the multiemployer labor-relations environment \n     that supports the plans; and\n       (4) supports legislation to strengthen and protect the \n     viability of multiemployer pension plans for the continued \n     benefit of current and retired members, and their families \n     and survivors, and to strengthen the ability of all plans to \n     address funding problems that occur.\n\n       TITLE II--CREATING NEW JOBS THROUGH INVESTMENT IN AMERICA\n\n           Subtitle A--Eliminating Incentives for Outsourcing\n\n     SEC. 211.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Research and development performed in the United States \n     results in quality jobs, better and safer products, increased \n     ownership of technology-based intellectual property, and \n     higher productivity in the United States.\n       (2) Since 1994, private sector research and development \n     employment has grown at a faster rate than overall private \n     sector employment in the United States. From 1994 to 2000, \n     there was an average annual growth rate of 5.4 percent in \n     research and development employment, compared with 2.7 \n     percent in total employment.\n       (3) The extent to which companies perform and increase \n     research and development activities in the United States is \n     in part dependent on Federal tax policy.\n       (4) The private sector performed most of the Nation's \n     research and development and accounted for more than two-\n     thirds of total research and development performance in 2003. \n     Of the $194,000,000,000 in industrial research and \n     development performed in 2003, more than 90 percent was \n     funded by industry.\n       (5) Many of the countries with which the United States \n     competes have introduced new or revised national plans for \n     science, technology, and innovation policy, and a growing \n     number of countries have established targets for increased \n     research and development spending. Virtually all countries \n     are seeking ways to enhance the quality and efficiency of \n     public research, stimulate business investments in research \n     and development, and strengthen linkages between the public \n     and private sectors.\n       (6) Direct government support to business research and \n     development has declined, both in absolute terms and as a \n     share of business research and development, and greater \n     emphasis is being placed on indirect measures, such as tax \n     incentives for research and development.\n       (7) Congress should make permanent a research and \n     development credit that provides a meaningful incentive to \n     all types of taxpayers.\n\n     SEC. 282.

AUTHORIZATIONS OF APPROPRIATIONS FOR THE ADVANCED \n                   TECHNOLOGY PROGRAM AND THE MANUFACTURING \n                   EXTENSION PARTNERSHIP PROGRAM.\n\n       (a) Advanced Technology Program.--\n       (1) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (A) The Advanced Technology Program (ATP) has played an \n     important role in helping United States companies develop \n     new, breakthrough technologies. ATP has funded research \n     ranging from cancer vaccines, to hi-tech flexible displays, \n     to composite materials, to fuel cells, all of which are the \n     kinds of technological advances that give the United States a \n     competitive advantage globally.\n       (B) The National Academy of Science has found it to be an \n     effective program that could use more funding wisely, and the \n     National Association of Manufacturers (NAM), the \n     Biotechnology Industry Organization (BIO), the Industrial \n     Research Institute, the Alliance for Science and Technology \n     Research in America, and the American Chemical Society \n     support ATP.\n       (C) Businesses need this type of program more than ever as \n     venture capital funds have become more scarce in the current \n     economy. ATP bridges this gap between the research lab and \n     market capital, facilitating the critical transfer of \n     technology to the private sector that leads to the \n     development of products and services that make use of new, \n     technological breakthroughs.\n       (D) Not only does ATP promote economic security and global \n     competitiveness for the nation as a whole, it is an important \n     program for generating jobs domestically. Last year nearly 80 \n     percent of ATP awards went to small businesses, an essential \n     job-creating sector in the United States economy.\n       (E) ATP is also vital to the homeland security of the \n     United States. ATP has funded many projects in detection, \n     preparedness, prevention and response with significant \n     applications for homeland security. With continued financial \n     support through ATP to develop these projects and their \n     security applications, the United States will become more \n     secure.\n       (F) Despite the importance and success of ATP, current \n     funding levels do not meet the demand. Over 1,000 proposals \n     for ATP funding that were submitted in 2002 yielded enough \n     high quality projects for the ATP funding that was available \n     in both fiscal years 2002 and 2003. The 870 applications for \n     ATP funding received in fiscal year 2004 made the second \n     highest number of applications for ATP funding that were \n     received in any fiscal year, but funding was only available \n     for 59 awards. No funding for new awards is available in \n     fiscal year 2005.\n       (G) According to the 2004 annual report on the ATP, returns \n     from just 41 of the 736 ATP\n\n[[Page S444]]\n\n     projects have exceeded $17,000,000,000 in economic benefits, \n     more than 8 times the amount of money spent on all 736 \n     projects.\n       (2) Authorization of appropriations.--There are authorized \n     to be appropriated to the Secretary of Commerce for the \n     Advanced Technology Program of the National Institute of \n     Standards and Technology--\n       (A) $247,200,000 for fiscal year 2005;\n       (B) $254,616,000 for fiscal year 2006;\n       (C) $262,254,000 for fiscal year 2007; and\n       (D) $270,122,000 for fiscal year 2008.\n       (b) Manufacturing Extension Partnership Program.--\n       (1) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (A) Small- and medium-sized manufacturers in the United \n     States employ 7,000,000 people and contribute \n     $711,000,000,000, or 7 percent of the Gross Domestic Product \n     to the United States economy. The Hollings Manufacturing \n     Extension Partnership (MEP) Program supports a network of \n     locally run centers that provide technical advice and \n     consulting to these firms in all fifty States and Puerto \n     Rico. Since its inception, the Hollings MEP Program has \n     assisted 149,000 of the 380,000 small and medium-sized \n     manufacturers in the United States.\n       (B) The Hollings MEP Program is a proven program. Studies \n     show that Hollings MEP Program manufacturers have four times \n     more productivity growth than non-MEP firms, and the program \n     has proven to lead to increased sales, increased capital \n     investment, cost savings and the creation or retention of \n     jobs in the United States.\n       (C) The Hollings MEP Program is more important today than \n     ever as the Nation faces a looming current account deficit. \n     The United States has lost over 880,000 manufacturing jobs \n     during 2003 and 2004. Such manufacturing jobs pay on average \n     19 percent higher wages than the industry average.\n       (D) The Hollings MEP Program is not just about economic \n     security. Manufacturers with fewer than 500 employees \n     comprise more than 80 percent of the suppliers in key defense \n     sectors. Helping such manufacturers helps the national \n     security of the United States.\n       (2) Authorization of appropriations.--There are authorized \n     to be appropriated to the Secretary of Commerce for the \n     Hollings Manufacturing Extension Partnership Program of the \n     National Institute of Standards and Technology--\n       (A) $110,210,000 for fiscal year 2005;\n       (B) $113,516,000 for fiscal year 2006;\n       (C) $116,921,000 for fiscal year 2007; and\n       (D) $120,429,000 for fiscal year 2008.\n       (3) Manufacturing extension partnership program defined.--\n     In this subsection, the term ``Hollings Manufacturing \n     Extension Partnership Program'' means the program of Hollings \n     Manufacturing Extension Partnership carried out by the \n     National Institute of Standards and Technology under section \n     26 of the National Institute of Standards and Technology Act \n     (15 U.S.C. 278l), as provided in part 292 of title 15, Code \n     of Federal Regulations.\n\n     SEC. 292. SENSE OF THE SENATE PROMOTING SCIENCE AND \n                   TECHNOLOGY FUNDING FOR A STRONGER ECONOMIC \n                   FUTURE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) Leading economists have consistently attributed more \n     than 50 percent of the growth in the economy of the United \n     States to scientific and technological innovation. The \n     economic future of the United States, thus, depends on the \n     United States remaining the world leader in science and \n     technology.\n       (2) If the United States loses its leadership in science \n     and technology, its capacity for economic growth and high-\n     wage job creation will soon atrophy, with deleterious effects \n     on the national security of the United States. In 2001, the \n     Hart-Rudman Commission on National Security for the 21st \n     Century characterized the failure of the United States to \n     invest in science and to reform science and mathematics \n     education as the second biggest threat to national security, \n     stating that ``[s]econd only to a weapon of mass destruction \n     detonating in an American city, we can think of nothing more \n     dangerous than a failure to manage properly science, \n     technology, and education for the common good over the next \n     quarter century''.\n       (3) The United States has reaped enormous economic benefits \n     from being the first country to lead in the development of \n     the Internet and the harnessing of biotechnology. These \n     developments, though, are far from being the last \n     technological revolutions to influence the economy of the \n     United States. Technological changes that promise major \n     economic effects are now being made in areas such as--\n       (A) microelectronics, including the continued \n     miniaturization of electronic devices and the increasingly \n     widespread diffusion of data processing power;\n       (B) high-end supercomputing;\n       (C) telecommunications technologies;\n       (D) artificial materials, including materials in which the \n     structure has been designed and built at the atomic or \n     molecular level, the essence of nanotechnology;\n       (E) robotics; and\n       (F) new energy technologies, particular including renewable \n     energy technologies that are as inexpensive as traditional \n     fossil sources of energy, technologies using hydrogen as an \n     energy carrier, and technologies for energy efficiencies.\n       (4) Because of the interconnected nature of modern science \n     and technology, advances in one field depend on research \n     results in other, seemingly unrelated fields. Biomedical \n     science has been consistently shown to rely on advances in \n     fields such as chemistry, materials science, mathematics, \n     computer science, and physics. Without basic advances in \n     chemistry, computer science, and mathematics, the sequencing \n     of the human genome could not have been successfully \n     undertaken.\n       (5) In the 60 years since World War II, other countries and \n     regions of the world have built science and technology \n     capabilities that rival those of the United States today, or \n     that could rival such capabilities of the United States in \n     the future. The governments of China, India, Japan, and the \n     countries of the European Union have all targeted significant \n     advancements in research and innovation as central elements \n     of the plans for future national and regional economic \n     prosperity.\n       (6) President George W. Bush has largely ignored this \n     challenge, proposing budgets that have under-funded or \n     terminated key programs promoting United States scientific \n     and technological strength, including cuts to--\n       (A) basic and applied research in the Department of \n     Defense;\n       (B) agricultural research;\n       (C) transportation research; and\n       (D) fundamental research in the physical sciences and \n     engineering at the Department of Energy and elsewhere.\n       (7) For other programs that have been proposed for small \n     increases, such as the National Science Foundation, the \n     amount of funding provided to individual grantees is well \n     below the amounts that would lead to optimal scientific \n     productivity and continued United States leadership in \n     science and technology. In fiscal year 2004, the National \n     Science Foundation's stringent peer review evaluation process \n     judged approximately 12,000 out of some 40,000 proposals as \n     ``very good to excellent'' or ``excellent,'' yet, due to \n     budget constraints, only 56 percent of such proposals were \n     funded.\n       (8) The National Science Foundation and the Office of \n     Science in the Department of Energy are among the greatest \n     assets of the United States for the advancement of science, \n     mathematical, engineering, and technology research and \n     education. Although the National Science Foundation accounts \n     for only 4 percent of Federal research and development \n     spending, it provides nearly 50 percent of all Federal \n     support for non-medical basic research conducted in United \n     States colleges and universities. Similarly, the Office of \n     Science of the Department of Energy funds over half of all \n     university research in disciplines such as physics and \n     materials science, and has played a crucial role in national \n     science and technology initiatives such as advancing high-\n     performance computing and the sequencing of the human genome. \n     Both the National Science Foundation and the Office of \n     Science fund research in new frontiers of scientific inquiry \n     and contribute to creating a highly skilled, competitive \n     workforce in science and engineering.\n       (9) President Bush has also consistently proposed \n     terminating the Advanced Technology Program at the Department \n     of Commerce, which helps stimulate companies to participate \n     in high-risk, high-payoff research and development and is \n     perhaps one of the most successful programs in directly \n     stimulating industrial innovation in the United States. \n     Projects supported by the Advanced Technology Program span a \n     broad range of key technology areas, such as oil exploration, \n     automobile manufacturing, and new medical diagnostic and \n     therapeutic technologies and investments made by the program \n     accelerate the development process for innovative \n     technologies that promise significant commercial payoff and \n     widespread benefits.\n       (10) The continual cycle of basic research, applied \n     research, and development gives rise to new products and \n     processes, new ideas and understanding, and new researchers \n     and educators. Each link in this chain depends on the others. \n     Basic research produces the fundamental understandings that \n     underpin applications and the development process. The \n     resulting technologies and innovations create economic growth \n     through new products and job creation and stimulate new \n     thinking and advances in scientific instrumentation, which in \n     turn stimulate new inquiries that lead to new fundamental \n     research. All of this activity improves the quality of life \n     in the United States, and when adequately supported, \n     contributes to the continued leadership of the United States \n     in science and technology.\n       (11) A revitalized science and technology policy focused on \n     advancing all of the links of this chain, from basic research \n     through technology deployment, is necessary if the United \n     States is to maintain its technological preeminence over the \n     next decade and beyond. Applications stemming from basic \n     research can take over 20 years to evolve into next \n     generation technologies. Inadequate funding of basic research \n     may not seem acute today, but 20 years from now, it will be \n     extremely difficult to correct an inability of the United \n     States to compete scientifically and technologically, which \n     could be caused by inadequate funding now.\n       (12) In order to ensure strength in these areas, it is \n     necessary for the United States Government to ensure that \n     scientists and technology experts in the United States \n     receive the best education possible. After the Russians \n     launched Sputnik, Congress passed the National Defense \n     Education Act of 1958\n\n[[Page S445]]\n\n     (Public Law 85-864), which declared ``an educational \n     emergency'' and led to the more than doubling of Federal \n     expenditures for education. The programs authorized under \n     that Act helped the United States to improve rapidly in the \n     areas of science and technology, and led to United States \n     dominance in the arms race and the global economy.\n       (13) The United States would be well served by the \n     enactment of a new National Defense Education Act. Third in \n     the world in 1975, America now ranks 15th in the development \n     of new scientists and engineers. Today, India and China \n     annually produce 10 times as many new engineers as the United \n     States. Out of over 15,000,000 college students in the United \n     States, fewer than 400,000 individuals graduate with a \n     bachelor's degree in math, science, engineering, or \n     technology each year, and only 75,000 postgraduate students \n     go on to obtain a master's degree in math, science, \n     engineering, or technology.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that--\n       (1) Congress and the President should direct significant \n     new investments in the National Science Foundation, the \n     Office of Science at the Department of Energy, the National \n     Institutes of Health, and the National Institute of Standards \n     and Technology to increase federally funded research in basic \n     science and technology so that the United States can better \n     compete in the international economy; and\n       (2) Congress and the President should direct significant \n     new investments into the enhancement of elementary and \n     secondary education programs related to math, science, and \n     technology and substantially expand access to postsecondary \n     education for United States students seeking degrees in math, \n     science, and technology.\n\n               TITLE III--FAIR TRADE AND COMPETITIVENESS\n\n               Subtitle A--Trade Enforcement Enhancement\n\n     SEC. 311.

FOREIGN DEBT.\n\n       (a) Short Title.--This section may be cited as the \n     ``Foreign Debt Ceiling Act of 2005''.\n       (b) Foreign Debt Ceiling.--\n       (1) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (A) The United States has become the world's largest net \n     debtor Nation, having run up massive trade deficits since the \n     1990s.\n       (B) At the end of 2002, the net United States foreign debt \n     stood at $2,553,000,000,000.\n       (C) The United States foreign debt position worsened in \n     2003, when the United States had a record trade deficit of \n     $489,000,000,000, equivalent to 4.4 percent of the United \n     States GDP that year.\n       (D) The large and growing United States foreign debt \n     represents claims on United States assets by foreign \n     nationals, which will eventually have to be repaid. If \n     unchecked, the foreign debt could seriously undermine our \n     children's future standard of living.\n       (E) Moreover, the growing accumulation of foreign claims on \n     United States assets, including over $1,200,000,000,000 in \n     United States Treasury securities, makes the United States \n     economy vulnerable to the whims of foreign investors.\n       (F) Congress presently places a ceiling on United States \n     public debt, but does not place a ceiling on United States \n     foreign debt.\n       (G) Just as Congress recognized the importance of placing a \n     ceiling on the United States public debt, it is appropriate \n     that Congress place a limit on the United States foreign \n     debt.\n       (2) Actions triggered by united states foreign debt.--\n       (A) In general.--Not later than the 15th day of the second \n     month after the date of enactment of this Act, and every 3 \n     months thereafter, the United States Trade Representative \n     shall determine if--\n       (i) the net United States foreign debt for the preceding \n     12-month period is more than 25 percent of United States GDP \n     for the same period; or\n       (ii) the United States trade deficit for the preceding 12-\n     month period is more than 5 percent of United States GDP for \n     the same period.\n       (B) Action by ustr.--Whenever an affirmative determination \n     is made under subparagraph (A) (i) or (ii), the United States \n     Trade Representative shall--\n       (i) within 15 days of the determination, convene an \n     emergency meeting of the Trade Policy Review Group to develop \n     a plan of action to reduce the United States trade deficit; \n     and\n       (ii) within 45 days of the determination, present to \n     Congress a report detailing the Trade Policy Review Group's \n     trade deficit reduction plan.\n       (3) Measurement of foreign debt.--\n       (A) Statistical sources.--For purposes of the calculations \n     described in paragraph (2)(A), the United States Trade \n     Representative shall rely on the most recent period for\n\n[[Page S446]]\n\n     which the following data, published by the Department of \n     Commerce, is available:\n       (i) In the case of United States foreign debt, the United \n     States Trade Representative shall use the net international \n     investment position of the United States, with direct \n     investment positions determined at market value, as compiled \n     by the Bureau of Economic Analysis.\n       (ii) In the case of the United States trade deficit, the \n     United States Trade Representative shall use the goods and \n     services trade deficit data compiled by the United States \n     Census Bureau.\n       (iii) In the case of the United States GDP, the United \n     States Trade Representative shall use the nominal gross \n     domestic product data compiled by the Bureau of Economic \n     Analysis.\n       (B) Adjustment.--The United States Trade Representative may \n     adjust the data described in subparagraph (A) to ensure that \n     the determination is made for comparable time period.\n\n     SEC. 314. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.\n\n       (a) Authorization of Appropriations for the Office of the \n     General Counsel and the Office of Monitoring and \n     Enforcement.--There are authorized to be appropriated to the \n     Office of the United States Trade Representative for the \n     appointment of additional staff in the Office of the General \n     Counsel and the Office of Monitoring and Enforcement--\n       (1) $2,000,000 for fiscal year 2005; and\n       (2) $2,000,000 for fiscal year 2006.\n       (b) Responsibilities of Additional Staff.--The \n     responsibilities of the additional staff appointed under \n     subsection (a) shall include--\n       (1) investigating, prosecuting, and defending cases before \n     the World Trade Organization and under trade agreements to \n     which the United States is a party;\n       (2) administering United States trade laws, including title \n     III of the Trade Act of 1974 (19 U.S.C. 2411 et seq.) and \n     other trade laws relating to foreign government barriers to \n     United States goods and services, including barriers \n     involving intellectual property rights, government \n     procurement, and telecommunications; and\n       (3) monitoring compliance with the Uruguay Round Agreements \n     (as defined in section 2 of the Uruguay Round Agreements Act \n     (19 U.S.C. 3501)) and other trade agreements, particularly by \n     the People's Republic of China.\n\n       Subtitle B--Exchange Rate Policy and Currency Manipulation\n\n     SEC. 321. NEGOTIATIONS REGARDING CURRENCY VALUATION.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The currency of the People's Republic of China, known \n     as the yuan or renminbi, is artificially pegged at a level \n     significantly below its market value. Economists estimate the \n     yuan to be undervalued by between 15 percent and 40 percent \n     or an average of 27.5 percent.\n       (2) The undervaluation of the yuan provides the People's \n     Republic of China with a significant trade advantage by \n     making exports less expensive for foreign consumers and by \n     making foreign products more expensive for Chinese consumers. \n     The effective result is a significant subsidization of \n     China's exports and a virtual tariff on foreign imports.\n       (3) The Government of the People's Republic of China has \n     intervened in the foreign exchange markets to hold the value \n     of the yuan within an artificial trading range. China's \n     foreign reserves are estimated to be over $609,900,000,000 as \n     of January 12, 2004, and have increased by over \n     $206,700,000,000 in the last 12 months.\n       (4) China's undervalued currency, China's trade advantage \n     from that undervaluation, and the Chinese Government's \n     intervention in the value of its currency violates the spirit \n     and letter of the world trading system of which the People's \n     Republic of China is now a member.\n       (5) The Government of the People's Republic of China has \n     failed to promptly address concerns or to provide a \n     definitive timetable for resolution of these concerns raised \n     by the United States and the international community \n     regarding the value of its currency.\n       (6) Article XXI of the GATT 1994 (as defined in section \n     2(1)(B) of the Uruguay Round Agreements Act (19 U.S.C. \n     3501(1)(B))) allows a member of the World Trade Organization \n     to take any action which it considers necessary for the \n     protection of its essential security interests. Protecting \n     the United States manufacturing sector is essential to the \n     interests of the United States.\n       (b) Negotiations and Certification Regarding the Currency \n     Valuation Policy of the People's Republic of China.--\n       (1) In general.--Notwithstanding the provisions of title I \n     of Public Law 106-286 (19 U.S.C. 2431 note), on and after the \n     date that is 180 days after the date of enactment of this \n     Act, unless a certification described in paragraph (2) has \n     been made to Congress, in addition to any other duty, there \n     shall be imposed a rate of duty of 27.5 percent ad valorem on \n     any article that is the growth, product, or manufacture of \n     the People's Republic of China, imported directly or \n     indirectly into the United States.\n       (2) Certification.--The certification described in this \n     paragraph means a certification by the President to Congress \n     that the People's Republic of China is no longer acquiring \n     foreign exchange reserves to prevent the appreciation of the \n     rate of exchange between its currency and the United States \n     dollar for purposes of gaining an unfair competitive \n     advantage in international trade. The certification shall \n     also include a determination that the currency of the \n     People's Republic of China has undergone a substantial upward \n     revaluation placing it at or near its fair market value.\n       (3) Alternative certification.--If the President certifies \n     to Congress 180 days after the date of enactment of this Act \n     that the People's Republic of China has made a good faith \n     effort to revalue its currency upward placing it at or near \n     its fair market value, the President may delay the imposition \n     of the tariffs described in paragraph (1) for an additional \n     180 days. If at the end of the 180-day period the President \n     determines that China has developed and started actual \n     implementation of a plan to revalue its currency, the \n     President may delay imposition of the tariffs for an \n     additional 12 months, so that the People's Republic of China \n     shall have time to implement the plan.\n       (4) Negotiations.--Beginning on the date of enactment of \n     this Act, the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with \n     the United States Trade Representative, shall begin \n     negotiations with the People's Republic of China to ensure \n     that the People's Republic of China adopts a process that \n     leads to a substantial upward currency revaluation within 180 \n     days after the date of enactment of this Act. Because various \n     Asian governments have also been acquiring substantial \n     foreign exchange reserves in an effort to prevent \n     appreciation of their currencies for purposes of gaining an \n     unfair competitive advantage in international trade, and \n     because the People's Republic of China has concerns about the \n     value of those currencies, the Secretary shall also seek to \n     convene a multilateral summit to discuss exchange rates with \n     representatives of various Asian governments and other \n     interested parties, including representatives of other G-7 \n     nations.\n\n                Subtitle C--Trade Adjustment Assistance\n\n                       CHAPTER 1--SERVICE WORKERS\n\n     SEC. 331.

SENSE OF THE SENATE ON FREE TRADE AGREEMENTS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) The United States is participating in the Doha Round of \n     World Trade Organization (``WTO'') negotiations, which seeks \n     to lower trade barriers for all members of the WTO.\n       (2) In addition to participating in the Doha Round of WTO \n     negotiations, the United States is negotiating bilateral free \n     trade agreements with 20 countries.\n       (3) Only 1 of those 20 countries is among the top 30 \n     trading partners of the United States.\n       (4) During the debate on the legislation that was enacted \n     as the Trade Act of 2002 (Public Law 107-210; 116 Stat. 933), \n     a representative of the President argued that ``[i]ncreased \n     trade will help our workers, farmers, businesses, and economy \n     by enhancing employment opportunities, opening more markets \n     to American goods and services, and increasing choices and \n     lowering costs for consumers''.\n       (5) During that debate and on other occasions, the \n     President and individuals in the Executive Branch of the \n     United States have repeatedly argued that increased trade \n     means an increase in the number of jobs in the United States \n     and a higher standard of living for people in the United \n     States.\n       (6) The President and individuals in the Executive Branch \n     of the United States have also argued that trade expands \n     markets for United States goods and services, creates higher-\n     paying jobs in the United States, and invigorates local \n     communities and their economies.\n       (7) Trade agreements between the United States and \n     countries with small economies have little impact on creating \n     jobs in the United States or a higher standard of living for \n     people in the United States.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that--\n       (1) the trade policy of the United States should focus on \n     creating more jobs in the United States and a higher standard \n     of living for people in the United States; and\n       (2) to best accomplish these goals, the United States \n     should focus its efforts on trade negotiations occurring at \n     the WTO and, when negotiating trade agreements on a bilateral \n     basis, focus on agreements with countries that have large \n     economies that will provide meaningful export opportunities \n     for United States farmers, workers, and businesses.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/01/25/senate-section/article/S450-1", "month": "01", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S450-S502]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n      By Mr. GRASSLEY (for himself, Mr. Kohl, Mr. Hatch, Mr. Carper, \n        Mr. Frist, Mr. Chafee, Mr. Dodd, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. Hagel, Mr. \n        Kyl, Ms. Landrieu, Mrs. Lincoln, Mr. Lugar, Mr. McConnell, Mr. \n        Schumer, Mr. Thune, Mr. Vitter, Mr. Voinovich, Mr. Lott, Mr. \n        Alexander, Ms. Snowe, Mr. Sessions, Mr. DeMint, Mr. Lieberman, \n        Mr. Martinez, and Mr. Ensign):\n  S. 5. A bill to amend the procedures that apply to consideration of \ninterstate class actions to assure fairer outcomes for class members \nand defendants, and for other purposes; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today to join Senators Grassley, \nHatch, Carper, and many others in introducing the Class Action Fairness \nAct of 2005. This legislation addresses the continuing problems in \nclass action litigation, particularly unfair and abusive settlements \nthat shortchange consumers across America.\n  The time for this bill has come. We have worked together on a \nbipartisan basis on this legislation in past Congresses. In fact, \nversions of this bill have passed the House of Representatives on two \noccasions in the past. In the Senate, we passed this bill through the \nJudiciary Committee in each of the last two Congresses and came within \none vote of gaining cloture on the bill.\n  We worked successfully to substantially improve this bill during the \nlast Congress. As a result of the interest of Senators Feinstein, Dodd, \nSchumer and Landrieu, we have changed the bill in important ways. Now, \nonly cases that are truly national in scope will be tried primarily in \nthe Federal courts. Cases that primarily involve people from only one \nState and that interpret State law will remain in State court. These \nchanges will ensure that class action cases are handled efficiently and \nin the appropriate venues and that no case that has merit will be \nturned away.\n  We have a simple story to tell. Consumers are too often getting the \nshort end of the stick in class action cases, recovering coupons or \npocket change, while their lawyers reap millions. Many of these complex \nclass action cases proceed exactly as we would hope. Injured parties, \nrepresented by strong advocates, get their day in court or reach a \npositive settlement that is good for the parties and handled well by \ntheir attorney.\n  Unfortunately, this is not how it always works. Rather, more and more \nfrequently, some are taking advantage of the system and, as a result, \nconsumers are getting the short end of the stick, recovering coupons or \npocket change, while the real reward is going to others. The Washington \nPost put it clearly, ``no portion of the American civil justice system \nis more of a mess than the world of class actions.''\n  Our remedy is straightforward. Consumers deserve notices that are \nwritten in plain English so they can understand their rights and \nresponsibilities in the lawsuit. Too many of the class action notices \nare designed to be impossible to comprehend. Further, if the cases are \nsettled, the notice to the class members must clearly describe the \nterms of the settlement, the benefits to each plaintiff and a summary \nof the attorneys' fees in the case and how they were calculated. We are \ngrateful that the Federal Judicial Conference has adopted our idea and \nhas already begun to improve the notices provided to class action \nplaintiffs.\n  Second, State attorneys general should be notified of proposed class \naction settlements to stop abusive cases if they want. This encourages \na neutral third party to weigh in on whether a settlement is fair and \nto alert the court if they do not believe that it is. The Attorney \nGeneral review is an extra layer of security for the plaintiffs and is \ndesigned to ensure that abusive settlements are not approved without a \ncritical review by one or more experts.\n  Third, a class action consumer bill of rights will help limit coupon \nor other unfair settlements.\n  Finally, we allow many class action lawsuits to be removed to Federal \ncourt. This is only common sense. These are national cases affecting \nconsumers in 50 States. If the court rules were being drafted today, \nthese are exactly the types of cases which we would want and expect to \nbe tried in Federal court.\n  Stories of nightmare class action settlements that affect consumers \naround the country are all too frequent. For example, a suit against \nBlockbuster video yielded dollar off coupons for future video rentals \nfor the plaintiffs while their attorneys collected $9.25 million. In \nCalifornia State court, a class of 40 million consumers received $13 \nrebates on their next purchase of a computer or monitor--in other words \nthey had to purchase hundreds of dollars more of the defendants' \nproduct to redeem the coupons. In essence, the\n\n[[Page S451]]\n\nplaintiffs received nothing, while their attorneys took almost $6 \nmillion in legal fees. We could list many, many more examples, but let \nme discuss just one more case that is almost too strange to believe.\n  I am speaking about the Bank of Boston class action suit and the \noutrageous case of Martha Preston from Baraboo, WI. She was an unnamed \nclass member of a class action lawsuit against her mortgage company \nthat ended in a settlement. The plaintiffs' lawyers were supposed to \nrepresent her. Instead, the settlement that they negotiated for her was \na bad joke. She received $4 and change in the lawsuit, while her \nattorneys pocketed $8 million.\n  Yet, the huge sums her attorneys received were not the worst of the \nstory. Soon after receiving her $4, Ms. Preston discovered that her \nlawyers took $80, 20 times her recovery, from her escrow account to \nhelp pay their fees. Naturally shocked, she and the other plaintiffs \nsued the lawyers who quickly turned around and sued her in Alabama, a \nState she had never visited, for $25 million. Not only was she $75 \npoorer for her class action experience, but she also had to defend \nherself against a $25 million suit by the very people who took \nadvantage of her in the first place.\n  No one can argue with a straight face that the class action process \nis not in serious need of reform.\n  Comprehensive studies support the anecdotes we have discussed. For \nexample, a study on the class action problem by the Manhattan Institute \ndemonstrates that class action cases are being brought \ndisproportionately in a few counties where plaintiffs expect to be able \nto take advantage of lax certification rules.\n  The study focused on three county courts--Madison County, IL; \nJefferson County, TX; and Palm Beach County, FL--that have seen a steep \nrise in class action filings over the last several years that seems \ndisproportional to their populations. They found that rural Madison \nCounty, IL, ranked third nationwide, after Los Angeles County, CA, and \nCook County, IL, in the estimated number of class actions filed each \nyear, whereas rural Jefferson County and Palm Beach County ranked \neighth and ninth, respectively. As plaintiff attorneys found that \nMadison County was a welcoming host, the number of class action suits \nfiled there rose 1,850 percent between 1998 and 2000.\n  Another trend evident in the research was the use of ``cut-and-\npaste'' complaints in which plaintiffs'' attorneys file a number of \nsuits against different defendants in the same industry challenging \nstandard industry practices. For example, in one situation, six law \nfirms filed nine nearly identical class actions in Madison County in \nthe same week alleging that the automobile insurance industry is \ndefrauding Americans in the way that they calculate claims rates for \ntotaled vehicles.\n  The system is not working as intended and needs to be fixed. The way \nto fix it is to move more of these cases currently being brought in \nsmall State courts like Madison County, IL, to Federal court.\n  The Federal courts are better venues for class actions for a variety \nof reasons articulated clearly in a RAND study. RAND proposed three \nprimary explanations why these cases should be in Federal court. \n``First, federal judges scrutinize class action allegations more \nstrictly than state judges, and deny certification in situations where \na state judge might grant it improperly. Second, state judges may not \nhave adequate resources to oversee and manage class actions with a \nnational scope. Finally, if a single judge is to be charged with \ndeciding what law will apply in a multistate class action, it is more \nappropriate that this take place in federal court than in state \ncourt.''\n  We all know that class actions can result in significant and \nimportant benefits for class members and society, and that most class \nlawyers and most State courts are acting responsibly. Class actions \nhave been used to desegregate racially divided schools, to obtain \nredress for victims of employment discrimination, and to compensate \nindividuals exposed to toxic chemicals or defective products. Class \nactions increase access to our civil justice system because they enable \npeople to pursue claims that collectively would otherwise be too \nexpensive to litigate.\n  The difficulty in any effort to improve a basically good system is \nweeding out the abuses without causing undue damage. The legislation we \npropose attempts to do this.\n  Let me emphasize the limited scope of this legislation. We do not \nclose the courthouse door to any class action. We do not require that \nState attorneys general do anything with the notice they receive. We do \nnot deny reasonable fees for class lawyers. And we do not mandate that \nevery class action be brought in Federal court. Instead, we simply \npromote closer and fairer scrutiny of class actions and class \nsettlements.\n  Right now, people across the country can be dragged into lawsuits \nunaware of their rights and unarmed on the legal battlefield. What our \nbill does is give back to regular people their rights and \nrepresentation. This measure may not stop all abuses, but it moves us \nforward. It will help ensure that unsuspecting people like Martha \nPreston don't get ripped off.\n  We believe this is a moderate approach to correct the worst abuses, \nwhile preserving the benefits of class actions. It is both pro-consumer \nand pro-defendant. We believe it will make a difference.\n      By Ms. COLLINS (for herself, Mr. Carper, Mr. Voinovich, Mr. \n        Feingold, Mr. Akaka, and Mr. Lieberman):\n  S. 21. A bill to provide for homeland security grant coordination and \nsimplification, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Homeland \nSecurity and Governmental Affairs.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President I rise with my good friend Senator Carper \nto offer the Homeland Security Grant Enhancement Act in order to \nstreamline and strengthen the way we help our States, communities, and \nfirst responders protect our homeland.\n  Three years ago, the Senate spent nearly three months on the Homeland \nSecurity Act, yet the law contains virtually no guidance on how the \nDepartment is to assist State and local governments with their homeland \nsecurity needs. In fact, the 187-page Homeland Security Act mentions \nthe issue of grants to first responders in but a single paragraph. The \ndecisions on how Federal dollars should be spent or how much money \nshould be allocated to whom were left for another day. That day has \ncome.\n  During the 108th Congress, Senator Carper and I introduced similar \nlegislation to more than double the proportion of homeland Security \nfunding distributed based on risk, while also helping all States \nachieve a baseline level of preparedness and an ability to respond. The \nSenate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs held \nthree hearings at which first responders, State and local officials, \nand Secretary Ridge all testified that the grant distribution system \nneeds fixing. The 9/11 Commission also urged that the system be \nchanged. It is therefore time for Congress to finally address this \ncritical issue.\n  The bill that we introduce today is identical to legislation that \npassed the Senate by voice-vote as an amendment to the Intelligence \nreform bill at the end of the last Congress.\n  That measure was supported by Senators from big States--like Michigan \nand Ohio--and small States like Maine, Delaware and Connecticut. The \nwide breadth of support in the Senate is indicative of the fact that \nthis bill takes a balanced approach to homeland security funding.\n  It recognizes that threat-based funding is a critical part of \nhomeland security funding. It also recognizes that first responders in \nevery State and territory stand at the front lines of securing the \nhomeland.\n  This legislation will also coordinate government-wide homeland \nsecurity funding by promoting one-stop-shopping for homeland security \nfunding opportunities. It would establish an information clearinghouse \nto assist first responders and State and local governments in accessing \nhomeland security grant information and other resources within the new \ndepartment. This clearinghouse will improve access to homeland security \ngrant information, coordinate technical assistance for vulnerability \nand threat assessments, provide information regarding homeland security \nbest practices, and compile information regarding homeland security \nequipment purchased with Federal funds.\n\n[[Page S452]]\n\n  Establishment of these programs will mean first responders can spend \nmore time training to save lives and less-time filling out paper work. \nThe inflexible structure of past homeland security funding, along with \nshifting federal requirements and increasing amounts of paperwork, \nposes a number of challenges to State and local governments as they \nattempt to provide these funds to first responders.\n  The legislation would provide greater flexibility in the use of those \nunspent funds. It would give the Department of Homeland Security \nflexibility to allow States, via a wavier from the Secretary, to use \nfunds from one category, such as training, for another purpose, such as \npurchasing equipment.\n  The Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs \nwill act promptly to mark-up and report this important measure to \nestablish a streamlined, efficient, and fair method for homeland \nsecurity funds to get into the hands of first responders.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. STEVENS (for himself, Mr. Inouye, Ms. Snowe, and Mr. \n        Dodd):\n  S. 39. A bill to establish a coordinated national ocean exploration \nprogram within the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration; to \nthe Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I introduce today S. 39, the ``National \nOcean Exploration Program Act'' to expand exploration and knowledge of \nour Nation's oceans. When I introduced this bill in the 108th Congress, \nSenator Hollings and Senator Inouye were original co-sponsors. Senator \nHollings has left this body, but he worked closely with Senator Inouye \nand me on this bill and we thank him for his contributions to ocean \npolicy. Senators Snowe and Dodd would like to be added as original co-\nsponsors of this bill.\n  Senator Inouye and I introduce this legislation today in an effort to \nincrease and coordinate research and exploration of our Nation's \noceans. Alaska and Hawaii are uniquely dependent on the ocean for food, \nemployment, recreation, and the delivery of goods. However, \napproximately 95 percent of the ocean floor remains unexplored, much of \nit located in the polar latitudes and the southern ocean. This \nlegislation will advance ocean exploration and increase funding for \ngreater research.\n  In its final report, the U.S. Commission on Ocean Policy recommended \nthat the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the \nNational Science Foundation lead an expanded National Ocean Exploration \nProgram. This legislation will accomplish that goal.\n  The National Exploration Program expands ocean exploration. Through \nthis program we will determine whether there are new marine substances \nwith potential therapeutic benefits; study unique marine ecosystems, \norganisms and the geology of the world's oceans; and maximize ocean \nresearch by integrating multiple scientific disciplines in the ocean \nscience community.\n  The program will focus on remote ocean research and exploration. \nSpecifically, research will be conducted on hydrothermal vents \ncommunities and seamounts. Increased research in these areas, where \norganisms exist in highly toxic environments, should yield significant \nscientific and medical breakthroughs.\n  Decades ago I help Oscar Dyson, a great Alaska fisherman, secure a \nsmall grant to explore the North Pacific. With that grant he discovered \na great number of marine species that are now considered vital to the \nNorth Pacific. It is my hope that the National Ocean Exploration \nProgram Act will be the catalyst for that type of ocean exploration and \ndiscovery.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 39\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``National Ocean Exploration \n     Program Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. ESTABLISHMENT.\n\n       The Secretary of Commerce, through the Administrator of the \n     National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, shall, in \n     consultation with the National Science Foundation and other \n     appropriate Federal agencies, establish a coordinated \n     national ocean exploration program within the National \n     Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.\n\n     SEC. 3. PURPOSES.\n\n       The purposes of the program are the following:\n       (1) To explore the physical, biological, chemical, \n     geological, archaeological, temporal, and other related \n     characteristics of the oceans to benefit, inform, and inspire \n     the American people.\n       (2) To create missions and scientific activities of \n     discovery that will improve our understanding, appreciation, \n     and stewardship of the unique marine ecosystems, organisms, \n     chemistry, and geology of the world's oceans, and to enhance \n     knowledge of submerged maritime historical and archaeological \n     sites.\n       (3) To facilitate discovery of marine natural products from \n     these ecosystems that may have potential beneficial uses, \n     including those that may help combat disease or provide \n     therapeutic benefits.\n       (4) To communicate such discoveries and knowledge to \n     policymakers, regulators, researchers, educators, and \n     interested nongovernmental entities in order to support \n     policy decisions and to spur additional scientific research \n     and development.\n       (5) To maximize effectiveness by integrating multiple \n     scientific disciplines, employing the diverse resources of \n     the ocean science community, and making ocean exploration \n     data and information available in a timely and consistent \n     manner.\n       (6) To achieve heightened education, environmental \n     literacy, public understanding and appreciation of the \n     oceans.\n\n     SEC. 4. AUTHORITIES.\n\n       In carrying out the program the Administrator of the \n     National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration shall--\n       (1) conduct interdisciplinary exploration voyages or other \n     scientific activities in conjunction with other Federal \n     agencies or academic or educational institutions, to survey \n     little known areas of the marine environment, inventory, \n     observe, and assess living and nonliving marine resources, \n     and report such findings;\n       (2) give priority attention to deep ocean regions, with a \n     focus on surveying deep water marine systems that hold \n     potential for important scientific and medical discoveries, \n     such as hydrothermal vent communities and seamounts;\n       (3) conduct scientific voyages to locate, define, and \n     document historic shipwrecks, submerged sites, and other \n     ocean exploration activities that combine archaeology and \n     oceanographic sciences;\n       (4) develop, in consultation with the National Science \n     Foundation, a transparent process for reviewing and approving \n     proposals for activities to be conducted under this program;\n       (5) enhance the technical capability of the United States \n     marine science community by promoting the development of \n     improved oceanographic research, communication, navigation, \n     and data collection systems, as well as underwater platforms \n     and sensors;\n       (6) conduct public education and outreach activities that \n     improve the public understanding of ocean science, resources, \n     and processes, in conjunction with relevant educational \n     programs of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric \n     Administration, the National Science Foundation, and other \n     agencies;\n       (7) accept donations of property, data, and equipment to be \n     applied for the purpose of exploring the oceans or increasing \n     knowledge of the oceans; and\n       (8) establish an ocean exploration forum to encourage \n     partnerships and promote communication among experts and \n     other stakeholders in order to enhance the scientific and \n     technical expertise and relevance of the national program.\n\n     SEC. 5. EXPLORATION TECHNOLOGY AND INFRASTRUCTURE TASK FORCE.\n\n       The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, in \n     coordination with the National Aeronautics and Space \n     Administration, the U.S. Geological Survey, Office of Naval \n     Research, and relevant governmental, non-governmental, \n     academic, and other experts, shall convene an ocean \n     technology and infrastructure task force to develop and \n     implement a strategy--\n       (1) to facilitate transfer of new exploration technology to \n     the program;\n       (2) to improve availability of communications \n     infrastructure, including satellite capabilities, to the \n     program;\n       (3) to develop an integrated, workable and comprehensive \n     data management information processing system that will make \n     information on unique and significant features obtained by \n     the program available for research and management purposes; \n     and\n       (4) to encourage cost-sharing partnerships with \n     governmental and non-governmental entities that will assist \n     in transferring exploration technology and technical \n     expertise to the program.\n\n     SEC. 6. INTERAGENCY FINANCING.\n\n       The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the \n     National Science Foundation, and other Federal agencies \n     involved in the program, are authorized to participate in \n     interagency financing and share, transfer, receive and spend \n     funds appropriated to any federal participant the program for \n     the purposes of carrying out any administrative or \n     programmatic project or activity under this section. Funds \n     may be transferred among such departments and agencies \n     through a appropriate instrument that specifies the\n\n[[Page S453]]\n\n     goods, services, or space being acquired from another Federal \n     participant and the costs of the same.\n\n     SEC. 7. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.\n\n       There are authorized to be appropriated to the National \n     Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to carry out the \n     program--\n       (1) $45,000,000 for each of fiscal years 2006 through 2011; \n     and\n       (2) $55,000,000 for each of fiscal years 2012 through 2017.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. NELSON of Florida (for himself, Mr. Martinez, Mr. \n        Sessions, and Mr. Allen):\n  S. 145. A bill to amend title 10, United States Code, to require the \nnaval forces of the Navy to include not less than 12 operational \naircraft carriers; to the Committee on Armed Services.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I feel strongly that any \nreduction in the size of the Nation's carrier fleet is not in the best \ninterest of national security. Therefore, I am introducing legislation \nto require the Navy to include not less than 12 operational aircraft \ncarriers. I am pleased to be joined by my co-sponsors, Senator \nMartinez, Senator Allen, and Senator Sessions.\n  America's aircraft carrier fleet has played and continues to play a \ncritical role in the global war on terrorism. Carrier based strike, \nelectronic warfare, and reconnaissance aircraft, and even more \nimportantly, special operations forces have provided the most \nresponsive and capable support throughout operations in the Gulf \nregion. Nothing has changed in the strategic environment to suggest \nthat America is more, or as secure with eleven carriers as we are with \ntwelve. The operational tempo of our aircraft carriers has never been \nhigher and it is hard to imagine that it will slow any time soon.\n  The range of strategic threats and opportunities that face the Nation \nat this moment in the war on terror does not support the idea that we \ncan reduce our carrier fleet without creating significant and \nunavoidable risk to our global reach and sustainability. I urge my \ncolleagues to join with us to ensure the Navy's global flexibility and \nstriking power. Cutting our carrier fleet now increases strategic risk \nand reduces our combat power and capability, all for relatively small \nbudgetary savings.\n  I look forward to working with Chairman Warner and Senator Levin to \ngain the Armed Services Committee's approval of this legislation, and \nits passage by the full Senate. Identical legislation is being \nintroduced in the House by Representative Ander Crenshaw, and I look \nforward to working with my colleagues in both houses to see that this \nvital national security legislation reaches the President's desk.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 145\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend title 38, United States Code, to deem certain \nservice in the organized military forces of the Government of the \nCommonwealth of the Philippines and the Philippine Scouts to have been \nactive service for purposes of benefits under programs administered by \nthe Secretary of Veterans Affairs; to the Committee on Veterans' \nAffairs.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, many of you know of my continued support \nand advocacy on the importance of addressing the plight of Filipino \nWorld War II veterans. As an American, I believe the treatment of \nFilipino World War II veterans is bleak and shameful. The Philippines \nbecame a United States possession in 1898, when it was ceded by Spain, \nfollowing the Spanish-American War. In 1934, the Congress enacted the \nPhilippine Independence Act, Public Law 73-127, which provided a 10-\nyear time frame for the independence of the Philippines. Between 1934 \nand final independence in 1946, the United States retained certain \npowers over the Philippines including the right to call military forces \norganized by the newly-formed Commonwealth government into the service \nof the United States Armed Forces.\n  The Commonwealth Army of the Philippines was called to serve with the \nUnited States Armed Forces in the Far East during World War II under \nPresident Roosevelt's July 26, 1941 military order. The Filipinos who \nserved were entitled to full veterans' benefits by reason of their \nactive service with our armed forces. Hundreds were wounded in battle \nand many hundreds more died in battle. Shortly after Japan's surrender, \nthe Congress enacted the Armed Forces Voluntary Recruitment Act of 1945 \nfor the purpose of sending Filipino troops to occupy enemy lands, and \nto oversee military installations at various overseas locations. These \ntroops were authorized to receive pay and allowances for services \nperformed throughout the Western Pacific. Although hostilities had \nceased, wartime service of these troops continued as a matter of law \nuntil the end of 1946.\n  Despite all of their sacrifices, on February 18, 1946, the Congress \npassed the Rescission Act of 1946, now codified as Section 107 of Title \n38 of the United States Code. The 1946 Act deemed that the service \nperformed by these Filipino veterans would not be recognized as \n``active service'' for the purpose of any U.S. law conferring ``rights, \nprivileges, or benefits.'' Accordingly, Section 107 denied Filipino \nveterans access to health care, particularly for non-service-connected \ndisabilities, and pension benefits. Section 107 also limited service-\nconnected disability and death compensation for Filipino veterans to 50 \npercent of what their American counterparts receive.\n  On May 27, 1946, the Congress enacted the Second Supplemental Surplus \nAppropriations Rescission Act, which duplicated the language that had \neliminated Filipino veterans' benefits under the First Rescission Act. \nThus, Filipino veterans who fought in the service of the United States \nduring World War II have been precluded from receiving most of the \nveterans' benefits that had been available to them before 1946, and \nthat are available to all other veterans of our armed forces regardless \nof race, national origin, or citizenship status.\n  The Filipino Veterans Equity Act, which I introduce today, would \nrestore the benefits due to these veterans by granting full recognition \nof service for the sacrifices they made during World War II. These \nbenefits include veterans health care, service-connected disability \ncompensation, non-service connected disability compensation, dependent \nindemnity compensation, death pension, and full burial benefits.\n  Throughout the years, I have sponsored several measures to rectify \nthe lack of appreciation America has shown to these gallant men and \nwomen who stood in harm's way with our American soldiers and fought the \ncommon enemy during World War II. It is time that we as a Nation, \nrecognize our long-standing history and friendship with the \nPhilippines. Of the 120,000 that served in the Commonwealth Army during \nWorld War II, there are approximately 60,000 Filipino veterans \ncurrently residing in the United States and the Philippines. According \nto the Department of Veterans Affairs, the Filipino veteran population \nis expected to decrease to approximately 20,000 or roughly one-third of \nthe current population by 2010.\n  Heroes should never be forgotten or ignored; let us not turn our \nbacks on those who sacrificed so much. Let us instead work to repay all \nof these brave men for their sacrifices by providing them the veterans' \nbenefits they deserve.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of my bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 146\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n[[Page S454]]\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Filipino Veterans Equity Act \n     of 2005''.\n\n     SEC. 2.

A bill to express the policy of the United State regarding \nthe United States relationship with Native Hawaiians and to provide a \nprocess for the recognition by the United States of the Native Hawaiian \ngoverning entity; to the Committee on Indian Affairs.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise today with the senior Senator from \nHawaii to introduce the Native Hawaiian Government Reorganization Act \nof 2005. This is bipartisan legislation that we have been working on \nwith our colleagues in Hawaii's Congressional delegation for the past 6 \nyears. During the past 2 years, we have worked closely with Hawaii's \nGovernor, Linda Lingle, Hawaii's first Republican governor in 40 years, \nto get this legislation enacted. We have also worked closely with the \nHawaii State legislature which has passed two resolutions unanimously \nin support of Federal Recognition for Native Hawaiians. I mention this, \nto underscore the fact that this is bipartisan legislation.\n  The Native Hawaiian Government Reorganization Act of 2005 does three \nthings:\n  (1) It authorizes the Office of Native Hawaiian Relations in the \nDepartment of the Interior to serve as a liaison between Native \nHawaiians and the federal government. Funding for Native Hawaiian \nprograms currently administered by the Departments of Health and Human \nServices, HHS, Education, or Housing and Urban Development, HUD, would \ncontinue to be administered by those agencies.\n  (2) It establishes the Native Hawaiian Interagency Coordinating \nGroup--an interagency group to be composed of federal officials from \nagencies which administer Native Hawaiian programs and services. Many \nare not aware that Native Hawaiians have their own programs which are \ncurrently administered by different agencies in the Federal Government. \nThis group would encourage communication and collaboration between the \nFederal agencies working with Native Hawaiians.\n  (3) It establishes a process for the reorganization of the Native \nHawaiian governing entity. While Congress has traditionally treated \nNative Hawaiians in a manner parallel to American Indians and Alaska \nNatives, the formal policy of self-governance and self determination \nhas not been extended to Native Hawaiians. The bill establishes a \nprocess for the reorganization of the Native Hawaiian governing entity \nfor the purposes of Federal recognition. The bill itself does not \nextend Federal recognition--it authorizes the process for Federal \nrecognition.\n  Following recognition of the Native Hawaiian government, negotiations \nwill ensue between the Native Hawaiian governing entity and Federal and \nState Governments over matters such as the transfer of lands and \nnatural resources; the exercise of governmental authority over any \ntransferred lands, natural resources and other assets, including land \nuse; the exercise of civil and criminal jurisdiction, and the \ndelegation of governmental powers and authorities to the Native \nHawaiian governing entity by the Federal and State Governments. This \nreflects the cooperation between the Federal and State governments and \nthe Native Hawaiian governing entity. It also reflects a new paradigm \nwhere recognition provides the governing entity with a seat at the \ntable to negotiate such matters.\n  The bill will not diminish funding for American Indians and Alaska \nNatives because Native Hawaiians have their own education, health and \nhousing programs which have been separately funded since their creation \nin 1988.\n  Finally, the bill does not authorize gaming in Hawaii.\n  Some have characterized this bill as race-based legislation. As \nindigenous peoples, Native Hawaiians never relinquished their inherent \nrights to sovereignty. We were a government that was overthrown. While \nthe history of the Native Hawaiian government ended in 1893 with great \nemotion and despair, inspired by the dignity and grace of Queen \nLiliuokalani, Native Hawaiians have preserved their culture, tradition, \nsubsistence rights, language, and distinct communities. We have tried \nto hold on to our homeland. Hawaii, for us, is our homeland.\n  I am Native Hawaiian and Chinese. I appreciate the culture and \nethnicity of my ancestors. I can trace my Chinese roots back to Fukien \nProvince in China. My Native Hawaiian roots, however, are in Hawaii \nbecause it is our Hawaiian homeland.\n  My Chinese ancestors came to Hawaii to build a better life. My Native \nHawaiian grandparents and parents had America come into their homeland \nand forever change their lives. This is a profound difference.\n  I am proud to be an American, and I am proud to have served my \ncountry in the military. As long as Hawaii is a part of the United \nStates, however, I believe the United States must fulfill its \nresponsibility to Hawaii's indigenous peoples. I believe it is \nimperative to clarify the existing legal and political relationship \nbetween the United States and Native Hawaiians by providing Native \nHawaiians with Federal recognition for the purposes of a government-to-\ngovernment relationship. Therefore, because this legislation is based \non the political and legal relationship between the United States and \nits indigenous peoples, which has been upheld for many, many years, by \nthe United States Supreme Court, based on the Indian Commerce Clause, I \nstrenuously disagree with the mischaracterization of this legislation \nas race-based.\n  Why is this bill so important? This bill is critical for the people \nof Hawaii because of the monumental step forward it provides for \nHawaii's indigenous peoples. As many of my colleagues know, the Kingdom \nof Hawaii was overthrown in 1893 with the assistance of agents from the \nUnited States. In 1993, we enacted Public Law 103-150, commonly \nreferred to as the Apology Resolution, which acknowledged the illegal \noverthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii and the deprivation of the rights of \nNative Hawaiians to self determination. The Apology Resolution \ncommitted the United States to acknowledge the ramifications of the \noverthrow in order to provide a proper foundation of reconciliation \nbetween the United States and the Native Hawaiian people.\n  This bill provides a step forward in the process of reconciliation. \nThe bill establishes the structure for Native Hawaiians and non-Native \nHawaiians to discuss longstanding issues resulting from the overthrow \nof the Kingdom of Hawaii. The structure is the negotiation process \nbetween the federally recognized Native Hawaiian government and the \nFederal and State governments that I referred to earlier in my \nstatement.\n  This discussion has been assiduously avoided because no one has known \nhow to address or deal with the emotions that are involved when these \nmatters are discussed. There has been no structured process. Instead, \nthere has been fear as to what the discussion would entail, causing \npeople to avoid and shirk the issues. Such behavior has led\n\n[[Page S455]]\n\nto high levels of anger and frustration as well as misunderstanding \nbetween Native Hawaiians and non-Native Hawaiians.\n  As a young child, I was discouraged from speaking Hawaiian because I \nwas told that I needed to succeed in the Western world. My parents \nwitnessed the overthrow and lived during a time when all things \nHawaiian, including language, which they both spoke fluently, hula, \ncustom, and tradition, were viewed unfavorably and discouraged. I, \ntherefore, was discouraged from speaking the language and practicing \nHawaiian customs and tradition. My experience mirrors that of my \ngeneration of Hawaiians.\n  My generation learned to accept what was ingrained into us by our \nparents, and while we were concerned about the longstanding issues \nresulting from the overthrow dealing with political status and lands, \nwe were told not to ``make waves'' by addressing these matters. My \nchildren, however, have had the advantage of growing up during the \nHawaiian renaissance, a period of revival for Hawaiian language, \ncustom, and tradition. My grandchildren, benefitting from this revival, \ncan speak Hawaiian and know so much about our history.\n  It is this generation, however, that is growing impatient with the \nlack of progress in efforts to resolve longstanding issues. It is this \ngeneration that does not understand why we have not discussed these \nmatters. It is this generation that cannot believe that we, as Native \nHawaiians, have let the situation continue for 110 years.\n  It is an active minority within this generation, spurred by \nfrustration and sadness, that embraces independence from the United \nStates.\n  It is for this generation that I bring this bill forward to ensure \nthat there is a structured process to address these issues.\n  My point is that Hawaii's people, both Native Hawaiians and non-\nNative Hawaiians, are no longer willing to pretend that the \nlongstanding issues resulting from the overthrow do not exist. We need \nthe structured process that this bill provides, first in reorganizing \nthe Native Hawaiian governing entity, and second by providing that \nentity with the opportunity to negotiate and resolve issues with the \nFederal and State governments to alleviate the growing mistrust, \nmisunderstanding, anger, and frustration about these matters in Hawaii. \nThis can only be done through a government-to-government relationship.\n  This bill is of significant importance in Hawaii. It has no impact on \nany of the other states. Hawaii's entire Congressional delegation \nsupports this legislation. Our Governor, the first Republican to be \nelected in 40 years, supports this legislation. Indeed, it is her \nNumber One Federal priority. The Hawaii State Legislature supports this \nlegislation. And most importantly, a clear majority of the Native \nHawaiian people and the people of Hawaii support this legislation.\n  I ask you to stand with me and my esteemed friend, Hawaii's revered \nsenior Senator, our two House members, our Governor, the Hawaii State \nlegislature, and the people of Hawaii to enact this critical measure \nfor my state.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of my bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of \nthe bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 147\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) the Constitution vests Congress with the authority to \n     address the conditions of the indigenous, native people of \n     the United States;\n       (2) Native Hawaiians, the native people of the Hawaiian \n     archipelago that is now part of the United States, are \n     indigenous, native people of the United States;\n       (3) the United States has a special political and legal \n     responsibility to promote the welfare of the native people of \n     the United States, including Native Hawaiians;\n       (4) under the treaty making power of the United States, \n     Congress exercised its constitutional authority to confirm \n     treaties between the United States and the Kingdom of Hawaii, \n     and from 1826 until 1893, the United States--\n       (A) recognized the sovereignty of the Kingdom of Hawaii;\n       (B) accorded full diplomatic recognition to the Kingdom of \n     Hawaii; and\n       (C) entered into treaties and conventions with the Kingdom \n     of Hawaii to govern commerce and navigation in 1826, 1842, \n     1849, 1875, and 1887;\n       (5) pursuant to the Hawaiian Homes Commission Act, 1920 (42 \n     Stat. 108, chapter 42), the United States set aside \n     approximately 203,500 acres of land to address the conditions \n     of Native Hawaiians in the Federal territory that later \n     became the State of Hawaii;\n       (6) by setting aside 203,500 acres of land for Native \n     Hawaiian homesteads and farms, the Hawaiian Homes Commission \n     Act assists the members of the Native Hawaiian community in \n     maintaining distinct native settlements throughout the State \n     of Hawaii;\n       (7) approximately 6,800 Native Hawaiian families reside on \n     the Hawaiian Home Lands and approximately 18,000 Native \n     Hawaiians who are eligible to reside on the Hawaiian Home \n     Lands are on a waiting list to receive assignments of \n     Hawaiian Home Lands;\n       (8)(A) in 1959, as part of the compact with the United \n     States admitting Hawaii into the Union, Congress established \n     a public trust (commonly known as the ``ceded lands trust''), \n     for 5 purposes, 1 of which is the betterment of the \n     conditions of Native Hawaiians;\n       (B) the public trust consists of lands, including submerged \n     lands, natural resources, and the revenues derived from the \n     lands; and\n       (C) the assets of this public trust have never been \n     completely inventoried or segregated;\n       (9) Native Hawaiians have continuously sought access to the \n     ceded lands in order to establish and maintain native \n     settlements and distinct native communities throughout the \n     State;\n       (10) the Hawaiian Home Lands and other ceded lands provide \n     an important foundation for the ability of the Native \n     Hawaiian community to maintain the practice of Native \n     Hawaiian culture, language, and traditions, and for the \n     survival and economic self-sufficiency of the Native Hawaiian \n     people;\n       (11) Native Hawaiians continue to maintain other distinctly \n     native areas in Hawaii;\n       (12) on November 23, 1993, Public Law 103-150 (107 Stat. \n     1510) (commonly known as the ``Apology Resolution'') was \n     enacted into law, extending an apology on behalf of the \n     United States to the native people of Hawaii for the United \n     States' role in the overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii;\n       (13) the Apology Resolution acknowledges that the overthrow \n     of the Kingdom of Hawaii occurred with the active \n     participation of agents and citizens of the United States and \n     further acknowledges that the Native Hawaiian people never \n     directly relinquished to the United States their claims to \n     their inherent sovereignty as a people over their national \n     lands, either through the Kingdom of Hawaii or through a \n     plebiscite or referendum;\n       (14) the Apology Resolution expresses the commitment of \n     Congress and the President--\n       (A) to acknowledge the ramifications of the overthrow of \n     the Kingdom of Hawaii;\n       (B) to support reconciliation efforts between the United \n     States and Native Hawaiians; and\n       (C) to consult with Native Hawaiians on the reconciliation \n     process as called for in the Apology Resolution;\n       (15) despite the overthrow of the government of the Kingdom \n     of Hawaii, Native Hawaiians have continued to maintain their \n     separate identity as a distinct native community through \n     cultural, social, and political institutions, and to give \n     expression to their rights as native people to self-\n     determination, self-governance, and economic self-\n     sufficiency;\n       (16) Native Hawaiians have also given expression to their \n     rights as native people to self-determination, self-\n     governance, and economic self-sufficiency--\n       (A) through the provision of governmental services to \n     Native Hawaiians, including the provision of--\n       (i) health care services;\n       (ii) educational programs;\n       (iii) employment and training programs;\n       (iv) economic development assistance programs;\n       (v) children's services;\n       (vi) conservation programs;\n       (vii) fish and wildlife protection;\n       (viii) agricultural programs;\n       (ix) native language immersion programs;\n       (x) native language immersion schools from kindergarten \n     through high school;\n       (xi) college and master's degree programs in native \n     language immersion instruction;\n       (xii) traditional justice programs, and\n       (B) by continuing their efforts to enhance Native Hawaiian \n     self-determination and local control;\n       (17) Native Hawaiians are actively engaged in Native \n     Hawaiian cultural practices, traditional agricultural \n     methods, fishing and subsistence practices, maintenance of \n     cultural use areas and sacred sites, protection of burial \n     sites, and the exercise of their traditional rights to gather \n     medicinal plants and herbs, and food sources;\n       (18) the Native Hawaiian people wish to preserve, develop, \n     and transmit to future generations of Native Hawaiians their \n     lands and Native Hawaiian political and cultural identity in \n     accordance with their traditions, beliefs, customs and \n     practices, language, and social and political institutions, \n     to control\n\n[[Page S456]]\n\n     and manage their own lands, including ceded lands, and to \n     achieve greater self-determination over their own affairs;\n       (19) this Act provides a process within the framework of \n     Federal law for the Native Hawaiian people to exercise their \n     inherent rights as a distinct, indigenous, native community \n     to reorganize a Native Hawaiian governing entity for the \n     purpose of giving expression to their rights as native people \n     to self-determination and self-governance;\n       (20) Congress--\n       (A) has declared that the United States has a special \n     responsibility for the welfare of the native peoples of the \n     United States, including Native Hawaiians;\n       (B) has identified Native Hawaiians as a distinct group of \n     indigenous, native people of the United States within the \n     scope of its authority under the Constitution, and has \n     enacted scores of statutes on their behalf; and\n       (C) has delegated broad authority to the State of Hawaii to \n     administer some of the United States' responsibilities as \n     they relate to the Native Hawaiian people and their lands;\n       (21) the United States has recognized and reaffirmed the \n     special political and legal relationship with the Native \n     Hawaiian people through the enactment of the Act entitled, \n     ``An Act to provide for the admission of the State of Hawaii \n     into the Union'', approved March 18, 1959 (Public Law 86-3; \n     73 Stat. 4), by--\n       (A) ceding to the State of Hawaii title to the public lands \n     formerly held by the United States, and mandating that those \n     lands be held as a public trust for 5 purposes, 1 of which is \n     for the betterment of the conditions of Native Hawaiians; and\n       (B) transferring the United States' responsibility for the \n     administration of the Hawaiian Home Lands to the State of \n     Hawaii, but retaining the authority to enforce the trust, \n     including the exclusive right of the United States to consent \n     to any actions affecting the lands that comprise the corpus \n     of the trust and any amendments to the Hawaiian Homes \n     Commission Act, 1920 (42 Stat. 108, chapter 42) that are \n     enacted by the legislature of the State of Hawaii affecting \n     the beneficiaries under the Act;\n       (22) the United States has continually recognized and \n     reaffirmed that--\n       (A) Native Hawaiians have a cultural, historic, and land-\n     based link to the aboriginal, indigenous, native people who \n     exercised sovereignty over the Hawaiian Islands;\n       (B) Native Hawaiians have never relinquished their claims \n     to sovereignty or their sovereign lands;\n       (C) the United States extends services to Native Hawaiians \n     because of their unique status as the indigenous, native \n     people of a once-sovereign nation with whom the United States \n     has a political and legal relationship;

AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.\n\n       There are authorized to be appropriated such sums as are \n     necessary to carry out this Act.\n\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleague, Senator \nAkaka, as a cosponsor of the Native Hawaiian Government Reorganization \nAct.\n  Having served on the Indian Affairs Committee for the past 27 years, \nI know that most of our colleagues are more familiar with conditions \nand circumstances in Indian country, and naturally, they bring their \nexperience with Indian country to bear in considering this measure, \nwhich has been pending in the Senate for the past six years.\n  Accordingly, Mr. President, I believe it is important that our \ncolleagues understand what this bill seeks to accomplish as well as how \nit differs from legislation affecting Indian country.\n  It is a little known fact that beginning in 1910 and since that time, \nthe\n\n[[Page S459]]\n\nCongress has passed and the President has signed into law over 160 \nFederal laws designed to address the conditions of Native Hawaiians.\n  Thus, Federal laws which authorize the provision of health care, \neducation, housing, and job training and employment services, as well \nas programs to provide for the preservation of the Native Hawaiian \nlanguage, Native language immersion, Native cultural and grave \nprotections and repatriation of Native sacred objects have been in \nplace for decades.\n  The Native Hawaiian programs do not draw upon funding that is \nappropriated for American Indians or Alaska Natives--there are separate \nauthorizations for programs that are administered by different Federal \nagencies--not the Bureau of Indian Affairs or the Indian Health \nService, for instance--and the Native Hawaiian program funds are not \ndrawn from the Interior Appropriations Subcommittee account. Thus, they \nhave no impact on the funding that is provided for the other \nindigenous, native people of the United States.\n  However, unlike the native people residing on the mainland, Native \nHawaiians have not been able to exercise their rights as Native people \nto self-determination or self-governance because their government was \noverthrown on January 17, 1893.\n  This bill would provide a process for the reorganization of the \nNative Hawaiian government and the resumption of a political and legal \nrelationship between that government and the government of the United \nStates.\n  Because the Native Hawaiian government is not an Indian tribe, the \nbody of Federal Indian law that would otherwise customarily apply when \nthe United States extends Federal recognition to an Indian tribal group \ndoes not apply.\n  Thus, the bill provides authority for a process of negotiations \namongst the United States, the State of Hawaii, and the reorganized \nNative Hawaiian government to address such matters as the exercise of \ncivil and criminal jurisdiction by the respective governments, the \ntransfer of land and natural resources and other assets, and the \nexercise of governmental authority over those lands, natural resources \nand other assets.\n  Upon reaching agreement, the U.S. Congress and the legislature of \nState of Hawaii would have to enact legislation implementing the \nagreements of the three governments, including amendments that will \nnecessarily have to be made to existing Federal law, such as the Hawaii \nAdmissions Act and the Hawaiian Homes Commission Act, and to State law, \nincluding amendments to the Hawaii State Constitution, before any of \nthe new governmental relationships and authorities can take effect.\n  That is why concerns which are premised on the manner in which \nFederal Indian law provides for the respective governmental authorities \nof the state governments and Indian tribal governments simply don't \napply in Hawaii.\n  Our state government, both the Governor and the state legislature of \nHawaii, fully support enactment of this measure. They will be at the \ntable with the United States and the Native Hawaiian government to \nshape the relationships amongst governments that will best serve the \nneeds and interests not only of the Native Hawaiian community but those \nof all of the citizens of Hawaii.\n  Mr. President, we have every confidence that consistent with the \nFederal policy of the last 35 years, the restoration of the rights to \nself-determination and self-governance will enable the Native Hawaiian \npeople, as the direct, lineal descendants of the aboriginal, indigenous \nnative people of what has become our nation's fiftieth state, to take \ntheir rightful place in the family of governments that makes up our \nconstitutional system of governance.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. McCAIN (for himself, Mr. Stevens, and Mr. Dorgan):\n  S. 148. A bill to establish a United States Boxing Commission to \nadminister the Act, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nCommerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, today I am pleased to be joined by \nSenators Stevens and Dorgan in introducing the Professional Boxing \nAmendments Act of 2005. This legislation is virtually identical to a \nmeasure approved unanimously by the Senate last year. I remain \ncommitted to moving the Professional Boxing Amendments Act through the \nSenate and I trust that my colleagues will once again vote favorably on \nthis important legislation. Simply put, this legislation would better \nprotect professional boxing from the fraud, corruption, and ineffective \nregulation that have plagued the sport for far too many years, and that \nhave devastated physically and financially many of our Nation's \nprofessional boxers.\n  For almost a decade, Congress has made efforts to improve the sport \nof professional boxing--and for very good reason. With rare exception, \nprofessional boxers come from the lowest rung on our economic ladder. \nThey are the least educated and most exploited athletes in our Nation. \nThe Professional Boxing Safety Act of 1996 and the Muhammad Ali Boxing \nReform Act of 2000 established uniform health and safety standards for \nprofessional boxers, as well as basic protections for boxers against \nthe sometimes coercive, exploitative, and unethical business practices \nof promoters, managers, and sanctioning organizations. But further \naction is needed.\n  The Professional Boxing Amendments Act would strengthen existing \nFederal boxing law by improving the basic health and safety standards \nfor professional boxers, establishing a centralized medical registry to \nbe used by local commissions to protect boxers, reducing the arbitrary \npractices of sanctioning organizations, and enhancing the uniformity \nand basic standards for professional boxing contracts. Most \nimportantly, this legislation would establish a Federal regulatory \nentity to oversee professional boxing and set basic uniform standards \nfor certain aspects of the sport.\n  Current Federal boxing law has improved to some extent the state of \nprofessional boxing. However, I remain concerned, as do many others, \nthat the sport remains at risk. Some State and tribal boxing \ncommissions still to this day do not comply with Federal boxing law, \nand there is still a troubling lack of enforcement of the law by both \nFederal and State officials. Indeed, professional boxing remains the \nonly major sport in the United States that does not have a strong, \ncentralized association, league, or other regulatory body to establish \nand enforce uniform rules and practices. Because a powerful few benefit \ngreatly from the current system of patchwork compliance and enforcement \nof Federal boxing law, a national self-regulating organization--though \npreferable to Federal government oversight--is not a realistic option.\n  Ineffective and inconsistent oversight of professional boxing has \ncontributed to the continuing scandals, controversies, unethical \npractices, and unnecessary deaths in the sport. These problems have led \nmany in professional boxing to conclude that the only solution is an \neffective and accountable Federal boxing commission. The Professional \nBoxing Amendments Act would create such an entity.\n  This bill would establish the United States Boxing Commission (USBC \nor Commission). The Commission would be responsible for protecting the \nhealth, safety, and general interests of professional boxers. The USBC \nwould also be responsible for ensuring uniformity, fairness, and \nintegrity in professional boxing. More specifically, the Commission \nwould administer Federal boxing law and coordinate with other Federal \nregulatory agencies to ensure that this law is enforced; oversee all \nprofessional boxing matches in the United States; and work with the \nboxing industry and local commissions to improve the safety, integrity, \nand professionalism of professional boxing in the United States.\n  The USBC would also license boxers, promoters, managers, and \nsanctioning organizations. The Commission would have the authority to \nrevoke such a license for violations of Federal boxing law, to stop \nunethical or illegal conduct, to protect the health and safety of a \nboxer, or if the revocation is otherwise in the public interest.\n  It is important to state clearly and plainly for the record that the \npurpose of the USBC is not to interfere with the daily operations of \nState and tribal boxing commissions. Instead, the Commission would work \nin consultation\n\n[[Page S460]]\n\nwith local commissions, and it would only exercise its authority when \nreasonable grounds exist for such intervention. In point of fact, the \nProfessional Boxing Amendments Act states explicitly that it would not \nprohibit any boxing commission from exercising any of its powers, \nduties, or functions with respect to the regulation or supervision of \nprofessional boxing to the extent not inconsistent with the provisions \nof Federal boxing law.\n  Let there be no doubt, however, of the very basic and pressing need \nin professional boxing for a Federal boxing commission. The \nestablishment of the USBC would address that need.\n  The problems that plague the sport of professional boxing undermine \nthe credibility of the sport in the eyes of the public--and more \nimportantly--compromise the safety of boxers. The Professional Boxing \nAmendments Act provides an effective approach to curbing these \nproblems. I again urge my colleagues to support this legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 148\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Clean Air Act to reduce emissions from \nelectric powerplants, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nEnvironment and Public Works.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I am both sad and happy to re-introduce \nthe Clean Power Act again with Senators Lieberman and Collins and the \nother 16 cosponsors of the legislation from the last Congress. I am \nhappy that they are all still as committed as I am to the fight to \nreduce pollution and to protect the public's health and to clean up and \nconserve the environment for future generations.\n  I am sad that we have not made more progress in this fight to reduce \nharmful emissions of sulfur dioxides (SOX), nitrogen oxides \n(NOX), mercury, and carbon dioxide from fossil fuel power \nplants. More than 25,000 people are dying prematurely every year \nbecause of fine particulate pollution (PM-2.5) that is \nemitted by power plants in the form of SOX and \nNOX. More than 4,000 people are dying of heart attacks due \nto ozone exposure, part of which is caused by power plant emissions. \nAnd, over 160 million people are living in areas with unhealthy air \nquality.\n  Acid rain continues to fall on our forests and lakes stressing \necosystems in the Northeast and the Southeast. Nearly all the States \nhave some kind of fish consumption warning or advisory due to mercury \ncontamination. And, earlier this week, the chairman of the \nInternational Panel on Climate Change, who was placed at the request of \nthe Bush Administration, said that he personally believes that the \nworld has ``already reached the level of dangerous concentrations of \ncarbon dioxide in the atmosphere.''\n  I am sad because there has been zero movement on multi-pollutant \nlegislation in Congress since this legislation was approved by the \nSenate Committee on Environment and Public Works in June 2002 in \nbasically the same form we are introducing. As Senators may be aware, \nprior to that Committee action, I and Senator Reid before me, sought to \nengage in a bipartisan dialogue to move four pollutant legislation. \nThough the President promised to support such legislation while a \ncandidate in 2000, he reversed himself on that pledge in early 2001.\n  Since early 2001, the Administration refused to negotiate, to \nconsider compromise or even to respond to legitimate requests for \ninformation or timely technical assistance. Instead, they have \nconcentrated their efforts on undermining the Clean Air Act with a \nparticularly focus on gutting New Source Review. They have not shown \nany real interest in legislating in this matter.\n  I am sad that the Administration's general approach has been to go \nbackward before 1990, to undue President Bush Sr.'s legacy. That is not \nwhat the American people want and it is not what they and their \nchildren deserve. They deserve better. They deserve the promise of the \nClean Air Act which is constant improvement and moving forward to \nprovide safe air for everyone to breathe.\n  It is long past time that all power plants in this country meet \nmodern emission performance standards. There is simply no excuse in a \ntechnologically advanced society like ours to have power plants running \non 1930s technology. It should be embarrassing for us all and requires \na swift and concerted effort and significantly more funding than the \nAdministration and Congress have appropriated thus far to maximize the \nuse of all of our energy resources, including coal and renewables, in \nan environmentally friendly way.\n  Simply letting these old dirty dinosaurs keep chugging along is bad \nfor public health and the environment and bad for innovation and the \ndevelopment of new technologies. It is a stone age response to a modern \nday problem.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 150\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I rise today to join Senator Jeffords and \nSenator Lieberman in introducing the Clean Power Act of 2005. This bill \ncloses the loophole that has allowed the dirtiest, most polluting power \nplants in the Nation to escape significant pollution controls for more \nthan 30 years.\n  Maine is one of the most beautiful and pristine States in the Nation. \nIt is also one of the most environmentally responsible States in the \nNation. Maine has fewer emissions of the pollutants that cause smog and \nacid rain than all but a handful of States. It also has one of the \nlowest emissions of carbon dioxide nationwide.\n  Unfortunately, despite the collective environmental commitment of \nboth its citizens and industries, Maine still suffers from air \npollution. Every freshwater lake, river, and stream in Maine is subject \nto a State mercury advisory that warns pregnant women and young \nchildren to limit consumption of fish caught in those waters. Even \nAcadia National Park, one of our most beautiful national parks, \nexperiences days in which visibility is obscured by smog.\n  Where does all this pollution come from? A large part of it comes \nfrom a relatively small number of mostly coal-fired powerplants that \nexploit loopholes to escape the provisions of the Clean Air Act. Coal-\nfired powerplants are the single largest source of air pollution, \nmercury contamination, and greenhouse gas emissions in the Nation. A \nsingle coal-fired powerplant can emit more of the pollutants that cause \nsmog and acid rain than all of the cars, factories, and businesses in \nMaine combined.\n  As the easternmost State in the Nation, Maine is downwind of almost \nall powerplants in the United States. Many of the pollutants emitted by \nthese powerplants--mercury, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and carbon \ndioxide--end up in or over Maine. Airborne mercury falls into our lakes \nand streams, contaminating freshwater fish and threatening our people's \nhealth. Carbon dioxide is causing climate change that threatens to \nalter Maine's delicate ecological balance. Sulfur dioxide and nitrogen \noxides come to Maine in the form of acid rain and smog that damage the \nhealth of our people and the health of our environment.\n  A single powerplant can emit nearly a ton of mercury in a single \nyear. That's equivalent to incinerating over one million mercury \nthermometers and is enough to contaminate millions of acres of \nfreshwater lakes. In contrast, Maine has zero powerplant emissions of \nmercury. This bill would reduce mercury emissions from powerplants by \n90 percent.\n  Powerplants are also one of the largest contributors of greenhouse \ngas emissions in the United States. In fact, powerplants account for 40 \npercent of our carbon dioxide emissions, which scientists believe are \nthe primary cause of man-made global warming.\n  I recently had the opportunity to view firsthand some of the dramatic \nimpacts of global warming. In August, I traveled with Senator McCain \nand several other Senators to the northernmost community in the world. \nWe visited Ny-Alesund on the Norwegian island of Spitsbergen. Located \nat 79  deg.N, Ny-Alesund lies well north of the Arctic Circle and is \nmuch closer to the North Pole than to Oslo, the country's\n\n[[Page S472]]\n\ncapital. It has even served as a starting point for several polar \nexpeditions.\n  Scientists tell us that the global climate is changing more rapidly \nthan at any time since the beginning of civilization. They further \nstate that the region of the globe changing most rapidly is the Arctic. \nThe changes are remarkable and disturbing.\n  In the last 30 years, the Arctic has lost sea-ice cover over an area \n10 times as large as the State of Maine. In the summer, the change is \neven more dramatic, with twice as much ice loss. The ice that remains \nis as much as 40% thinner than it was just a few decades ago. In \naddition to disappearing sea-ice, Arctic glaciers are also rapidly \nretreating. In Ny-Alesund, Senator McCain and I witnessed massive \nblocks of ice falling off glaciers that had already retreated well back \nfrom the shores where they once rested.\n  The Clean Power Act takes an important step in addressing global \nwarming by reducing powerplant emissions of carbon dioxide to 2000 \nlevels by the year 2010. Although doing so will not solve the problem \nof global warming, it is an important first step. In light of the rapid \nwarming in the Arctic and the significance that this warming portends \nfor the rest of the planet, reducing carbon dioxide emissions is a step \nthat we can no longer afford to put off.\n  I am pleased that the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee \nwill be considering clean air legislation in the 109th Congress. The \nJeffords-Collins-Lieberman bill does more to reduce smog, acid rain, \nmercury pollution, and global warming than any other bill. Our bill \nprovides more public health and environmental benefits than any other \nserious proposal, and it provides those benefits sooner.\n  I believe it is time to stop acid rain, free our lakes from mercury \npollution, reduce global warming, and eliminate the smog that drifts in \nto obscure Maine skies and jeopardize our health. I look forward to \nworking with the administration and my colleagues on both sides of the \naisle to provide cleaner air.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to cosponsor Senator Jeffords' \nbill--as I have in the last three Congresses--because I remain \ndedicated to reducing power plant emissions that cause some of the \nNation's--and Maine's--most serious public health and environmental \nproblems.\n  For too many years, coal-burning power plants exempt from emissions \nstandards under the Clean Air Act have created massive pollution \nproblems for the Northeast because whatever spews out of their \nsmokestacks in the Midwest, blows into the Northeast, including my \nState of Maine, giving it the dubious distinction of being at the ``end \nof the tailpipe'', so to speak.\n  The Jeffords' legislation calls for reductions of power plant \nemissions for pollutants that cause smog, soot, respiratory disease; \nacid rain that kills our forests and may be affecting Atlantic salmon \nstreams; mercury that contaminates our lakes, rivers and streams; and \nposes health risks to children and the unborn, and climate \nvariabilities from manmade carbon dioxide emissions that cause severe \nshifts in our weather patterns. Maine currently leads the nation in \nasthma cases per capita, which is not a surprise, but which it can do \nlittle about when nearly 80 percent of the State's dirty air--some days \nas high as 90 percent--is not of their own making but is transported by \nwinds blowing in from the Midwest and Southeast.\n  This bill will dramatically cut aggregate power plant emissions by \n2010 for the four major power plant pollutants: nitrogen oxides \n(NOX), the primary cause of smog, by 71 percent from 2000 \nlevels; sulfur dioxide (SO2), that causes acid rain and \nrespiratory disease, by 81 percent from 2000 levels; mercury (Hg), \nwhich poisons our lakes and rivers, causing fish to be unfit for human \nconsumption, through a 90 percent reduction by 2009; and carbon dioxide \n(CO2), the greenhouse gas most directly linked to global \nclimate change, by 21 percent from 2000 levels. Of note, the \nNOX, SO2, and mercury reductions are set at \nlevels that are known to be cost-effective with available technology.\n  The Clean Power Act will also eliminate the outdated coal-burning \npower plants that were grandfathered in under the Clean Air Act unless \nthey apply the best available pollution control technology by their \n40th birthday or 2014, whichever is later. The thinking for the \nexemption in the Clean Air Act was based, at the time, on the \nassumption that the plants would not stay on line much longer. However, \nas energy has gotten more expensive, companies are keeping these older, \ndirtier plants up and running.\n  Furthermore, just as the Clean Air Act already provides tradable \nallowances for sulfur dioxide that causes acid rain, the Jeffords' \nlegislation also allows for tradable allowances to control emissions \nfor three other pollutants--NOX, SOX, and \nCO2--by using market-oriented mechanisms to meet emissions \nreduction requirements.\n  The tradable allowances would be distributed to five main categories, \nincluding 63 percent or more to households; six percent for transition \nassistance to affected communities and industries, which will decline \nover time; up to 20 percent to renewable energy generation, efficiency \nprojects and cleaner energy sources, based on avoided pollution; 10 \npercent to existing electric generating facilities based on 2003 \noutput; and up to 1.5 percent of the carbon dioxide allowances for \nbiological and geological carbon sequestration. Of note, trading will \nnot be allowed if it enables a power plant to pollute at a level that \ndamages public health or the environment.\n  I am disappointed that the Clear Skies initiative addresses neither \ncarbon dioxide as a pollutant nor anthropogenic emissions reductions \nfor CO2. While I recognize that the pollutants listed under \nthe Clean Air Act were chosen in order to achieve healthier air for \nhumans by cutting back on smog and soot, and also for mercury \ncontamination, I believe it is long past due that carbon dioxide be \nrecognized as a pollutant that is harming the health of the planet, and \nindirectly, all of us.\n\n  I am supporting the goal of CO2 emissions reduction in the \nJeffords' bill in the hopes that the bill will be a rallying point to \nfurther the debate for reducing CO2 and at the same time, \nget our air cleaner on a quicker timeframe. In particular, Congress \nneeds to develop a market mechanism approach for CO2 \nemissions trading--such as we now have for acid rain--to allow U.S. \nindustries the flexibility and certainty to reduce CO2 \nemissions without the threat of higher energy production costs in the \nfuture that will be passed on to the consumer. I will continue to work \nwith my colleagues, the White House and representatives from various \nindustry groups, and environmental organizations to achieve this goal.\n  The bottom line is that we have the opportunity to raise the bar for \ncleaner domestic energy production in an economically effective manner. \nSolutions exist in available and developing technologies, and most of \nall in the entrepreneurial spirit of the American people who want a \ncleaner and healthier environment, including those in Maine who want to \nensure that the State's pristine lakes and coast will remain clean and \nour forests and fish healthy for generations to come.\n  My State of Maine is leading the way in attempting to reduce \nCO2 emissions as it is the first state in the nation to \nenact a law setting goals for the reduction of global warming \nemissions, through An Act to Provide Leadership in Addressing the \nThreat of Climate Change. The Act requires Maine to develop a climate \nchange action plan to reduce carbon dioxide emissions to 1990 levels by \n2010, 10 percent below 1990 levels by 2020, and by as much as 75 to 80 \npercent over the long term. These are the cuts previously agreed to by \nthe New England Governors and Eastern Canadian Premiers. The State law \nwill also inventory and reduce CO2 emissions from state-\nfunded programs and facilities, and to spur at least 50 partnerships \nwith businesses and non-profit organizations to reduce CO2 \nemissions.\n  While Maine was the first to put into effect a comprehensive climate \nchange law, other states from the Northeast and around the country have \ntaken, or are currently taking, actions to address climate change at \nthe state or regional level. The Jeffords' legislation calls for \nFederal leadership as well and sends a powerful message to those who \nwould heavily pollute our air: your days are numbered.\n  I am optimistic that the Congress can come together with the \nPresident, industry and all those who want cleaner, healthier air to \ncreate a cohesive\n\n[[Page S473]]\n\npolicy that is best suited for our nation, and I urge my colleagues to \nsupport the Jeffords' four-pollutant legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. COLEMAN (for himself and Mr. Pryor):\n  S. 151. A bill to amend title 38, United States Code, to require an \nannual plan on outreach activities of the Department of Veterans \nAffairs; to the Committee on Veterans' Affairs.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, today I am pleased to introduce the \nVeterans Benefits Outreach Act of 2005 with my good friend and \ncolleague, Senator Mark Pryor of Arkansas.\n  The idea for this legislation emanated from a very troubling story I \nread in my hometown paper, the Saint Paul Pioneer Press entitled, \n``Wounded and Forgotten.''\n  The article reported that nearly 600,000 veterans are eligible for \nbenefits but not receiving them simply because they don't know they are \neligible.\n  It is clear that we need to do a better job of reaching out to \nveterans so they get the benefits they have earned. Our bill would do \nthis by requiring the Veterans Administration to develop an annual plan \nto identify veterans who are eligible for but not receiving their \nbenefits and an outreach plan to enroll them.\n  Pretty simply really: matching benefits with people who have earned \nthem, and often through a lot of sacrifice for us and the freedoms we \nenjoy every day.\n  I hope the Senate will be able to act on this important legislation \nearly this year so my hometown newspaper can report that our veterans \nare always remembered.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 151\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to direct the Secretary of the Interior to conduct a \nresource study of the Rim of the Valley Corridor in the State of \nCalifornia to evaluate alternatives for protecting the resources of the \nCorridor, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and \nNatural Resources.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce this bill \ntoday along with Senator Boxer as cosponsor to direct the Interior \nSecretary to conduct a study to evaluate the suitability and \nfeasibility of expanding the Santa Monica National Recreation Area to \ninclude the Rim of the Valley Corridor.\n  The Rim of the Valley Corridor encircles the San Fernando Valley, La \nCrescenta, Simi, Conejo, and Santa Clarita Valleys, consisting of parts \nof the Santa Monica Mountains, Santa Susanna Mountains, San Gabriel \nMountains, Verdugo Mountains, San Rafael Hills and connects to the \nadjacent Los Padres and San Bernardino National Forests.\n  This parcel of land is unique because of its rare Mediterranean \necosystem and wildlife corridor that stretches north from the Santa \nMonicas. With the population growth forecasted to multiply \nexponentially over the next several decades, the need for parks to \nbalance out the expected population growth has become critical in \nCalifornia.\n  Since the creation of the Santa Monica Recreation Area in 1978, \nFederal, State, and local authorities have worked successfully together \nto create and maintain the highly successful Santa Monica Mountains \nNational Recreation Area, the world's largest urban park, hemmed in on \nall sides by development.\n  Park and recreational lands provide people with a vital refuge from \nurban life while preserving valuable habitat and wildlife. With the \npassage of this legislation, Congress will hold true to its original \ncommitment to preserve the scenic, natural, and historic setting of the \nSanta Monica Mountains Recreation Area.\n  With the inclusion of the Rim of the Valley Corridor in the Santa \nMonica Mountains Recreation Area, greater ecological health and \ndiversity will be promoted, particularly for larger animals like \nmountain lions, bobcats, and the golden eagle. By creating a single \ncontiguous Rim of the Valley Trail, people will enjoy greater access to \nexisting trails in the Recreational Area.\n  After the study called for in this bill is complete, the Secretary of \nthe Interior and Congress will be in a key position to determine \nwhether all or portions of the Rim of the Valley Corridor warrant \nnational park status.\n  This bill enjoys strong support from local and State officials and I \nhope that it will have as much strong bipartisan support this Congress, \nas it did last Congress. Congressman Adam Schiff plans to introduce \ncompanion legislation for this bill in the House and I applaud his \ncommitment to this issue.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation and I ask unanimous \nconsent that the text of this proposed legislation be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 153\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to increase and enhance law enforcement resources \ncommitted to investigation and prosecution of violent gangs, to deter \nand punish violent gang crime, to protect law-abiding citizens and \ncommunities from violent criminals, to revise and enhance criminal \npenalties for violent crimes, to reform and facilitate prosecution of \njuvenile gang members who commit violent crimes, to expand and improve \ngang prevention programs, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nthe Judiciary.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to join my good friend \nand colleague Senator Orrin Hatch, to introduce the ``Gang Prevention \nand Effective Deterrence Act of 2005.''\n  Gangs are spreading across our country, increasing in violence and \npower in every State. The growth and spread of these gangs illustrate \nthe simple fact that they are no longer a local problem. They are a \nnational problem, and require a national solution. This bill is \ndesigned to contribute to that solution by bringing together Federal, \nState and local law enforcement, equipping them with the right legal \ntools, and providing authorization for funds to make this partnership \neffective.\n  First, let me illustrate the scope of the problem we face: In 2002, \nthere were approximately 731,500 gang members and 21,500 gangs in the \nUnited States. Additionally, the FBI report on national crime \nstatistics found that youth-gang homicides had jumped to more than \n1,100 in 2002, up from 692 in 1999. According to a report commissioned \nby a coalition of big city police chiefs, gang-related killings \nskyrocketed by 50 percent from 1999 to 2002. In 2002, there were a \nlittle more than 16,000 homicides in the United States--more than a \nthousand of those murders were gang-related. In Southern California \nalone there have been about 3,100 gang-related killings since 1999. 87 \npercent of U.S. cities with a population of more than 100,000 have \nreported gang problems, according to the Department of justice.\n  The bottom line is that this is a major problem.\n  This legislation before us today squarely addresses these serious \nissues. Its main point is to create a new type of crime, by defining \nand criminalizing ``Criminal Street Gangs.'' This recognizes the basic \npoint of a street gang--it is more powerful, and more dangerous, than \nits individual members. Defeating gangs means recognizing what is so \ndangerous about them, and then making that conduct against the law.\n  This bill does exactly that. It makes illegal participation in a \ncriminal street gang a federal crime. A ``criminal street gang'' is \ndefined to mean a formal or informal group, club, organization or \nassociation of 3 or more persons who act together to commit gang \ncrimes. This legislation makes it a crime for a member of a criminal \nstreet gang to commit, conspire or attempt to commit two or more \npredicate gang crimes; or to get another individual to commit a gang \ncrime. The term ``gang crime'' is defined to include violent and other \nserious State and Federal felony crimes such as: murder, maiming, \nmanslaughter, kidnapping, arson, robbery, assault with a dangerous \nweapon, obstruction of justice, carjacking, distribution of a \ncontrolled substance, certain firearms offenses and money laundering. \nAnd it criminalizes violent crimes in furtherance or in aid of criminal \nstreet gangs.\n\n  These two provisions are at the heart of this legislation. Armed with \nthis new law, Federal prosecutors, working in tandem with State and \nlocal law enforcement, will be able to take on gangs in much the same \nway that traditional Mafia families have been systematically destroyed \nby effective RICO prosecutions. The legislation also recognizes that \nthe core changes, standing alone, are not sufficient.\n  The Gang Prevention and Effective Deterrence Act is a comprehensive \nbill to increase gang prosecution and prevention efforts. The bill \nauthorizes approximately $650 million over the next five years to \nsupport Federal, State and local law enforcement efforts against \nviolent gangs including the funding of witness protection programs and \nfor intervention and prevention programs for at-risk youth. In support \nof this effort, the bill increases funding for Federal prosecutors and \nFBI agents to increase coordinated enforcement efforts against violent \ngangs.\n  Witness protection is particularly important--as an example, recent \npress reports from Boston show that gang members are distributing what \nis, in essence, a witness intimidation media kit, complete with \ngraphics and CDs that warn potential witnesses that they will be \nkilled--one CD depicts three bodies on its covers. In another incident, \na witnesses' grand jury testimony was taped to his home--soon afterward \nhe was killed.\n  The Act also creates new criminal gang prosecution offenses, enhances \nexisting gang and violent crime penalties to deter and punish illegal \nstreet gangs, proposes violent crime reforms needed to effectively \nprosecute gang members, and proposes a limited reform of the juvenile \njustice system to facilitate Federal prosecution of 16 and 17 year old \ngang members who commit serious acts of violence--specifically it:\n  Makes recruiting minors to join criminal street gangs a Federal crime \nand requires offenders to pay the costs associated with housing and \ntreating any recruited minor who is prosecuted for their gang activity.\n  Makes murder and other violent crimes committed in connection with \ndrug trafficking Federal crimes.\n  Creates a new offense of multiple interstate murders, where an \nindividual crosses State lines and intends to cause the death of two or \nmore people.\n  Allows for prosecution of gang members who cross State lines to \nobstruct justice, intimidate or retaliate against witnesses, jurors, \ninformants, or victims.\n  Creates tougher laws for certain Federal crimes like assault, \ncarjacking, manslaughter, conspiracy, and for specific types of crimes \noccurring in Indian country.\n  Requires that someone convicted of hiring another person to commit \nmurder be punished with imprisonment, instead of a fine.\n  Makes sexual assault a predicate act under RICO and increases the \nmaximum sentences for these RICO crimes.\n  Allows for detention of persons charged with firearms who have been \npreviously convicted of prior crimes of violence or serious drug \noffenses. Current law does not allow a prosecutor to\n\n[[Page S475]]\n\nask that a person be held without bail even if the person has \npreviously been convicted of a crime of violence or a serious drug \noffense. This bill would allow prosecutors to make that request of a \njudge but would allow a criminal defendant the right to argue why he or \nshe should not be held.\n  Makes it clear that in a death penalty case, the case can be tried \nwhere the murder, or related conduct, occurred.\n  Extends the time within which a violent crime case can be charged and \ntried. For violent crime cases, the time is extended from 5 years to 10 \nyears after the offense occurred or the continuing offense was \ncompleted, and from 5 years to 8 years after the date on which the \nviolation was first discovered.\n  Permits wiretaps to be used for new gang crimes created by this bill.\n  Allows for a murdered witness's statements to be admitted at trial in \ncases where the defendant caused the witness's death.\n  Makes clear where a case can be tried involving retaliation against a \nwitness--in either the district where the case is being tried, or where \nthe intimidation took place.\n  Increases penalties for criminal use of firearms in crimes of \nviolence and drug trafficking.\n  Includes modified juvenile provisions. This bill will allow \nprosecutors to more easily charge 16 and 17 year olds who are charged \nwith serious violent felonies. A judge will review every decision a \nprosecutor makes to charge a juvenile as an adult.\n  Creates and provides assistance for ``High Intensity'' Interstate \nGang Activity areas. This legislation requires the Attorney General to \ndesignate certain locations as ``high intensity interstate gang \nactivity areas'' and provides assistance in the form of criminal street \ngang enforcement teams made up of local, State and Federal law \nenforcement authorities to investigate and prosecute criminal street \ngangs in each high intensity interstate gang activity area.\n  Authorizes funding of $500 million for 2004 through 2008 to meet the \ngoals of suppression and intervention: $50 million a year will be used \nto support the criminal gang enforcement teams. $50 million a year will \nbe used to make grants available for community-based programs to \nprovide for crime prevention and intervention services for gang members \nand at-risk youth in areas designated as high intensity interstate gang \nactivity areas.\n\n  Authorizes $150 million over five years to support anti-gang efforts \nincluding: Expanding the Project Safe Neighborhood program to require \nU.S. Attorneys to identify and prosecute significant gangs within their \ndistrict; coordinating such prosecutions among all local, State, and \nFederal law enforcement; and coordinating criminal street gang \nenforcement teams in designated high intensity interstate gang activity \nareas. Supporting the Federal Bureau of Investigation's Safe Streets \nProgram. Creating and expanding witness protection programs, the hiring \nof additional State and local prosecutors, funding gang prevention and \ncommunity prosecution programs and purchasing equipment to increase the \naccurate identification and prosecution of violent offenders.\n  The bottom line is that this legislation would provide the tools and \nthe resources to begin that national task of destroying criminal street \ngangs. It is designed to emphasize and encourage Federal, State and \nlocal cooperation. It combines enforcement with prevention. It is a \ntough, effective and fair approach.\n  This is not a new bill. I have been working on it for almost ten \nyears. In 1996, I joined Senator Hatch and others to develop the \nFederal Gang Violence Act, which would have increased criminal \npenalties for gang members, made recruiting persons into a criminal \nstreet gang a crime, and enhanced penalties for transferring a gun to a \nminor. Many of the provisions of that bill were incorporated into the \n1999 Juvenile Justice bill, which was approved overwhelmingly (73-25) \nby the Senate in the 106th Congress. However, the Juvenile Justice bill \nstalled in conference, and these provisions were never signed into law.\n  In the years that followed we kept up our efforts, with Republicans \nand Democrats working together on this critical issue. In the 108th \nCongress a version of this bill was introduced, and eventually was co-\nsponsored by Senators Hatch and others. That bill was the subject of \nmuch discussion and debate. Some of my colleagues raised some valuable \nsuggestions and criticisms, many of which were incorporated in the bill \nlast year. The result of that compromise was reported favorably by the \nJudiciary Committee last Fall, but was never considered by the full \nSenate.\n  The legislation today is the same as that which was approved by the \nJudiciary Committee, and I hope this year we will move quickly to pass \nit into law. That said, I understand that some of my colleagues are \nstill concerned about certain aspects of the bill. My intention is to \ncontinue to negotiate in the weeks ahead. I am open to change, and \nwelcome further discussion and analysis.\n  We all agree that gangs are a terrible and growing problem. We all \nagree that something needs to be done.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) violent crime and drug trafficking are pervasive \n     problems at the national, State, and local level;\n       (2) the crime rate is exacerbated by the association of \n     persons in gangs to commit acts of violence and drug \n     offenses;\n       (3) according to the most recent National Drug Threat \n     Assessment, criminal street gangs are responsible for the \n     distribution of much of the cocaine, methamphetamine, heroin, \n     and other illegal drugs being distributed in rural and urban \n     communities throughout the United States;\n       (4) gangs commit acts of violence or drug offenses for \n     numerous motives, such as membership in or loyalty to the \n     gang, for protecting gang territory, and for profit;\n       (5) gang presence has a pernicious effect on the free flow \n     of commerce in local businesses and directly affects the \n     freedom and security of communities plagued by gang activity;\n       (6) gangs often recruit and utilize minors to engage in \n     acts of violence and other serious offenses out of a belief \n     that the criminal justice systems are more lenient on \n     juvenile offenders;\n       (7) gangs often intimidate and threaten witnesses to \n     prevent successful prosecutions;\n       (8) gang recruitment can be deterred through increased \n     vigilance, strong criminal penalties, equal partnerships with \n     State and local law enforcement, and proactive intervention \n     efforts, particularly targeted at juveniles, prior to gang \n     involvement;\n       (9) State and local prosecutors, in hearings before the \n     Committee on the Judiciary of the Senate, enlisted the help \n     of Congress in the prevention, investigation, and prosecution \n     of gang crimes and in the protection of witnesses and victims \n     of gang crimes; and\n       (10) because State and local prosecutors and law \n     enforcement have the expertise, experience, and connection to \n     the community that is needed to combat gang violence, \n     consultation and coordination between Federal, State, and \n     local law enforcement is critical to the successful \n     prosecutions of criminal street gangs.\n\n Subtitle A--Criminal Law Reforms and Enhanced Penalties To Deter and \n                  Punish Illegal Street Gang Activity\n\n     SEC. 101.

Mr. President, I rise today to introduce with my \ncolleagues, Senators Feinstein, Grassley, Kyl, and Cornyn, a \ncomprehensive bipartisan bill to increase gang prosecution and \nprevention efforts. The bill I introduce today is identical to S. 1735 \nthat was favorably reported by the Senate Judiciary Committee in the \n108th Congress.\n  This legislation, ``The Gang Prevention and Effective Deterrence Act \nof 2005,'' authorizes approximately $650 million over the next five \nyears to support law enforcement and efforts to prevent youngsters from \njoining gangs. Of that, $450 million would be used to support Federal, \nState and local law enforcement efforts against violent gangs, and $200 \nmillion would be used for intervention and prevention programs for at-\nrisk youth. The bill increases funding for the Federal prosecutors and \nFederal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) agents needed to conduct \ncoordinated enforcement efforts against violent gangs.\n  This bill also creates new criminal gang prosecution offenses, \nenhances existing gang and violent crime penalties to deter and punish \nillegal street gangs, enacts violent crime reforms needed to prosecute \neffectively gang members, and implements a limited reform of the \njuvenile justice system to facilitate Federal prosecution of 16- and \n17-year-old gang members who commit serious violent felonies.\n  The problem of gang violence in America is not a new one, nor is it a \nproblem that is limited to major urban areas. Once thought to be only a \nproblem in our Nation's largest cities, gangs have invaded smaller \ncommunities. Gangs in Salt Lake County result in significant measure \nfrom the influence of gangs existing in Los Angeles and Chicago, but \nwith local mutations.\n  Constituents frequently mention to me their extreme concern about \ngang violence in Utah. According to the Salt Lake Area Gang Project, a \nmulti-jurisdictional task force created in 1989 to fight gang crime in \nthe Salt Lake area, there are at least 250 identified gangs in Utah \nwith over 3,500 members. In Utah, there are street gangs that are \nethnically oriented, such as Hispanic gangs, as well as those \naffiliated with gangs from other cities, such as the Crips and Bloods, \nFolks and People, motorcycle gangs, Straight Edge gangs, Animal \nLiberation Front, Skinheads, Varrio Loco Town, Oquirrh Shadow Boys, \nSalt Lake Posse, and the list goes on. Some of these gangs are racist; \nsome are extremist.\n  And what I find particularly troubling is that over one-third of the \ntotal gang membership is made up of juveniles. Thus, these crimes have \na particular impact on youths.\n  Gangs now resemble organized crime syndicates which readily engage in \ngun violence, illegal gun trafficking, illegal drug trafficking and \nother serious crimes. All too often we read in the headlines about \ngruesome and tragic stories of rival gang members gunned down, innocent \nbystanders--adults, teenagers and children--caught in the cross fire of \ngangland shootings, and family members crying out in grief as they lose \nloved ones to the gang wars plaguing our communities.\n\n[[Page S483]]\n\n  Recent studies confirm that gang violence is an increasing problem in \nall of our communities. Based on the latest available National Youth \nGang Survey, it is now estimated that there are more than 25,000 gangs, \nand over 750,000 gang members who are active in more than 3,000 \njurisdictions across the United States. The most current reports \nindicate that in 2002 alone, after five years of decline, gang \nmembership has spiked nationwide.\n  I have been--and remain--committed to supporting Federal, State and \nlocal task forces as a model for effective gang enforcement strategies. \nWorking together, these task forces have demonstrated that they can \nmake a difference in the community. In Salt Lake City, the Metro Gang \nMulti-Jurisdiction Task Force stands out as a critical player in \nfighting gang violence in Salt Lake City. We need to reassure \noutstanding organizations like this that there will be adequate \nresources available to expand and fund these critical task force \noperations to fight gang violence.\n  In my study of this problem, it has become clear that the government \nneeds to work with communities to meet this problem head-on and defeat \nit. If we really want to reduce gang violence, we must ensure that law \nenforcement has adequate resources and legal tools, and that our \ncommunities have the ability to implement proven intervention and \nprevention strategies, so that gang members who are removed from the \ncommunity are not simply replaced by the next generation of new gang \nmembers.\n  In closing, I want to commend my colleagues--Senators Feinstein, \nGrassley, Kyl and Cornyn. They have worked very closely with me as we \nconsidered these issues last Congress and I look forward to working \nwith them and others as we proceed this year. I urge my colleagues to \njoin with us in promptly passing this important legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BINGAMAN (for himself and Mr. Domenici):\n  S. 156. A bill to designate the Ojito Wilderness Study Area as \nwilderness, to take certain land into trust for the Pueblo of Zia, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I am proud to introduce the ``Ojito \nWilderness Act''. This bill was passed in various forms by both the \nSenate and the House of Representatives in the 108th Congress. I am \npleased that the senior Senator from New Mexico, Mr. Domenici, is \ncosponsoring this bill.\n  The support for this proposal truly is impressive.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to permit \ninterest on Federally guaranteed water, wastewater, and essential \ncommunity facilities loans to be tax exempt; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I'm introducing a bill today that is aimed \nat helping rural communities build or improve essential community \nfacilities such as shelters, nursing homes, hospitals, medical clinics, \nand fire and rescue-type projects. My bill would make it possible for \nproject sponsors to accept certain USDA loan guarantees without risking \nthe tax exempt status that enables them to finance these initiatives.\n  Clarification of existing tax rules, as proposed in this bill, will \nprovide certainty for project sponsors, help lower project costs for \nrural communities, and help deal with a backlog of loan applications \nfor small communities.\n  The needs are great in many rural communities. This measure will help \ncommunities help themselves and I look forward to working with the \nSenate Finance Committee on this important topic.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the measure be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 157\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. TAX-EXEMPT INTEREST ON FEDERALLY GUARANTEED WATER, \n                   WASTEWATER, AND FEDERALLY GUARANTEED ESSENTIAL \n                   COMMUNITY FACILITIES LOANS.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 149(b)(3)(A) of the Internal \n     Revenue Code 1986 (relating to certain insurance programs) is \n     amended by striking ``or'' at the end of clause (ii), by \n     striking period at the end of clause (iii) and inserting ``, \n     or'', and by adding at the end the following new clause:\n       ``(iv) any guarantee by the Secretary of Agriculture \n     pursuant to section 306(a)(1) of the Consolidated Farm and \n     Rural Development Act (7 U.S.C. 1926(a)(1)) to finance water, \n     wastewater, and essential community facilities.''.\n       (b) Effective Date.--The amendments made by this section \n     shall apply to bonds issued after the date of the enactment \n     of this Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LIEBERMAN (for himself, Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Dodd, and Mr. \n        Schumer):\n  S. 158. A bill to establish the Long Island Sound Stewardship \nInitiative; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n\n[[Page S485]]\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to re-introduce \nlegislation that would establish a new system to preserve the \nenvironmental quality of Long Island Sound by identifying, protecting, \nand enhancing sites within the Long Island Sound ecosystem that have \nsignificant ecological, educational, open space, public access, or \nrecreational value.\n  With this legislation, we hope to preserve the natural beauty and \necological wonder of the majestic waterway between New York and \nConnecticut, which my New York and Connecticut colleagues and I have \nworked hard together to improve. We have come a long way in restoring \nthe Sound and its rich biodiversity over the past several decades, but \nour progress may be in jeopardy if we do not take measures now to \nprotect remaining sites of biological diversity. Despite our best \nefforts, we are continuing to lose unprotected open sites along the \nshore. That is why this Act is so important.\n  One of the important features of the Stewardship Act I am introducing \nis that it will use new approaches to address an old problem, the \nproper conservation of our resources. The legislation includes novel \nconservation techniques that are designed to accomplish their goals at \nthe least cost. First, it involves purchasing property or property \nrights or entering into binding legal agreements with property owners, \nbut does so through a process that is voluntary and that explicitly \nrespects the interests and rights of private property owners. It also \nuses established scientific methods for identifying potential coastal \nsites. Finally, it incorporates a flexible management system that \ninstitutionalizes learning and ensures efficiency in the identification \nand acquisition of conservation and recreation sites.\n  The value of this legislation, which passed the Senate by unanimous \nconsent during the last Congress, is clear. I look forward to working \nwith my co-sponsors from Connecticut and New York, Senators Dodd, \nClinton, and Schumer, and a bipartisan group of our Connecticut and New \nYork House colleagues to enact this legislation and ensure that we can \ntake necessary common-sense steps to protect and preserve Long Island \nSound for generations to come.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 158\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Long Island Sound \n     Stewardship Act of 2005''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) Long Island Sound is a national treasure of great \n     cultural, environmental, and ecological importance;\n       (2) 8,000,000 people live within the Long Island Sound \n     watershed and 28,000,000 people (approximately 10 percent of \n     the population of the United States) live within 50 miles of \n     Long Island Sound;\n       (3) activities that depend on the environmental health of \n     Long Island Sound contribute more than $5,000,000,000 each \n     year to the regional economy;\n       (4) the portion of the shoreline of Long Island Sound that \n     is accessible to the general public (estimated at less than \n     20 percent of the total shoreline) is not adequate to serve \n     the needs of the people living in the area;\n       (5) existing shoreline facilities are in many cases \n     overburdened and underfunded;\n       (6) large parcels of open space already in public ownership \n     are strained by the effort to balance the demand for \n     recreation with the needs of sensitive natural resources;\n       (7) approximately \\1/3\\ of the tidal marshes of Long Island \n     Sound have been filled, and much of the remaining marshes \n     have been ditched, dyked, or impounded, reducing the \n     ecological value of the marshes; and\n       (8) much of the remaining exemplary natural landscape is \n     vulnerable to further development.\n       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to establish the \n     Long Island Sound Stewardship Initiative to identify, \n     protect, and enhance sites within the Long Island Sound \n     ecosystem with significant ecological, educational, open \n     space, public access, or recreational value through a bi-\n     State network of sites best exemplifying these values.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to provide for a land exchange in the State of Arizona \nbetween the Secretary of Agriculture and Yavapai Ranch Limited \nPartnership; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with Senator Kyl in \nintroducing the Northern Arizona Forest Lands Exchange and Verde River \nBasin Partnership Act of 2005. The Senate passed by unanimous consent a \nnearly identical measure late last year. Unfortunately, the House did \nnot have the time to pass the bill before the 108th Congress adjourned. \nIt is my hope that this compromise bill will pass quickly in both \nHouses and become law in the near future.\n  This legislation is the product of many years of negotiation and \ncompromise. It provides a sound framework for a fair and equal value \nexchange of 50,000 acres of private and public land in Northern \nArizona. The bill also addresses water issues associated with the \nexchange of lands located within the Verde River Basin watershed by \nlimiting water usage on certain exchanged lands and supporting the \ndevelopment of a collaborative science-based water resource planning \nand management entity for the Verde River Basin watershed.\n  After countless hours of deliberation and discussion by all parties, \nI believe that the compromise reached on the bill is both balanced and \nforesighted in addressing the various issues raised by the exchange. I \nwant to thank Senator Kyl and his staff, as well as Senators Domenici \nand Bingaman, and their staffs on the Senate Energy and Natural \nResources Committee, for their tireless efforts in reaching this \nagreement at the end of the last session. I also want to recognize the \nwork of Congressmen Renzi and Hayworth who have championed this \nlegislation in the House of Representatives. Representative Renzi plans \nto introduce a companion bill in the House this week.\n  The Arizona delegation is strongly supportive of the legislation \nbecause it will offer significant benefits for all parties. Benefits \nwill accrue to the U.S. Forest Service and the public with the \nconsolidation of checkerboard lands and the protection and enhanced \nmanagement of extensive forest and grasslands. The communities of \nFlagstaff, Williams, and Camp Verde will also benefit in terms of \neconomic development opportunities, water supply, and other important \npurposes.\n  While facilitating the exchange of public and private lands is a very \nimportant objective of this legislation, and indeed, was the original \npurpose when we began working on it several years ago, I now consider \nthe provisions concerning water management even more crucial. Since \nintroducing the original legislation in April 2003, I have heard from \nhundreds of Arizonans and learned first-hand of the significant water \nissues raised by the transfer of Federal land into private ownership. \nWe have modified the bill to take into account many of the concerns \nraised during meetings held in Northern Arizona by limiting water usage \non exchanged lands and removing certain lands entirely from the \nexchange.\n  There is growing recognition throughout Arizona of the need to face \nthe crucial challenge of wise management of limited water supplies, \nparticularly with the extended drought coupled with rapid population \ngrowth. Earlier this month, I had the opportunity to participate in an \nArizona Water Conservation Forum which was attended by educators, \nbusiness leaders, and State and local officials. I think the majority \nof us came away more aware of the management measures needed to provide \nfor a more secure water future.\n  This bill promotes an important opportunity to encourage sound water \nmanagement in Northern Arizona by supporting the creation of a \ncollaborative, science-based decision-making body to advance essential \nplanning and management at the State and local level. To be successful, \nthis effort will require the involvement of all the stakeholders with \nwater supply responsibilities and interests and a solid foundation of \nknowledge about available resources and existing demands. We are \nfortunate to have an existing model of collaborative science-based \nwater resource planning and management with the Upper San Pedro \nPartnership in\n\n[[Page S488]]\n\nthe Sierra Vista subwatershed of Arizona. In my view, the establishment \nof a similar, cooperative body in the Verde Basin will be a vital step \nin assuring the wise use of our limited water resources.\n  I look forward to the expeditious passage of this legislation in this \nCongress and again thank all of the parties involved with this effort \nduring the past several years. I ask unanimous consent that the text of \nthe bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 161\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

EFFECT.\n\n       Nothing in this title diminishes or expands State or local \n     jurisdiction, responsibilities, or rights with respect to \n     water resource management or control.\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, today, I am pleased to join with Senator \nMcCain to introduce the Northern Arizona Land Exchange and Verde River \nBasin Partnership Act of 2005. This bill facilitates a large and \ncomplex land exchange of over 50,000 acres of Federal and private land \nin Arizona to consolidate the largest remaining checkerboard ownership \nin the State. It also encourages the formation of a partnership between \nFederal, State, and local stakeholders to facilitate sound water \nresource planning and management in the Verde River Basin. This bill is \nthe product of two years of discussions and compromise between the \nArizona delegation, United States Forest Service,\n\n[[Page S491]]\n\ncommunity groups, local officials, and other stakeholders. The bill \npassed the Senate last session, but unfortunately was not enacted \nbefore adjournment. I am introducing this legislation with the hope \nthat the Senate will act quickly to pass it early in this Congress.\n  The bill is divided into two titles. Title I provides the framework \nfor the land exchange between Yavapai Ranch Limited Partnership and the \nUnited States Forest Service. Title II outlines the key aspects of the \nVerde River Basin Partnership. The land exchange outlined in Title I is \na fair and equitable exchange that will yield many environmental \nbenefits to the citizens of Arizona. It will place approximately 35,000 \nacres of private land in federal ownership for public use. This acreage \nis important ecologically because it contains such key features as old \ngrowth ponderosa pine, and high quality grassland that serves as \nexcellent habitat for pronghorn antelope and is critical to the \npreservation of the watershed. In addition, it consolidates under \nForest Service ownership a 110-square mile area in the Prescott \nNational Forest near the existing Juniper Mesa Wilderness, to preserve \nthe area in its natural state. Without this land exchange, these \nprivate tracts would be open to future development. I am pleased that \nthis bill will preserve them for future generations.\n  The land exchange also significantly improves the management of the \nPrescott National Forest. The existing checkboard ownership pattern \nmakes management and access difficult. By consolidating this land, the \nexchange will enable the Forest Service will be able to effectively \napply forest restoration treatments to reduce the fire risk and improve \nthe overall health of the forest. I cannot emphasize enough how crucial \nthis is, given the history of devastating forest fires in the state.\n  In addition to protecting Arizona's natural resources, Title I of the \nbill allows several Northern Arizona communities to accommodate future \ngrowth and economic development, and to meet other municipal needs. \nThis exchange will allow the cities of Flagstaff and Williams to expand \ntheir airports, meet their water-treatment needs, and develop town \nparks and recreation areas. The town of Camp Verde will have an \nopportunity to acquire land to build an emergency center and protect \nits viewshed. Several youth organizations will be able to acquire land \nfor their camps.\n  This bill addresses one of the most crucial challenges facing \nArizona: sound management of water resources. I have heard from many \nstate and local officials, and the constituents affected by the land \nexchange, that we needed to do more in this bill to address water \nissues. I note in response that this bill has two key features: First, \nit establishes a conservation easement on the Camp Verde General Crook \nparcel, which limits water use after private acquisition to just 300 \nacre feet a year. This limitation was strengthened from the previous \nversions of the bill which included a use restriction of 700 acre feet \na year. This provision sets an important precedent for responsible \nwater use in the Verde Valley and across the state. Second, and most \nrecently, Senator McCain and I added Title II to the bill. This title \nfacilitates and encourages the creation of the Verde River Basin \nPartnership to examine water issues in the long term. Such a \ncollaborative, multi-stakeholder group would be authorized to receive \nfederal assistance to develop the scientific and technical data needed \nto make sound water-management decisions.\n  Finally, this bill saves significant taxpayer dollars. It obviates \nthe administrative route for a land exchange; doing an exchange of this \nsize administratively would require considerable financial and \npersonnel resources from the Forest Service. The agency estimates that \nusing legislation instead will cost half as much as the administrative \nalternative--resulting in potential savings to the taxpayers in excess \nof $500,000.\n  This land exchange is a unique opportunity to protect Arizona's \nnatural resources, accommodate the state's tremendous growth, and plan \nfor the future. I intend to work with my colleagues to ensure that we \npass this important legislation this year.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ROCKEFELLER:\n  S. 162. A bill to amend chapter 99 of the Internal Revenue code of \n1986 to clarify that certain coal industry health benefits may not be \nmodified or terminated; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to \nmake very clear that Congress fully protected the health insurance \nbenefits of miners and their families when we passed the Coal Act in \n1992. This legislation is identical to S. 3004 which I introduced in \nthe 108th Congress. Unfortunately, it is necessary, because we have \nrecently seen bankruptcy courts disregard the Coal Act and absolve \ncompanies of their obligations to provide health benefits for workers \nand retirees. This is unacceptable. And the bill I am introducing today \nreiterates that the bankruptcy code does not supersede the Coal Act.\n  Last fall, another company abandoned promises it made to workers and \nretirees in West Virginia. Horizon Natural Resources sought and \nreceived a court ruling that released it from its contracts with union \nminers and allowed it to avoid honoring health care benefit obligations \nfor over 2,300 retired miners. This is a morally bankrupt corporate \nstrategy, and is inconsistent with the Coal Act passed by Congress in \n1992.\n  The Coal Act was needed in 1992 to prevent some companies from \nwalking away from their clear contractual obligations and agreements \nwith their workers. One of the provisions of that bill was written \nespecially with the intent of not allowing companies to simply \nreorganize as a way to get out of their obligations to their workers. \nUnfortunately, too many companies are increasingly using bankruptcy \ncourts to achieve the same results.\n  It should not be necessary for me to introduce this bill today. \nCongress has already spoken on this subject. The law is clear: Coal Act \nretirees are entitled to full benefits provided under the statute. No \njudge should rewrite the law to take those benefits away. However, \nbecause judges are legislating from the bench, it will be helpful for \nCongress to reiterate our intention to protect the health benefits of \ncoal miners and their families.\n  This issue is extremely important to all of those who are being \nvictimized by the bankruptcy courts. I hope that my colleagues will \njoin me in this effort to protect the miners, retired miners, and \nfamilies who are simply seeking the benefits they were promised in \nexchange for years of hard work.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 162\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. PROTECTION OF COAL INDUSTRY HEALTH BENEFITS.\n\n        Section 9711(g) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 \n     (relating to rules applicable to this part and part II) is \n     amended by adding at the end the following new paragraph:\n       ``(3) Prohibition on termination and modification of \n     benefits.--Except as provided in subsection (d), the benefits \n     required to be provided by a last signatory operator under \n     this chapter may not be terminated or modified by any court \n     in a proceeding under title 11 of the United States Code or \n     by agreement at any time when such operator is participating \n     in such a proceeding.''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BENNETT:\n  S. 163. A bill to establish the National Mormon Pioneer Heritage Area \nin the State of Utah, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nEnergy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I rise today to re-introduce the National \nMormon Pioneer Heritage Area Act.\n  The story behind and about the Mormon pioneers' 1,400-mile trek from \nIllinois to the Great Salt Lake Valley is one of the most compelling \nand captivating in our Nation's history. This legislation would \ndesignate as a National Heritage Area an area that spans some 250 miles \nalong Highway 89 and encompasses outstanding examples of historical, \ncultural, and natural resources that demonstrate the colonization of \nthe western United States, and the experience and influence of the \nMormon pioneers in furthering that colonization.\n  The landscape, architecture, artisan skills, and events along Highway \n89\n\n[[Page S492]]\n\nconvey in a very real way the legacy of the Mormon pioneers' \nachievements. The community of Panquitch for example, has an annual \nQuilt Day celebration to commemorate the sacrifice and fortitude of its \npioneers whose efforts saved the community from starvation in 1864. The \ncelebration is in remembrance of the Quilt Walk, a walk in which a \ngroup of men from Panquitch used quilts to form a path that would bear \ntheir weight across the snow. This quilt walk enabled these men to \ncross over the mountains to procure food for their community, which was \nfacing starvation as it experienced its first winter in Utah.\n  Another example of the tenacity of pioneers can be seen today at the \nHole-in-the-Rock. Here, in 1880, a group of 250 people, 80 wagons, and \n1,000 head of cattle upon the Colorado River Gorge. Finding no pathways \ndown to the river, the pioneers decided to use a narrow crevice leading \ndown to the bottom of the gorge. To make the crevice big enough to \naccommodate wagons, the pioneers spent 6 weeks enlarging the crevice by \nhand, using hammers, chisels, and blasting powder. They then attached \nlarge ropes to the wagons as they began their descent down the steep \nincline. It is because of such tenacity and innovation on the part of \npioneers that the western United States was shaped the way it was and \nmuch of that has contributed to the way of life and landscape still \nfound in the West today.\n  The National Mormon Pioneer Heritage Area will serve as a special \nrecognition of the people and places that have contributed greatly to \nour Nation's development. It will allow for the conservation of \nhistorical and cultural resources, the establishment of interpretive \nexhibits, will increase public awareness of the surviving skills and \ncrafts of those living along Highway 89, and specifically allows for \nthe preservation of historic buildings. In light of the benefits \nassociated with preserving the rich heritage of the founding of many of \nthe communities along Highway 89, my legislation has broad support from \nSanpete, Sevier, Piute, Garfield, and Kane counties and is a locally \nbased, locally supported undertaking.\n  Since the introduction of this legislation in the 108th Congress, I \nam pleased that the local counties, who have been unanimously \nsupportive of this legislation, have come together to outline in a \nMemorandum of Understanding, with the local coordinating entity \nidentified in the legislation, the cooperative relationship the \ncoordinating entity enjoys with the elected officials of the local \ncounties.\n  This legislation passed the Senate both in the 107th and 108th \nCongresses as part of packages agreed upon by the committee of \njurisdiction. Unfortunately, both times the packages were not able to \nbe considered by the other body prior to adjournment. I reintroduce \nthis bill today with the hope that during this session of Congress we \nmight achieve success in this body early enough to be considered by the \nHouse.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BENNETT:\n  S. 164. A bill to provide for the acquisition of certain property in \nWashington County, Utah; to the Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, today I am re-introducing a bill which is \nintended to bring to a close the Federal acquisition of an important \npiece of privately held land, located within the federally designated \ndesert tortoise reserve in Washington County, UT.\n  As some of my colleagues are aware, this is not the first time \nlegislation has been introduced in an attempt to resolve this issue. \nMost recently, on December 7, 2004, at the conclusion of the 108th \nCongress, the Senate passed by unanimous consent an amendment in the \nnature of a substitute to H.R. 620, which adopted as title XVI agreed \nupon provisions of S. 1209. Unfortunately, the House of Representatives \nadjourned sine die before it had time to act upon H.R. 620. The \nlegislation I am introducing today is virtually the same as the \nlanguage earlier adopted by the Senate, except for a technical \nclarification regarding management of the acquired lands.\n  I want to personally express my appreciation to Chairman Domenici and \nhis staff for their leadership and assistance on this issue. I would \nalso like to thank the ranking minority member, Mr. Bingaman, the \nDepartment of the Interior, and their respective staffs, for their \nassistance and support of this measure.\n  Earlier in July of 2000, I introduced S. 2873, which was referred to \nand reported favorably by the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources. In addition, similar legislation was twice approved by the \nHouse of Representatives, both in the 106th and 107th Congresses. For \nover a decade, the private property addressed by this bill has been \nunder Federal control and the Federal Government has enjoyed the \nbenefits of the private property without fulfilling its constitutional \nobligation to compensate the landowner. The government's failure to \ntimely acquire the landowner's private property has forced the \nlandowner into bankruptcy. It is my hope that the time has come to \nfinally resolve this issue.\n  In March of 1991, the desert tortoise was listed as an endangered \nspecies under the Endangered Species Act. Government and environmental \nresearchers determined that the land immediately north of St. George, \nUT, was prime desert tortoise habitat. Consequently, in February 1996, \nnearly 5 years after the listing, the United States Fish and Wildlife \nService, USFWS, issued Washington County a Section 10 permit under the \nEndangered Species Act which paved the way for the adoption of a \nhabitat conservation plan, HCP, and an implementation agreement. Under \nthe Plan and Agreement, the Bureau of Land Management, BLM, committed \nto acquire all private lands in the designated habitat area for the \nformation of the Red Cliffs Reserve for the protection of the desert \ntortoise.\n  One of the private land owners within the reserve is Environmental \nLand Technology, Ltd., ELT, which began acquiring lands from the State \nof Utah in 1981 for residential and recreational development several \nyears prior to the listing of the species. Moreover, in the years \npreceding the listing of the desert tortoise and the adoption of the \nhabitat conservation plan, ELT completed appraisals, cost estimates, \nengineering studies, site plans, surveys, utility layouts, and right-\nof-way negotiations. ELT staked out golf courses, and obtained water \nrights for the development of this land. Prior to the adoption of the \nHCP, it was not clear which lands the Federal and local governments \nwould set aside for the desert tortoise, although it was assumed that \nthere were sufficient surrounding Federal lands to provide adequate \nhabitat. However, when the HCP was adopted in 1996, the decision was \nmade to include ELT's lands within the boundaries of the reserve \nprimarily because of the high concentrations of tortoises. The \ntortoises on ELT land also appeared to be one of, if not the only \npopulation without an upper respiratory disease that afflicted all of \nthe other populations. As a consequence of the inclusion of the ELT \nlands, ELT's development efforts were halted.\n\n  With assurances from the Federal Government that the acquisition of \nthe ELT development lands was a high priority, the owner negotiated \nwith, and entered into, an assembled land exchange agreement with the \nBLM in anticipation of intrastate land exchanges. The private land \nowner then began a costly process of identifying comparable Federal \nlands within the State that would be suitable for an exchange for his \nlands in Washington County. Over the last 7 years, BLM and the private \nland owners, including ELT, have completed several exchanges, and the \nFederal Government has acquired, through those exchanges or direct \npurchases, nearly all of the private property located within the \nreserve, except for approximately 1,516 acres of the ELT development \nland. However, with the unforeseen creation of the Grand Staircase-\nEscalante National Monument in September 1996, and the subsequent land \nexchanges between the State of Utah and the Federal Government to \nconsolidate Federal lands within that monument, there are no longer \nsufficient comparable Federal lands within Utah to complete the \noriginally contemplated intrastate exchanges for the remainder of the \nELT land.\n  Faced with this problem, and in light of the high priority the \nDepartment of the Interior has placed on acquiring\n\n[[Page S493]]\n\nthese lands, BLM officials recommended that the ELT lands be acquired \nby direct purchase. During the FY 2000 budget process, BLM proposed \nthat $30 million be set aside to begin acquiring the remaining lands in \nWashington County. Unfortunately, because this project involves \nendangered species habitat and the USFWS is responsible for \nadministering activities under the Endangered Species Act, the Office \nof Management and Budget shifted the $30 million from the BLM budget \nrequest to the USFWS's Cooperative Endangered Species Conservation Fund \nbudget request. Ultimately, however, none of those funds was made \navailable for BLM acquisitions within the Federal section of the \nreserve. Instead, the funds in that account were made available on a \nmatching basis for the use of individual States to acquire wildlife \nhabitat. The result of this bureaucratic fumbling has resulted in \nextreme financial hardship for ELT.\n  The lands within the Red Cliffs Reserve are ELT's only asset. The \nestablishment of the Washington County HCP has effectively taken this \nproperty and prevented ELT from developing or otherwise disposing of \nthe property. ELT has been brought to the brink of financial ruin as it \nhas exhausted its resources in an effort to hold the property while \nawaiting the compensation to which it is entitled. ELT has had to sell \nits remaining assets, and the private land owner has also had to sell \nhis personal assets, including his home, to simply hold the property. \nThis has become a financial crisis for the landowner. It is simply \nwrong for the Federal Government to expect the landowner to continue to \nbear the cost of the government's efforts to provide habitat for an \nendangered species. That is the responsibility of the Federal \nGovernment. Moreover, while the landowner is bearing these costs, he \ncontinues to pay taxes on the property. This situation is made more \negregious by the failure of the Department of the Interior to request \nany acquisition funding for FY 2004 or FY 2005, even though this \nacquisition has been designated a high priority by the agency. Over the \npast several years, ELT has pursued all possible avenues to complete \nthe acquisition of these lands. The private land owner has spent \nmillions of dollars pursuing both intrastate and interstate land \nexchanges and has worked cooperatively with the Department of the \nInterior. Unfortunately, all of these efforts have thus far been \nfruitless.\n\n  The bill that I am introducing today will finally bring this \nacquisition to a close. In my view, a legislative taking should be an \naction of last resort. But, if ever a case warranted legislative \ncondemnation, this is it. This bill will transfer to the Federal \nGovernment all right, title, and interest in the ELT development \nproperty within the Red Cliffs Reserve, including an additional 34 \nacres of landlocked real property owned by ELT adjacent to the land \nwithin the reserve. Subject to existing law, the Uniform Appraisal \nStandards for Federal Land Acquisitions and the Uniform Standards and \nPractices for Appraisal Professionals, USPAP, a United States Court of \ncompetent jurisdiction shall determine the value for the land.\n  The bill includes language to allow, as part of the legislative \ntaking, for the landowner to recover reasonable costs, interest, and \ndamages, if any, as determined by the court. It is important to \nunderstand that, while Federal acquisitions should be completed on the \nbasis of fair market value, when the Federal Government makes the \ncommitment to acquire private land, the landowner should not have to be \ndriven into financial ruin while waiting upon the Federal Government to \ndischarge its obligation. While the Federal Government has never \ndisputed its obligation to acquire the property, it has had the benefit \nof the private land for all these years without having to pay for it. \nThe private landowner should not have to bear the costs of this Federal \nfoot-dragging.\n  This legislation is consistent with the high priority the Department \nof the Interior has repeatedly placed on this land acquisition, and is \na necessary final step towards an equitable resolution. The time for \npursuing other options has long since expired and it is unfortunate \nthat it requires legislative action. Without commenting on the \nEndangered Species Act itself, it would seem that if it is the \ngovernment's objective to provide habitat for the benefit of an \nendangered species, then the government ought to bear the costs, rather \nthan forcing them upon the landowner. It is also time to address this \nissue so that the Federal agencies may be single-minded in their \nefforts to recover the desert tortoise which remains the aim of the \ncreation of the reserve. This legislation simply codifies the status \nquo by enabling the private land owner to obtain the compensation to \nwhich he is constitutionally entitled. It is time to right this wrong \nand get on with the efforts to recover the species and I encourage my \ncolleagues to again support the immediate enactment of this important \nlegislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. COLEMAN:\n  S. 165. A bill for the relief of Tchisou Tho; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, today I am introducing a private relief \nbill for an outstanding young man from my State of Minnesota, Tchisou \nTho.\n  This legislation would allow Tchisou, a Hmong immigrant, to stay in \nthis country by adjusting his status to permanent resident. Not only \nwould this allow him to stay in the country he has lived in since he \nwas 5 years old, but it will make him eligible for in-State tuition at \nthe University of Minnesota.\n  Tchisou's family came to the United States 14 years ago on a \nvisitor's visa from France after fleeing Communist rule in Laos in \n1975. He was 5 years old at the time. They moved to Minnesota in 1993 \nto find work and to give their children an opportunity to receive a \nquality education.\n  Tchisou was an all-American high school kid. He watched movies, hung \nout at the mall with his friends and attended prom. He was an honor \nroll student, active in his community, church, and school. Tchisou was \ngoing to be the first member of his family to graduate from high \nschool, and he was getting ready to begin his freshman year on a \nscholarship to the University of Minnesota.\n  But in May 2003, just as Tchisou was getting ready to graduate from \nhigh school, his family met with immigration officials to request \nchanges to their immigration status. Instead, they received a \ndeportation order.\n  Tchisou's parents acknowledged that they had broken the law by \noverstaying their visas, and agreed to leave the country. But we all \nwanted Tchisou to have the chance to graduate with his high school \nclass. Legislation I introduced last year allowed Tchisou to stay. And \nthanks to the compassion of the immigration authorities, Tchisou's \nfamily was allowed to remain in the country just long enough to see \ntheir son walk in his high school graduation ceremony. Shortly \nthereafter, Tchisou's parents and brothers and sisters returned to \nFrance as they promised, where they live today.\n  Still focused on his educational goals and now living with his \nmarried sister in St. Paul, Tchisou enrolled at the University of \nMinnesota as an international student. However, he was required to pay \nout-of-State tuition and unfortunately had to drop out after one \nsemester when he ran out of money.\n  Determined to finish college, Tchisou is currently driving a forklift \nat the loading docks of a home improvement store, to save money for \ncollege while his immigration status is being sorted out. He was \nrecently named employee of the month. Tchisou hopes to re-enroll at the \nUniversity of Minnesota.\n  I acknowledge that Tchisou's parents broke the law. They overstayed \ntheir visas to remain in this country, which they should not have done. \nAnd they have since been deported. But I think it would be unfair to \npunish Tchisou for the actions of his parents. This private relief bill \nwould allow Tchisou the chance to live the American dream.\n  With the help of my good friend and colleague, the senior Senator \nfrom Georgia, Chairman Chambliss, we were able to pass this legislation \nlast year. I hope the Senate will be able to act on this important \nlegislation early this year so that Tchisou may enroll at the \nUniversity of Minnesota, graduate, and be an asset to our community.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n[[Page S494]]\n\n                                 S. 165\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Oregon Resource Conservation Act of 1996 \nto reauthorize the participation of the Bureau of Reclamation in the \nDeschutes River Conservancy, and for other purposes; to the Committee \non Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation, \ncosponsored by my colleague from Oregon, to reauthorize participation \nby the Bureau of Reclamation in the Deschutes River Conservancy for an \nadditional 10 years.\n  The Deschutes River Conservancy, formerly know as the Deschutes \nResources Conservancy, was originally authorized in 1996 as a pilot \nproject. It was so successful it was reauthorized in the 106th \nCongress. The Conservancy is designed to achieve local consensus for \non-the-ground projects to improve ecosystem health in the Deschutes \nRiver Basin.\n  The Deschutes River is truly one of Oregon's greatest resources. It \ndrains Oregon's high desert along the eastern front of the Cascades, \neventually flowing into the Columbia River. It is the State's most \nintensively used recreational river. It provides water to both \nirrigation projects and to the city of Bend, which is one of Oregon's \nfastest growing cities. The Deschutes Basin also contains hundreds of \nthousands of acres of productive forest and rangelands, serves the \ntreaty fishing and water rights of the Confederated Tribes of Warm \nSprings, and has Oregon's largest non-Federal hydroelectric project.\n  By all accounts, the Deschutes River Conservancy has been a huge \nsuccess. It has brought together diverse interests within the Basin, \nincluding irrigators, tribes, ranchers, environmentalists, an investor-\nowned utility, local businesses, as well as local elected officials and \nrepresentatives of State and Federal agencies. Together, the \nConservancy board members have been able to develop project criteria \nand identify a number of water quality, water quantity, fish passage \nand habitat improvement projects that could be funded. Over the years, \nprojects have been selected by consensus, and there must be a fifty-\nfifty cost share from non-Federal sources.\n  Over the past 8 years, they have been very successful at finding \ncooperative, market-based solutions to enhance the ecosystem in the \nbasin. The Conservancy has used this approach to restore over ninety \ncubic-feet-per-second of streamflow in the Deschutes Basin. In \naddition, by planting over 100,000 trees, installing miles of riparian \nfencing, removing berms and reconstructing stream beds, the Conservancy \nhas helped improve fish habitat and water quality along one hundred \nmiles of the Deschutes River and its tributaries.\n  The existing authorization provides for up to two million dollars \neach year for projects. This bill would continue that annual \nauthorization ceiling for 10 years. Funds are provided through the \nBureau of Reclamation, the group's lead Federal agency.\n  The Deschutes River Conservancy enjoys widespread support in Oregon. \nIt has very committed board members who represent diverse interests in \nthe Basin. The high caliber of their work, and their pragmatic approach \nto ecosystem restoration have been recognized by others outside the \nregion.\n  I am convinced that Federal participation in this project needs to \ncontinue. This organization has helped to avoid the conflicts over \nwater that we have seen in too many watersheds in the western United \nStates. I urge my colleagues to continue support for this project. Not \nonly is it important to central Oregon, but the Deschutes River \nConservancy can serve as a national model for cooperative watershed \nrestoration at the local level.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HATCH (for himself, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Cornyn, and Mrs. \n        Feinstein):\n  S. 167. A bill to provide for the protection of intellectual property \nrights, and for other purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Family \nEntertainment and Copyright Act of 2005. This important legislation \nconsists of a package of smaller intellectual property bills that the \nHouse and Senate have been working to enact since last Congress. This \nlegislation passed the Senate not once, but twice, during the waning \ndays of the last Congress. Unfortunately, though, it was doomed by a \nnon-germane amendment unrelated to intellectual property law. My hope \nis that we can work together this Congress to avoid this type of \npitfall, and I commit to work with other members to do so.\n  Before beginning my substantive discussion of the bill, I would like \nto thank my colleagues Senators Leahy, Cornyn, and Feinstein for their \nongoing efforts on this legislation. Just as it was last year, this \nlegislation is a group effort, and I want to take care to recognize the \ncontributions and their excellent work along with that of \nRepresentatives Sensenbrenner, Smith, Berman, and Conyers in the House.\n  Before going into a title-by-title discussion of the bill, I would \nlike to express my particular support for the Family Movie Act, which \nhas been included in this legislation. Chairman Lamar Smith and I \nworked on this bill last Congress. It's important legislation both to \nparents who want the ability to use new technologies to help shield \ntheir families from inappropriate content as well as the technology \ncompanies, such as ClearPlay in my home State of Utah, that are working \nto develop these technologies. The Family Movie Act will give parents \nmore say over what their children see, without limiting the creative \ncontrol of directors and movie studios.\n  Title I of this Act, the Artists' Rights and Theft Prevention Act of \n2005, (the ART Act), contains a slightly modified version of S. 1932, \nauthored by Senators Cornyn and Feinstein in the 108th Congress. This \nbill will close two significant gaps in our copyright laws that are \nfeeding some of the piracy now rampant on the Internet.\n  First, it criminalizes attempts to record movies off of theater \nscreens. These camcorded copies of new movies now appear on filesharing \nnetworks almost contemporaneously with the theatrical release of a \nfilm. Several States have already taken steps to criminalize this \nactivity, but providing a uniform Federal law--instead of a patchwork \nof State criminal statutes--will assist law enforcement officials in \ncombating the theft and redistribution of valuable intellectual \nproperty embodied in newly-released motion pictures.\n  Second, the bill will create a pre-registration system that will \npermit criminal penalties and statutory-damage awards. This will also \nprovide a tool for law enforcement officials combating the growing \nproblem of music and movies being distributed on filesharing networks \nand circulating on the Internet before they are even released. \nObviously, the increasingly frequent situation of copyrighted works\n\n[[Page S495]]\n\nbeing distributed illegally via the Internet before they are even made \navailable for sale to the public severely undercuts the ability of \ncopyright holders to receive fair and adequate compensation for their \nworks.\n  Title II of this Act, the Family Movie Act of 2005 (the FMA), \nresolves some ongoing disputes about the legality of so-called ``jump-\nand-skip'' technologies that companies like Clearplay in my home State \nof Utah have developed to permit family-friendly viewing of films that \nmay contain objectionable content. The FMA creates a narrowly defined \nsafe-harbor clarifying that distributors of such technologies will not \nface liability for copyright or trademark infringement, provided that \nthey comply with the requirements of the Act. I have been working with \nmy colleagues in the Senate and several leaders in the House--\nincluding, most importantly Chairmen Smith and Sensenbrenner--for the \npast couple of years to resolve this issue. The FMA will help to end \naggressive litigation threatening the viability of small companies like \nClearplay which are busy creating innovative technologies for consumers \nthat allow them to tailor their home viewing experience to their own \nindividual or family preferences.\n  The Family Movie Act creates a new exemption in section 110(11) of \nthe Copyright Act for skipping and muting audio and video content in \nmotion pictures during performances of an authorized copy of the motion \npicture taking place in the course of a private viewing in a household. \nThe version passed last year by the House explicitly excluded from the \nscope of the new copyright exemption so-called ``ad-skipping'' \ntechnologies that make changes, deletions, or additions to commercial \nadvertisements or to network or station promotional announcements that \nwould otherwise be displayed before, during, or after the performance \nof the motion picture. This provision was included on the House floor \nto address the concerns of some Members who were concerned that a court \nmight misread the new section 110(11) exemption to apply to ``ad-\nskipping''' cases, such as in the recent litigation involving ReplayTV.\n  In the Senate, however, some expressed concern that the inclusion of \nsuch explicit language could create unwanted inferences with respect to \nthe merits of the legal positions at the heart of recent ``ad-\nskipping'' litigation. Those issues remain unsettled in the courts, and \nit was never the intent of this legislation to resolve or affect those \nissues in any way. Indeed, the Copyright Act contains literally scores \nof similar exemptions, and none of those exemptions have been or should \nbe construed to imply anything about the legality of conduct falling \noutside their scope. As a result, the Copyright Office has now \nconfirmed that such an explicit exclusion is unnecessary to achieve the \ndesired outcome, which is to avoid application of this new exemption in \npotential future cases involving ad-skipping devices. In order to avoid \nunnecessary controversy, the Senate bill omits the exclusionary \nlanguage with the understanding that doing so does not in any way \nchange the scope of the bill.\n  That this change in no way affects the scope of the exemption is \nclear when considering that the new section 110(11) exemption protects \nthe ``making imperceptible . . . limited portions of audio or video \ncontent of a motion picture. . . .'' An advertisement, under the \nCopyright Act, is itself a ``motion picture,'' and thus a product or \nservice that enables the skipping of an entire advertisement, in any \nmedia, would be beyond the scope of the exemption. Moreover, the phrase \n``limited portions'' is intended to refer to portions that are both \nquantitatively and qualitatively insubstantial in relation to the work \nas a whole. Where any substantial part of a complete work, such as a \ncommercial advertisement, is made imperceptible, the new section \n110(11) exemption would not apply. The limited scope of this exemption \ndoes not, however, imply or show that such conduct or a technology that \nenables such conduct would be infringing. This legislation does not in \nany way deal with that issue. It means simply that such conduct and \nproducts enabling such conduct are not immunized from liability by this \nexemption.\n  This bill also differs from the version passed by the House last year \nin that it adds two ``savings clauses.'' The copyright savings clause \nmakes clear that there should be no spillover effect from the passage \nof this law: that is, nothing shall be construed to have any effect on \nrights, defenses, or limitations on rights granted under title 17, \nother than those explicitly provided for in the new section 110(11) \nexemption. The trademark savings clause clarifies that no inference can \nbe drawn that a person or company who fails to qualify for the \nexemption from trademark infringement found in this provision is \ntherefore liable for trademark infringement.\n  Title III of this Act, the National Film Preservation Act of 2004, \nwill reauthorize the National Film Preservation Board and the National \nFilm Preservation Foundation. These entities have worked successfully \nto recognize and preserve historically or culturally significant \nfilms--often by providing the grants and expertise that enable local \nhistorical societies to protect and preserve historically significant \nfilms for the local communities for which they are most important. This \nfine work will ensure that the history of the 20th century will be \npreserved and available to future generations.\n  As a conservative Senator from a socially conservative state, I \noccasionally take a few swings at the movie industry for the quality \nand content of the motion pictures they are currently creating, but I \nwill note for the record that I commend efforts to ensure that \nimportant artistic, cultural, and historically significant films are \npreserved for future generations. I commend my friend from Vermont for \nhis perseverance in reauthorizing Federal funds to continue this \nimportant effort.\n  Title IV of this act, the ``Preservation of Orphan Works Act,'' also \nensures the preservation of valuable historic records by correcting a \ntechnical error that unnecessarily narrows a limitation on the \ncopyright law applicable to librarians and archivists. This will \nstrengthen the ability of librarians and archivists to better meet the \nneeds of both researchers and ordinary individuals and will result in \ngreater accessibility of important works. I applaud my colleague in the \nHouse--Representative Howard Berman of California--for his efforts on \nthis bill and am pleased to see it included in this Senate package.\n  Just to conclude, I will again thank Ranking Democratic Member Leahy, \nSenator Cornyn, Chairmen Sensenbrenner and Smith, as well as Mr. \nConyers and Mr. Berman for their bicameral, bipartisan approach to \nthese bills and to intellectual property issues generally.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 167\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, today I join my colleagues, Senators Hatch, \nFeinstein, and Cornyn, introducing an important piece of bipartisan \nintellectual property legislation. The provisions of the ``Family \nEntertainment and Copyright Act of 2005'' are virtually identical to \nthose in the bill we passed in the waning days of the 108th Congress. \nUnfortunately, that package of intellectual property bills was hijacked \nin an effort to use it as a vehicle to pass unrelated legislation. The \neffort failed, and in the end so did Congress: we were not able to send \nto the President the most important package of intellectual property \nlegislation on last year's agenda. The legislation passed in the \nSenate--several times in fact--but there was simply not enough time for \nthe House of Representatives to act.\n  I am pleased that we were able to salvage two components of last \nyear's bill. As Congress came to a close, the House passed the Senate \nversion of the CREATE Act, legislation I cosponsored with Senator \nHatch. The new law will continue to encourage collaborative research \npartnerships between private industry and not-for-profits, such as \nuniversities. We were also able to send to the President the Anti-\ncounterfeiting Amendments Act, a version of Senator Biden's legislation \nthat my friend from Delaware has championed for several years. Both \nlaws are important, but our task remains incomplete.\n  It is time to enact the remaining components of the Family \nEntertainment and Copyright Act, to finish off the work of the 108th \nCongress as we begin the 109th.\n  Title I of the bill contains the ``Artists'' Rights and Theft \nPrevention Act,'' better known as the ART Act. This provision passed \nthe Senate as a standalone bill in June of 2004, and again as part of \nthe FECA bill at the end of the last Congress. The bill will make \nimportant inroads in the fight against movie piracy by criminalizing \nthe use of camcorders to pilfer movies from the big screen. It will \nalso direct the Register of Copyrights to create a registry of pre-\nrelease works in order to better address the problem of movie-theft \nbefore these works are offered for legal distribution.\n  The next title of the bill is the Family Movie Act, which will \npreserve the rights of families to watch motion pictures in the manner \nthey see fit. At the same time, the Act protects the rights of \ndirectors and copyright holders to maintain the artistic vision and \nintegrity of their works. A version of this legislation passed the \nother chamber in September of 2004, and it passed the Senate as part of \nthe FECA bill at the end of the 108th Congress.\n  Title III of the bill is the Film Preservation Act, legislation that \nI sponsored in the last Congress. A version of this bill, too, was part \nof the FECA bill that passed the Senate last Congress. The Film \nPreservation Act will allow the Library of Congress to continue its \nimportant work in preserving America's fading film treasures. The works \npreserved by this important program include silent-era films, avant-\ngarde works, ethnic films, newsreels, and home movies that are in many \nways more illuminating on the question of who we are as a society than \nthe Hollywood sound features kept and preserved by major studios. \nWhat's more, the bill will assist libraries, museums, and archives in \npreserving films, and in making those works available to researchers \nand the public.\n  Finally, the bill contains the Preservation of Orphan Works Act. This \nprovision corrects for a drafting error in the Sonny Bono Copyright \nTerm Extension Act. Correction of this error will allow libraries to \ncreate copies of certain copyrighted works, such as films and musical \ncompositions that are in the last 20 years of their copyright term, are \nno longer commercially exploited, and are not available at a reasonable \nprice. Again, this provision ensures that copies of culturally-\nilluminating works are not lost to history.\n  Anytime we enact a package of legislation as large as the ``Family \nEntertainment and Copyright Act,'' building consensus is difficult. \nHowever, this is a chamber built on collegiality and compromise, and \nwhile I may have crafted specific components of this package \ndifferently, I believe that the final result we have achieved is one \nworthy of enactment. The components of this package have already passed \nthe Senate at least once, and I have received assurances from the other \nchamber that the bill will receive swift consideration once it is \napproved in this body.\n  The legislative process is functioning well when we work with our \ncolleagues across the aisle, and it is at its best when we work on a \nbipartisan basis with our friends in the other chamber. This bill has \nbenefited from both. The agenda of the 109th Congress promises many \nissues that divide us, but this is not such a bill: It has garnered \nbroad consensus, and I hope that we can finally move to swiftly enact \nit.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, in the fall of 2003, I introduced S. 1932, \nthe Artists' Rights and Theft Prevention Act of 2003, along with my \nfriend from California, Senator Feinstein. As introduced, the ART Act \nwas a modest but necessary first step to combat the rampant piracy \nplaguing the motion picture, recording and general content industries. \nThe Bill focuses on the most egregious form of copyright piracy \nplaguing the entertainment industry today--the piracy of film, movies, \nand other copyrighted materials before copyright owners have had the \nopportunity to market fully their products.\n  Now, as part of a comprehensive package, ``the Family Entertainment \nand Copyright Act of 2005,'' it is even more significant. This package \ncontains a number of targeted, important reforms that help strengthen \nour intellectual property laws. I rise to express my strong support for \nthe bill and ask my colleagues to move it expeditiously.\n  Intellectual property laws and the American businesses that rely on \nthem deserve our strongest support. Our Nation was founded on a number \nof important ideas. One central one was that the value created by the \nwork and sweat of a person should be recognized as that person's \nproperty and should be protected. Protecting the creativity and capital \nthat American innovators invest to make our lives richer is the right \nthing to do. Failure to do so not only would diminish the quality of \nour individual lives, but our country would suffer too. Intellectual \nproperty-related industries are a central driver of our Nation's \neconomy and a staple of our international trade.\n  The copyright-based industries alone accounted for more than 5 \npercent of the U.S. GDP or $535,100,000,000 in 2001 and almost 6 \npercent of U.S. employment, and led all major industry sectors in \nforeign sales and exports in 2001, the last year for which we have \nfigures.\n  As the Justice Department recently has pointed out:\n\n\n[[Page S499]]\n\n\n       Ideas and the people who generate them serve as critical \n     resources both in our daily lives and in the stability and \n     growth of America's economy. The creation of intellectual \n     property--from designs for new products to artistic \n     creations--unleashes our Nation's potential, brings ideas \n     from concept to commerce, and drives future economic and \n     productivity gains. In the increasingly knowledge-driven, \n     information age economy, intellectual property is the new \n     coin of the realm. . . . [Report of the DOJ Task Force on \n     Intellectual Property, p. 7.]\n\n  As the DOJ IP Task Force Report notes, America's economy relies more \nand more on ideas we create, not things we make. We need to protect our \nNation's innovative and creative works with strong laws and enforcement \nof those laws because doing so is vital to our national economic \nsecurity.\n  Having noted and quoted the DOJ Report, I want to pause to thank the \nJustice Department and outgoing Attorney General John Ashcroft for \ntaking these issues seriously and for taking significant steps to \naddress them. The formation of the Intellectual Property Task Force \nspotlighted these issues at the Justice Department and the work of the \nTask Force, headed by David Israelite did a superb job in developing \ncomprehensive and serious steps better protecting our intellectual \nproperty interests. The DOJ engaged in serious domestic and \ninternational investigations and prosecutions against digital thieves \nwho have misused promising digital technology like the Internet to \nfurther their attacks on American businesses. General Ashcroft and the \nJustice Department, who deserve our gratitude for so many reasons, \ncertainly deserve it for their efforts on this area.\n  Having provided that foundation, let me discuss briefly some of the \nimportant provisions contained in this legislative package.\n  We have purposefully compiled a package of legislation that strikes a \nbalance between innovation and copyright protection. One needn't be \nsacrificed to encourage the other--rather they go hand-in-hand.\n  First, I would mention the Cornyn-Feinstein ``Artist's Rights and \nTheft Prevention Act'' or the ART Act. Notably, it contains a provision \nmaking it a felony to record a movie in a theater. One of the principal \nways that movie piracy happens is by thieves sitting in a movie \ntheater, or bribing a projectionist to help them, and recording movies \nwith small camcorders. These camcorded copies can then make their way \naround the world on the internet and usually land on the streets of \ncities around the world in pirated copies sold on the street, often the \nday the movie opens in the U.S. or even before the movie opens in many \ncountries.\n  All it takes is a single or a small handful of camcorded copies \ndistributed worldwide to have a devastating effect on a movie's \nprofitability. Movies are generally an investment of tens or hundreds \nof millions of dollars that rely on box office and home video and other \nsubsequent sales to recoup this investment. A camcorded copy released \nearly in any of these cycles can undermine the economics of this \nbusiness, and especially if they hit the streets or the internet while \nthe movie is still in theaters. This is theft, and it is theft that \nsupports organized crime groups, and perhaps, even terrorism. It \ndeserves to be stopped by the specter of a federal felony.\n  Its second key provision focuses on so-called ``pre-released'' works. \nBecause serious harm can be done to both the reputation of and market \nfor creative products if they are pirated before they actually come to \nmarket, we have included reforms in the ART Act and this package that \nmake it easier for the Justice Department to prosecute those who steal \nand distribute copies of copyrighted works on the internet before they \nare released to the public by their owners or authorized distributors. \nWe make the prosecutor's job easier by allowing certain presumptions \nwith regard to the harm caused, including the dollar amount and number \nof copies, necessary to allow the prosecutor to bring a felony action \nwhere the works in question are being prepared for commercial release \nbut have not been released to the public legitimately. This is fair \nbecause no one can legitimately believe that they are within their \nrights copying and distributing works that are not yet available in the \nmarketplace. Again this is a common sense concept, which deserves the \nsupport of the Congress.\n  Also, I would mention the Family Movie Act--another important \ncomponent of this package. This provision allows the use of certain, \nspecified technology to skip or mute content that may be objectionable \nto certain viewers when watching a movie at home, so long as no fixed \ncopy of the edited work is made.\n  Very few would argue that many of the movies produced today contain \nsignificant amounts of gratuitous sex, violence, foul language or other \npotentially objectionable content. A number of innovative companies \nhave stepped forward to solve this problem by providing filters that \ntag such scenes and allows consumers to tailor their viewing \nexperience.\n  This legislation is designed to solve an on-going controversy \nsurrounding the use of such technology. Specifically, there is \nlitigation pending over the issue of whether providing edited versions \nof movies to consumers creates a ``derivative work'' that violates the \nrights of those who created or own the copyrights and trademarks for \nthe original movies. The existence of this controversy arguably is \nhampering the development of the technology that families may find \nhelpful in protecting children from potentially objectionable content.\n  Let me make clear that this bill is not designed to deal with ad-\nskipping by consumers in the home. I know that there has been some \nmisinformation about this by groups who apparently oppose copyright \nprotections generally, but this bill has nothing to do with anything \nother than using a certain kind of technology to modify the viewing \nexperience of a movie to skip over objectionable content.\n  Finally, the two remaining provisions--though relatively small--are \nnot insignificant. The Film Preservation Act, legislation that I \nrecognize is particularly important to Senator Leahy, and I thank him \nfor his efforts in promoting it, will reauthorize a Library of Congress \nProgram dedicated to saving rare and significant films. Additionally, \nwe make a small but necessary change to the Sonny Bono Copyright Term \nExtension Act. Correction of this error will allow libraries to create \ncopies of certain copyrighted works, such as films and musical \ncompositions that are in the last 20 years of their copyright term, are \nno longer commercially exploited, and are not available at a reasonable \nprice.\n  Before I relinquish my time, I do want to thank a number of people \nwho have worked tirelessly on behalf of this bill. Allow me to thank \nDavid Jones and Tom Sydnor of the staff of Chairman Orrin Hatch, who is \nnot only our previous Judiciary Committee Chairman, but a leader on \ncopyright and intellectual property issues; Susan Davies and Dan Fine \nof Senator Leahy's staff, who also has long been a leader on \nintellectual property issues; and finally, David Hantman of Senator \nFeinstein's staff, a Senator with whom I am happy to have teamed to \nintroduce the ART Act in the last Congress.\n  Having begun with the staff, who rarely get mentioned as much as they \ndeserve for the great work they do, let me also thank the Senators they \nwork for: Senators Hatch, Leahy, and Feinstein for their co-\nsponsorship, as well as the Majority Leader, who has taken a personal \ninterest in this legislation and worked to make it happen.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, would the Senator yield for a quick \nquestion?\n  Mr. HATCH. I would be happy to yield for a question from the \ndistinguished Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. As the chairman knows, he and I and our other cosponsors \nhave worked throughout last Congress on the provisions of the Family \nEntertainment and Copyright Act of 2005 that we have introduced today. \nWith respect to the Family Movie Act portion of the bill, I just wanted \nto raise the point that there had been some concern over the potential \neffect of the FMA on future cases involving ``ad skipping'' \ntechnologies and ask if you would have any objection to including in \nthe record the relevant portion of the floor discussion on that issue \nfrom last Congress?\n  Mr. HATCH. I thank my friend, the Senator from Texas, for that \nreminder. I would certainly have no objection to entering our previous \ncolloquy into the Record again and ask unanimous consent that it appear \nafter our remarks.\n\n[[Page S500]]\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, Section 102 of the ART Act establishes a \nnew provision of Title 18 entitled, ``Unauthorized Recording of Motion \nPictures in a Motion Picture Exhibition Facility.'' I ask Senator \nCornyn, what is the purpose of this provision?\n  Mr. CORNYN. Section 102 addresses a serious piracy issue facing the \nmovie business: the use of camcorders in a motion picture theater. Sad \nto say, there are people who go to the movie theater, generally during \npre-opening ``screenings'' or during the first weekend of theatrical \nrelease, and using sophisticated digital equipment, record the movie. \nThey're not trying to save $8.00 so they can see the movie again. \nInstead, they sell the camcorded version to a local production factory \nor to an overseas producer, where it is converted into DVDs or similar \nproducts and sold on the street for a few dollars per copy. This misuse \nof camcorders is a significant factor in the estimated $3.5 billion per \nyear of losses the movie industry suffers because of hard goods piracy. \nEven worse, these camcorded versions are posted on the Internet through \n``P2P'' networks such as KaZaA, Grokster and Morpheus--and made \navailable for millions to download. The goal of our bill is to provide \na potent weapon in the arsenal of prosecutors to stem the piracy of \ncommercially valuable motion pictures at its source.\n  Mr. HATCH. I have heard it said that this bill could be used against \na salesperson or a customer at stores such as Best Buy or Circuit City \nif he or she were to point a video camera at a television screen \nshowing a movie. Is this cause for concern?\n  Mr. CORNYN. Absolutely not. The offense is only applicable to \ntransmitting or copying a movie in a motion picture exhibition \nfacility, which has to be a movie theater or similar venue ``that is \nbeing used primarily for the exhibition of a copyrighted motion \npicture.'' In the example of Best Buy--the store is being used \nprimarily to sell electronic equipment, not to exhibit motion pictures. \nFor the same reason, the statute would not cover a university student \nwho records a short segment of a film being shown in film class, as the \nvenue is being used primarily as a classroom, and not as a movie \ntheater.\n  Mr. HATCH. Does the Senator from California agree with your colleague \nfrom Texas?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Absolutely on all points.\n  Mr. HATCH. I have also heard some say that this statute could be used \nto prosecute someone for camcording a DVD at his home. Is this a fair \nconcern?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. No, it is not. The definition of a motion picture \nexhibition facility includes the concept that the exhibition has to be \n``open to the public or is made to an assembled group of viewers \noutside of a normal circle of a family and its social acquaintances.'' \nThis definition makes clear that someone recording from a television in \nhis home does not meet that definition. It is important to emphasize \nthat the clause ``open to the public'' applies specifically to the \nexhibition, not to the facility. An exhibition in a place open to the \npublic that is itself not made to the public is not the subject of this \nbill.\n  Thus, for example, a university film lab may be ``open to the \npublic.'' However, a student who is watching a film in that lab for his \nor her own study or research would not be engaging in an exhibition \nthat is ``open to the public.'' Thus, if that student copied an excerpt \nfrom such an exhibition, he or she would not be subject to liability \nunder the bill.\n  Mr. HATCH. Do the users of hearing aids, cell phones or similar \ndevices have anything to fear from this statute?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Of course not. The statute covers only a person who \n``knowingly uses or attempts to use an audiovisual recording device to \ntransmit or make a copy of a motion picture or other audiovisual work \nprotected under Title 17, or any part thereof. . . .'' In other words, \nthe defendant would have to be making, or attempting to make, a copy \nthat is itself an audiovisual work, or make, or attempt to make, a \ntransmission embodying an audiovisual work, as that term is defined in \nSection 101 of Title 17. As such, the Act would not reach the conduct \nof a person who uses a hearing aid, a still camera, or a picture phone \nto capture an image or mere sound from the movie.\n  Mr. HATCH. It appears that there is no fair use exception to this \nprovision. Is that correct?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. This is a criminal provision under Title 18, not a \ncopyright provision under Title 17. Accordingly, there is no fair use \nexception included. However, Federal prosecutors should use their \ndiscretion not to bring criminal prosecutions against activities within \nmovie theaters that would constitute fair use under the copyright laws. \nThe object of this legislation is to prevent the copying and \ndistribution of motion pictures in a manner that causes serious \ncommercial harm. This legislation is not intended to chill legitimate \nfree speech.\n  Mr. HATCH. Does the Senator from Texas agree?\n  Mr. CORNYN. Yes, on all points.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, would the chairman yield for a question?\n  Mr. HATCH. I would be happy to yield for a question from the \ndistinguished Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. As the chairman knows, he and I and our other co-sponsors \nhave worked throughout this Congress on the provisions of the Family \nEntertainment and Copyright Act of 2004 that we have introduced today. \nI just want to confirm what I believe to be our mutual understanding \nabout the effect of certain provisions of the Family Movie Act. Title \nII of the Family Entertainment and Copyright Act of 2004 that we \nintroduced today modifies slightly the Family Movie Act provisions of \nH.R. 4077 as passed by the House of Representatives. That bill created \na new exemption in section 110(11) of the Copyright Act for skipping \nand muting audio and video content in motion pictures during \nperformances that take place in the course of a private viewing in a \nhousehold from an authorized copy of the motion picture. The House-\npassed version specifically excluded from the scope of the new \ncopyright exemption computer programs or technologies that make \nchanges, deletions, or additions to commercial advertisements or to \nnetwork or station promotional announcements that would otherwise be \ndisplayed before, during, or after the performance of the motion \npicture.\n  My understanding is that this provision reflected a ``belt and \nsuspenders'' approach that was adopted to quiet the concerns of some \nMembers in the House who were concerned that a court might misread the \nstatute to apply to ``ad-skipping'' cases. Some Senators, however, \nexpressed concern that the inclusion of such explicit language could \ncreate unwanted inferences as to the ``ad-skipping'' issues at the \nheart of the recent litigation. Those issues remain unsettled, and it \nwas never the intent of this legislation to resolve or affect those \nissues. In the meantime, the Copyright Office has confirmed that such a \nprovision is unnecessary to achieve the intent of the bill, which is to \navoid application of this new exemption in potential future cases \ninvolving ``ad-skipping'' devices; therefore, the Senate amendment we \noffer removes the unnecessary exclusionary language.\n  Would the chairman confirm for the Senators present his understanding \nof the intent and effect, or perhaps stated more appropriately, the \nlack of any effect, of the Senate amendment on the scope of this bill?\n  Mr. HATCH. My cosponsor, Senator Cornyn, raises an important point. \nWhile we removed the ``ad-skipping'' language from the statute to avoid \nthis unnecessary controversy, you are absolutely correct that this does \nnot in any way change the scope of the bill. The bill protects the \n``making imperceptible . . . limited portions of audio or video content \nof a motion picture . . .'' An advertisement, under the Copyright Act, \nis itself a ``motion picture,'' and thus a product or service that \nenables the skipping of an entire advertisement, in any media, would be \nbeyond the scope of the exemption. Moreover, the phrase ``limited \nportions'' is intended to refer to portions that are both \nquantitatively and qualitatively insubstantial in relation to the work \nas a whole. Where any substantial part of a complete work, such as a \ncommercial advertisement, is made imperceptible, the new section \n110(11) exemption would not apply.\n  The limited scope of this exemption does not, however, imply or show \nthat\n\n[[Page S501]]\n\nsuch a product would be infringing. This legislation does not in any \nway deal with that issue. It means simply that such a product is not \nimmunized from liability by this exemption.\n  Mr. CORNYN. I thank the chairman. I am pleased that we share a common \nunderstanding. If the chairman would yield for one more question about \nthe Family Movie Act?\n  Mr. HATCH. Certainly.\n  Mr. CORNYN. This bill also differs from the House-passed version \nbecause it adds two ``savings clauses.'' As I understand it, the \n``copyright'' savings clause makes clear that there should be no \n``spillover effect'' from the passage of this law: that is, nothing \nshall be construed to have any effect on rights, defenses, or \nlimitations on rights granted under title 17, other than those \nexplicitly provided for in the new section 110(11) exemption. The \nsecond, relating to trademark, clarifies that no inference can be drawn \nthat a person or company who fails to qualify for the exemption from \ntrademark infringement found in this provision is therefore liable for \ntrademark infringement. Is that the chairman's understanding as well?\n  Mr. HATCH. Yes it is. Let me ask that a copy of the section-by-\nsection analysis of the Family Movie Act as amended by the Senate be \nincluded in the Record. This section-by-section analysis contains a \nmore complete analysis of the bill as proposed today in the Senate, \nincluding the limited changes made by the bill Senators Leahy, Cornyn, \nBiden, and I offer today.\n  The analysis follows.\n\n Section-by-Section Analysis of the Family Movie Act of 2004, Amended \n                        and Passed by the Senate\n\n\n                                overview\n\n       Title II of the Family Entertainment and Copyright Act of \n     2004 incorporates the House-passed provision of the Family \n     Movie Act of 2004, with limited changes as reflected in this \n     section-by-section analysis. As discussed herein, these \n     changes are not intended to and do not affect the scope, \n     effect or application of the bill.\n       The purpose of the Family Movie Act is to empower private \n     individuals to use technology to skip and mute material that \n     they find objectionable in movies, without impacting \n     established doctrines of copyright or trademark law or those \n     whose business models depend upon advertising. This amendment \n     to the law should be narrowly construed to effect its \n     intended purpose only. The sponsors of the legislation have \n     been careful to tailor narrowly the legislation to clearly \n     allow specific, consumer-directed activity and not to open or \n     decide collateral issues or to affect any other potential \n     or actual disputes in the law.\n       The bill as proposed in the Senate makes clear that, under \n     certain conditions, ``making imperceptible'' of limited \n     portions of audio or video content of a motion picture--that \n     is, skipping and muting limited portions of movies without \n     adding any content--as well as the creation or provision of a \n     computer program or other technology that enables such making \n     imperceptible, does not violate existing copyright or \n     trademark laws. That is true whether the movie is on \n     prerecorded media, like a DVD, or is transmitted to the home, \n     as through pay-per-view and ``video-on-demand'' services.\n     Subsection (a): Short Title\n       Subsection (a) sets forth the short title of the bill as \n     the Family Movie Act of 2004.\n     Subsection (b): Exemption from Copyright and Trademark \n         Infringement for Skipping of Audio or Video Content of \n         Motion Pictures\n       Subsection (b) is the Family Movie Act core provision and \n     creates a new exemption at section 110(11) of the Copyright \n     Act for the ``making imperceptible'' of limited portions of \n     audio or video content of a motion picture during a \n     performance in a private household. This new exemption sets \n     forth a number of conditions to ensure that it achieves its \n     intended effect while remaining carefully circumscribed and \n     avoiding any unintended consequences. The conditions that \n     allow an exemption, which are discussed in more detail below, \n     consist of the following:\n       The making imperceptible must be ``by or at the direction \n     of a member of a private household.'' This legislation \n     contemplates that any altered performances of the motion \n     picture would be made either directly by the viewer or at the \n     direction of a viewer where the viewer is exercising \n     substantial choice over the types of content they choose to \n     skip or mute.\n       The making imperceptible must occur ``during a performance \n     in or transmitted to the household for private home \n     viewing.'' Thus, this provision does not exempt an \n     unauthorized ``public performance'' of an altered version.\n       The making imperceptible must be ``from an authorized copy \n     of a motion picture.'' Thus, skipping and muting from an \n     unauthorized or ``bootleg'' copy of a motion picture would \n     not be exempt.\n       No ``fixed copy'' of the altered version of the motion \n     picture may be created by the computer program or other \n     technology that makes imperceptible portions of the audio or \n     video content of the motion picture. This provision makes \n     clear that services or technologies that make a fixed copy of \n     the altered version are not afforded the benefit of this \n     exemption.\n       The ``making imperceptible'' of limited portions of a \n     motion picture does not include the addition of audio or \n     video content over or in place of other content, such as \n     placing a modified image of a person, a product, or an \n     advertisement in place of another, or adding content of any \n     kind.\n       These limitations, and other operative provisions of this \n     new section 110(11) exemption, merit further elaboration as \n     to their purposes and effects.\n       The bill makes clear that the ``making imperceptible'' of \n     limited portions of audio or video content of a motion \n     picture must be done by or at the direction of a member of a \n     private household. While this limitation does not require \n     that the individual member of the private household exercise \n     ultimate decision-making over each and every scene or element \n     of dialog in the motion picture that is to be made \n     imperceptible, it does require that the making imperceptible \n     be made at the direction of that individual in response to \n     the individualized preferences expressed by that individual. \n     The test of ``at the direction of an individual'' would be \n     satisfied when an individual selects preferences from among \n     options that are offered by the technology.\n       An example is the C1earPlay model. C1earPlay provides so-\n     called `` filter files'' that allow a viewer to express his \n     or her preferences in a number of different categories, \n     including language, violence, drug content, sexual content, \n     and several others. The version of the movie that the viewer \n     sees depends upon the preferences expressed by that viewer. \n     Such a model would fall under the liability limitation of the \n     Family Movie Act.\n       This limitation, however, would not allow a program \n     distributor, such as a provider of video-on-demand services, \n     a cable or satellite channel, or a broadcaster, to make \n     imperceptible limited portions of a movie in order to provide \n     an altered version of that movie to all of its customers, \n     which could violate a number of the copyright owner's \n     exclusive rights, or to make a determination of scenes to be \n     skipped or dialog to be muted and to offer to its viewers no \n     more of a choice than to view an original or an altered \n     version of that film. Some element of individualized \n     preferences and control must be present such that the viewer \n     exercises substantial choice over the types of content they \n     choose to skip or mute.\n       It is also important to emphasize that the new section \n     110(11) exemption is targeted narrowly and specifically at \n     the act of ``making imperceptible'' limited portions of audio \n     or video content of a motion picture during a performance \n     that occurs in, or that is transmitted to, a private \n     household for private home viewing. This section would not \n     exempt from liability an otherwise infringing performance, or \n     a transmission of a performance, during which limited \n     portions of audio or video content of the motion picture are \n     made imperceptible. In other words, where a performance in a \n     household or a transmission of a performance to a household \n     is done lawfully, the making imperceptible limited portions \n     of audio or video content of the motion picture during that \n     performance, consistent with the requirements of this new \n     section, will not result in infringement liability. \n     Similarly, an infringing performance in a household, or an \n     infringing transmission of a performance to a household, are \n     not rendered non-infringing by section 110(11) by virtue of \n     the fact that limited portions of audio or video content of \n     the motion picture being performed are made imperceptible \n     during such performance or transmission in a manner \n     consistent with that section.\n       The bill also provides additional guidance, if not an exact \n     definition, of what the term ``making imperceptible'' means. \n     The bill provides specifically that the term ``making \n     imperceptible'' does not include the addition of audio or \n     video content that is performed or displayed over or in place \n     of existing content in a motion picture. This is intended to \n     make clear in the text of the statute what has been expressed \n     throughout the consideration of this legislation, which is \n     that the Family Movie Act does not enable the addition of \n     content of any kind, including the making imperceptible of \n     audio or video content by replacing it or by superimposing \n     other content over it. In other words, for purposes of \n     section 110(11), ``making imperceptible'' refers solely to \n     skipping scenes and portions of scenes or muting audio \n     content from the original, commercially available version of \n     the motion picture. No other modifications of the content are \n     addressed or immunized by this legislation.\n       The House sponsor of this legislation noted in his \n     explanation of his bill, and the Senate is also aware, that \n     some copy protection technologies rely on matter placed into \n     the audio or video signal. The phrase ``limited portions of \n     audio or video content of a motion picture'' means what it \n     would naturally seem to mean (i.e., the actual content of \n     the motion picture) and does not refer to any component of \n     a copy protection scheme or technology. This provision \n     does not allow the skipping of technologies or other copy-\n     protection-related matter for the purpose of defeating \n     copy protection. Rather, it is expected that skipping and \n     muting of content\n\n[[Page S502]]\n\n     in the actual motion picture will be skipped or muted at \n     the direction of the viewer based on that viewer's desire \n     to avoid seeing or hearing the action or sound in the \n     motion picture. Skipping or muting done for the purpose of \n     or having the effect of avoiding copy protection \n     technologies would be an abuse of the safe harbor outlined \n     in this legislation and may violate section 1201 of title \n     17.\n       Violating the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, and \n     particularly its anti-circumvention provisions, is not \n     necessary to enable technology of the kind contemplated under \n     the Family Movie Act. Although the amendment to section 110 \n     provides that it is not an infringement of copyright to \n     engage in the conduct that is the subject of the Family Movie \n     Act, the Act does not provide any exemption from the anti-\n     circumvention provisions of section 1201 of title 17, or from \n     any other provision of chapter 12 of title 17. It would not \n     be a defense to a claim of violation of section 1201 that the \n     circumvention is for the purpose of engaging in the conduct \n     covered by this new exemption in section 110(11), just as it \n     is not a defense under section 1201 that the circumvention is \n     for the purpose of engaging in any other non-infringing \n     conduct.\n       There are a number of companies currently providing the \n     type of products and services covered by this Act. The Family \n     Movie Act is intended to facilitate the offering of such \n     products and services, and it certainly creates no impediment \n     to the technology employed by those companies. Indeed, it is \n     important to underscore the fact that the support for such \n     technology and consumer offerings that is reflected in this \n     legislation is driven in some measure by the desire for \n     copyright law to be respected and to ensure that technology \n     is deployed in a way that supports the continued creation and \n     protection of entertainment and information products that \n     rely on copyright protection. This legislation reflects the \n     firm expectation that those rights and the interests of \n     viewers in their homes can work together in the context \n     defined in this bill. Any suggestion that support for the \n     exercise of viewer choice in modifying their viewing \n     experience of copyrighted works requires violation of either \n     the copyright in the work or of the copy protection schemes \n     that provide protection for such work should be rejected as \n     counter to legislative intent or technological necessity.\n       The House-passed bill included an explicit exclusion to the \n     new section 110(11) exemption in cases involving the making \n     imperceptible of commercial advertisements or network or \n     station promotional announcements. This provision was added \n     on the House floor to respond to concerns expressed by \n     Members during the House Judiciary Committee markup that the \n     bill might be read somehow to exempt from copyright \n     infringement liability devices that allow for skipping of \n     advertisements in the playback of recorded television (so \n     called ``ad-skipping'' devices). Such a reading is not \n     consistent with the language of the bill or its intent.\n       The phrase ``limited portions of audio or video content of \n     a motion picture'' applies only to the skipping and muting of \n     scenes or dialog that are part of the motion picture itself, \n     and not to the skipping of commercial advertisements, which \n     are themselves considered motions pictures under the \n     Copyright Act. It also should be noted that the phrase \n     ``limited portions'' is intended to refer to portions that \n     are both quantitatively and qualitatively insubstantial in \n     relation to the work as a whole. Where any substantial part \n     of a complete work (including a commercial advertisement) is \n     made imperceptible, the section 110(11) exemption would not \n     apply.\n       The House-passed bill adopted a ``belt and suspenders'' \n     approach to this question by adding exclusionary language in \n     the statute itself. Ultimately that provision raised concerns \n     in the Senate that such exclusionary language would result in \n     an inference that the bill somehow expresses an opinion, or \n     even decides, the unresolved legal questions underlying \n     recent litigation related to these so-called ``ad-skipping'' \n     devices. In the meantime, the Copyright Office also made \n     clear that such exclusionary language is not necessary. In \n     other words, the exclusionary language created unnecessary \n     controversy without adding any needed clarity to the statute.\n       Thus, the Senate amendment omits the exclusionary language \n     while leaving the scope and application of the bill exactly \n     as it was when it passed the House. The legislation does not \n     provide a defense in cases involving so-called ``ad-\n     skipping'' devices, and it also does not affect the legal \n     issues underlying such litigation, one way or another. \n     Consistent with the intent of the legislation to fix a narrow \n     and specific copyright issue, this bill seeks very clearly to \n     avoid unnecessarily interfering with current business models, \n     especially with respect to advertising, promotional \n     announcements, and the like. Simply put, the bill as amended \n     in the Senate is narrowly targeted to the use of technologies \n     and services that filter out content in movies that a viewer \n     finds objectionable, and it in no way relates to or affects \n     the legality of so-called ``ad-skipping'' technologies.\n       There are a variety of services currently in litigation \n     that distribute actual copies of altered movies. This type of \n     activity is not covered by the section 110(11) exemption \n     created by the Family Movie Act. There is a basic distinction \n     between a viewer choosing to alter what is visible or audible \n     when viewing a film, the focus of this legislation, and a \n     separate entity choosing to create and distribute a single, \n     altered version to members of the public. The section 110(11) \n     exemption only applies to viewer directed changes to the \n     viewing experience, and not the making or distribution of \n     actual altered copies of the motion picture.\n       Related to this point, during consideration of this \n     legislation in the House there were conflicting expert \n     opinions on whether fixation is required to infringe the \n     derivative work right under the Copyright Act, as well as \n     whether evidence of Congressional intent in enacting the 1976 \n     Copyright Act supports the notion that fixation should not be \n     a prerequisite for the preparation of an infringing \n     derivative work. This legislation should not be construed to \n     be predicated on or to take a position on whether fixation is \n     necessary to violate the derivative work right, or whether \n     the conduct that is immunized by this legislation would be \n     infringing in the absence of this legislation. Subsection (b) \n     also provides a savings clause to make clear that the newly-\n     created copyright exemption is not to be construed to have \n     any effect on rights, defenses, or limitations on rights \n     granted under title 17, other than those explicitly provided \n     for in the new section 110(11) exemption.\n     Subsection (c): Exemption from Trademark Infringement\n       Subsection (c) provides for a limited exemption from \n     trademark infringement for those engaged in the conduct \n     described in the new section 110(11) of the Copyright Act. In \n     short, this subsection makes clear that a person engaging in \n     the conduct described in section 110(11)--the ``making \n     imperceptible'' of portions of audio or video content of a \n     motion picture or the creation or provision of technology to \n     enable such making available--is not subject to trademark \n     infringement liability based on that conduct, provided that \n     person's conduct complies with the requirements of section \n     110(11). This section provides a similar exemption for a \n     manufacturer, licensee or licensor of technology that enables \n     such making imperceptible, but such manufacturer, licensee or \n     licensor is subject to the additional requirement that it \n     ensure that the technology provides a clear and conspicuous \n     notice at the beginning of each performance that the \n     performance of the motion picture is altered from the \n     performance intended by the director or the copyright holder.\n       Of course, nothing in this section would immunize someone \n     whose conduct, apart from the narrow conduct described by \n     110(11), rises to the level of a Lanham Act violation. For \n     example, someone who provides technology to enable the making \n     imperceptible limited portions of a motion picture consistent \n     with section 110(11) could not be held liable on account of \n     such conduct under the Trademark Act, but if in providing \n     such . . .\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/01/25/senate-section/article/S502-1", "month": "01", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S502-S504]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n        SENATE RESOLUTION 10--HONORING THE LIFE OF JOHNNY CARSON\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska (for himself, Mr. Hagel, Mr. Kennedy, Mrs. \nFeinstein, and Mr. Inouye) submitted the following resolution; which \nwas considered and agreed to:\n\n                               S.

Con. Res. 4\n\n       Whereas the Boy Scouts of America was incorporated on \n     February 8, 1910, and received a Federal charter on June 15, \n     1916, which is codified as chapter 309 of title 36, United \n     States Code;\n       Whereas section 30902 of title 36, United States Code, \n     states that it is the purpose of the Boy Scouts of America to \n     promote, through organization, and cooperation with other \n     agencies, the ability of boys to do things for themselves and \n     others, to train them in scoutcraft, and to teach them \n     patriotism, courage, self-reliance, and kindred virtues;\n       Whereas, since its inception, millions of Americans of \n     every race, creed, and religion have participated in the Boy \n     Scouts of America, and the Boy Scouts of America, as of \n     October 1, 2004, utilizes more than 1,200,000 adult \n     volunteers to serve 2,863,000 youth members organized in \n     121,051 units;\n       Whereas the Department of Defense and members of the Armed \n     Forces have a long history of supporting the activities of \n     the Boy Scouts of America and individual Boy Scout troops \n     inside the United States, and section 2606 of title 10, \n     United States Code, enacted in 1988, specifically authorizes \n     the Department of Defense to cooperate with and assist the \n     Boy Scouts of America in establishing and providing \n     facilities and services for members of the Armed Forces and \n     their dependents, and civilian employees of the Department of \n     Defense and their dependents, at locations outside the United \n     States;\n       Whereas sections 4682, 7541, and 9682 of title 10, United \n     States Code, authorize the Department of Defense to sell and, \n     in certain cases, donate obsolete or excess material to the \n     Boy Scouts of America to support its activities; and\n       Whereas Public Law 92-249, enacted on March 10, 1972, and \n     codified as section 2554 of title 10, United States Code, \n     recognizes that Boy Scout Jamborees may be held on military \n     installations and authorizes the Department of Defense, in \n     support of Boy Scout Jamborees, to lend certain equipment and \n     to provide transportation from the United States or military \n     commands overseas, and return, at no expense to the United \n     States Government, and to provide other personnel services \n     and logistical support to the Boy Scouts of America to \n     support national and world gatherings of Boy Scouts at events \n     known as Boy Scout Jamborees: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That it is the sense of the Congress that the \n     Department of Defense should continue to exercise its long-\n     standing statutory authority to support the activities of the \n     Boy Scouts of America, in particular the periodic national \n     and world Boy Scout Jamborees.\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, today I rise to submit a \nconcurrent resolution on behalf of myself, Senators Allard, Allen, Ben \nNelson of Nebraska, Sessions and Enzi expressing the sense of the \nCongress that the Department of Defense should continue to exercise its \nstatutory authority to support the activities of the Boy Scouts of \nAmerica, in particular the periodic national and world Boy Scout \nJamborees.\n  I ask unanimous consent that, the attached letter from Secretary of \nDefense Rumsfeld be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                     The Secretary of Defense,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, December 2, 2004.\n     The Speaker,\n     House of Representatives,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Speaker: The Department of Defense (DOD) has a \n     long tradition of providing worldwide support for Boy Scout \n     activities, which have been mutually beneficial to the \n     Department and the Boy Scouts of America. I am especially \n     appreciative of the efforts undertaken by numerous Scouting \n     organizations to assist Service members deployed in the war \n     on terrorism.\n       As you are aware, the American Civil Liberties Union sued \n     the Department of Defense, the Department of Housing and \n     Urban Development, and others, challenging the various \n     statutory authorizations of support for the Boy Scouts on the \n     grounds that they violate the Establishment Clause of the \n     First Amendment. The Department of Justice is fighting the \n     lawsuit, and the Department of Defense is assisting in all \n     respects.\n       The Department of Defense entered a ``partial settlement'' \n     in the litigation, which apparently resolved a small \n     component of the overall lawsuit. I was unaware of this \n     settlement, but I have since been advised that this agreement \n     does not fundamentally change the long-standing relationship \n     between America's Boy Scouts and U.S. military installations. \n     I have been assured that Scouts will continue to have access \n     to our facilities for camping, hiking, fishing, etc.\n       I am concerned with the impression left by the ACLU in \n     recent reporting of this matter that suggests the Department \n     of Defense is changing its relationship with the Boy Scouts. \n     Recently, I supported Sense of Congress resolutions \n     introduced in the House and Senate that the Department should \n     continue to exercise its statutory authority to\n\n[[Page S504]]\n\n     support the activities of the Boy Scouts, in particular the \n     periodic national and world Boy Scout Jamborees.\n       I also have reviewed legislation recently introduced that \n     affirms Congressional support for Scouting organizations. I \n     believe this legislation is important and welcome the \n     opportunity to work with you as it moves forward.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Donald Rumsfeld.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 5--CONGRATULATING THE PEOPLE OF UKRAINE \n                                  FOR\n  CONDUCTING A DEMOCRATIC, TRANSPARENT, AND FAIR RUNOFF PRESIDENTIAL \n                   ELECTION ON DECEMBER 26, 2004, AND\n   CONGRATULATING VIKTOR YUSHCHENKO ON HIS ELECTION AS PRESIDENT OF \n           UKRAINE AND HIS COMMITMENT TO DEMOCRACY AND REFORM\n\n  Mr. LUGAR (for himself and Mr. Biden) submitted the following \nconcurrent resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Foreign \nRelations:\n\n                             S. Con. Res. 5\n\n       Whereas the establishment of a democratic, transparent, and \n     fair election process for the 2004 presidential election in \n     Ukraine and of a genuinely democratic political system have \n     been prerequisites for that country's full integration into \n     the international community of democracies;\n       Whereas the Government of Ukraine has accepted numerous \n     specific commitments governing the conduct of elections as a \n     participating State of the Organization for Security and \n     Cooperation in Europe (OSCE);\n       Whereas the election of Ukraine's next president was seen \n     as an unambiguous test of the extent of the Ukrainian \n     authorities' commitment to implement these standards and \n     build a democratic society based on free elections and the \n     rule of law;\n       Whereas a genuinely free and fair election requires \n     government and public authorities to ensure that candidates \n     and political parties enjoy equal treatment before the law \n     and that government resources are not employed to the \n     advantage of individual candidates or political parties;\n       Whereas a genuinely free and fair election requires the \n     full transparency of laws and regulations governing \n     elections, multiparty representation on election commissions, \n     and unobstructed access by candidates, political parties, and \n     domestic and international observers to all election \n     procedures, including voting and vote-counting in all areas \n     of the country;\n       Whereas efforts by national and local officials and others \n     acting at the behest of such officials to impose obstacles to \n     free assembly, free speech, and a free and fair political \n     campaign took place throughout Ukraine during the entire 2004 \n     presidential election campaign without condemnation or \n     remedial action by the Government of Ukraine;\n       Whereas on October 31, 2004, Ukraine held the first round \n     of its presidential election and on November 21, 2004, \n     Ukraine held a runoff presidential election between the two \n     leading candidates, Prime Minister Viktor Yanukovich and \n     opposition leader Viktor Yushchenko;\n       Whereas a consensus of Ukrainian and international election \n     observers determined that the runoff election did not meet a \n     considerable number of international standards for democratic \n     elections, and these observers specifically declared that \n     state resources were abused in support of Viktor Yanukovich, \n     and that illegal voting by absentee ballot, multiple voting, \n     assaults on electoral observers and journalists, and the use \n     of counterfeit ballots were widespread;\n       Whereas following the runoff presidential election on \n     November 21, 2004, tens of thousands of Ukrainian citizens \n     engaged in peaceful demonstrations in Kiev and elsewhere to \n     protest the unfair election and the declaration by the \n     Ukrainian Central Election Commission that Viktor Yanukovich \n     had won a majority of the votes;\n       Whereas, on November 25, 2004, the Ukrainian Supreme Court \n     blocked the publication of the official runoff election \n     results thus preventing the inauguration of the next \n     president of Ukraine until the Supreme Court examined the \n     reports of voter fraud;\n       Whereas on November 27, 2004, the Parliament of Ukraine \n     passed a resolution declaring that there were violations of \n     law during the runoff presidential election on November 21, \n     2004, and that the results of the election did not reflect \n     the will of the Ukrainian people;\n       Whereas on December 1, 2004, the Parliament of Ukraine \n     passed a no confidence motion regarding the government of \n     Prime Minister Viktor Yanukovich;\n       Whereas European mediators and current Ukrainian President \n     Leonid Kuchma began discussions on December 1, 2004, to \n     attempt to work out a resolution to the standoff between the \n     supporters of both presidential candidates;\n       Whereas on December 3, 2004, the Ukrainian Supreme Court \n     ruled that the runoff presidential election on November 21, \n     2004, was invalid and ordered a new presidential election to \n     take place on December 26, 2004;\n       Whereas on December 8, 2004, the Parliament of Ukraine \n     passed laws to reform the Ukrainian electoral process, \n     including to reconstitute the Ukrainian Central Election \n     Commission, and to close loopholes for fraud in preparation \n     for a new presidential election;\n       Whereas on December 26, 2004, the people of Ukraine again \n     went to the polls to elect the next president of Ukraine in \n     what the consensus of domestic and international observers \n     declared as a more democratic, transparent, and fair election \n     process with fewer problems than the previous two rounds;\n       Whereas on January 10, 2005, the election victory of \n     opposition leader Viktor Yushchenko was certified by the \n     Ukrainian Central Election Commission; and\n       Whereas the runoff presidential election on December 26, \n     2004, signifies a turning point for Ukraine which offers new \n     hope and opportunity to the people of Ukraine: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That Congress--\n       (1) commends the people and Government of Ukraine for their \n     commitment to democracy and their determination to end the \n     political crisis in that country in a peaceful and democratic \n     manner;\n       (2) congratulates the people and Government of Ukraine for \n     ensuring a free and fair runoff presidential election which \n     represents the true choice of the Ukrainian people;\n       (3) congratulates Viktor Yushchenko on his election as \n     President of Ukraine;\n       (4) applauds the Ukrainian presidential candidates, the \n     European Union and other European representatives, and the \n     United States Government for the role they played in helping \n     to find a peaceful resolution of the crisis;\n       (5) acknowledges and welcomes the strong relationship \n     formed between the United States and Ukraine and expresses \n     its strong and continuing support for the efforts of the \n     Ukrainian people and the new Government of Ukraine to \n     establish a full democracy, the rule of law, and respect for \n     human rights; and\n       (6) pledges its assistance to the strengthening of a fully \n     free and open democratic system in Ukraine, the creation of a \n     prosperous free market economy in Ukraine, the reaffirmation \n     of Ukraine's independence and territorial sovereignty, and \n     Ukraine's full integration into the international community \n     of democracies.\n\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, today I offer a resolution celebrating the \nDecember 26 election in Ukraine. I am pleased that Ukraine has \ndominated newspaper headlines and media broadcasts all over the world \nfor the last sixty days. In that time, extraordinary events have \noccurred. A free press has revolted against government intimidation and \nreasserted itself. An emerging middle class has found its political \nfooting. A new generation has found its hope for the future. A society \nhas rebelled against the illegal activities of its government. It is in \nour interests to recognize and protect these advances.\n  I congratulate the people of Ukraine in their undeniable quest for \nfreedom and democracy. Furthermore, I would also like to congratulate \nPresident Viktor Yushchenko, who was inaugurated last Sunday, for his \nvictory.\n  The December 26 election in Ukraine was a tribute to Ukraine's \nmaturing democracy and places Ukraine on a path to join the community \nof European democracies. A fraudulent and illegal election would have \nleft Ukraine crippled. The new president would have lacked legitimacy \nwith the Ukrainian people and the international community.\n  With the stakes so high, I commend President Bush, his \nAdministration, and the international community for providing the \npeople of Ukraine with the support they needed to withstand the threats \nto free and fair elections. Even in the face of repeated attempts to \nend any hope of a free and fair election, I was inspired by the \nwillingness and courage of so many citizens of Ukraine to demonstrate \ntheir passion for free expression and the building of a truly \ndemocratic Ukraine.\n  I am hopeful that the momentum to foster democratic freedom around \nthe world will continue. In his inaugural speech last week, President \nBush stated his unequivocal support for democracy and put securing \nindividual freedom at the forefront of America's foreign policy. I \nagree with the President. We must be prepared to play an active role in \nensuring that democracy and basic freedoms are promoted and preserved \naround the world.\n  The future of Ukraine rests with its leaders and its people, but the \nUnited States and Europe must continue to support a foundation of \ndemocracy, rule of law, and a market economy, which will allow Ukraine \nto prosper and reach its full potential. I urge my colleagues to lend \ntheir support to U.S. policy in Ukraine and ask their support for this \nresolution.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/01/25/senate-section/article/S505-1", "month": "01", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S505]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S505]]\n                      NOTICES OF HEARINGS/MEETINGS\n\n\n               committee on energy and natural resources\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of S. Res. 12, submitted earlier \ntoday by Senators Feinstein and Boxer.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 12) commending the University of \n     Southern California Trojans football team for winning the \n     2004 Bowl Championship Series national championship game.\n\n  The Senate proceeded to consider the resolution.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, as a strong supporter of California's \ncollege athletes, I rise today with Senator Boxer in support of S. Res. \n12 commending the University of Southern California Trojans football \nteam for winning the 2004 Bowl Championship Series national \nchampionship game.\n  No one who witnessed the Trojans decisive 55 to 19 victory over the \nUniversity of Oklahoma in the FedEx Orange Bowl can deny that USC is \nthe best college football team in the Nation. Led by Head Coach Pete \nCarroll, the Trojans brought home their 11th national championship, \ntheir 22nd straight win, and 27th victory in a bowl game, second all \ntime to only the University of Alabama.\n  Not even the most die-hard Trojan fan could have anticipated such a \nwin.\n  In addition to winning 13 games during the 2004 season for the first \ntime in the history of the school, USC became the first team since the \nUniversity of Nebraska in 1994-1995 to repeat as Associated Press \nnational champions and the second team to start and finish the season \nat number one in the Associated Press poll. As the number one team in \nthe country, they took on the best and they beat the best.\n\n[[Page S506]]\n\n  Every USC player deserves praise and recognition for their fine play \non the field, but I would like to particularly point out the \naccomplishments of Heisman Trophy winner and Associated Press Player of \nthe Year, quarterback Matt Leinert, who completed 18 of 35 passes for a \ntotal of 332 yards and set an Orange Bowl record with five touchdown \npasses. There were times when he could do no wrong and his play \nreminded me of a couple quarterbacks from my hometown team, the 49ers: \nJoe Montana and Steve Young.\n  Matt has also distinguished himself by announcing that he would \nreturn to school for his senior year, foregoing an opportunity to be \nthe first pick in the National Football League draft. I wish more \ncollege athletes would follow his lead.\n  Ultimately, however, this was a team win featuring a high scoring \noffense and a tenacious defense. USC ranked in the top 10 in every \ndefensive category and set a school record by scoring at least 20 \npoints in the last 38 games.\n  Led by All-Americans Matt Leinert, tailback Reggie Bush, defensive \ntackle Shaun Cody, and linebacker Matt Grootegoed, USC brought much \npride to the University and the Pacific Ten Conference.\n  Legions of Trojan fans across the country celebrated the victory and \nhave already made plans for a return trip to the championship game in \n2005.\n  And anyone who has seen a USC game over the past few years knows that \nanother championship run is a strong possibility.\n  Let me also take a moment to congratulate the University of Oklahoma \nSooners for their great season. They were a worthy opponent and a \ncredit to the University and their State.\n  Years from now, as Americans engage in one of their favorite pastimes \nand debate the great college football teams of all-time, the 2004 \nUniversity of Southern California Trojans will surely make the list. I \ncongratulate the team once again for their incredible season and I look \nforward to watching them make another run at a championship next year.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to the outstanding \naccomplishments of the University of Southern California football team. \nEarlier this month, the Trojans completed a perfect season by winning \nthe Orange Bowl and their second consecutive national championship.\n  Last year, USC shared the championship after being excluded from the \nBowl Championship Series title game.\n  This year, there was no doubt. The Trojans won all 13 of their games \nand led both the Associated Press and the USA Today/ESPN coaches polls \nfrom the preseason through the bowl games.\n  On Tuesday, January 4, they ended the season with a bang. In a much-\nanticipated meeting with second-ranked Oklahoma, the Trojans \noverwhelmed the Sooners by a score of 55-19 to win the Orange Bowl and \nthe national championship in utterly convincing fashion.\n  I would like to congratulate USC President Steven B. Sample, Head \nCoach Pete Carroll, and the Trojan football team for an unforgettable \nseason.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the resolution \nand preamble be agreed to en bloc, the motion to reconsider be laid \nupon the table, and that any statements relating thereto be printed in \nthe Record, without intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S.
