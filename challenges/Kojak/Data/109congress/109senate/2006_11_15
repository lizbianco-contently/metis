Mr. President, I thank the Chair. I may request to speak \nfor a few more minutes than 5, and when the time comes, I will so \ninform the Chair.\n  Last week the American people went to the polls across our great \nNation. They went not simply to choose new political leaders, but to \nask those leaders--Democrats and Republicans alike--to work together \nfor a new and long-overdue direction in Iraq.\n  There is no doubt that the majority of American voters want change in \nan Iraq policy that has brought such death and chaos and the prospect \nof failure. There is no doubt that they want us to speak honestly about \nthe current failures and boldly about the way through the present \ncrisis. But it is also very clear that Americans are not defeatists. \nThey want success in Iraq, they want our troops to succeed, and they \nwant them to come home.\n\n  I note as I speak here there are hearings occurring in the Armed \nServices Committee. I commend Senator Warner and Senator Levin for \nholding such a hearing. They heard this morning from some of our \nleading military figures. This afternoon there will be additional \nwitnesses appearing before them. So I am very conscious that a lot of \npeople are thinking about this issue now and that we hope to come up \nwith some positive suggestions on how we might come to a successful \nconclusion of this policy--a policy, I might add, that is in deep \njeopardy of failure.\n  In that respect, the message of the American people was one of hope: \nthat years of strained, painful debate can give way to American \npragmatism; that leaders can find in national security not a political \ncudgel but a political consensus; and that Iraq, even now, is not past \nsalvaging, if we right our course immediately.\n  I hope the resignation of Secretary Rumsfeld is a sign that the White \nHouse has heard that message. But I would add very quickly that it is \nnot enough to change the leadership at the Pentagon when a week ago \nSunday the Vice President of the United States proclaimed that we \nintend to go, and I quote him, ``full-speed ahead'' in Iraq. The \nPresident must fundamentally change our Iraq policies if we are to \nreverse the downward spiral into chaos that threatens the territorial \nintegrity of that country and our larger regional security interests--\nas well as the success of our war on al-Qaida and international \nterrorism.\n  In the midst of an election season, some of America's best foreign \npolicy minds were working diligently to find that new direction. We are \nlucky to have two distinguished former public servants to chair the \nStudy Group on Iraq: the former Secretary of State James Baker and the \nformer Chairman of the House International Relations Committee, Lee \nHamilton. Their group of experts is striving diligently to find \nconsensus on a set of policy recommendations to put before the \nPresident and the Congress of the United States. It is painful work, \nbut it is necessary work. And the tragedy of Iraq--over 30,000 injured \ntroops, hundreds of thousands of innocent Iraqis dead, more than 2,800 \nof our fellow citizens in uniform killed--the tragedy of Iraq demands \nnothing less than a new direction and some new thought.\n  It will take every dram of our honesty and pragmatism to turn around \na society that--despite $400 billion of taxpayer money, $250 million \nevery single day and still counting--remains broken, crippled, and \nfractured. The Iraqi economy is in worse shape today than it was in \nMarch of 2003. Electric and water treatment capacity, oil production, \naccess to clean water, are all below prewar levels. America has spent \n$14 billion training and equipping 300,000 Iraqi police and security \nforces; yet today as I speak on the floor of this Chamber, some 23 \nseparate sectarian militias alone operate with impunity throughout \nBaghdad. Sectarian killings continue largely unabated, averaging scores \nof deaths a day.\n  These realities mean that none of us should underestimate the \ndifficulties ahead. We need to recognize--every single time we talk \nabout this matter--the remarkable service being performed by our men \nand women in uniform. Theirs is a very difficult job. Anyone who has \nbeen there, regardless of his or her views on policy, has to admire \nimmensely the courage and determination of these people as they go out \nevery single day, facing the kinds of problems that are everywhere in \nthe streets of Baghdad, Fallujah, and other major urban areas. So I do \nnot underestimate the tremendous burden these people bear every single \nday, as too often they become nothing more than target practice for \nthose who seek to gain the upper hand in Iraq.\n  Nor do I underestimate the difficult task facing Jim Baker, Lee \nHamilton, and their colleagues on this task force that is determined to \nfind some answers to Iraq. They know, as I do, if there were any easy \nsolutions we would have discovered them by now. It may be that members \nof the Baker-Hamilton commission will not be able to arrive at a \nconsensus. I hope that is not the case. But I have no doubt that their \nefforts are taking place in a constructive and bipartisan spirit and we \nhere should do everything we can to follow their example in the weeks \nand months ahead.\n  I hope to add briefly to that debate by sharing some of my own \nthoughts this afternoon. Taken individually, none of these proposals \nthat I am going to discuss are groundbreaking or earthshattering in any \nway. A sound foreign policy rarely is. But after a war sparked by \nideology and grand theorizing, maybe we can once more learn the value \nof quiet virtues. Taken together, I believe these suggestions might \nhelp to reverse the ongoing spiral into violence and chaos, permit the \nphased redeployment of U.S. troops within and from Iraq, and secure \nAmerica's regional interests to the greatest extent.\n  Clearly, our interests are in disrepair, and other regions cry out \nfor attention. We are further away from stabilizing Afghanistan and \ndealing a mortal blow to our al-Qaida and Taliban enemies. In fact, \ndrug traffickers and\n\n[[Page S10943]]\n\ntribal warfare now threaten to destroy the fragile foundation of \nAfghanistan's nascent democracy and the Taliban is stronger now than at \nany point since our invasion.\n  This summer an emboldened and defiant Iran launched a proxy war \nagainst our ally Israel; and the apocalyptic mullahs are undeterred in \ntheir pursuit of nuclear weapons.\n  Last month North Korea claimed to have tested a nuclear weapon of its \nown, a further example of our country's growing vulnerabilities, a \nfurther cost of this administration's fixation on Iraq. While we have \nbeen bogged down in that country, North Korea has taken the chance to \nexpand its nuclear arsenal fivefold.\n  Al-Qaida, Afghanistan, Iran, North Korea--the conclusion is \nirrefutable: America is less safe today because of our Iraq diversion. \nThat is precisely why so many voices among our civilian and military \nleadership are calling upon the President to change course in that \ncountry.\n  I believe there are five key ingredients to any course change that we \nmust take: establishment of internal security in that country; phased \nredeployment of United States forces; continued training of an \nindependent, professional military and security force for Iraq; a \nstrong central government; and regional and international engagement.\n  Let me first talk briefly about security. I think we must continue to \nrecruit and train forces that reflect Iraq's ethnic diversity, forces \nthat are capable of neutralizing sectarian militias and are able to \nrestore and maintain domestic stability. Without that, nothing is \nlikely to happen. But I believe the hour has arrived when Iraq must \nassume the responsibility for policing itself. At great cost, the \nUnited States has given the Iraqi people the chance for a much brighter \nfuture. Now they must seize it. There is not a treasury deep enough nor \nan army large enough to achieve this goal if the Iraqi people \nthemselves lack the will to achieve it for themselves.\n  Second, redeployment. ``More troops or fewer troops'' is a sterile \ndebate. The reality is that in cities such as Baghdad and Falluja, our \nsoldiers are going door to door like a police force on the front lines \nof religious violence, and they need to be removed from that fruitless \nexercise. Our troops should be relocated from these larger urban zones \nto less populated regions and border areas where they can more \neffectively advance our strategic interests: continued training of \nIraqi forces and the protection of Iraq's territorial integrity until \nIraqis can do so for themselves.\n  Remaining United States forces should be repositioned to United \nStates bases in Kuwait and Qatar, where they could be available to \nprotect American interests if they should be called upon, and to \nAfghanistan, where we must redouble our efforts to capture bin Laden, \ndismantle al-Qaida and neutralize the Taliban and the drug lords who \nare funding them.\n\n  These movements must begin immediately and continue over the next 12 \nto 18 months, in concert with our efforts to enhance the stability of \nthe Iraqi Government, engage Iraq's neighbors, and build a better and \nmore secure life for the people of that country.\n  Third is professional military and security forces. Iraq will never \nbe unified as a sovereign and secure nation until all of its citizens \ncan count on the Iraqi forces to be capable of maintaining internal \nstability and protecting the nation's territorial integrity. But no \nIraqi Army can ever meaningfully stand up when Iraq's political \natmosphere remains so poisonous.\n  Which leads me to my fourth point, unity government. Our commanding \ngenerals have rightly concluded there is no military solution to Iraq's \nunfolding civil conflict. Only a political solution which unifies all \nIraqis around a common cause will save Iraq from becoming a failed \nstate.\n  So, along with the training of Iraqi troops, I believe we must tackle \nIraq's political chaos, because only stability will be the cornerstone \nof a prosperous nation.\n  Finding common cause must come first and foremost from within Iraq. \nIt must come from Iraq's secular and religious leaders, leaders such as \nAyatollah Sistani. We need Iraqis like him at the table and the United \nStates needs to encourage more acts of leadership by him and others.\n  Our political goals for Iraq are clear. Though Iraq's constitution is \nfederal, with local flexibility for provinces, we must insist on a \nstable and unified central government, capable of distributing \nresources to its citizens on a just basis. Iraq's oil must be shared \nequitably. At the end of the day, Iraq may end up a divided and \npartitioned state where sectarian influences govern; but that should \nnot be our stated policy. Nor should we allow short-term political \nexpediency to keep us from disbanding sectarian militias. Our failure \nto confront them head-on forces uncountable Iraqis to live in daily \nfear for their very lives.\n  That said, I believe we should not preclude the possibility of \nintegrating ex-militia members into the professional Iraqi military--\nbut only if they be vetted and retrained first.\n  Fifth and finally, regional and international engagement. Iraq's \nneighbors have a huge stake in a stable and competent Iraq. If there is \none thing that unites all of the nations bordering Iraq, it is the fear \nthat Iraq will splinter into fractured enclaves with dedicated \nsectarian militias that will not only terrorize each other but threaten \nthe stability of the nations that border them.\n  It is for that reason that the administration should find willing \npartners--if it were willing to look. Iraq's neighbors, as well as \nregional international organizations can help Iraq toward unity and \nstability--not from the goodness of their hearts but from the fact of \ntheir interest. Regional powers such as Turkey, Iran, Syria, and Saudi \nArabia could be enormously useful to us as mediators--a ``Friends of \nIraq'' group, committed to ensuring the integrity of its borders, the \ndisbanding of the militias, and the unity of its government.\n  When it comes to protecting our security, we must be as willing to \nwage diplomacy as we have been willing to wage war. Robust, muscular, \nand direct negotiations are not gifts to our enemies. They are the \nessential tools of avoiding conflict and securing peace and stability.\n  We are reminded of the eloquence of John Kennedy, who said many years \nago, ``Let us never negotiate out of fear. But let us never fear to \nnegotiate.''\n  Further, rebuilding Iraq's economy should be a part of any regional \nand international rescue mission. The Iraqi Government has formally \nrequested help from the United States to develop an International \nCompact for Iraq. This compact could serve as a blueprint for a new \npartnership with the international community, one aimed at \nconsolidating peace and pursuing political, social, and economic \ndevelopment over the next five years.\n  There are no guarantees, of course. Iraq is broken. The policies of \nthe Bush administration, in my view, have sadly failed. But last week's \nelections have given us the gift of opportunity--to chart a new course \nin Iraq if we are honest enough, tough enough, and bold enough to find \nit.\n  Reducing and withdrawing our troop presence. Restoring security. \nSupporting the development of a unified Iraqi Government. Enlisting \nIraq's neighbors and the international community. Creating economic \nactivity in that shattered country. If we take these steps, or ones \nlike them, we can serve our larger interests in peace and prosperity \nand security, not only for the Iraqis but, as importantly, for \nourselves. We can begin to redeem a great harm.\n  The American voters have asked this us of us. While they don't have a \nspecific plan in mind, they want us to come together, to chart a new \ncourse, to make some sense, to be rational and think about the \nimportance not only of Iraq getting on its feet--but of our nation \nmeriting its vital role in the world. No other nation in the 21st \ncentury is going to lead but this great nation of ours. Other nations \ndown the road may assume that responsibility, but as far as I can see, \nonly one nation can lead now--and it is ours. And if we continue on the \npath we are following today in Iraq, that mission will be far more \ndifficult to fulfill.\n  So far more is at risk here than just what happens in Iraq. We risk \nfailing the calling of leadership itself.\n  Anything I suggested here, I know others have raised. But I came here \ntoday, above all, to ask a question:\n\n[[Page S10944]]\n\nWho is thinking about this in a concrete way? I trust that Jim Baker \nand Lee Hamilton are. I hope that my colleagues are.\n  You may not like all of my ideas. You may reject all of them. But \nwhatever ideas come to the fore, let us debate the substance in \ntolerance and good faith, open to new thinking and hungering for new \naction.\n  The American people are watching us, wondering if we have heard their \ncall for a new way forward. The Iraqi people are watching us, wondering \nif their united country can still survive and succeed. Americans and \nIraqis both want what it is within our power to give them: hope.\n  Again, I thank the President for his indulgence in providing a little \nmore time.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I rise to address two matters \nthat will be taken up by the Senate in this lameduck session. The first \nwill be after we come back from the Thanksgiving holiday. We will be \ntaking up a tax bill that will include a group of what we call tax \nextenders. These are tax breaks that are in existing law which are \nrunning out of time. They are going to cease to exist by the 1st of the \nyear, unless we extend these tax breaks. One of those tax breaks is \nvery important to our State of Florida. In fact, six States in this \nUnion do not have a personal income tax at the State level. Whereas, \nthose 44 States that do have the personal income tax are able to deduct \nthat State income tax in the calculation of their Federal income tax, \nin those six States that do not have the State income tax, they have no \nsuch deduction. But their main revenue stream is a State sales tax.\n  The deduction of that State sales tax has been a major help to \nconstituents in those six States, including my State of Florida. It has \nsaved, for example, the people of the State of Florida $750 million per \nyear in Federal income taxes by being able to deduct their Florida \nState sales tax.\n  It is my understanding that this is all worked out; that, in fact, we \nare going to be able to extend all of these tax extenders and that it \nwill be done in the week of the lameduck session when we come back \nafter the Thanksgiving holiday. That, of course, is enormously \nimportant.\n  I had a hand, along with Senator Hutchison of Texas, in passing that \nbill to begin with, but that bill was effective for 2 years. That 2 \nyears is about to expire at the end of this calendar year. So we \ncertainly need that extended.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/11/15/senate-section/article/S10944-2", "month": "11", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10944-S10945]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      PRESCRIPTION DRUG AMENDMENT\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I also want to speak on a \nmatter that Senator Vitter and I will introduce shortly, for there will \nbe in front of the Senate an appropriations bill that will fund the \nFood and Drug Administration. Senator Vitter will offer, on behalf of \nhimself and myself, an amendment that we had offered to the Senate on a \ndifferent appropriations bill several months ago--and passed--that \nwould allow Americans to purchase low-cost prescription drugs from \nCanada.\n  Every year, millions of Americans, who cannot otherwise afford their \nprescriptions at pharmacies, seek those same FDA-approved prescriptions \nfrom Canada at significantly lower prices.\n  Back in July, Senator Vitter and I introduced a separate amendment on \nthis issue to the Department of Homeland Security appropriations bill. \nOur amendment prohibited Customs from stopping the importation of FDA-\napproved prescription drugs by American citizens.\n  The amendment was in response to a new policy implemented by U.S. \nCustoms which resulted in over 38,000 prescription drug shipments being \ndetained by Federal officials. Our amendment received overwhelming \nbipartisan support when it was added to the Senate bill.\n  This Senator started receiving complaints as far back as 2\\1/2\\ years \nago. They had been ordering prescriptions from Canada for years, and \nsuddenly Customs was confiscating their prescriptions. Customs has \nadmitted that it was to the tune of almost 40,000 prescriptions.\n  To a senior citizen who is so desperate to make financial ends meet--\nand, in fact, sadly, in America in the year 2006, some senior citizens \nare having to make a choice because of their financial condition \nbetween buying their groceries or buying their prescription medicines. \nThey are forced to do things such as cutting their medicine tablets in \nhalf to try to stretch it out when, in fact, their doctor tells them \nthat is not what they should be doing. Yet it is happening.\n  Over and over again, seniors have been able to order from Canadian \npharmacists at half the cost of their prescription medicine. It is not \na question of safety because it is made by the same manufacturer and \neven with the same packaging.\n  Back in the summer, Senator Vitter and I saw an opportunity on an \nappropriations bill to prohibit Customs from using the appropriated \nmoneys for the seizure of those kinds of individual purchases for a \nsmall duration of time--no more than a 90-day supply of their \nprescriptions and only from Canada.\n  We passed it in the Senate overwhelmingly. It goes down to a House-\nSenate conference committee, and they watered down that provision to \nsay that it can be done to bring those small, limited, individual \nsupplies of prescription drugs from Canada but only if you bring it \npersonally back from Canada.\n  That may help my two colleagues who are from the State of North \nDakota because they are right next to the Canadian border. But clearly \nfor the States of Senator Vitter and myself and the States in the \nSoutheastern United States, that doesn't help at all, particularly \nsince some of our seniors have been accustomed to ordering these much \nless expensive drugs by mail or by e-mail or by telephone calls.\n  When it got to the conference committee, they watered down the \nprovision. That is what we are going to address today. I am waiting on \nSenator Vitter to come to the floor so we can offer this amendment.\n  We have a new opportunity on an appropriations bill that includes the \nFood and Drug Administration appropriations. This does not assure \nAmericans access to lower cost medications from Canada, since the FDA \ncan still hold up the imports if they choose to do so under current \nlaw. That is why we are going to add this amendment to prevent the FDA \nfrom interfering with the importation of prescription drugs from \nCanada.\n  A little bit of good news came out the last time we tried to do this \nwith regard to the Customs Department. In October, Customs threw up its \nhands and said: We have more important things to do on the huge import \nof drugs that are counterfeit. That is what we are going after. We are \nnot going to confiscate these individual purchases of a 90-day supply \nor less which are prescriptions from Canadian pharmacists.\n  With that as a precedent, it would seem to me that the Senate would \ncertainly go along with us and put this in the law right now with \nregard to the FDA to make sure that this policy is very clear.\n  When Congress returns in January, we should look at, additionally, \nwhat is introduced by my colleague who is on the floor now, Senator \nDorgan, and Senator Snowe, the Pharmaceutical Market Access and Drug \nSafety Act.\n  This bipartisan bill, which I support, is going to set up a \ncomprehensive system for importation of prescription drugs which will \nfurther help our senior citizens on lower prescription drug costs.\n  Ultimately, we will have to debate the very essence of the problem in \nMedicare prescription drug benefits, Part D benefits. That is going to \nbe a whole new debate that we will have out here on how to fill the \ndoughnut hole which some people say would cost something like $26 \nbillion. But there is a way to do that--by allowing Medicare to do what \nother parts of the Federal Government have done for years, including \nthe Veterans' Administration and the Department of Defense; that is, \nuse the bulk purchasing power to negotiate lower prices for drugs.\n  As most people know, that was prohibited in the Medicare prescription \ndrug benefit. But I think we are going to be addressing that because \nthat is a\n\n[[Page S10945]]\n\nhuge stake in the heart of the purchasing power of Medicare for 43 \nmillion senior citizens to be able to negotiate those prices down by \nbulk purchases.\n  It is clearly time for the Congress to stand up for our constituents \nand to help lower these prescription drug prices.\n  I am looking forward to working with Senators in a bipartisan way to \nembrace this Vitter-Nelson amendment.\n  Thank you.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, my colleague from Florida was describing \nthe issue of prescription drug pricing in our country--an amendment \nthat would be offered to a subsequent appropriations bill dealing with \nthe FDA and its enforcement of the reimportation of prescription drugs.\n  Let me point out, as he properly said, that Senator Snowe and myself \nand others, a large bipartisan group, Senators McCain and Kennedy, \nintroduced legislation--and have been blocked from having it considered \nfor some many months in the Senate--dealing with the comprehensive \napproach to reimportation of FDA-approved drugs.\n  The American consumer is now charged the highest prices for \nprescription drugs in the entire world. Let me say that again. The \nAmerican consumer is charged the highest prices for prescription drugs \nanywhere in the world. It is not fair. That pricing policy has to \nchange. One of the ways to change it will be to put downward pressure \non pricing in this country by allowing American consumers to access \nthose identical FDA-approved drugs, some of which are actually made in \nthis country; to reimport them from other countries, FDA-approved, made \nand manufactured in manufacturing plants approved by the FDA.\n  My colleague talked about Canada and the United States. That is an \nobvious issue. My State borders Canada, and we see people coming back \nand forth going to Canada to purchase prescription drugs, in some cases \nfor one-tenth the price they are charged in this country.\n  We need to find a way to pass the comprehensive legislation. My \ncolleague from Florida cosponsored that bill and worked with us on it--\nmyself, Senator Snowe from Maine, Senator McCain, Senator Grassley, \nSenator Kennedy, a pretty significant bipartisan group in the \nSenate. We have not had a vote on that only because it has been \nblocked. We will have a vote on that in the next session of Congress if \nwe are not able to offer it in the coming weeks. In the next session of \nCongress, we will have a vote on it.\n\n  We will have very substantial numbers in the Senate supporting that \nlegislation. When we do, it will be good news for American consumers \nwho now pay the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs. \nThat is unfair. I certainly support the amendment that deals with a \nfunding limitation that would be offered as described by my colleague \nfrom Florida. That in itself does not solve the larger problem. He has \nindicated that. I believe Senator Vitter would indicate that as well. \nIt is a step in the right direction.\n  I am supportive of it with the understanding that we will have a more \ncomprehensive piece of legislation on this issue which will be \nintroduced, will be offered, and will be voted on with a very large \nmajority in the Senate. The House of Representatives has already \ndemonstrated its support for such a plan. If we can't get it done in \nthe lameduck session, as soon as we turn the calendar and begin a new \nyear, I am convinced we will get this done.\n  I appreciated the words of my colleague from Florida.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The senior Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/11/15/senate-section/article/S10945-1", "month": "11", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10945-S10947]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       FARMER DISASTER ASSISTANCE\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, yesterday I withdrew an amendment to \nprovide disaster assistance to farmers and ranchers for the disasters \nof 2005 and 2006. I did so on the basis of an assurance by the majority \nleader that is in the Record very clearly: we would go to the \nAgriculture appropriations bill today, I would have a chance to offer \nmy amendment today, the rights of all Senators were protected, and that \nthey would have their rights. Now I am told there is an objection to \ngoing to the Agriculture appropriations bill.\n  I say to my colleagues, that leaves me with no alternative but to \nobject to other business. I, in good faith, removed my amendment \nyesterday, took it down, with the assurance--and that is in the Record, \nvery clearly in the Record--from the majority leader, the assurance \nthat we would go to Agriculture appropriations today. I alert my \ncolleagues I kept my word. I would hope others would keep theirs.\n  If that is not to be, I will be in a position in which I will be \nobjecting to any other business coming before the Senate. If they want \nto have a live quorum, we can go through that exercise, but we will go \nthrough it repeatedly. This is not fair. It is not right. We have tried \nrepeatedly to get this bill up so we can have a vote. It has previously \npassed the Senate with 77 votes in favor.\n  What we are asking for is not unreasonable. We have reduced the cost \ndramatically. Here, a person's word is their bond. I kept my word. I am \nexpecting others to keep theirs.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, my colleague was on the Senate floor \nyesterday, as I was, and he was offering an amendment on the Military \nConstruction appropriations bill dealing with agricultural disaster. In \nexchange for withdrawing that amendment on the Military Construction \nbill, he was given some assurance that the Agriculture appropriations \nbill would come next to the Senate and he would be able to offer that \namendment on the Agriculture appropriations bill.\n  Let me, first of all, support my colleague, Senator Conrad. He knows \nand I know that the Agriculture appropriations bill includes a disaster \npiece that I added in the committee many months ago. That amendment I \noffered in the committee was one we had worked on with Senator Conrad \nand many other Senators on a bipartisan basis. It was Senator Conrad \nand myself who were recognized in the committee to offer the \nagricultural disaster plan. That was in the spring of this year.\n  Subsequent to that, we have now had a very substantial drought that \nhas enveloped a fair part of this country, devastating some additional \ncrops, and we have not been able to get the Agriculture appropriations \nbill back to the Senate so we can make an adjustment to the disaster \nplan for farmers, an adjustment to include the 2006 disaster, but we \nhave not been able to get it to the floor of the Senate. That is why my \ncolleague, Senator Conrad, offered it yesterday as an amendment to the \nMilitary Construction bill. We have already passed it twice in the \nSenate; that is, an agricultural disaster plan.\n  Two times I added it in the Appropriations Committee. On two \noccasions--I believe both were with supplemental bills--both occasions \nwe went to a conference with the House of Representatives. I had money \nin for a farm disaster plan. In both circumstances, we went to the \nconference; the Senate conferees, at my request, had a vote, insisted \non the Senate position which included an agricultural disaster plan for \nfamily farmers who got hit with the weather disaster; and on both \noccasions the President threatened a veto and got the House conferees, \nat the request of the Speaker, to object. Therefore, twice it got \nknocked out in a conference.\n\n  The third time now, I have added the farm disaster piece to the \nAgriculture appropriations bill. We did that before this growing season \nin which we had a very devastating drought, so that needs to be \nadjusted.\n  My colleague, Senator Conrad, is offering the farm disaster piece \nthat would try to reach out to those family farmers who now do not know \nwhether they will be able to continue farming, reach out with a helping \nhand to say: You are not alone. We cannot make\n\n[[Page S10946]]\n\nyou whole, but we can help you during a tough time.\n  This Congress has already said to the farmers in the Gulf of Mexico: \nYou will get disaster aid because you got hit with Hurricane Katrina \nand you lost your crops. You get disaster aid. This Congress has \nessentially said to other farmers and this President has said to other \nfarmers: You might have lost all of your crops from a drought or a \nflood, but it didn't have a name named ``Katrina.'' It is not like a \nhurricane, it is not named; therefore, you are not going to get any \ndisaster help--just those who got hit with Hurricane Katrina and lost \ntheir crops. That is not fair. No one in this country would think that \nis fair.\n  So what we are trying to do--I in the Committee on Appropriations and \nmy colleague, Senator Conrad, here in the Senate with this amendment--\nis to say to farmers who are out there wondering: Will our family be \nable to continue on the farm next year? Will we be able to do spring \nplanting? Will we have the capability to put a crop in? At this point, \nthe answer for many of them, thousands of them, is: No, we are not \ngoing to be able to continue farming because we had a disaster. Where a \ncrop should have existed on our land, there was barren land, no seeds, \nno crop.\n  It used to be in our farm bill we had a disaster title. When a \ndisaster occurred, we, with that disaster title, could say to farmers: \nWe want to help you. Now there is no disaster title in the farm bill, \nand each year when there is a disaster we have to reach out to try to \ncreate a disaster bill.\n  This country goes almost every place in the world to help when there \nis trouble. What about at home? What about when there is trouble on the \nfamily farm? I know that is far from the city lights and far from the \ncameras, but the fact is, that is real trouble for families whose dream \nis about to end because they cannot continue farming. Why? Is it \nbecause they mismanaged? Is it because they are not good farmers, \nbecause they can't grow a crop? No. It is because a drought came around \nand destroyed everything on their farm or it is because a flood came \nand washed it away.\n  In 2005, in parts of our State, there were over a million acres that \ncould not be planted--think of that--could not be planted at all, and \nnearly another 1 million planted acres and all the seeds were washed \naway with torrential rain where one-third of a year's worth of rain \nfell in 24 hours. Think of that. Then you say to those farmers: You \nknow what. Tough luck. You are on your own.\n  That is not the way this country has dealt with farmers. We have \nalways believed there is value and importance in having farmers on the \nland farming and creating America's food supply. We have always said: \nWe want to have a bridge across troubled times for you. When price \ndepressions occur, when natural disasters occur, we want to create a \nsafety net for you. We have always done that.\n  Now what happens with disasters, with no disaster title in the farm \nbill, we face a situation where, because of two years--2005, with \nsubstantial flooding, and in 2006, a protracted drought in some \nsignificant areas of the country--we face a prospect of losing a great \nmany family farmers just because this country will have said--if we do \nnot do what Senator Conrad and I and others want to do, this country \nwill have said: It doesn't matter. The only farmers we will help are in \nthe gulf region, those who were hit by a hurricane. Some of my \ncolleagues have said it is tempting to name a drought. Give it a name, \nif that is what is required here. Give these natural disasters a name. \nWe do with hurricanes.\n  My colleague is suggesting the right remedy. We have, apparently, \nsome people saying we need to go to another piece of legislation. \nPerhaps there is the India nuclear agreement.\n  My colleague says, properly--and I was in the Senate when this \nexchange took place--my colleague says: Yesterday, I withdrew my \namendment from the Military Construction bill--and he did--and I heard \nthe discussion as a result of his withdrawing that amendment. I believe \nthere is an understanding that the next piece of legislation we go to, \nwhich would be this afternoon, is the Agriculture appropriations bill. \nThat will give him the opportunity--and me and others--to both \nintroduce and speak to farm disaster aid that is long overdue, that \nshould have been done long ago.\n  Senator Conrad has indicated that he would object to other procedures \nand other proceedings unless we reach an understanding of going to the \nAgriculture appropriations bill. I certainly support that and would be \nin the Senate with him, prepared to object, just as he would.\n  That is the background. That is the story. My colleague, Senator \nConrad, is perfectly within his rights. He is absolutely accurate in \nterms of what we understood when we left the Senate yesterday.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. DeMint). The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I thank my colleague, Senator Dorgan, and \nI also point to the Record, the Record from yesterday, page S. 10900. \nIt says:\n\n       Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I notice the majority leader has \n     returned to the floor. I tried to recount for our colleagues \n     the status of our discussion, and the understanding that we \n     had reached, that I would withdraw my amendment from this \n     bill with the understanding that we would go to the \n     Agriculture Appropriations bill tomorrow and have a chance to \n     offer it there. All Senators' rights would be reserved. That \n     is the status of it. I just ask if that is the majority \n     leader's understanding. If it is, I will then be willing to \n     withdraw my amendment for the Military Construction bill and \n     we can conclude that.\n       Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, in the last hour or so we have \n     had numerous discussions on the floor, as our colleagues have \n     observed, and many participated in the discussion. My \n     understanding and the general agreement we have is to go to \n     the Agriculture Appropriations bill tomorrow. That does \n     facilitate the progress we need to make on the current bill \n     that is on the floor, which I hope and expect to be able to \n     finish tonight. If that is the case, we plan on going to the \n     Agriculture bill tomorrow. All rights would be reserved for \n     all Senators, of course. We don't have an agreement, but that \n     is the intention.\n       The disaster ag relief bill is very important and has been \n     talked about by Republicans and Democrats and we expect to \n     debate it tomorrow. It is a more appropriate place for this \n     amendment. So I think this is a good understanding.\n\n  Mr. President, I withdrew my amendment based on that understanding. I \ndid it in good faith. I did it to accommodate my colleagues. I did it \nso other legislation could move. But now I am told the agreement is not \ngoing to be kept. That is not acceptable. That is just not acceptable. \nThat puts me in the position now of having to object to proceeding to \nother business. I have no alternative but to do that.\n  I am here representing thousands of farm families across our State \nand really right down the heartland of the country. We have 26 \ncosponsors for this legislation, totally bipartisan, about as many \nRepublicans as Democrats on the bill because we have had the third \nworst drought in the country's history. That is the reality.\n  I have a letter on my desk from a man talking about the disaster. And \nin that letter he said to me--this is from last year when we had \nterrible flooding--he had 26 inches of rain over a very short period of \ntime. The result was he had no production, and he lost $120,000. Even \nwith the crop insurance, it did not come close to covering his bills, \nand that he and his wife and his family were going to be forced off the \nland if there were not some assistance.\n  Let me just recount the history. Always in our past when anyone \nsuffered from natural disaster in this country, anywhere, Congress \nresponded. Congress responded. We responded when there was Hurricane \nKatrina. We responded when there was Hurricane Rita. In fact, this \ngentleman says: I urged our delegation to support the victims of \nHurricane Katrina. We suffered the same kind of loss here, a complete \neconomic loss, but there were no news cameras seeing our disaster. We \nhad a slow-motion disaster but every bit as devastating.\n  The question is, Are those people going to be given any kind of \nhelping hand, the kind of thing we have done repeatedly in the past?\n  Now, we don't budget for disasters. Some have said it is a budget \nbuster. No, it is not. No. 1, there is no budget. No. 2, to the extent \nwe have agreed on guidelines for spending, it has always been \nunderstood, it has always been the case for the 20 years I have been \nhere that natural disasters are treated separate and apart from the \nbudget. It\n\n[[Page S10947]]\n\nis very hard to budget for natural disasters. Nobody knows the extent \nor when they will occur. As a result, we have always dealt with \ndisaster spending as an emergency outside the budget.\n  Now, how much money is being talked about here? Mr. President, $4.5 \nbillion for 2 years of disasters. And this is a national bill. This is \nnot restricted to one region, one location. This will assist anybody \nwho had a loss of at least 35 percent. And if you have a loss of at \nleast 35 percent, only then do you start to get any assistance; and \nthen you only get a percentage of the loss, 50 percent covered. So you \nget nothing on the first 35 percent of loss, nothing. Only if you have \na loss of at least 35 percent do you get anything. If your loss is over \n35 percent, you will get assistance on a highly restricted basis.\n  The bankers of my State have told me if this kind of assistance is \nnot forthcoming, 5 to 10 percent of the farmers and ranchers in our \nState will go out of business, not because of any fault of theirs, but \nbecause of the most incredible swing in weather that we have ever seen.\n  Last year, we had flooding that prevented a million acres from even \nbeing planted. It was not even planted. This year, we have had the \nthird worst drought, according to the scientists, in our Nation's \nhistory, a drought that Senator Dorgan and I saw firsthand in a tour \nwith our Governor and agricultural leaders of our State.\n  I even saw irrigated corn--irrigated corn--in which the ears never \nfilled out because the heat was so unbelievably intense. In one day in \nmy hometown, it was 112 degrees. I am not talking about the heat index. \nI am talking about the actual temperature, 112 degrees.\n  In July and August of this last year, we had extreme temperatures day \nafter day after day, and no rain. It was devastating. And it is just \nnot my State. It is right down the heartland of the country: South \nDakota, Nebraska, Oklahoma, Texas, over into Minnesota, Montana.\n  There are 26 cosponsors of this bill. It is fully bipartisan. This \nlegislation has passed overwhelmingly in the Senate with 77 votes.\n  So I just say to my colleagues, I was given a commitment yesterday \nthat we would go to the Agriculture appropriations bill today, and that \nI would have a chance to offer my amendment; that Senators could raise \nany objections they might have. They could raise a rule XVI objection. \nBy the way, we now know that would not lie against our bill. We also \nknow that they could raise a budget point of order. That would require \na supermajority vote. We are fully prepared to do that and to accept \nthe will of the body.\n  But what is not fair is not to have a vote. And what is especially \nnot fair is not to keep the commitment that was made yesterday publicly \nand privately that we would go to the Agriculture appropriations bill \ntoday and have an opportunity for a vote. That was the commitment that \nwas made. This leaves me with no alternative but to object to going to \nother business. I will make that objection. And if I have to do it \nrepeatedly, I will make it repeatedly.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nLautenberg be recognized for 10 minutes and that I be recognized at the \nend of that period.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from New Jersey.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/11/15/senate-section/article/S10947-1", "month": "11", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10947-S10949]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from North Dakota \nfor enabling me to make some remarks about the war and where things are \nas we see them.\n  It has been more than a month since we were last together in the \nSenate. While we were out of session, the war in Iraq continued to \nrage. We in the Congress had the pleasure of going home to our \nfamilies, our friends, familiar circumstances and surroundings. Our \ntroops in Iraq, however, didn't have that opportunity while we were \noff, so to speak, for almost 6 weeks. Everyone knows that we did work \nat home, but we were in familiar, safe territory. The troops were in \nharm's way, trying to bring order to a country in absolute chaos.\n  Tragically, many of our people there did not survive since the Senate \nwas last in session. During the recess, America lost 157 brave men and \nwomen in combat, 146 in Iraq and 11 in Afghanistan, and 649 were \nseriously wounded. Most of us have been to Walter Reed and the naval \nhospital in Bethesda and had opportunities to talk to some of those \npeople who are so seriously wounded, some limbless, some sightless. \nTheir pain goes way beyond that which is directly part of their wound; \ntheir pain goes on for the rest of their lives.\n  Now here we are, almost at Thanksgiving. Americans are looking \nforward to sharing a holiday with family and friends. But in this \nseason of giving and cheer, we have to find a serious way to give some \ncheer, some recognition for the sacrifices of our soldiers. Outside my \noffice, I have found a way to express thanks to them. We have \nestablished a photographic display of those who have lost their lives. \nIt is called the ``Faces of the Fallen.'' It is visited daily by \ntourists and others who search the gallery for people they may have \nknown from a hometown or region.\n  Today I offer another way to honor our courageous men and women. I am \ngoing to place the names and hometowns of the 157 troops that we lost \nsince the Senate was last in session in the Congressional Record.\n  Too often when we talk about our fallen troops, they become faceless, \nif it is not your family, statistics, but we don't want that anymore. \nWe want to recognize, and the American people want to recognize, what \nis really happening to the fathers, mothers, sisters, and children. \nThey are our children, and many have children of their own.\n  Among those who perished are PFC Donald S. Brown, 19 years of age, \nfrom Succasunna, NJ. I attended his wake 2 weeks ago, met with his \nfamily, and LCpl Christopher B. Cosgrove III of Cedar Knolls, NJ. There \nare many more New Jerseyans who have perished there. The number is \nalmost 80 now. We look around, and they are from States across the \ncountry. Almost every State has seen the loss of a former resident, \nsomeone with roots in that State:\n       SGT Bryan Burgess of Garden City, MI;\n       SGT Courtland A.

I want their families to know that they can find \ntheir names in the permanent Record. Around many dinner tables across \nthe Nation this Thanksgiving, the conversation will no doubt turn to \nthe Iraq war. By this Thanksgiving, we will have been at war in Iraq as \nlong as we were in World War II. I served in that war for almost 3 \nyears. By reading these names today, my hope is that the dinner table \nconversations will discuss our foreign policy and the reasons that we \nare there, the reasons that they think put us there. I would ask them \nto contact their Senators, Representatives in Washington with views and \nquestions that are on their minds.\n  Think about it. There are proposals now from outstanding leaders in \nthis body suggesting that we need more troops than we have there, when \nit is the desire of most of us to get out of there. We can argue about \ntimetables and should we have timetables, but we know this: we want our \npeople home. It is shocking to hear suggestions that maybe we ought to \nbe--not maybe, that we ought to be sending more troops. Where were \nthose suggestions when General Shinseki, a very high ranking chief of \nthe Army, said to the Pentagon, to the President, to the American \npeople that we ought to have at least 300,000 people on the ground \nthere? Why, then, if this war was planned properly, didn't we respect \nthe opinions of so many senior officers in the military who said we \nneeded more and were denied?\n  When we hear pleas that say put more troops there, I, for one--I am \nsure colleagues of mine feel the same way--don't know where they are \ngoing to get them. We are stretched thin now. So I think it is a fairly \narbitrary suggestion, unless there is a plan accompanying it that says \nwhatever we do, this is what we intend to do. I don't want to get into \nthat argument about timetables, and cut and run. No, stay and die. Is \nthat the alternative that we are talking about? No.\n  I don't want us to leave in a fashion that negates some of the \nsacrifices that have been made, but we are now being left alone as \nother countries pull out the few people who were there as part of a \ncoalition which never really materialized. We want a plan. We want some \nidea as to what the President, the administration thinks about when we \ncan start to look ahead, think more about it from this side, from the \nAmerican side, and not have some false hopes, dismal hopes that we are \ngoing to be able to stay there and correct this situation without \ntelling the American people, without telling the Congress that some \nprogram has to be presented that says we will not stay there forever. \nThe price is far too costly.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/11/15/senate-section/article/S10949-1", "month": "11", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10949-S10950]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      DISASTER RELIEF FOR FARMERS\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I want to say to my colleagues, I hope \nvery much we are able to find some accommodation to work out the \nsituation. I stand ready to try to resolve this matter. I did it \nyesterday. I withdrew an amendment with the assurance that we would go \nto the Agriculture appropriations bill today. I really expected that \ncommitment would be kept. I don't know how else this place can run but \non the good faith of Members. I did my best to accommodate colleagues \nyesterday and did so on the assurance, both public and private, that we \nwould go to the Agriculture appropriations bill so we could have a \nvote--we could have a series of votes, if necessary--on the question of \nwhether we are going to provide disaster assistance to farmers who have \nbeen hit by drought, flooding, and other natural disasters, something \nwe have done routinely in the past, frankly, at far greater cost.\n  One of my colleagues asked me yesterday: How does this compare to \ndisaster bills of the past? We looked it up. One year we had a disaster \nbill of $16 billion, natural disaster. Another bill, another year it \nwas $14 billion.\n  This is $4 billion for 2 years. This is not some outsized disaster \nassistance legislation; it is barebones. We recall that the bill that \npassed earlier was in the $6 billion range, when I had earlier offered \n$6.7 billion. We are down to $4.5 billion, as we have taken out things \nthe White House said they would object to. We took out the energy \nprovisions, for a savings of $1.8 billion. We stripped out some of the \nsupport for small businesses, for a savings of $215 million. We did add \nsteps to reduce the cost in response to complaints from the \nadministration. We now have it stripped down to the barebones, $4.5 \nbillion for 2 years.\n  Mr. President, I thank very much those who have tried to work things \nout. I look forward to further discussions.\n  With that, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, in line with the agreement we had reached \nyesterday, I now ask unanimous consent that we proceed to the \nAgriculture appropriations bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. In my capacity as a Senator, I object.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I know this is not necessarily the \nposition of the occupant of the chair. He is being asked to do that on \nbehalf of the other side. I regret that very much because we had what \nwas to me a very clear understanding yesterday. It was very clear. We \nwere going to go to the Agriculture appropriations bill today. I was to \nbe given the right to offer my amendment. All other Senators would have \ntheir rights respected with respect to that bill. That meant they could \ncall for a supermajority vote. They could try to invoke rule XVI. We \nwere prepared to deal with any of those contingencies.\n  I must say that this action leaves us with very little choice but to \nnow object to proceeding to other matters. If good faith means \nsomething in this Chamber, that means commitments are kept. I regret \nvery much that we find ourselves in this circumstance. The commitment \nmade to me yesterday was very clear, both public and private. We were \ngoing to go to the Agriculture appropriations bill today. We were going \nto have a chance to vote. It is not exactly a novel idea here that we \nvote. People have a chance to win or lose. That is what I am asking \nfor. That is what I was assured yesterday would happen today.\n  So, again, I ask unanimous consent to proceed to the Agriculture \nappropriations bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. In my capacity as a Senator, I object.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Objection is clearly heard. Again, I regret that very \nmuch.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota, Mr. Dorgan, is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, my colleague has sought unanimous consent \nto bring up the Agriculture appropriations bill. I recognize, and I \nknow he recognizes, that we don't have the power of scheduling in the \nSenate. That is the basis of that request. Those who observe the \nprocess of legislating might wonder sometimes, if you are not doing \nanything, why are you not doing something?\n  Clearly we are not doing anything at the moment. We have no business \npending. We are attempting to do a piece of legislation dealing with \nthe agricultural disaster for family farmers who suffered weather-\nrelated disasters. That is on the basis of the discussion yesterday, \nwhere the leader of the Senate wanted to finish the Military \nConstruction bill, and my colleague, Senator Conrad, withdrew his \namendment dealing with farm disaster help in order to allow that bill \nto be completed yesterday. So the assumption was, with the back-and-\nforth my colleague read from the Record, that we would have the \nopportunity today for my colleague to offer an amendment to the \nAgriculture appropriations bill because the assumption and intent was \nto bring up the Agriculture appropriations bill first thing today. That \nhas not been the case.\n\n[[Page S10950]]\n\n  We came into session at 2:15, I believe, and we essentially are doing \nnothing. So someone watching these proceedings might want to ask the \nquestion: If you are not doing anything, why aren't you doing \nsomething? Are you not doing anything because there is nothing to do?\n  That is not the case. We are not doing anything, despite the fact \nthat there are things to be done, because people object to doing \nthings. That is a strange situation. What should be done? The \nAgriculture appropriations bill should be brought to the floor. That \nwas the intention yesterday.\n  That bill is one I worked on last spring. I am a member of that \nagriculture appropriations subcommittee. I offered an amendment that my \ncolleague Senator Conrad and many others worked on on a bipartisan \nbasis. That amendment, dealing with farm disaster aid to farmers, was \nagreed to. It went through the entire process. But the bill has not \nbeen brought to the floor. It needs to be modified now because we have \nhad a devastating drought in the middle of 2006. My colleague would \nmodify, with his amendment, the original amendment and provide the \ndisaster aid we want to provide to family farmers.\n  This is not some notion out of left field. It is what this country \nhas always done. If you have a devastating drought--and tens of \nthousands of farmers have seen their crops dry up in the field, and \nthey have lost everything--the Congress has always said: We want to \nhelp you.\n  It is interesting to me that we go all over the world helping. I am \nproud that our country is there to say we want to help. But what about \nhere at home, in the middle of our country, in the northern Great \nPlains in North Dakota, where farmers and ranchers had to sell their \nentire herds because there was nothing to eat? You cannot run a farm \nand you cannot keep a cow if you don't have feed. What about those \nfolks who lost everything? Do we want to help them? I think so. It is \nwhat we have always done. But we have been blocked from bringing it to \nthe floor of the Senate. We have things to do right now, and yet we are \ndoing nothing because we have people blocking the attempt to bring up \nlegislation we should be working on.\n  So my colleague, Senator Conrad, asked unanimous consent to go to the \nAgriculture appropriations bill, which we thought we were going to as \nof yesterday, and we believed that was the intent. If we cannot reach \nan agreement on that, let me ask consent of a different nature. My \nunderstanding today was they could not go to the Agriculture \nappropriations bill, or would not, or whatever, and they wanted to go \nto the India nuclear agreement.\n  Let me ask this: I ask unanimous consent that the Senate immediately \nproceed to the Agriculture appropriations bill pending the disposition \nof the Indian nuclear agreement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. In my capacity as a Senator, I object.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, the point is to say the following: We are \nnot doing anything at this moment. There is much work to be done, some \nof it very important. We have a lot of farm families wondering: Will we \nbe able to have money to run our farms, for spring planting, or are we \ngoing to be told by our bankers and lenders that we cannot continue?\n  There is an urgency to this. If it cannot be the case that we move to \nthat this afternoon, then OK. If it is the case that there are \nobjections to moving to the Agriculture appropriations bill today and \nsomeone says let's bring up the India nuclear deal, the question I \nraise is, Can we get an agreement following that, so that we have \ncertainty? We are not asking for the Moon here. All we are asking for \nis certainty to be able to bring to the floor of the Senate and to have \na vote on a disaster relief package that is supported by almost three-\nfourths of the Senate.\n  My hope is that the majority leader and others will agree with us \nthat we need to find a time. Perhaps the time cannot be today. Can it \nbe at a future date? As my colleague indicated, the Presiding Officer \nis constrained to object on behalf of the majority leader. I understand \nthat. That may not even be his position. I know he has farmers and \nagricultural folks in his State as well. My hope is that, with the \ncooperation of the majority leader, we can lock in a determination of \nwhen we have business on the floor of the Senate that will allow \nSenator Conrad and I and others to offer the amendment to provide \ndisaster aid. That is what we are asking.\n  This is not a puzzle for which there is no solution. This is very \nsimple. We just need to understand, will there be an attempt to \ncontinue to block this or will there be an obvious opportunity for us \nto offer the amendment? If there is an opportunity, at that point I \nthink we can lock in a time. My colleague, Senator Conrad, and I and \nothers would be satisfied with that and we would know we will get to \nthe point to pass this for the farmers in the Senate. That would be an \nenormous and beneficial thing to do on behalf of thousands of families \nwho work very hard in this country. They get up in the morning and do \nchores. We don't use the term ``do chores'' around here. Nobody does \nchores in the Senate; that is, getting up in the morning, feeding \ncattle, dealing with the hogs, chickens, and the horses--doing chores. \nThese are people who work very hard. I think it is important for us to \nrecognize that this devastating drought hurt a lot of families very \nbadly. We helped those families as a result of the loss of crops in the \nGulf of Mexico as a result of Hurricane Katrina. I am pleased we did \nthat. We should not limit help in the form of disaster aid to just \nthose folks who lost crops due to a disaster named ``Hurricane \nKatrina.'' That is the point we are making.\n  I regret that we have not been able to get consent. My colleague has \nindicated--and I join him--that he would be constrained to object to \nmoving on other issues until we get an agreement. When we get an \nagreement on when we are going to be able to vote on this amendment, at \nthat point, then we can move on.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CONRAD.

The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I have agreed to have these matters \nresolved because they are urgent matters, and I certainly didn't want \nto in any way impede action on those items that are absolutely \nessential.\n  I would very much like to resolve this matter so that the commitments \nthat were made to me yesterday, both privately and publicly, be kept \nand we can move on. But I was assured yesterday that if I would take \ndown my amendment, we would then go to the Agriculture appropriations \nbill today so that the amendment could be offered on that bill, with \nall Senators' rights reserved.\n  That was fair. I did it in good faith. But it is not to me good faith \nto have commitments made and then not kept. So I find myself in the \nsituation where I have no alternative but to object to other business \nbeing done until and unless the commitment that was made to\n\n[[Page S10951]]\n\nme is kept. That is why we are in this situation. I regret it. I wish \nwe weren't in this situation. But I have been here 20 years, and I have \ncomplete respect for other Senators having the right to raise their \nobjections. They can raise rule XVI. We believe our amendment has been \ndrafted in a way that rule XVI will not apply. They can raise a budget \npoint of order. That is completely fair. That is within any Senator's \nright. I certainly respect that. That would face then a supermajority \nvote. But we have been trying for months just to get a vote, and I \nthink we have come to the point now where I was assured publicly and \nprivately that it would happen today. That is why I am insisting on \nthat commitment being kept.\n\n  I want to say once again, the issue is how we deal with natural \ndisasters. I have proposed that we budget for natural disasters. At \nleast we could look back historically. We know that on average we spend \nabout $8 billion a year on natural disasters. Perhaps that is what we \nshould do, budget that amount. The problem is, none of us can predict \nvery well what natural disasters are going to occur. Obviously, no one \nknows when a hurricane is going to hit or a flood or a drought. So \nhistorically the approach has been not to budget for natural disasters \nbut to consider them outside of the budget on an emergency basis, and \nthat has been done the entire time I have been in the Senate. I don't \nnecessarily think it is the best way or the only way, but it has been \nthe way. There was no disaster assistance last year. There is no \ndisaster assistance this year for those outside the gulf region. We \ncertainly appreciate that they suffered by far the worst calamity, and \nI supported generous help to them. But there were others hit by natural \ndisaster as well.\n  In my State last year, there were 1 million acres prevented from even \nbeing planted. Another 600,000 acres were subsequently drowned out, \neven though they were planted, by the worst flooding we have ever seen. \nI flew over southeastern North Dakota and it looked like Lake Agassi, \nwhich used to exist thousands of years ago, was reforming. I was on a \nplane and as far as the eye could see, there was water. I earlier \nreferenced this letter from a young farm family telling me how \ndevastating it was to them that they lost $120,000 and now this year, \nthe irony of ironies, suffering the worst drought since the 1930s. In \nfact, the drought monitor, which is the scientific analysis of drought, \nsaid the drought that has been suffered in the heartland of the country \nis the third worst in our Nation's history.\n  I was on farm after farm that looked like moonscapes. There was \nnothing growing. Nothing. It was the 4th of July. Corn is supposed to \nbe knee high by the 4th of July. Well, the corn wasn't as high as your \nshoelaces. I was even on irrigated ground and I saw irrigated corn and \nthe ears hadn't filled out because of the extreme heat. One day in my \nhometown of Bismarck, ND, it was 112 degrees. I am not talking about \nthe heat index; I am talking about the actual temperature. This isn't \nrestricted to my home State of North Dakota. South Dakota was even \nharder hit. The two Senators from that State, a Republican and \nDemocrat, are cosponsors of this legislation. The Senators from \nMinnesota, a Republican and a Democrat, are cosponsors of this \nlegislation. The Senators from Montana, a Republican and a Democrat, \nare cosponsors of this legislation. The Senators from Nebraska, a \nRepublican and a Democrat, are cosponsors of this legislation. The \nSenator from Kansas, Senator Roberts from Kansas, the former chairman \nof the House Agriculture Committee, is a cosponsor of this legislation. \nSenator Hutchison of Texas is a cosponsor of this legislation. All of \nthem have been hit by devastating drought this year.\n  What does this bill do? It provides bare-bones assistance to these \nfarmers. The cost is $4.5 billion over 2 years--over 2 years. So it \naverages about $2 billion a year. I will just put that in an historic \ncontext. In 2000 and 2001, we had disaster assistance bills that cost 1 \nyear over $11 billion and in another year over $14 billion. This is a \nfraction of those. The White House objected to my earlier provisions \nthat included something my southern colleagues asked for--I didn't ask \nfor it, my southern colleagues asked for it--and it passed in the \nappropriations bill. It was in the previous supplemental that passed \nthe Senate overwhelmingly. But the administration said: No, take that \nout, because you could be helping somebody not affected by a natural \ndisaster. So we took it out and saved $1.8 billion. We took out $250 \nmillion of the assistance for small businesses that have been affected. \nI have spray pilots who have been completely wiped out. They had no \nbusiness this year. They can't have business when there is no crop to \nspray. We took that out. We have made adjustment after adjustment to \nanswer the legitimate complaints of colleagues and the administration.\n  But now we are in a situation where we need to have a vote and have \nthe will of the Chamber expressed. Do they support this or do they not? \nThese farmers deserve at least that. They at least deserve to know: Are \nthey going to have a fair fighting chance for next year?\n  I would say to those who might be listening: Earlier this year I had \n12 independent bankers in my office when the President's chief economic \nadviser came to see me on another issue. I asked him to step in the \nconference room to listen for a few moments to these independent \nbankers from all across every corner of the State of North Dakota, and \nthey told Mr. Hubbard, unless there is assistance forthcoming, there \nwill be a loss of 5 to 10 percent of their clients. They told him that \n5 to 10 percent of the farmers and ranchers in North Dakota will be \nforced off the land and out of business. They will be done.\n  That is why Senator Dorgan and I are here with such tenacity, because \nwe are representing the economic lives of tens of thousands of farm \nfamilies--thousands in North Dakota, but also thousands more in \nMinnesota, in Montana, in South Dakota, in Nebraska. Our colleagues \nfrom those States have come repeatedly to the floor with us to make \nthis point. We have 26 cosponsors of this bill--26--lots of \nRepublicans, lots of Democrats, whose constituents have been similarly \ndevastated by natural disaster. Always in the past there has been a \nresponse and, frankly, generally far more generous than this \nassistance. But these people have not gotten the media attention. It is \nnot like the kind of disaster where the national media focuses, such as \na Katrina or Hurricane Rita, or some other devastation. But, in many \nways, this is a slow-motion disaster. This is a disaster that unfolded \nover many days and many weeks and even months no less devastating, but \nit didn't get the media attention.\n\n  I implore my colleagues to give us a chance to vote. That is all we \nare asking for. We absolutely understand that Senators have a right to \nvote against it. They have a right to bring a budget point of order. \nThey have a right to raise rule XVI. I don't think it applies here, but \nthey certainly have the right to do it, and to give us a vote. That is \nwhat was promised us yesterday. That is why I withdrew the amendment \nyesterday to let business proceed. But I only did it on the basis that \nwe would be given that opportunity today.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Chair for listening and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, first, thanks to my colleague who states \nwell the reasons we are on the floor. I think we have said most of what \nneeds to be said in support of those farm families who have struggled \nand who have been hit and devastated with something they could not have \nenvisioned: a natural disaster, drought and flood in both cases in our \nState in successive years.\n  I mentioned earlier this is not unusual. Traditionally in our country \nwhen family farmers have been hit with a tough blow, this country has \nsaid: You are not alone. We want to help you. And we have passed some \nkind of disaster legislation. We have provided some kind of help to \nthose families. They are the ones who live out on the farm alone. It is \na tough life.\n  I was looking back yesterday at 70 years ago in our region, first in \nSouth Dakota and next in North Dakota, when Franklin Delano Roosevelt \ndid a train trip and it was a drought tour. On that drought tour he \nwent out to say to people: I want to see what is happening out here and \nI want to tell you we are going to help. That was 70 years ago. This \nisn't new. We are not asking for\n\n[[Page S10952]]\n\nsomething that has not been done before. It is something that has \nalways been done.\n  The President has threatened to veto agricultural disaster aid when \nit has passed the Senate twice before. There were amendments I added in \nthe Senate Appropriations Committee providing disaster help for \nfarmers. It proceeded through the Senate. It went to conference. I was \na conferee. The President threatened the veto and he got the House \nconferees to resist it and knock it out.\n  We asked the President to do a drought tour, to go out and see the \nmiddle part of the country. Go to the Northern Great Plains, the \nepicenter of drought, and take a look at ground that is not growing \nanything. It is just bare ground where crops used to exist. The \nPresident was not able to do that.\n  I want to quote Franklin Delano Roosevelt who 70 years ago on a train \ndid do that drought tour. Here is what he said in Huron, SD, from the \nback platform of a train. The drought inspection trip was the occasion \nfor Franklin Delano Roosevelt to be on the back platform of a train, \nspeaking to the citizens of Huron, SD, and the family farmers in the \nsurrounding area. He said:\n\n       No city in an agricultural country can exist unless the \n     farms are prosperous. We have to cooperate with one another \n     rather than trying to buck one another. I have come out here \n     to find you with your chins up, looking toward the future \n     with confidence and courage. I am grateful for the attitude \n     you are taking out here. As I said, it is a question of \n     working together.\n\n  Then he was in Devils Lake, ND, on his train trip. He said:\n\n       Today out here I don't ask you to have courage and faith. \n     You have it. You have demonstrated that through a good many \n     years. I am asking, however, that you keep up that courage \n     and especially keep up that faith. If it is possible for \n     government to improve conditions, government will do it.\n\n  That is Franklin Delano Roosevelt 70 years ago. He said:\n\n       I assure you, the interests of these communities are very \n     close to my heart. I won't forget the day I have spent with \n     you. We hope that nature is going to open up the heavens. \n     When I came out on the platform this morning, I saw a rather \n     dark cloud and I said to myself, Maybe it is going to rain, \n     but it didn't. All I can say is I hope to goodness it is \n     going to rain good and plenty.\n\n  He said:\n\n       I will tell you, my friends, I am not going to let up until \n     I can give my best service to solving these problems.\n\n  Seventy years ago Franklin Delano Roosevelt, a man who knew family \nfarmers, a man who knew America's workers, got on the train and went to \ntake a look at what had happened, at the suffering in the Northern \nGreat Plains as a result of that drought and said: We are going to \nhelp.\n  This is not new. My colleague Senator Conrad and I are not asking for \nsomething that hasn't been done. In fact, in more modern times, the \nagriculture bill, known as the farm bill, has always included, until \nthe recent decade or so, a provision called the disaster title that \ncould be triggered when there was a disaster. That is not the case now. \nSo each year we have to come to the Senate to ask for a separate \ndisaster aid package, to try to reach out and help those who otherwise \nare going to be thrown off the farm and told they can't continue. Is it \ntheir fault? No, it is not their fault. Bad managers? No, not bad \nmanagers. Spend too much? No. It was a drought that came and destroyed \neverything they had, and where, in some parts of the country, a flood \ncame and wiped out everything that existed on their farm. It is not \ntheir fault. It is the best of this country then to reach out and say: \nWe want to help you. We think you are important to this country.\n  I mentioned yesterday a fellow named Rodney Nelson from my State who \nwrites prose. He is a cowboy poet. He lives near Almont, ND, and he \nwrote a piece once that I have not forgotten. He asked in that piece: \nWhat is it worth? I think it is important for us to ask the question, \nWhat is it worth? What is it worth to have a kid who knows how to weld \na seam? What is it worth to have a kid who knows how to work livestock? \nWhat is it worth to have a kid who knows how to grease a combine? What \nis it worth to have a kid who knows how to fix a tractor? What is it \nworth to have a kid who knows how to build a lean-to? What is it worth \nto have a kid who knows how to teach a newborn calf how to suck milk \nout of a bucket? What is all that worth? What is it worth to have a kid \nwho knows how to plow a straight line?\n\n  There is only one university in America, only one, where they teach \nall those skills, and that is the family farm. Some people say it \ndoesn't matter. It does to us. That is why we are here. This is not \nabout a handout. It is about a helping hand during a time of trouble, \nduring a drought and a flood. It is the best of what this country can \ndo, and it is what this country should do. I hope, before this day is \nout, we will have an agreement by which we will have an opportunity to \noffer this amendment, get a vote on this amendment, after which clearly \nit will pass the Senate, and we will be on the way to getting this to \nthe President.\n  My hope is that the President will not block it. He previously said \nhe would veto legislation such as this, but I think, since he said \nthat, things have changed. My hope is that he will recognize that \nchange.\n  There has been a lot of discussion about change in this country in \nrecent days, particularly in the last week. Change has a lot of meaning \nto it. Change is a word that we hope the President will embrace with \nrespect to this issue. Twice previously he has blocked disaster aid for \nfarmers who suffered a disaster as a result of weather-related \nproblems. Twice previously he has blocked it. We hope he recognizes the \nchange necessary to decide that now we need to help those family \nfarmers.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor. I make a point of order a quorum is \nnot present.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, we have been talking about these disasters \nof 2005 and 2006. I thought maybe it would be helpful to show a picture \nof what we are talking about.\n  This is last year in North Dakota, the Southeastern part of the \nState. You can see the massive flooding. There is water everywhere. \nOnly the farmhouse that is surrounded by sandbags is dry--and part of \nthe barn. This was seen all across North Dakota last year.\n  Now, this year, there is an incredible change. This is what we saw \nthis year. This is the most wicked drought I have ever seen in my life. \nThis is a cornfield in my home county. The corn should have been 2 to \n2\\1/2\\ feet high. You can see there is nothing here that is going to \nproduce anything. This gentleman standing there, we asked him to be in \nthe picture to give perspective. It is similar to a moonscape. We saw \nthis all over western South Dakota. Nothing grew.\n  I told the story earlier of being on a farm south of Bismarck with \nirrigated corn--160 acres of irrigated corn. We took the ears off the \ncorn and stripped them and about every third row of kernels was gone. \nThere was nothing there.\n  I said to the farmer: How does this happen with irrigated corn?\n  He said: Kent, remember, last Sunday alone it was 112 degrees here. \nIt was so hot, so intensely hot, that the kernels couldn't form.\n  This is the Drought Monitor. This is actually a publication by the \nU.S. Department of Agriculture that shows the severity of drought. Let \nme point out this is a scientifically designed survey. It focuses on \nbroad-scale conditions. The yellow is abnormally dry; the tan is \ndrought that is moderate; the darker tan is drought that is severe; the \nred is drought that is extreme; and the dark brown is drought that is \nexceptional. Those are the gradations. From abnormally dry in yellow, \nto light tan, moderate drought, the darker tan severe drought, the red \nis extreme drought, and the brown is exceptional drought.\n  Look at my State. North and South Dakota--exceptional drought, \nextreme drought, severe drought. The whole State in drought.\n  It was not just North Dakota. You can see Minnesota, a very big \nswatch here of extreme drought.\n  Over into Montana. As I said, South Dakota, Nebraska--right down the \ncenter of the country, Kansas, over into\n\n[[Page S10953]]\n\nColorado, over into Wyoming, down into Texas and Oklahoma. These are \nStates, all of which have had drought conditions and quite severe \ndrought conditions.\n  The disaster assistance that we are seeking has been endorsed by all \nof these farm groups--34 different farm groups saying that we need \ndrought assistance and we need it now, everything from the National \nFarmers Union to the Barley Growers, the Cotton Council, the Wheat \nGrowers, the Peanut Producers, the Farm Credit Council, the Soybean \nGrowers, the Sheep Industry, the American Farm Bureau--all of them \nsaying:\n\n       We urge you to schedule a vote before the October recess on \n     emergency agriculture disaster assistance legislation.\n\n  They were asking for it to be done before the October recess. And it \nis not just the farm groups, but it is also the agriculture \ncommissioners from around the country. Here is what they said in a \nletter to the Senate back in September:\n\n       The State Commissioners, the Secretaries of Agriculture and \n     the Directors of Agriculture of the National Association of \n     State Departments of Agriculture urge you to support \n     emergency disaster assistance legislation for farmers and \n     ranchers suffering losses and damages in 2005 and 2006.\n       NASDA believes that emergency agriculture disaster \n     assistance is a high priority requiring action by Congress \n     this year.\n\n  This year is swiftly running out. They went on to say:\n\n       While there are risk management programs such as crop \n     insurance, disaster loans, and emergency grazing, the relief \n     needed greatly exceeds the levels these programs can provide.\n\n  Some of my colleagues have said: Doesn't crop insurance cover this? \nNo, crop insurance doesn't cover it. Why not? Because crop insurance is \nnot designed for repeated loss. It is designed for periodic loss. That \nis what most insurance is designed for. Fire insurance on your home is \nnot designed to deal with a situation in which your house burns down \nevery year. What we have is a situation in which we have had repeated \ndifferent disasters--flood last year, drought this year--a bizarre set \nof circumstances. But crop insurance is not designed for that kind of \nsituation. With crop insurance, what happens when you have repeated \ndisasters, the way the formula works is your coverage level diminishes \nautomatically so that if you have had repeated losses, crop insurance \ndoes not provide much assistance. That is the hard reality. That is the \nway it works.\n  Some have said: Gee, we ought to fix that. Well, that is a good idea, \nbut that is the way it works right now. So if you do not have a \ndisaster program to offset some of these losses, you wash people right \nout of business. And that is what is going to happen, not just in my \nState but right down the center of the country. That is why you see \nthese farm organizations coming forward--those that are Republican \noriented, those that are Democratically oriented, unanimously saying \nthis is needed. That is why you hear the agriculture commissioners and \nthe secretaries of agriculture of the States together, in unison: This \nis needed.\n  I respect those who say: I am against that. My State is not affected. \nI will oppose it. They have a right to oppose it. They have a right to \ncome and vote against it. But it seems to me it is only fair that \npeople at least be given a vote. Let's let the body here work its will. \nIf somebody wants to say there is a budget point of order against this, \nthat is fair. You can have a budget point of order and require more \nthan 60 votes to pass. I respect anybody offering that.\n  I respect somebody saying rule XVI ought to apply. We have been to \nthe Parliamentarian. Rule XVI doesn't apply because this is on an \nagriculture bill, it is agricultural disaster, so we are told rule XVI \ndoes not apply. There are other ways of writing this to further assure \nrule XVI does not apply.\n  I say to my colleagues, a commitment was made, publicly and \nprivately, that we are going to go to the agriculture disaster bill \ntoday. Today is here. Today is fast fleeting. In fact, as I look out \nthe door there toward the direction of the Supreme Court of the United \nStates, I can see the dusk is falling.\n  I know the Senate often does its work at night. I have never quite \nunderstood that, I say to the occupant of the chair, but for some \nreason this place often doesn't get around to voting. I think it is \nbecause Senators have appointments all afternoon. The reality of the \nwork is they are in committees all morning and they have appointments \nevery 15 minutes or every 30 minutes all afternoon, so by the time they \nget to come and offer their amendments and offer legislation, it is \noften in the evening. But the evening is fast approaching, and I hope, \nI say to my colleagues, I hope we have a chance to vote. Let's give \nthese farm families at least an indication of where they stand. Is \nthere going to be assistance forthcoming or not?\n  Some have said it is fiscally irresponsible. I understand there is an \neditorial in the Wall Street Journal, criticizing me, saying I am known \nas somebody who wants to see a return to fiscal responsibility and yet \nI am offering this amendment.\n  That is true. I think one of the greatest threats to this country is \nthe massive debt we are accumulating. I am extremely worried about it. \nBut I also know the Government has an obligation to help those who are \naffected by natural disasters. This is a very modest package, $4 \nbillion over 2 years. In 2000 and 2001 we had disaster assistance \nprograms that were approaching more than $10 billion: $14.8 billion 1 \nyear and $11 billion in the next.\n  This is a very tightly written, constrained disaster relief program \nin which we have responded to the criticisms leveled by the \nadministration by taking out those things to which they objected.\n  I will conclude with this thought.\n  Agriculture is far under the projections that were made for its costs \nwhen the farm bill was written in 2002. Agriculture is below by about \n$15 billion what was projected at the time the farm bill was written. \nSome have said the farm bill was a huge increase over the previous farm \nbill. No. What they are missing is if you combine the disaster \nassistance and the farm legislation with previous bills and compare it \nto what we are doing now, spending is not up; it is down and down \nsignificantly.\n  As I have indicated, we are $15 billion below what the projections \nwere when the farm bill was written.\n  That is the circumstance we face.\n  I have very much riveted in my mind the drought tour we took earlier \nthis year with the leaders of our State going from community to \ncommunity listening to farm families describe the magnitude of the \ndisaster facing them. I remember being in one farm yard and having one \nof the most respected farmers in our State take me aside, and say: \nKent, this is my last year. I can't continue.\n  This is a man who has won virtually every farm award in the State of \nNorth Dakota. He said to me: You know my family has been on the land \nfor over 100 years in North Dakota. We have a ``legacy farm.'' But we \nhave not had a normal crop in 5 years.\n  This is in the Red River Valley of North Dakota.\n  When I grew up, my grandfather would drive through and say: There has \nnever been a crop failure in the Red River Valley. It is the richest \nfarmland in the world outside of the Nile Valley. In the Red River \nValley of North Dakota, until the last 6 or 7 years, there has never \nbeen a crop failure. We have had the most bizarre set of weather events \nof my lifetime. We had 18 inches of rain in 24 hours in a town in the \nRed River Valley, in an area that only gets 18 inches of rain a year. \nTwo years later, they had 14 inches of rain in 24 hours.\n  We have a lake called Devils Lake that has gone up 26 feet in the \nlast 9 years. This lake is now three times the size of the District of \nColumbia.\n  There is something very odd going on. I don't pretend to know what it \nis. Some say global climate change. Some scientists who have studied it \nsay my part of the country would be most severely affected by a global \nclimate change, that these extremes would be made more extreme. I do \nnot know about that. I do know that in my lifetime I have never seen \nanything like this.\n  Can you imagine a lake, a giant lake, going up 26 feet vertically in \n9 years? It is an awesome thing to see 18 inches of rainfall in a town \nin 24 hours where the average rainfall is about that a year.\n  This is what has been happening. Now this incredible drought which \nthe\n\n[[Page S10954]]\n\nDrought Monitor says is the third most extreme drought in the history \nof the United States. I do not know how they measure drought. I do not \nknow how they make that determination. These are scientific experts. I \ntrust that they know what they are doing.\n  I say to my colleagues that I have seen firsthand land that looks \nlike a moonscape which would normally be lush.\n  These people are hanging by a thread. The question is, Do they have \nthe chance to survive until next year or are they done? Many of them \nare going to be out of business. But many more will be, if there is a \nfailure to act, if there is a failure by Congress to do what it has \nalmost always done in the case of natural disaster, which is to provide \ndisaster relief on an emergency basis.\n  We don't budget for natural disasters. There is no line item in the \nbudget for natural disaster. Perhaps there should be, but there is \nnone.\n  I, frankly, think it would be a wise thing to do. At least we could \ntake the average for some period of time and reduce it by 25 percent \nand put that in so we would have some way of having additional \ndiscipline in the budget.

LYONS\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, this afternoon I come to the Senate floor \nto pay tribute to Marine LCpl Christopher Lyons from Mansfield, OH. On \nJuly 28, 2005, Lance Corporal Lyons was killed when his unit \nencountered hostile fire in Iraq. He was only 24 years old.\n  Lance Corporal Lyons is survived by his wife Bethany and their \ndaughter Ella; his mother Phyllis Lyons; his father and step-mother, \nPaul and Debbie Lyons; his grandmothers Irmil Humphreys and Joyce \nLyons; and numerous aunts, uncles, and cousins.\n  Christopher's family and friends remember him as an exceptional young \nman, someone who was always full of fun. With a quick wit and an \ninfectious smile, his own love of life always brought happiness to \nthose around him. Caring, selfless, loving, and extremely intelligent, \nChristopher had the gift of bringing out the best in everyone. He was \nsimply the type of person who stood out in a crowd.\n  Christopher graduated in 1999 from Shelby High School, where he was \nenrolled in the Tech Prep Program at Pioneer Career and Technology \nCenter. His vice-principal, Tim Tarvin, describes him as a ``big-\nhearted kid, who always wanted to do the right thing for people.''\n  Kevin Adkins, Christopher's youth pastor, remembers the impact that \nChristopher had on everyone who knew him. He said this:\n\n       As a teenager, [Christopher] was the type of man that I \n     have always strived to be. I'm not so sure how much I \n     actually taught him, but just by his life, alone, he has \n     taught me volumes. As a pastor, I was both humbled and \n     uplifted by Chris's excellence and tenacity toward life. His \n     example will live on in the many lives (like ours) that he \n     has touched. I hope to raise my own two sons to be of such \n     caliber.\n\n  After completing school, Christopher became a sales representative in \nthe advertising department at the News Journal in Mansfield, Ohio. \nAdvertising Director Scott Miller describes him as a polite young man \nwho always took his obligations seriously. And Tom Brennan, publisher \nof the News Journal, said this about him:\n\n       Christopher was an outstanding young man. He was the \n     ultimate professional. Simply put, he was polite and \n     positive. Any employer would have found a spot for him. The \n     staff here will surely miss him.\n\n  Christopher's widow Bethany recalls her husband's ability to make \neveryone laugh and the way that he would tickle her to get her to \nsmile. They were married in September 2003. Christopher's youth pastor \nremembers meeting Bethany for the first time. He remarked, ``I will \nalways remember that I thought you two were the cutest couple I have \never seen. It would take a very special person to catch Chris's eye.''\n  Christopher was inspired to join the military by the terrorist \nattacks of September 11, 2001. His unit was called to active duty in \n2005, and Christopher was sent to California for training. In March of \nthat same year, he was deployed to Iraq.\n  Months before his deployment, Christopher and Bethany became \nexpectant parents. For Christopher, who was so devoted to his family, \nit was a momentous occasion, and he was so proud of a t-shirt he wore \nwith the word ``Daddy'' on the front of it.\n  Christopher's daughter Ella was born while her father was serving in \nIraq. Although he was overseas, Christopher was able to see his new \ndaughter on a web camera and in the many photos that his wife and his \nmother sent to him. And as she grows up, Ella will have numerous emails \nand photos from Christopher to treasure.\n  Christopher regularly wrote to family and friends from Iraq. Two of \nthese letters were sent to the News Journal in Mansfield and were \npublished in their editorial pages. The letters told about \nChristopher's experience in Iraq, and what it was like to lose a \nsergeant in his unit during combat. ``When all is said and done,'' he \nwrote, ``the greatest act is when one of our own gives his or her life \nin service [to] our country and each other.''\n  This, of course, is the sacrifice that Christopher, himself, made for \nour Nation and for the ideals of freedom and democracy that we all hold \ndear. Christopher believed in his mission in Iraq. And, while paying \ntribute to eight of his Marine brothers who had fallen in combat, he \nwrote the following in one of his letters:\n\n       The Corps values of honesty, courage and commitment have \n     served as our cornerstone as we press on to put down the \n     insurgency and win the war on terror.\n       The people [in the] villages were grateful for our \n     presence, often showing gratitude and appreciation by \n     offering tea, blankets, or simply a smile and wave.\n       Seeing this reaffirms that we have a purpose working toward \n     a greater good in this country. Honoring our fallen brothers, \n     we will continue the fight upholding the highest standards \n     and working to break this dark oppressive force that lingers \n     over the Iraqi citizens.\n\n  These are very impressive words, Mr. President, from a young man who \nwas just 24-years-old.\n  Christopher's widow remembers that Christopher realized he could be \nkilled while in serving in Iraq. But, she also remembers that \nChristopher, after being deployed, ``saw how much good the United \nStates was doing for Iraq.''\n  Christopher's first person accounts of Lima Company's heroism spread \nto the\n\n[[Page S10955]]\n\nfamilies and friends of readers eager to hear from one of their own. In \nGreenwich, OH, Christopher's 9 year-old cousin Devin Back wrote of \nChristopher's heroism in a poem entitled, ``My Hero:''\n\n     My hero is my cousin, Christopher.\n     He is nice.\n     He is playful.\n     He is in Iraq.\n     My cousin is very smart.\n     Christopher, my cousin, is not afraid of anything.\n     He is cool. He is happy a lot.\n     He writes to us from Iraq.\n     He takes a lot of risks.\n\n  Christopher's aunt Gwen Gwinner remembers that he never said anything \nbad about anyone. And his cousin Amy Blevins remembers that he was the \ndefinition of honorable, even before he joined the Marines. Throughout \nhis entire life, Christopher was simply the kind of person who was \nrespectful of and considerate to everyone.\n  Christopher's mother describes her son as her best friend, as someone \nwho was always ``kind, gentle, caring, compassionate, and giving.''\n  ``People have said to me how proud I must be of him,'' she said. ``I \nwas proud of him before he entered the military because of his \nintegrity and his ability to let things roll off his back.''\n  At an early age, Phyllis taught her son the importance of honesty, \nhard work, and respect. Christopher used an acronym to encompass his \nbeliefs and values. The acronym was ``WHO:'' W- for willingness--to \nalways be willing to do what you must and what is asked of you; H- for \nhonesty and integrity--to be honest about what and why you do what you \ndo; and O for obedience--always obey those who have rule over you, \nincluding God first and your mother.\n  From boot camp and Iraq, Christopher would write his mother Phyllis \nto say that he would keep the faith and be alright--and that he knew \n``WHO'' he was. Phyllis says it is Christopher she now turns to for \ncomfort. ``He is now my strength and guidance,'' she said.\n  I am honored that I had the opportunity to meet Christopher's family \nand friends during a memorial in his honor, all of whom remember him as \na special and unique person. He will never be forgotten by those who \nknew him. Christopher was an avid Scrabble player, and there was a \nmessage for him spelled out in Scrabble letters at his funeral. It read \nsimply: ``B-E-L-O-V-E-D'' beloved.\n  The spirit of LCpl Christopher Lyons will never be forgotten. He had \nan insight into life and a sense of humor that was truly unique. He \nunderstood the importance of service, and was a man who was dedicated \nto family, community, and country.\n  My wife Fran and I continue to keep the family of LCpl Christopher \nLyons in our thoughts and prayers.\n\n\n                      MAJOR RAMON J. MENDOZA, JR.\n\n  Mr. President, I also rise today to pay tribute to Marine MAJ Ramon \nJ. Mendoza Jr., from Columbus, OH. On November 15, 2005, Major Mendoza \ndied from wounds that were sustained when an improvised explosive \ndevice detonated near his vehicle. He was 37 years old. He is survived \nby his wife Karen, his daughter Kiana, and his son Aleksandr. He is \nalso survived by his two brothers Niola and Jermaine.\n  The death of Major Ray Mendoza has been felt by many. He was a man \nconsidered indestructible--someone whom his friends and family describe \nas ``larger than life.'' His smile will always be remembered. It was \nhuge and put everyone he met immediately at ease.\n  Ray was also devoted to serving his Nation and his Marines. He was \ndedicated, compassionate, and hard-working. His death is a loss not \nonly for those who knew and loved him, but for our entire country.\n  Ray was born in Pleasantville, NJ, in 1968. He moved to Queens, NY, \nas a boy and graduated from John Adams High School in 1986. He then \nattended the prestigious Blair Academy in New Jersey for a year of \nstudy, where he was captain of the football team and a member of the \nwrestling team.\n  Many admired Ray at Blair Academy for his hard work and dedication. \nBob Latessa, his former wrestling coach, remembers that ``There was no \ntask too tall. He never got down. He never ever felt sorry for himself \nor felt like he couldn't do something. This is a kid that just blew \neverybody away. I feel lucky and privileged to have known him.''\n  Ray carried his tremendous work ethic and positive attitude with him \nto the Ohio State University, where he was a heavyweight wrestler. \nCoach Russ Hellickson described him as an aggressive athlete who \npursued his goals with passion. ``He wasn't a guy who stood around,'' \nhe said. Coach Hellickson will never forget the young man who was one \nof his star wrestlers. Ray ``forced the action and went after things,'' \nhe recalled. ``He was a pleasure to watch. I always felt he was a very \nmature kid. He was committed to accomplishing what he set out to do.''\n  Ray lettered for the Buckeyes in 1992 and 1993 and was the Big Ten \nrunner-up in the heavyweight division in 1993. His contributions to the \nBuckeyes will never be forgotten. They placed fourth in the Nation \nwhile he was there, and Ray's overtime victory against a reigning champ \nin the 1993 Big Ten tournament remains one of the program's most \nthrilling moments. Adam DiSabato, one of Ray's former teammates, \nremembers that Ray was the ``key ingredient'' to their team. ``He \nsolidified our team,'' he said. ``He was the type of guy who wouldn't \nargue if you told him to do something that would benefit the team.''\n  Today, wrestlers at Ohio State remember Ray by wearing a patch \nbearing his name on their singlets. And during one game, the OSU \nfootball team wore a decal on their helmets in Ray's memory.\n  While he was attending OSU, Ray met Karen Miller, the love of his \nlife. Karen recalls that Ray began thinking of joining the Marines soon \nafter graduating. According to Karen, he simply felt that it was his \ncalling. She said, ``We were married and getting set to launch a \nfamily. He said, `I just have to do this.' It was almost like a calling \nto the pulpit.''\n  Ray completed Officer Candidate School at Quantico, VA, and entered \nthe Marine Corps in February 1995. He was commissioned Second \nLieutenant in August 1995 and assigned as an infantry officer at the \nbasic school.\n  While in the military, Ray continued his competitive wrestling \ncareer. He competed for the All-Marine Wrestling Team and was the \nCentral Region Olympic Trial Greco-Roman Champion at 100 kilograms. One \nyear, he placed second in the nation in the Armed Services National \nWrestling Tournament. And in 1996, Ray was able to live the dream of \nmillions when he became an alternate for the U.S. wrestling team at the \nOlympic Games in Atlanta.\n  But Ray was much more than an incredible wrestling talent. He brought \nthe same dedication and determination that he had displayed on the mat \nto his service as a Marine. In October 1997, Ray was selected for \naugmentation and promoted to the rank of captain. He now had a regular \ncommission in the United States Marine Corps.\n  Ray was deployed to Iraq with his unit in June 2003. Upon being \nredeployed after combat, he assumed command of Echo Company. And on \nOctober 1, 2005, Ray was promoted to the rank of major in the \noperational theatre.\n  Ray was a true leader in the Marines who always inspired others. \nCourage and dedication were attributes that he repeatedly displayed. In \nHusayba, Iraq, Ray positioned himself at the point of attack to \nmaneuver his platoons and attachments, without regard to his own \nsafety. While leading from the front, Ray enabled his company to defeat \nseveral enemy strong points and allowed the battalion to maintain its \ninitiative as it advanced through the city.\n  MG Richard F. Natonski said this about the service of Ray and his \ncomrades in Iraq:\n\n       For a period of 9 days--starting November 5, 2005--Echo \n     Company made history. Company Echo, under Mendoza's \n     leadership, cleared over 600 buildings, found 16 weapon \n     caches, and detained more than 300 insurgents.\n\n  Major Mendoza was truly loved by the marines under his command. SSG \nBoyde Allen described him as ``the best platoon commander I've ever \nserved under.'' And, SGT David Sanchez remembers Major Mendoza's effort \nto get to know his marines, and how one day he took the time to ask him \nabout his sister's wedding ceremony. ``He was really surprising,'' said \nSergeant Sanchez. ``He really knew his marines.''\n\n[[Page S10956]]\n\n  Ray's service to this Nation has earned him many awards, including a \nposthumous Bronze Star. But the awards are not what matter most. \nAccording to Ray's wife:\n\n       Awards are great, but the most fulfilling reward I can \n     receive and our family can receive is knowing that the \n     Marines completed their mission. His boys finished the job.\n\n  Karen has started the Ray Mendoza Blair Wrestling Scholarship fund in \nher husband's memory, which will provide a financial contribution to a \nstudent-athlete attending Blair Academy. And Karen's own bravery and \ndedication to the Corps have been remarkable to everyone around her. \n``She's a phenomenal example for all of us,'' said Judy L. Svendsen, \nKaren's longtime friend. ``She's always thinking of the military \nfamilies, putting them first.''\n  Mr. President, those who knew Ray all agree that he died doing what \nhe loved to do--and that was leading marines. ``He was always right in \nthe friction,'' remembers 1SG Dennis J. Downing. ``He always thought \nhis best point of view was right up there with the Marines.''\n  Perhaps the words of SGM Sylvester D. Daniels say it best:\n\n       We all love Major Mendoza, make no mistake about that.\n\n  Without a doubt, Ray will continue to lead and inspire even after his \npassing. Karen says that she will never forget what happened shortly \nafter receiving word that her husband had died. Her 8-year-old son, \nAlec, wrote a note and hung it from his bedroom door. The note read,\n\n       Be a leader, not a follower.\n\n  I would like to conclude with words from a tribute that Ray's former \nwrestling coach wrote and posted on the Ohio State web site:\n\n       Much like in the Marines, success on the wrestling mat is a \n     consequence of the diligence and discipline that goes in to \n     the training. Ray knew the only way to truly perform was to \n     immerse yourself in the preparation. Do it hard, do it right, \n     and do it relentlessly with passionate resolve.\n       Ray put his heart and soul into every lift, every run and \n     every match he ever wrestled for the Buckeyes. To a man, his \n     teammates are grieving today. To know Ray, was to love him \n     and respect him. No excuses ever! He was never absent, never \n     late, and always ready to do his part with a smile and 100% \n     commitment.\n       Ray was a powerful man with a kind and caring heart. He was \n     the ultimate team player in that he cared as much or more \n     about you as he did about himself. Ray loved his family, he \n     loved his fellow Marines, and he loved his wrestling \n     Buckeyes.\n       Ray showed us all that leadership is not a position, it is \n     an action. Ray is my hero, too. Good bye, my friend.\n\n  My wife Fran and I will continue to keep the family and friends of \nRay Mendoza in our thoughts and prayers. He was a truly outstanding \nmarine. He was a truly outstanding human being. He will never be \nforgotten.\n\n\n                     Corporal Jeffrey A. Boskovitch\n\n  Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute on the Senate floor to \nMarine Cpl Jeffrey Allen Boskovitch of Seven Hills, OH. Corporal \nBoskovitch was assigned to the 3rd Battalion, 25th Marine Regiment, 4th \nMarine Division, based in Brook Park, OH. He was one of six members of \na sniper unit to be killed on August 1, 2005, by small-arms fire in \nIraq. He was 25 years of age.\n  Jeff--as he was called by family and friends--lived a life that \nepitomized the virtues of bravery and dedication. His zest for life was \nboth admirable and rare. He loved shooting pool with friends, bungee \njumping, hot-air ballooning, and playing paint-ball. In the eyes of his \nyoung nephews, he was the ``best'' because he was so ``cool'' and \nbecause he loved the videogame HALO as much as they did. He is greatly \nmissed by everyone who knew him.\n  Jeff graduated from Normandy High School in 1999, where he played \nquarterback and wide receiver for the Invaders. Soon after graduating, \nhe enlisted in the Marine Corps Reserves and began studying criminal \njustice at Cuyahoga Community College. He graduated from the program as \npresident of his class in 2001. At the time he was sent overseas, he \nwas working full time as a corporate security supervisor for National \nCity Bank and part time as a deputy with the Geauga County Sheriff.\n  One of Jeff's classmates, Tim Ellis, recognized his friend's natural \ngifts as a leader. Tim remembers how Jeff--who was in outstanding \nshape--would fall back in order to encourage the slower guys during \ntheir training runs. ``Hang in there,'' he would say, ``only one lap \nleft.'' Tim wrote the following in remembrance of his friend on an \nInternet tribute page:\n\n       Jeff was elected class president without asking for it or \n     even mentioning it. He was a born leader. Jeff had a higher \n     calling, and I will forever look up to him.\n\n  In January of 2005, Jeff followed that higher calling when his unit \nwas deployed to Iraq. And Jeff found more than comrades in his sniper \nunit--he found brothers. They became a tightly knit group, so close \nthat Jeff later declined a promotion just to be able to stay with them.\n  I would like to quote the words of SGT Brian Casagrande, who served \nwith the snipers of 3-25. In a eulogy for his fallen comrade, he had \nthis to say:\n\n       Jeff Boskovitch was the platoon clown. He had a great sense \n     of humor. He would often imitate other people and we loved to \n     pick on him too. . . . He proved himself to be a valuable \n     asset to the platoon, and was a comforting, sometimes comical \n     voice on the other side of the handset.\n\n  Jeff loved his unit, and he loved his marines. According to his \nfather Jim, ``He was always one to do the honorable thing.'' And in the \nwords of his uncle Dan, Jeff ``had the biggest heart in the world. He \nwas just a great kid.''\n  Jeff truly was a person who cared deeply. One example of his \ncompassion is the story about a puppy that Jeff found in a paper bag \ncarried by an Iraqi boy. He asked the child to sell the puppy to him \nfor a quarter and three jellybeans. The boy agreed, and Jeff named the \ndog Beans. Beans became the mascot of the entire 3-25 and would help \nthem on missions. One time, she even alerted the unit to an attempted \nambush. In an e-mail to his mother, Kathy, Jeff expressed the love for \nhis new friend with the following simple words: ``Beans is so cool.'' \nHe sent his mother pictures of Beans, and Kathy began to raise money to \nbring the dog back to Ohio.\n  After Jeff died, Kathy embarked on a quest, a quest to bring his dog \nBeans home, petitioning the aid of both politicians and military \nofficials. The story of ``Operation Beans'' was printed in newspapers \nin both the United States and Iraq. Three months later, after crossing \nthe Atlantic on a military transport plane, Beans disembarked in Ohio \nand found Jeff's mother Kathy waiting for her. On the way home, Beans \nand Kathy made a stop at Jeff's final resting place.\n  Jeff was a young man who had a bright future before him. He was an \naspiring police officer, someone willing to step forward as a role \nmodel for the entire community and for those who loved him.\n  Jeff was also planning a family. Days before he was killed, he spoke \nwith his beloved fiancee, Shelly Tevis, and selected a date for their \nwedding. The date was to be October 14, 2006. In Shelly's words, ``Jeff \njust embodied wholesomeness and strength, everyone looked up to him, \nand we will miss him very, very much.''\n  Mr. President, I would like to conclude with the words of Jeff's \nfather. This is what he said about his son:\n\n       We're proud of him. And we look at him as a true hero--just \n     like the other men and women who are serving in Iraq.\n\n  Indeed, the world is a better place because Jeff Boskovitch was in \nit. He will forever be remembered for his sincere compassion to help \nand serve others, for his sense of humor, and for his dedication to his \nfriends, family, and country. He will be remembered as a devoted son, a \nkind brother, a beloved fiancee, and the best friend of a dog named \nBeans.\n  My wife Fran and I will continue to keep Jeff's family and friends in \nour thoughts and in our prayers.\n\n\n                      Lance Corporal Aaron H. Reed\n\n  Mr. President, I come to the Senate floor today to talk about Marine \nLCpl Aaron Reed from Chillicothe, OH, and pay tribute to him. On August \n3, 2005, Lance Corporal Reed was killed when his military vehicle was \nhit by an improvised explosive device during combat operations in Iraq. \nHe was only 21 years old--just 20 days shy of his 22nd birthday.\n  Aaron was one of the marines with Lima Company--Marine Force \nReserve's 3rd Battalion, 25th Marine Regiment, 4th Marine Division, \nbased in Columbus, OH. Everyone knows their story, which is one that \nhas touched hearts across this Nation. On the day\n\n[[Page S10957]]\n\nAaron died, 13 other men in his unit--eight of them from Ohio--died \nalongside him. It was a tragedy that was felt by the Nation and felt by \nthe State of Ohio.\n  Aaron's family and friends remember him as a quiet young man with an \nupbeat demeanor. His smile was truly something special. With it, he \ncould light up an entire room. He was easy-going and social with his \nfriends, always ready to laugh. At the same time, though, when it came \ntime to get things done, no one worked harder than he did.\n  Aaron's capacity for leadership was unique, and he was active in both \nhis church and community. His words always had a great impact on those \nwho heard them. A 2001 graduate of Southeastern High School--where he \nhad run both cross-country and track and field--he had been elected by \nhis classmates to serve as senior class president. Leonard Steyer, \nAaron's principal, said, ``When you're senior class president, that \nshould tell you quite a bit about what kind of young man he was.''\n  Aaron was also known for his compassion. His mother Sara was active \nwith Habitat for Humanity, and they were planning to help build a house \ntogether when Aaron returned from Iraq. In the words of Cody Elam, one \nof Aaron's friends from high school, Aaron ``was the kind of guy to \ngive you the shirt off his back if you needed it.''\n  Aaron joined the Marines shortly after graduating. He wasn't the \nfirst member of his family to serve in the military--his older brother \nMatt was stationed in Kosovo at the time. According to his father, \nSteve, Aaron simply wanted the challenge of being a marine.\n  It is impossible to remember LCpl Aaron Reed without also remembering \nthe other marines of Lima Company. The bond among these men was \nsomething we do not see every day. They were truly brothers. Because \nAaron had dark hair and glasses, they nicknamed him after the fictional \nwizard ``Harry Potter.''\n  Before his death, Aaron had been promoted to team leader. According \nto his friend Joey Barker, Aaron was spending almost all of his spare \ntime analyzing past missions to better prepare for the next one. But, \nthis is simply the kind of man Aaron was--always hard-working and \nalways willing to do his best for others.\n  Aaron kept in touch with his family and friends regularly while in \nIraq, calling and e-mailing frequently. Aaron and his friend Joey had \nbeen playing an intense game of tic-tac-toe through the mail. Joey \nremembers that Aaron had been ``in one of the best moods he'd ever \nheard him, laughing and joking around.'' At the time, he had been in \nIraq since March 2005, and was scheduled to come home in late \nSeptember.\n  Aaron's dad's last communication from Aaron was through e-mail, a \nshort note letting him know his son was safe. His dad still chuckles \nwhen he reads the greeting--``Hey Daddy-O,'' using the nickname he had \ngiven his father, ``nothing much going on here. Just the daily grind . \n. . Just thought I'd drop you a short note to let you know I was doing \nfine.'' And in an e-mail to his mother, Sara, Aaron wrote, ``Mom, I'm \njust out here doing the best I know how to do.''\n  It was typical of Aaron to describe his service in Iraq as ``nothing \nmuch.'' He was always willing to serve others and do so with a cheerful \nsmile on his face.\n  Aaron remained positive throughout his time in Iraq. Angela Flowers \nhad been his friend since the time they met in seventh grade, and the \ntwo wrote each other frequently during Aaron's deployment. Aaron called \nwhen he was able, and Angela remembers the last time they talked. ``He \nwas extremely optimistic and positive,'' she said. ``He was still the \nsame old Reed.''\n  Hundreds of mourners gathered at Aaron's funeral to pay their \nrespects. Family and friends talked about Aaron the jokester, Aaron the \nfaithful friend, and Aaron the steadfast teammate. They also laughed \nand told funny tales about joy riding and the typical teenage pranks \nthat Aaron had played.\n  They also spoke of Aaron's faith in God. Aaron was wearing a cross \naround his neck when he died. It was recovered and returned to his \nmother Sara. She wears that cross every day.\n  At his funeral, Aaron's friend Joey played guitar and sang one of \nAaron's favorite songs: ``The Dance,'' by Garth Brooks. ``We all loved \nAaron, and Aaron loved all of us,'' Joey said. ``He left this world \nmuch better than he found it.''\n  Aaron had big plans for his life. He was planning to attend college \nwhen he returned from Iraq. He loved to write, and his father believes \nAaron would have become an excellent writer. ``He had the heart of a \npoet,'' his father said. ``And he wrote some very good things.''\n  Aaron will never be forgotten. A memorial scholarship has been \nestablished in his honor. Family, friends, community members, and \ncomplete strangers gave willingly and generously. Almost $25,000 has \nbeen raised, and the first scholarship of $1,000 was granted last \nspring to a graduating Southeastern senior.\n  Aaron's mother Sara also worked to build a Habitat house in his honor \nand in the honor of Army SPC Gavin Colburn, another Ohioan from Aaron's \nhometown who also lost his life serving in Iraq. Aaron had told his \nmother that when he got home, they would volunteer together to help \nbuild a Habitat house. After his death, several of Aaron's friends \nworked with his mother Sara to help his dream become a reality. \nFittingly, they decided to name the building Hometown Hero House.\n  I had the privilege of meeting several of Aaron's family members and \nfriends at a service held in his honor. Each remembers the beaming, \nmegawatt smile that would always light up Aaron's face. And they will \nalways remember that Aaron died while serving our Nation.\n  ``Aaron believed in what he was doing, which made him my hero,'' his \nfather Steve said. ``Now he's everyone's hero.''\n  Mr. President, 21 years, 11 months, and 11 days was the short time \nthat Aaron lived on this Earth, but we are all better off because of \nthe time he did live. He was a young man who genuinely loved life and \nhad compassion for others. His dedication to his friends, family, \ncommunity, and country was unmatched. Aaron is a model of what we all \nhope our children will become.\n  My wife Fran and I continue to keep the family of Aaron Reed in our \nthoughts and prayers.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I say to my colleague, Senator DeWine, \nthose have been very moving tributes to fallen soldiers from his State \nof Ohio. He has set a good example for all of us on recognizing the \nservice and sacrifice of those from his home State. I find as I listen \nto those tributes that they are extremely well done. I thank the \nSenator for that.\n  I also wish to acknowledge that the Senator from Ohio will be leaving \nat the end of this term and that I have very much appreciated working \nwith him. He has been one of the very serious Members of this body, and \nwe are going to miss him. I wanted to say to him that I certainly \nappreciate his service in the Senate. He has always been a constructive \ncolleague, somebody who was working diligently to try to solve problems \nfacing the country. We very much appreciate his dedication to the \ncountry.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I thank my colleague and tell him that I \nhave enjoyed working with him very much. We have worked on things \ntogether. You can work across the aisle in this body and get things \ndone. I thank him for his very kind and generous words.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/11/15/senate-section/article/S10957-1", "month": "11", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10957-S10959]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      DISASTER RELIEF FOR FARMERS\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, as this interregnum continues, as we wait \nfor some kind of resolution--we were told an hour and a half ago that \nwould be forthcoming in 45 minutes--I wanted to read a letter I \nreceived from a young farm family that had been hit by one of the \ndisasters I had referenced earlier. This family is from Souris, ND. It \nwas a letter that was written to me last year about the extraordinary \nrains. This is what the father of the family wrote:\n\n       The rains began in earnest the last days of May 2005. Our \n     crops were in the ground so the majority of the input costs \n     for the crops\n\n[[Page S10958]]\n\n     were already realized. We received 25 inches in 33 days and \n     the attached pictures show the result. In our local town \n     residents were going up and down the streets in boats.\n       We did our very best to cope with expenses but with the \n     increased energy prices and the loss of crop income we and \n     all the other producers in our area lost the battle. Our farm \n     had financial reversals in the amount of $110,000. We carry \n     crop insurance but this program does not begin to cover our \n     risks.\n       In speaking with loan officers at 2 of our local banks I \n     was told that First National expects to restructure 60% of \n     their Ag. Loans and State Bank estimated 75%-80%. This is \n     serious business in agriculture.\n       We have felt the seriousness of the disasters in the South \n     from last year's hurricanes and we have urged our delegation \n     to support help for them. However our area was understandably \n     off everyone's radar screen yet we had the devastation here \n     as well.\n       Concerns abound as we look to the future. As I look out my \n     window to the west I see a field that we have seeded since my \n     grandfather homesteaded here in 1892. For the first time we \n     will not be able to seed it. It is 120 acres with about 60 \n     acres still under water from last summer. The Federal \n     Government has placed a heavy burden on us by declaring our \n     area as a Prairie Pot Hole Region. This means I cannot drain \n     this excess water into a nearby drainage system. I am stuck \n     with it. How do I begin to recover the financial losses \n     mentioned above when the Government Regulations limit those \n     opportunities? The water is to the top of the road on both \n     sides and now after being this way for close to a year the \n     road is saturated and just about ruined. I just spoke with a \n     township supervisor and they feel they will be closing the \n     road because of liability concerns.\n       We are asking that you come along side us and help us \n     through this impossible situation that has been presented to \n     us by a combination of nature and government regulations. \n     Please support the Disaster Relief Appropriation currently \n     working its way through Congress. If you do, you will \n     literally be the difference between many being able to \n     continue to produce food and fiber for this great nation and \n     not being able to continue this production.\n       Thank you so much for listening to part of our story.\n\n  This gentleman included pictures. I don't think these are pictures \nthat can be seen on camera, but I will hold them up and describe them. \nThese are six different pictures. In some of them, there is water from \nhorizon to horizon. Here we see a view that would go for miles and \nmiles. There is water everywhere. This is what happened last year over \nmuch of my State--as I indicated earlier, a million acres that could \nnot even be planted, another 600,000 acres where the crops were drowned \nout. Now this year, as I have said before, irony of ironies, the worst \ndrought since the 1930s. Land I have been on many times in my life \nsouth of my hometown is like a moonscape--nothing growing, just dirt; \nland that had been planted and nothing even emerged.\n  To understand what happened, this is the weather for the month of \nJuly in my State. Bismarck, ND, is the State capital. It started out \nwith a day at 90 degrees; the next day, 92. Then right after July 4 it \nwent over 90 degrees the next 2 days. Then it jumped up to 102, and \nthen it was 97. The next week, 96, and then it was 101, 105, 94, 101, \n105, 106. This is not heat index. These were the actual temperatures. \nThen we had kind of a cooling, and it got into the 80s. Then on the \n22nd it jumped back up to 96, 97, 96, 90s all these days, 99, 97, and \nthen the real corker, on the 30th of July, 112 degrees. That is really \nhot. I had friends who went out and drove south of my hometown that day \nwho told me it was so hot it took your breath away, 112 degrees. I am \nnot talking heat index or any of that; I am talking the actual \ntemperature.\n  The crops just burned up. During this period, there was no \nprecipitation--no precipitation, no precipitation, no precipitation \nthat whole week, no precipitation this entire week, no precipitation \nuntil the 19th. In fact, not a drop until the 19th of July, and then \nthere was 7/100th, then there was 32/100th, then no precipitation, none \nfor the next period going through the end of the month. So from the \n21st to the 31st, not another drop of precipitation. Meanwhile, 101, \n105, 106, 112 degrees. This is why the disaster is so serious, a \ncombination of virtually no precipitation--for this whole month, there \nwas 39/100th of an inch of precipitation--and day after day, 90 and 100 \ndegrees. The crops just burned up.\n  We can say: Tough luck, you are out of here, but that is not what we \nhave done in the past. In the past, going back to 1989, we had the \ndisaster assistance bill, $3.4 billion. In 1990, we had disaster \nassistance. Every year with the exception of 1991, right through 2005.\n  Disaster assistance in 2000 was $14.8 billion. The next year it was \n$11.3 billion. This disaster package is $4.5 billion for 2 years, so it \nis dramatically less. Obviously, that is a result of more widespread \ndisasters, perhaps, in those years, so the cost is less, but also this \nis a less generous disaster bill, as we have moved to reduce things, \ncut things from the $6.7 billion to $4.5 billion or just under $4.5 \nbillion.\n  I think most people would acknowledge I have not been somebody who \nhas ever sought to hold up the business of the Senate. I have been here \n20 years. That is not how I have conducted myself. But I am left with \nno alternative and no choice when a commitment was made to me \nyesterday, both publicly and privately, that we would go to the \nAgriculture appropriations bill today and that I would have a chance to \noffer the amendment. I have reviewed the Record. It is very clear, the \ncommitment that was made. As of this hour--we are approaching the 6 \no'clock hour--that commitment has not been kept.\n  I understand there are others who may have lodged objection to going \nto the bill. But there are ways to go to a bill. It happens every day \nhere. It happens every day that we go to a bill to which somebody has \nan objection. We have completely reserved the rights of our colleagues. \nThey can require a supermajority vote. They can raise a budget point of \norder. They can raise rule XVI. As I have indicated, it is clear to me \nrule XVI doesn't apply because we have written this in a way that it \ndoes not apply. They can insist on a vote. Fair enough. That is all I \nam asking for. I am asking for a vote. These people deserve that \nchance.\n  The fact is, literally thousands of farm families in my State are \nhanging in the balance. Right now, they are done with production for \nthe year. Many of these places didn't have any production. This time of \nyear, you go to your banker, and the bankers are saying to me that if \nthere is not disaster assistance, 5 to 10 percent of farm families in \nmy State are finished. What does that mean? We have 35,000 farm \nfamilies in North Dakota. Five percent, if my math is right, would be \n1,750. Ten percent would be 3,500 farm families who are out there right \nnow wondering: What is the Federal Government going to do? Are they \ngoing to do what they have always done every year for almost the last \n20 years and provide some kind of disaster assistance, or are they \ngoing to say: Tough, you are on your own, you are out of luck? I very \nmuch hope there will be a response and it will be a favorable response. \nThese are as good as any people I know anywhere, hard-working, decent, \nhonest, good people. They have been hit by the most extraordinary set \nof conditions. This drought has been rated the third worst drought in \nour Nation's entire history.\n  The flooding last year was unprecedented in my State. Outside of the \n1997 floods, which was a 500-year flood--the worst flood in 500 years--\nwe have not seen anything like it. I don't pretend to know what is \ngoing on with the weather out there, but something extraordinary is \nhappening--extreme weather and extreme weather conditions, unlike \nanything I have seen in my adult lifetime. The result is deep financial \ndamage to thousands and thousands of people.\n  Mr. President, I hope somewhere somebody is listening. I thank the \nChair and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, leadership indicates to me they wish to \nadjourn for the evening momentarily. I don't know if they have other \nmatters to wrap up. I am certainly not going to hold the body here. We \nwill come back tomorrow with the status quo being in place. That is my \nunderstanding of what the agreement would be. I understand they are \ngoing to try to work through the evening to resolve this matter so we \ncan go to the bill at some point, with some assurance.\n  I want to bring this to my colleagues' attention. I pointed out the \nhorrendous\n\n[[Page S10959]]\n\nweather in July in North Dakota. This is an article that appeared in \nthe Grand Forks Herald. It said this:\n\n       Fields of wheat, durum and barley in the Dakotas this dry \n     summer will never end up as pasta, bread or beer. What is \n     left of the stifled crops has been salvaged to feed livestock \n     struggling on pastures where hot winds blow clouds of dirt \n     from dried-out ponds.\n       Some ranchers have been forced to sell their entire herds, \n     and others are either moving their cattle to greener pastures \n     or buying more already-costly feed. Hundreds of acres of \n     grasslands have been blackened by fires sparked by lightning \n     or farm equipment.\n       ``These 100-degree days for weeks steady have been burning \n     everything up,'' said Walter Johnson, Steele's mayor. ``I'd \n     go for 2 feet of snow than this.''\n       Farm ponds and other small bodies of water have dried out \n     from the heat, leaving the residual alkali dust to be whipped \n     up by the wind. The blowing, dirt-and-salt mixture is a \n     phenomenon that hasn't been seen in south central North \n     Dakota since the Dust Bowl of the 1930s, Johnson said.\n       More than 60 percent of the United States now has \n     abnormally dry or drought conditions, stretching from Georgia \n     to Arizona and across the north through the Dakotas, \n     Minnesota, Montana and Wisconsin, said Mark Svoboda, a \n     climatologist for the National Drought Mitigation Center at \n     the University of Nebraska at Lincoln.\n       An area stretching from south central North Dakota to \n     central South Dakota is the most drought-stricken region in \n     the nation, Svoboda said.\n       ``It's the epicenter,'' he said. ``It's just like a \n     wasteland in north central South Dakota.''\n       Conditions aren't much better a little farther north. Paul \n     Smokov and his wife, Betty, raise several hundred cattle on \n     their 1,750-acre ranch north of Steele, a town of about 760 \n     people.\n       North Dakota's all-time high temperature was set here in \n     July 1936, at 121. Smokov, now 81, remembers that time and \n     believes conditions this summer probably are worse.\n       ``I could see this coming in May,'' Smokov said of the \n     parched pastures and wilted crops. ``That's the time the good \n     Lord gives us our general rains. But we never got them this \n     year.''\n       Brad Rippey, a federal Agriculture Department meteorologist \n     in Washington, said this year's drought is continuing one \n     that started in the late 1990s. ``The 1999 to 2006 drought \n     ranks only behind the 1930s and the 1950s. It's the third-\n     worst drought on record--period,'' Rippey said.\n       Svoboda was reluctant to say how bad the current drought \n     might eventually be.\n       ``We'll have to wait to see how it plays out--but it's \n     definitely bad,'' he said. ``And the drought seems to not be \n     going anywhere soon.''\n       Herman Schumacher, who owns Herreid Livestock Auction in \n     north central South Dakota, said his company is handling more \n     sales than ever because of the drought.\n       In May, June and July last year, his company sold 3,800 \n     cattle. During the same months this year, more than 27,000 \n     cattle have been sold, he said.\n       ``I've been in the barn here for 25 years and I can't even \n     compare this year to any other year,'' Schumacher said.\n       He said about 50 ranchers have run cows through his auction \n     this year.\n       ``Some of them just trimmed off their herds, but about a \n     third of them were complete dispersions--they'll never be \n     back,'' he said.\n       ``This county is looking rough--these 100-degree days are \n     just killing us,'' said Gwen Payne, a North Dakota State \n     University extension agent in Kidder County, where Steele is \n     located.\n       The Agriculture Department says North Dakota last year led \n     the nation in production of 15 different commodity classes, \n     including spring wheat, durum wheat, barley, oats, canola, \n     pinto beans, dry edible peas, lentils, flaxseed, sunflower \n     and honey.\n       North Dakota State University professor and researcher \n     Larry Leistritz said it's too early to tell what effect this \n     year's drought will have on commodity prices. Flour prices \n     already have gone up and may rise more because of the effect \n     of drought on wheat.\n       ``There will be somewhat higher grain prices, no doubt \n     about it,'' Leistritz said. ``With livestock, the short-term \n     effect may mean depressed meat prices, with a larger number \n     of animals being sent to slaughter. But in the longer run it \n     may prolong the period of relatively high meat prices.''\n       Eventually, more than farmers could suffer.\n       ``Agriculture is not only the biggest industry in the \n     state, it's just about the only industry,'' Leistritz said. \n     ``Communities live or die with the fortunes of agriculture.''\n\n  Mr. President, this is an article that was repeated in newspaper \nafter newspaper across my State. This is a disaster that is virtually \nunprecedented. South Dakota is even worse. That is why we simply have \nto achieve a result. I again ask my colleagues, please, just give us a \nvote. These people deserve at least that.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I have just been told now by leadership \nstaff they are going to do everything they can to try to get this \nAgriculture appropriations bill up tomorrow and that I would have an \nopportunity to offer an amendment and get a vote. I have been assured \nthey are going to bend their best efforts to accomplish that tomorrow. \nI appreciate that effort. I hope it occurs. Of course, that was \nsupposed to happen today.\n  I am also informed they want to adjourn the body for the day, and I \ncertainly will not stand in the way of adjourning. There are many here \nwho have families they wish to go home to, and I certainly don't want \nto stand in the way of that, especially with these assurances that now, \nonce again, have been given to me that they will bend their best \nefforts to try to get to the Agriculture appropriations bill tomorrow \nand give me an opportunity for a vote.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/11/15/senate-section/article/S10959-1", "month": "11", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10959-S10960]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       BUDGET SCOREKEEPING REPORT\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I hereby submit to the Senate the budget \nscorekeeping report prepared by the Congressional Budget Office under \nSection 308(b) and in aid of Section 311 of the Congressional Budget \nAct of 1974, as amended. This report meets the requirements for Senate \nscorekeeping of section 5 of S. Con. Res. 32, the first concurrent \nresolution on the budget for 1986.\n  This report shows the effects of congressional action on the 2006 \nbudget through September 30, 2006. The estimates of budget authority, \noutlays, and revenues are consistent with the technical and economic \nassumptions of the 2006 concurrent resolution on the budget, H. Con. \nRes. 95. Pursuant to section 402 of that resolution, provisions \ndesignated as emergency requirements are exempt from enforcement of the \nbudget resolution. As a result, the attached report excludes these \namounts.\n  The estimates show that current level spending is under the budget \nresolution by $11.869 billion in budget authority and by $4.030 billion \nin outlays in 2006. Current level for revenues is $6.590 billion above \nthe budget resolution in 2006.\n  Since my last report dated September 5, 2006, Congress has cleared \nand the President has signed the Department of Defense Appropriations \nAct, 2007, P.L. 109-289. In addition to providing regular defense \nappropriations for 2007, this act appropriated $200 million for \nfirefighting activities in fiscal year 2006. Those appropriations were \ndesignated as emergency requirements in 2006 and did not affect the \ncurrent level totals.\n  This is my final report for 2006.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n                                                U.S. Congress,\n\n                                      Congressional Budget Office,\n                                  Washington, DC, October 5, 2006.\n     Hon.

This report is submitted under \n     section 308(b) and in aid of section 311 of the Congressional \n     Budget Act, as amended.\n       The estimates of budget authority, outlays, and revenues \n     are consistent with the technical and .economic assumptions \n     for fiscal year 2006 that underlie H. Con. Res. 95, the \n     Concurrent Resolution on the Budget for Fiscal Year 2006. \n     Pursuant to section 402 of that resolution, provisions \n     designated as emergency requirements are exempt from \n     enforcement of the budget resolution. As a\n\n[[Page S10960]]\n\n     result, the enclosed current level report excludes these \n     amounts (see footnote 2 on Table 2).\n       Since my last letter dated September 5, 2006, the Congress \n     has cleared and the President has signed the Department of \n     Defense Appropriations Act, 2007 (Public Law 109-289).

Mr. President, I rise today to pay special tribute to the \nGeneral Federation of Women's Clubs and their recent work to fight \ndomestic violence. The organization is a gem among our midst. Founded \nin April 1890, it is one of the world's oldest and largest women's \nvolunteer organizations. More than 150,000 women members in 5,000 local \nand 20 international clubs volunteer over 13 million hours and \ncontribute approximately $35 million through more than 160,000 club \nprojects. I can't underestimate how powerful and influential this corps \nof volunteers is to the health of our Nation.\n  I am particularly proud that this year the international president, \nJacqueline Pierce, has adopted ``Domestic Violence Awareness and \nPrevention'' as her President's Special Project for 2006-2008. Nannette \nWhite, a member from Louisiana, serves as the national chairperson of \nthe President's Special Project, and with the support of a national \ncommittee of women, promotes participation in this project. All across \nthe Nation, local women's clubs are adopting battered women's shelters \nand donating needed goods such as food, linens, health care items, and \nmore. In Nevada, members sponsored a public service campaign on radio \nstations to promote important messages about violence prevention. In \nMississippi, members distributed 2,000 fliers with information on the \nNational Domestic Violence Hotline and helped raise funds for the \nMississippi State Coalition Against Domestic Violence. This is just a \nsmall sampling of the good works being done.\n\n[[Page S10961]]\n\n  As part of this special project, the General Federation of Women's \nClubs forged a historic collaboration with the Family Violence \nPrevention Fund, the National Domestic Violence Hotline, the National \nNetwork to End Domestic Violence and domestic violence organizations in \ncommunities throughout the United States. Innovative partnerships \nbetween the public and private sector, new relationships between \norganizations--these are the pathways to solutions to our Nation's most \npressing problems.\n  I have spent almost 34 years of my life in Congress and witnessed the \ntransformative impact of powerful Federal legislation. For instance, \nthe Violence Against Women Act improved Federal and State criminal laws \nand enacted programs that encourage prosecution of abusers, create \nbattered women's shelters and sponsor educational campaigns. Over the \npast decade, the act's programs have distributed over $4 billion to \nStates, local governments, and nonprofit organizations. Yet despite \nthis extraordinary success, I am convinced that Federal Government \naction alone cannot end domestic violence. We desperately need the \nindividual attention and dedication of volunteers. Change happens one \nwoman at a time and one volunteer at a time. The volunteer work done by \nclub members fills an invaluable role. As my mother would say, these \nare the people who do God's work.\n  I commend Madam President Pierce for her leadership and commitment to \nairing our Nation's ``dirty little secret,'' domestic violence. She has \nbrought a whole new legion of women warriors to help battered women and \ntheir children. On behalf of the entire Senate, I thank them for their \ntireless volunteerism to end domestic violence and giving women what \nthey haven't had before--hope.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/11/15/senate-section/article/S10961-1", "month": "11", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10961-S10962]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            HOLD EXPLANATION\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I have placed a hold on the nomination of \nRoger A. Martella, Jr., to be general counsel of the U.S. Environmental \nProtection Agency. Consistent with my policy of publicly announcing \nwhenever I place a hold on a nomination, I want to notify my colleagues \nof my objection to allowing Mr. Martella's nomination to be considered \nunder a unanimous consent agreement and to take a few minutes to \nexplain to my colleagues why I am doing so.\n  After many years of delay, the EPA has finally proposed regulations \nunder the Clean Air Act to protect Americans from toxic air pollutants \nfrom cars and trucks and other mobile sources. But instead of proposing \na rule that would protect all Americans from these toxic emissions, \nEPA's proposal would essentially turn the Pacific Northwest into an \nenvironmental sacrifice zone.\n  EPA's analysis shows that the biggest risk from these pollutants \ncomes from benzene which is naturally found in petroleum products and \nends up in the gas tanks of our cars and in the gas cans in our \ngarages. Some of the highest levels of benzene in gasoline are found in \nthe Northwest. In fact, our region of the country has the highest \naverage levels of benzene in gasoline in the United States, more than \nthree times higher than gasoline here on the east coast.\n  Benzene is a known carcinogen. Exposure to benzene has been shown to \ncause leukemia and poses other health risks, such as genetic changes. \nAlthough the EPA has never set a health standard for benzene in the \nenvironment, the Department of Environmental Quality for the State of \nOregon has, and we have levels of benzene in Downtown Portland that are \n20 times higher than the State's standard. The majority of this benzene \ncomes from gasoline. So it should be good news that EPA is finally \nacting to regulate the amount of benzene in gasoline.\n  Unfortunately, EPA has proposed a regulatory scheme that will simply \nnot ensure that these levels are reduced as much as they need to be, \nand let me explain why.\n  First, EPA rejected the idea that there should be a maximum level of \nbenzene in gasoline. The current Federal requirements for reformulated \ngasoline contain a maximum threshold for benzene. The State of \nCalifornia's fuel standards include a provision limiting the percentage \nof benzene in gasoline sold in California. Canada has a benzene limit. \nKorea has a benzene limit. Japan has a benzene limit. The European \nUnion has a benzene limit. And according to a recent article in the \nindustry trade press, Vietnam is going to establish a benzene limit. \nBut not EPA.\n  Instead, what EPA has proposed is the establishment of a national \naverage for benzene in gasoline. Every refinery or gasoline importer is \ntheoretically supposed to sell gasoline that meets this average \nstandard, but there is no maximum level and EPA has coupled this \nrequirement to a credit-trading system. Under EPA's scheme, refineries \nthat make gasoline below the standard will get credits that they can \ngive away, trade, or sell to refineries which make gasoline above the \nstandard. Many refineries that make gasoline with high benzene levels \nwould never have to meet the EPA standard. And again, because under the \nEPA proposal there would be no maximum level of benzene in gasoline, \nmany refineries are expected to make little, if any, reduction in the \namount of benzene in their gasoline and rely instead on credits to meet \nthe standard. According to EPA, five refineries producing gasoline over \nthe EPA standard would take no action whatsoever to reduce their \nbenzene levels.\n  The reason this is all so important is that Americans don't get their \ngasoline from a gasoline terminal filled with ``average'' gasoline. \nThey get their gas from regional refineries and distributors. In \nOregon, we get almost all of our gasoline from refineries on Puget \nSound in the State of Washington--refineries which, for the most part, \nproduce gasoline with high benzene levels. Even if everything worked as \nEPA intended, benzene levels in gasoline in the Northwest would be 40 \npercent above the national standard. However, the plain fact is that \nthere is no assurance that gasoline in our region will be cleaner \nbecause EPA leaves the decision of whether the refineries in Puget \nSound reduce their benzene levels up to the companies that own those \nrefineries. If oil companies decide that it is in their economic \ninterest to simply buy their way to compliance by using credits instead \nof investing in equipment that will actually reduce the amount of \nbenzene in our gas, EPA says they can. The only thing that EPA will \ncare about is that those companies have begged, borrowed, or bought \nenough credits to meet the national average. And we will continue to \nhave the same high levels of benzene we have now. In fact, without any \nsort of overall cap on the amount of benzene that can be in gasoline, \nbenzene levels in our gasoline in the Northwest could even go up.\n  I have focused my remarks on the impact that this proposal has on the \nNorthwest, but it is not just a problem for the Northwest. Other parts \nof the country will also have gasoline with benzene levels over the \nnational standard, and without any maximum level of benzene no American \ncan be sure of how much benzene might be in their gasoline and in the \nair they breathe.\n  I also want to emphasize again that under the EPA approach, it will \nbe the oil companies that decide whether they reduce their benzene \nlevels at any given refinery, not EPA. If EPA's analysis is correct, a \nsingle major oil company, which EPA identifies only as ``Company No. \n2,'' would be responsible for producing more than a third of all of the \ngasoline exceeding the proposed national benzene standard. Rather than \nmake the investment in benzene control and removal technology, EPA, \nfrom the beginning, simply expects this company to use credits to meet \nthe standard for all of this high benzene gasoline. Who is Company No. \n2 and why is EPA proposing to give them this license to pollute?\n  This would all be bad enough if EPA hadn't actually thought about \nthese problems. They acknowledged in their rulemaking process that \nthere would be regional inequities. They examined alternatives for \nsetting maximum levels of benzene that should be in gasoline. In one \ncase, they looked at the additional cost to Americans of imposing an \naverage maximum level of benzene of 1.3 percent as part of the standard \nin order to address these problems. EPA's own analysis concluded that \nthis would cost consumers in my region of the country less than one-\nhalf of 1 cent a gallon and Americans, nationwide, an additional 5/\n1000ths of a cent per gallon\n\n[[Page S10962]]\n\nof gasoline. That is not five cents. That is .005 cents. The bottom \nline is that EPA is proposing to allow my constituents to breathe more \ntoxic emissions and face greater risk of cancer so that oil companies \ncan save a fraction of a cent per gallon of gas.\n  I am not going to sit back and let EPA just go ahead with this \nrulemaking without complaint. The Office of General Counsel is the \nchief legal advisor to EPA. Mr. Martella was the principal deputy \ngeneral counsel when this rule was proposed. He is now the acting \ngeneral counsel. I am placing a hold on his nomination to send as \nstrong a signal to EPA as I can at this time that they need to take \nanother look at their own figures. They need to take another look at \ntheir own regulatory analysis. The regional problems that they \nidentified would occur in setting up a national cap-and-trade program \nare real problems and must not be ignored. They need to come up with a \nreal solution. Until they do, I will object to any unanimous consent \nagreement to allow Mr. Martella's nomination to come to a vote in the \nSenate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/11/15/senate-section/article/S10962-1", "month": "11", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10962]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                  IN HONOR OF SHERIFF CHARLES PLUMMER\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I take this opportunity to \nrecognize Alameda County Sheriff Charles Plummer, who is retiring after \nmore than 54 years of dedicated service in law enforcement.\n  Sheriff Plummer began his career in law enforcement in 1952 with the \ncity of Berkeley Police Department. His dedication to the Berkeley \nPolice Department was evident over the 23 years he spent with that \nagency, where he ultimately rose to the rank of acting chief of police.\n  Following his service with the Berkeley Police Department, Sheriff \nPlummer was appointed chief of police for the city of Hayward in June \nof 1976. During his 10 years with the Hayward Police Department, \nSheriff Plummer employed many innovative and successful programs. In \n1979, Sheriff Plummer volunteered the Hayward Police Department to be \none of five trial sites to test the law enforcement service standards \nestablished by the Commission on Accreditation for Law Enforcement \nAgencies, CALEA, becoming the ninth law enforcement agency in the \nNation, and the first west of the Mississippi, to be accredited by \nCALEA. Sheriff Plummer was later elected to CALEA, served as its \npresident, and has since been a strong advocate for the accreditation \nof law enforcement agencies.\n  Most memorably, in his role as Hayward chief of police, Sheriff \nPlummer initiated what became known as ``The Cardinal Sins,'' a set of \nsimple, straightforward rules demanding honesty from all employees and \nprohibiting bigotry, the acceptance of bribes, and the use of \ncontrolled substances. Many officers felt that adherence to these rules \nhelped build a bond of trust between law enforcement and the \ncommunities they served. Today, ``The Cardinal Sins'' have become \nstandard in many law enforcement agencies throughout the Nation. Under \nhis leadership, the Hayward Police Department became one of the most \nhighly respected law enforcement agencies in the country.\n  In 1986, Sheriff Plummer was elected sheriff of Alameda County. In \nhis capacity as sheriff, he opened the new Santa Rita jail, the sixth \nlargest facility of its kind in the United States; he established a \nmarine patrol unit to protect the shoreline of Alameda County; he \nopened a state-of-the-art Office of Emergency Services Center; he has \nachieved CALEA accreditation for the sheriff's office; and has also \nreceived accreditation for many branches of the sheriff's office, \nincluding Prison Health Services, the County Crime Laboratory, and the \nExplosive Ordinance Unit. Under his leadership, the Alameda County \nSheriff's Office is the only agency in California to earn the National \nSheriff's Association prestigious ``Triple Crown Award.''\n  In addition to his regular duties as Alameda county sheriff, Sheriff \nPlummer has served as head of Region II in the California Law \nEnforcement Mutual Aid System, a statewide program under the Office of \nEmergency Services that restores order during emergencies, including \ncivil unrest, and provides assistance to local agencies during other \nunusual events. Throughout his career, Sheriff Plummer has also been \nactive in numerous professional organizations including the Peace \nOfficer's Research Association of California, the Peace Officer \nStandards and Training, the Police Executive Research Forum, and the \nInternational Association of Chiefs of Police.\n  In his spare time, Sheriff Plummer has been very involved in his \ncommunity, serving as past president and a member of the Hayward Rotary \nClub. He is a lifetime volunteer for the Boy Scouts of America, serving \non the executive council in San Francisco, and a lifetime member of the \nSouthern Alameda County Chapter of the NAACP. Sheriff Plummer has \ngenerously given his time to such organizations as the YMCA and the \nSalvation Army.\n  For over half a century, Sheriff Plummer has dedicated his life to \npromoting excellence in law enforcement and the communities he has \nserved. He has served with honesty, integrity, and a commitment to \nexcellence. I am confident that, even in retirement, Sheriff Plummer \nwill continue to touch lives with his good will and compassion. I wish \nhim the very best and hope he enjoys his much deserved \nretirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/11/15/senate-section/article/S10962-2", "month": "11", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10962]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              DELANO ELEMENTARY SCHOOL, DELANO, MINNESOTA\n\n Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, today I honor Delano Elementary \nSchool, in Delano, MN, which recently earned an Award for Excellence in \nEducation for its exceptional and innovative achievements in educating \nchildren.\n  Delano Elementary School is truly a model of educational success. The \nschool takes great pride in involving parents in their children's \nschool experiences. Last spring, the rate of parents' participation at \nparent-teacher conferences was an impressive 99 percent. Parents \ncontributed over 6,000 hours of volunteer services during the 2005-2006 \nschool year.\n  The Partners in Education organization at Delano Elementary raises \nover $30,000 per year for student activities and supplies for teachers \nand classrooms. Recently, the organization contributed $8,000 toward \nthe purchase of SMARTBOARD technology, an interactive, electronic \nblackboard system. The money was also used to install sound-field \nsystems in a number of the primary grade classrooms.\n  Delano Elementary also offers several programs to challenge children \nof high potential. The school's Tiger's Tale publishing center allows \nchildren to turn their own creative stories into books that have a \nprofessionally published look. The math lab extends and enriches skills \ntaught through classroom instruction.\n  An organized gifted and talented program, with a teacher of gifted \nand talented children, offers several opportunities for pupils beyond \ntheir classrooms, including Destination Imagination, Continental Math \nLeague, and other unique units of instruction, designed specifically \nfor high-potential pupils.\n  Delano Elementary consistently receives five-star ratings from the \nDepartment of Education in both reading and math. Last year, 87 percent \nof Delano third-graders scored in the top three levels on the Minnesota \nComprehensive Assessment Reading Test, and 93 percent of the third-\ngraders scored in the top three levels in math.\n  Much of the credit for Delano Elementary School's success belongs to \nits principal, Darren Schuler, and the dedicated teachers. The pupils \nand staff at Delano Elementary School understand that, in order to be \nsuccessful, a school must go beyond achieving academic success; it must \nalso provide a nurturing environment where children can develop the \nknowledge, skills, and attitudes for success throughout life. All of \nthe faculty, staff, and pupils at Delano Elementary School should be \nvery proud of their accomplishments.\n  I congratulate Delano Elementary School in Delano for winning the \nAward for Excellence in Education and for its exceptional contributions \nto education in Minnesota.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/11/15/senate-section/article/S10962-3", "month": "11", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10962-S10963]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              ORONO INTERMEDIATE SCHOOL, ORONO, MINNESOTA\n\n Mr. DAYTON.

Mr. President, today I speak in memory of \nSigmund Strochiltz, a truly remarkable man from New London, Connecticut \nwho passed away on Monday October 16, at the age of 89. I was saddened \nto hear about Mr. Strochiltz's death, and I will keep his friends and \nfamily in my thoughts and prayers.\n  Mr. Strochlitz was best known as the owner of Whaling City Ford, a \nsuccessful car dealership that became a local institution in New \nLondon. Almost anyone who has lived in southeastern Connecticut can \nrecall the television commercials for his dealership, in which Mr. \nStrochiltz would pleasantly invite the viewer to ``Come in. I would \nlike to meet you,'' a simple slogan that reflected his pleasant \ndemeanor and truly optimistic outlook on life. Those who knew him best \nsay that he had a deep appreciation for the simple joys in life, like \ndining with friends or spending time with his grandchildren.\n  Mr. Strochiltz's optimism is incredible considering the horrors he \nhad to endure early in life. Mr. Strochiltz grew up in Poland, where he \nlived through both world wars. During the Second World War, he was held \nin a concentration camp in Auschwitz, Poland, for over 15 months. \nDuring this truly horrible experience, Mr. Strochiltz was forced to \nwatch as his parents, two sisters, his first wife, and countless others \nmarched off to their deaths.\n  Yet Mr. Strochiltz's spirit could not be broken, and he refused to \ngive up hope that the people of all nations could live together in \npeace. After being released, he was determined to ensure that no one \nelse ever had to suffer as he had.\n  Mr. Strochiltz believed that if mankind was never allowed to forget \nthe atrocities committed by the Nazi regime, such atrocities might \nnever be repeated. He worked tirelessly toward this end. He served on \nthe U.S. Memorial Holocaust Council, which worked to establish the \nNational Holocaust Memorial and Museum. He served as chairman of the \ncouncil's remembrance committee, where he lobbied the governments of \nevery State and the District of Columbia to hold annual ceremonies to \nremember victims and survivors of the Holocaust.\n  In addition to his great work with the council, Mr. Strochiltz helped \nelevate the writer Elie Wiesel, a close friend of his, to international \nfame. The two were partners in their mission to make sure the world \nnever forgot the evils of the Holocaust. Together they traveled the \nglobe, meeting with world leaders, such as German Chancellor Helmut \nSchmitt and Pope John Paul II. Mr. Strochiltz also lobbied Capitol Hill \nto have Mr. Wiesel nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize; he was \nsuccessful, and Mr. Wiesel was deservedly awarded the prize.\n  The passing of Sigmund Strochiltz is truly a loss for the people of \nConnecticut and throughout the world. May his kind nature and devotion \nto promoting peace and tolerance in the world live on in all those he \nhas touched.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/11/15/senate-section/article/S10963-2", "month": "11", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10963-S10964]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RECOGNIZING EARL MCVICKER\n\n Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, today I congratulate a Kansan, and \na friend, Earl McVicker, whose hard work, perseverance, and dedication \nhas earned him recognition by those in his profession. Last month, \nEarl, who started his banking career at a bank in a town of 400, was \nelected chairman of the American Bankers Association. I join his \nfriends, family, and colleagues in extending my congratulations and \nbest wishes to him during the upcoming year.\n  Earl's career in the banking industry began shortly after his \ngraduation from Kansas State University, home of the always optimistic \nand fighting Wildcats. Although Earl earned an engineering degree from \nK-State, he had taken a few business classes and a course on rural \nbanking, which captured his interest. His first job was at the Bazine \nState Bank. Earl worked hard, learning the banking business from the \nground up. His strong work ethic paid off, and he rose steadily in the \nbanking industry, moving on to banks in Colorado and Kansas before \nbecoming CEO of Central Bank and Trust, in Hutchinson, KS. By this \ntime, Earl was looking for more than just another job at another bank. \nHe was looking for the opportunity to make policy decisions, and he \nknew the only way to achieve that was to buy a bank.\n  Well, Earl succeeded in this goal, in part, by doing something we \nshould all take a lesson from. When he became CEO at CB, he made the \ndecision that he would continue to live off the amount of his previous \nsalary and save and invest the difference in order to buy CB stock. \nThis self-discipline, along with some help from his parents and a loan \nfrom another bank, allowed Earl to continue buying stock in CB, \neventually gaining majority ownership. Further, the loan that he took \nout, that he hoped to pay off in 10 years? He paid it off in 5. Earl \nacknowledges that he risked everything on this one venture, but it is \ncertainly a risk that has paid off.\n  Perhaps the quote that Earl has framed and hanging in his office best \nsums up what guides him. The quote, by President Calvin Coolidge, \nreads: ``Nothing in this world can take the place of persistence. \nTalent will not; nothing is more common than unsuccessful men with \ntalent. Genius will not; unrewarded genius is almost a proverb. \nEducation will not; the world is full of educated derelicts. \nPersistence and determination alone are omnipotent. The slogan `press \non' has solved and always will solve the problems of the human race.''\n  Earl's own hard work, persistence, and willingness to take risks \ngives him an understanding and an empathy for people who are looking to \nstart and own their own business. His commitment to promoting \nentrepreneurship, his willingness to help individuals start a business, \nand his ability to recognize the potential of these individuals, even \nthose who may not have business experience, makes him unique and \nreminds us all of the important role hometown\n\n[[Page S10964]]\n\nbanks play in a community. They understand the needs of the customers, \ntheir community, and know that their role in helping individuals and \nbusinesses succeed is vital to economic health.\n  Now, I don't want to leave you with the impression that Earl is just \nanother skilled businessman, although over the past 14 years, his \nprivate investment company, Central Financial Corp., has grown to \ninclude banks in a dozen States and has outperformed Warren Buffet's \nBerkshire Hathaway, as well as the Dow and the S 500. In fact, Earl \nwears several hats, including a Stetson when he is out horseback riding \nwith his wife Molly or helping out on his parent's farm near Ness City. \nAnd he's particularly fond of the motorcycle helmet that he wears when \nhe takes his Harley for a ride up to Sturgis, SD. Maybe not what you \nexpected from the incoming ABA chairman.\n  Earl has reached a milestone in his career, but in this success, he \nhas also helped others succeed in starting and growing their businesses \nand has taken an active role in helping communities like Hutchinson \nthrive. I am proud to call Earl a friend. I know he will approach his \nyear as chairman of the ABA by expanding his ``commitment to \ncommunity'' philosophy throughout the country. It is this commitment, \nworking as a partner with his community, that has made him a leader in \nthe banking profession.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/11/15/senate-section/article/S10964-1", "month": "11", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10964]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/11/15/senate-section/article/S10964-2", "month": "11", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10964]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/11/15/senate-section/article/S10964-3", "month": "11", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10964]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 2:22 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Hays, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills and joint resolutions, in which it requests \nthe concurrence of the Senate:\n\n       H.R. 864.

SENSE OF CONGRESS ON INTERNATIONAL EFFORTS.\n\n       It is the sense of Congress that the Governments of South \n     Korea, Japan, China, and Russia and other concerned \n     governments should make commitments commensurate to those \n     that the United States is offering under this Act--\n       (1) to assist refugees fleeing political oppression in \n     North Korea; and\n       (2) to meet humanitarian and reconstruction needs arising \n     in connection with--\n       (A) the reunification of North Korea with South Korea; or\n       (B) the emergence in North Korea of a new national \n     government committed to respect for human rights, \n     nonproliferation, and peaceful relations with the United \n     States and the other countries in the region.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DODD (for himself, Mr. Cochran, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Baucus, \n        Mr. Salazar, Mr. Rockefeller, Mrs. Boxer, and Mr. Kerry):\n  S. 4053. A bill to amend the National and Community Service Act of \n1990 to establish a Summer of Service State grant program, a Summer of \nService national direct grant program, and related national activities, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, \nand Pensions.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise to introduce, along with Senators \nCochran, Kennedy, Baucus, Rockefeller, Salazar, Boxer and Kerry, the \nSummer of Service Act of 2006. This bill offers middle school students \nthe chance to spend a summer in service to their communities as they \ntransition into high school.\n  Summer of Service creates a competitive grant program that enables \nStates and localities to offer middle school students an opportunity to \nparticipate in a structured community service program over the summer \nmonths. It employs service-learning to teach civic participation \nskills, help young people see themselves as resources to their \ncommunities, expand educational opportunities and discourage ``summer \nacademic slide.'' Providing tangible benefits to their communities, \nSummer of Service projects direct grantees to work on unmet human, \neducational, environmental and public safety needs and encourage all \nyouth, regardless of age, income, or disability, to engage in community \nservice. The program also grants participants with an educational award \nof up to $500 which can later be used to pay for college.\n  Volunteerism not only brings support and services to communities in \nneed, it also provides significant benefits to the students who \nparticipate. When young people participate in service activities they \nfeel better able to control their lives in a positive way, avoiding \nrisk behaviors, strengthening their community connections and become \nmore engaged in their studies. When service is tied to what students \nare learning in school, they make gains on achievement tests, complete \ntheir homework more often, and increase their grade point average. \nStudents who engage in service learning also improve their \ncommunication skills, gain increased awareness of career possibilities, \nand develop more positive workplace attitudes, setting the foundation \nfor their place as America's future leaders. Studies also show that \nstudents who participate in community service are more likely to \ngraduate high school and demonstrate interest in going to college.\n  We often hear today of the tremendous pressures our young people face \nat home, in school and in the afterschool hours. Summer of Service \nprovides young people with the chance to be a positive change in their \ncommunities. For this reason, I urge my colleagues to join me in \nsupporting the Summer of Service Act of 2006. I ask unanimous consent \nthat the text of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 4053\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Summer of Service Act of \n     2006''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Throughout the United States, there are pressing unmet \n     human, educational, environmental and public safety needs.\n       (2) Americans desire to affirm common responsibilities and \n     shared values, and join together in positive experiences, \n     that transcend race, religion, gender, age, disability, \n     region, income, and education.\n       (3) Americans of all ages can improve their communities and \n     become better citizens through service to their communities.\n       (4) When youth participate in service activities and see \n     that they are able to improve the lives of others, the youth \n     feel better able to control their own lives in a positive \n     way, avoiding risky behaviors, strengthening their community \n     connections, and becoming more engaged in their own \n     education.\n       (5) When youth service is tied to learning objectives, that \n     service is shown to decrease alienation and behavior \n     problems, and increase knowledge of community needs, \n     commitment to an ethic of service, and understanding of \n     politics and morality.\n       (6) When service is tied to what students are learning in \n     school, the students make gains on achievement tests, \n     complete their homework more often, and increase their grade \n     point averages.\n       (7) Students who engage in service-learning improve their \n     communication skills, increase their awareness of career \n     possibilities, have a deeper understanding of social and \n     economic issues that face the United States, and develop more \n     positive workplace attitudes, preparing them to take their \n     places as future leaders of the United States.\n       (8) In a national poll, more than 80 percent of parents \n     said that their child would benefit from an after school \n     program that offered community service and 95 percent of \n     teens agreed that is important to volunteer time to community \n     efforts.\n       (b) Purpose.--The purposes of this Act are to--\n       (1) offer youth the chance to spend a summer in service to \n     their communities as a rite of passage before high school;\n\n[[Page S10967]]\n\n       (2) teach civic participation skills to youth and help \n     youth see themselves as resources and leaders for their \n     communities;\n       (3) expand educational opportunities and discourage \n     ``summer slide'' by engaging youth in summer service-learning \n     opportunities;\n       (4) encourage youth, regardless of age, income, or \n     disability, to engage in community service;\n       (5) provide tangible benefits to the communities in which \n     Summer of Service programs are performed; and\n       (6) enhance the social-emotional development of youth of \n     all backgrounds.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to amend title 38, United States Code, to expand the \nnumber of individuals qualifying for retroactive benefits from \ntraumatic injury protection coverage under Servicemembers' Group Life \nInsurance; to the Committee on Veterans' Affairs.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to comment on \nlegislation that the distinguished Senator from Hawaii, Senator Akaka, \nand I are introducing today. This bill would expand the number of \neligible recipients of retroactive payments under the Traumatic Injury \nProtection under Servicemembers' Group Life Insurance, or ``TSGLI'', \nbenefit. Most of my colleagues have perhaps heard the story of how this \nimportant benefit became law and what its intended purpose is, but I \nbelieve it is worth repeating.\n  In April of 2005 I was visited by three servicemembers who were \nseriously injured during Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF). They were \nmembers of an organization called the Wounded Warrior Project, and they \ntold me of their lengthy recovery times at Walter Reed Army Medical \nCenter and the financial toll that that period of convalescence had on \nthem and their families. They talked about wives, parents, and other \nrelatives who had taken long absences from work, and some who had even \nquit their work, in order to spend time with those recovering at Walter \nReed. And they told me that the Department of Veterans Affairs \ncompensation system was no help because, by law, those benefits do not \nkick in until after separation from service.\n  Based on their experiences, these wounded warriors recommended that I \npursue legislation to create a new insurance benefit for those with \ntraumatic injuries such as theirs. The insurance would pay between \n$25,000 and $100,000 as soon as possible after an injury occurred, \nthereby bridging the gap in assistance needed during the time of a \nwounded servicemember's recovery and the time of his or her separation \nfrom service. They asked that I make the legislation prospective only, \nmeaning that they, and hundreds of others, would go without any TSGLI \npayment. I honored that request and, together with Senator Akaka and \nother Members of the Committee on Veterans' Affairs, introduced an \namendment to the 2005 Emergency Supplemental Appropriations bill then \npending before the Senate.\n  A second degree amendment was later unanimously agreed to which \nauthorized retroactive benefit payments to all of those injured in the \nOperation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF) theaters \nof operation--providing for TSGLI payments to hundreds of \nservicemembers who had been seriously injured since the start of the \nwars in Afghanistan and Iraq. At the time, the retroactive TSGLI \nprovision was consistent with other retroactive benefits approved \nwithin the Emergency Supplemental bill, such as $238,000 in combined \nServicemembers' Group Life Insurance (SGLI) and death gratuity benefits \nthat were provided retroactively to survivors of those killed in combat \noperations since the start of the War on Terror. Needless to say, the \nTSGLI amendments were approved by the Congress and enacted into law.\n  Fast forward to the present. TSGLI has been up and running since \nDecember 1, 2005, and provides financial assistance of $25,000 to \n$100,000 to traumatically injured servicemembers within, on average, 60 \ndays of the date of the injury causing event. As of September 2006, \nalmost 2,300 wounded OIF/OEF servicemembers have benefited under the \nretroactive portion of the program. For those with injuries post \nDecember 1, 2005, it does not matter if an injury occurs as a result of \ncombat operations or training exercises--payment under TSGLI is \navailable in either situation.\n  The Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs held a hearing on the TSGLI \nbenefit this past September. The Committee received testimony from the \nWounded Warrior Project, the organization largely responsible for \nTSGLI's conception. While very pleased with the program overall, a \nserious concern was raised regarding the equity of only extending \nretroactive TSGLI payments to those injured during Operations Iraqi and \nEnduring Freedom. Mr. Jeremy Chwat, testifying for the Wounded Warrior \nProject that day, used the example of one servicemember as \nrepresentative of others who are not now eligible for benefits:\n\n       Brave men and women like Seaman Robert Roeder who was \n     injured on January 29, 2005 when an arresting wire on the \n     aircraft carrier, the USS Kitty Hawk, severed his left leg \n     below the knee. . . . Although the ship was on its way to the \n     Gulf and the training exercises being conducted were in \n     preparation for action in either Operation Enduring or Iraqi \n     Freedom, Robert's injury does not qualify for payment.\n\n  Furthermore, since enactment of the 2005 Emergency Supplemental, \nretroactive SGLI and death gratuity benefits combining $238,000 have \nbeen expanded to provide payments to survivors of all servicemembers \nwho died on active duty, whether in combat or not. The reason behind \nthe expansion of retroactive benefits was a recognition that military \nservice is universal in character; that each military man or woman, no \nmatter where they are serving, contributes in a unique way to make the \nUnited States Armed Forces second to none.\n  The legislation I am introducing today, along with Senate Akaka, will \nmake the TSGLI retroactive payment eligibility criteria consistent with \nthe other benefit program retroactive payment criteria I just \nmentioned. Thus, if this legislation is enacted, all traumatically \ninjured servicemembers who served between October 7, 2001, and December \n1, 2005, will be eligible for TSGLI payments, irrespective of where \ntheir injuries occurred. Unofficial estimates from the Department of \nVeterans Affairs suggest that approximately 700 individuals would be \ncovered under this bill.\n  Both the Wounded Warrior Project and the National Military Families \nAssociation have expressed their support for this bill.

A bill to address the effect of the death of a defendant in \nFederal criminal proceedings; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, today I am pleased to introduce the \n``Preserving Crime Victims' Restitution Act of 2006.'' The Act would \nclarify the rule of law and procedures that should be applied when a \ncriminal defendant, such as former Enron CEO Kenneth Lay, dies after he \nhas been\n\n[[Page S10972]]\n\nduly convicted, but before his appeals are final.\n  I am pleased that Senator Sessions is joining me as a cosponsor in \nintroducing this bill. We have worked closely with the Department of \nJustice in crafting this legislation, and have used much of DOJ's \ntransmitted language. DOJ fully supports the principles contained in \nthis bill, and has indicated its support for this bill's efforts to fix \nthis problem now to ensure that, despite a defendant's death, hard-won \nconvictions are preserved and restitution remains available for the \nvictims of crime.\n  This bill that I introduce today would do the following: Establish \nthat, if a defendant dies after being convicted of a Federal offense, \nhis conviction will not be vacated. Instead, the court will be directed \nto issue a statement stating that the defendant was convicted (either \nby a guilty plea or a verdict finding him guilty) but then died before \nhis case or appeal was final.\n  It would codify the current rule that no further punishments can be \nimposed on a person who is convicted if they die before a sentence is \nimposed or they have an opportunity to appeal their conviction.\n  It would clarify that, unlike punishment, all other relief, such as \nrestitution to the victims, that could have been sought against a \nconvicted defendant can continue to be pursued and collected after the \ndefendant's death.\n  It would establish a process to ensure that after a person dies, a \nrepresentative of his estate can stand in the shoes of the defendant \nand challenge or appeal his conviction if they want, and can also \nsecure a lawyer--either on their own or by having one appointed, and\n  If the Government had filed a criminal forfeiture action--in which it \nhad sought to reach the defendant's assets that were linked to his \ncrimes--the Government would get an extra 2 years after the defendant's \ndeath to file a parallel civil forfeiture lawsuit so that it could try \nto recover those same assets in a different, and traditionally-accepted \nmanner.\n  The need for this legislation was vividly demonstrated last month. On \nOctober 17, 2006, U.S. District Judge Sim Lake, of the Southern \nDistrict of Texas, wiped clean the criminal record of Enron founder \nKenneth Lay, even after a jury and judge had unanimously found him \nguilty of 10 criminal charges, including securities fraud, wire fraud \ninvolving false and misleading statements, bank fraud and conspiracy.\n  That decision was not based on an error in the trial or any \nsuggestion of unfairness in the proceedings. Instead, it was simply \nbased on the fact that Mr. Lay died before his conviction had been \naffirmed on appeal, under a common law rule known as ``abatement.''\n  In other words, this order essentially means that Mr. Lay is \n``convicted but not guilty''--``innocent by reason of his death.''\n  Judge Lake granted this dismissal even in the face of DOJ Enron Task \nForce filings, which noted how Mr. Lay's conviction ``provided the \nbasis for the likely disgorgement of fraud proceeds totaling tens of \nmillions of dollars.'' In other words, the dismissal means that \nmillions dollars, that the jury found were obtained by Mr. Lay \nillegally, will now remain untouched in the Lay estate. And everyone \nagrees that former Enron employees and shareholders will now find it \nmuch harder to lay claim to these ill-gotten gains held by Mr. Lay's \nestate, because they will be unable to point to his criminal conviction \nas proof of his wrongdoing.\n  I do not fault Judge Lake for issuing this order. He made it clear \nthat he was simply following the binding precedent issued in 2004 by \nthe full U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit, in a case called \nUnited States v. Estate of Parsons.\n  But as I noted in a letter I wrote to Attorney General Gonzales on \nOctober 20, 2006, the Fifth Circuit's Parsons decision goes far beyond \nthe traditional rule of law in this area. While the common-law doctrine \nof abatement has historically wiped out ``punishments'' following a \ncriminal defendant's death, the Supreme Court has never held that it \nmust also wipe out a victim's right to other forms of relief such as \nrestitution, which simply compensate third parties who were injured by \ncriminal misconduct.\n  As the six dissenters in Parsons noted, the majority's `` `finality \nrationale' is a completely novel judicial creation which has not been \nembraced or even suggested by . . . other courts.'' The Third and \nFourth Circuits, for example, have expressly refused to take this \nposition, and upheld a restitution order after a criminal defendant's \ndeath.\n  The Parsons decision was remarkable in several other respects, \nincluding the fact that (as the dissenters noted), its new rule of law \nwas apparently inspired by a single law review article. That academic \npiece boldly claimed that a criminal defendant's right of appeal is \n``evolving into a constitutional right,'' and suggested that a \nconviction untested by appellate review is unreliable and illegitimate. \nThis notion runs contrary to the traditional rule applied in virtually \nevery other context--where a jury's findings are typically respected \nunder the law.\n  Of course a defendant is presumed innocent at the outset of his case. \nAfter a jury has deliberated and unanimously issued a formal finding of \nguilt, however, that presumption of innocence no longer stands.\n  The Parsons ``finality'' rationale raises the absurd possibility that \neven a defendant who fully admitted his wrongdoing and pleaded guilty, \nbut who then died while an appeal of his sentence was pending, could \nhave his entire criminal conviction erased. In fact, this has already \noccurred, in the 1994 case of United States v. Pogue, where the D.C. \nCircuit ordered the dismissal of a conviction of a defendant whose \nappeal was pending--even though the docketing statement had said that \nthe defendant intended to challenge only his sentence, and not his \nunderlying conviction.\n  I have urged the Attorney General to continue to fight for Enron \nvictims by appealing Judge Lake's dismissal to the Supreme Court. \nThere, he should ask for a resolution of this split in the law between \nthese Circuits, so that he can try to get the Parsons rule overturned. \nUnfortunately, the Justice Department has been noncommittal--it refuses \nto say if it will appeal the Ken Lay dismissal or not, even with the \nfiling deadline fast approaching.\n  In the meantime, rather than remaining silent on this issue, and \nhoping that the Attorney General will appeal the Lay case as he should, \nI believe the time has come for Congress to take action.\n  While I have no desire for our Government to punish a criminal \ndefendant who dies, the calculation should be different when we are \ndetermining how to make up for harm suffered by other individuals.\n  There is surely a legal and moral basis for not punishing the dead. \nBut there is also, more importantly, a legal and moral basis for \ndefending the living. The legislation that I introduce today codifies \nthat distinction.\n  This legislation offers a fair solution and orderly process in the \nevent that a criminal defendant dies prior to his final appeal.\n  Enron's collapse in 2001 wiped out thousands of jobs, more than $60 \nbillion in market value, and more than $2 billion in pension plans. \nWhen America's seventh largest company crumbled into bankruptcy after \nits accounting tricks could no longer hide its billions in debt, \ncountless former Enron employees and shareholders lost their entire \nlife savings after investing in Enron's 401(k) plan.\n  Many of these Enron victims have been following closely the years of \npreparation by the Enron Task Force, and the four-month jury trial and \nseparate one-week bench trial, hoping to finally recover some \nrestitution in this criminal case. And despite Mr. Lay's vigorous \nefforts to avoid being held accountable for his actions, a conviction \nwas finally secured.\n  Yet now these people have essentially been victimized again. They \nwill be forced to start all over in their efforts to get back some \nportion of the pension funds on which they expected to subsist, and the \nother hard-earned assets that will remain beyond their reach, despite \nthe unanimous, hard-fought verdicts finding Mr. Lay guilty of all ten \ncounts with which he had been charged.\n  The time has come for Congress to end this injustice--hopefully, by \nacting quickly enough to assist these Enron victims, but in any event \nin a way that\n\n[[Page S10973]]\n\nwill prevent this type of injustice from ever happening again in the \nfuture.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/11/15/senate-section/article/S10973-1", "month": "11", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10973]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n   SENATE RESOLUTION 614--HONORING THE FIREFIGHTERS AND OTHER PUBLIC \n SERVANTS WHO RESPONDED TO THE DEVASTATING ESPERANZA INCIDENT FIRE IN \n                  SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA IN OCTOBER 2006\n\n  Mrs. BOXER (for herself and Mrs. Feinstein) submitted the following \nresolution; which was referred to the Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                              S. Res. 614\n\n       Whereas, in late October 2006, the mountain communities \n     west of Palm Springs, California were struck by a vast \n     wildfire, which came to be known as the Esperanza Incident \n     and which authorities believe was started by an arsonist;\n       Whereas the Esperanza Incident fire tragically claimed \n     lives, homes and other buildings, and more than 40,000 acres \n     of terrain;\n       Whereas nearly 3,000 firefighters from dozens of fire crews \n     courageously battled the fast-spreading blaze, which was \n     fanned by Santa Ana wind gusts up to 60 miles per hour;\n       Whereas 4 firefighters--Mark Loutzenhiser, Jess McLean, \n     Jason McKay, and Daniel Hoover-Najera--made the ultimate \n     sacrifice by giving their lives when flames overtook them as \n     they tried to protect a home;\n       Whereas an additional firefighter, Pablo Cerda, joined them \n     in that sacrifice when he too lost his life, after fighting \n     to survive for 6 days in a hospital before succumbing to \n     burns he had received fighting alongside his fallen \n     colleagues;\n       Whereas firefighters honored the spirit of their fallen \n     colleagues by completing the job they started and controlling \n     the blaze, even while recognizing considerable danger to \n     their own well-being;\n       Whereas skilled and courageous aircraft personnel and \n     additional emergency personnel, including law enforcement and \n     medical personnel, also responded to the threat posed by the \n     fire; and\n       Whereas law enforcement personnel are aggressively pursuing \n     the conviction of the arsonist, and generous Californians \n     have offered additional funds, on top of those offered by the \n     Riverside County Board of Supervisors, to help bring the \n     arsonist to justice: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) recognizes and honors--\n       (A) all of the firefighters who responded to the \n     devastating Esperanza Incident fire in southern California in \n     October 2006; and\n       (B) all others, including emergency, law enforcement, and \n     medical personnel and aircraft crews, who contributed to \n     controlling the fire, keeping Californians safe, and finding \n     and arresting the suspected arsonist; and\n       (2) commends the firefighters and other personnel who \n     responded to the fire for dedicated service to the people of \n     California.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/11/15/senate-section/article/S10973-2", "month": "11", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10973]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 5149.
