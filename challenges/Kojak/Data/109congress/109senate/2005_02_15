Mr. President, I will take just a few moments at the \nbeginning of today to comment on last week and a brief look ahead.\n  Last Thursday, the Senate achieved its first legislative victory, a \nbipartisan victory of the 109th session. By a vote of 72 to 26, the \nSenate passed the Class Action Fairness Act. The process was that we \nworked together across the aisle from beginning to end. The bill was \nintroduced with 32 cosponsors, 24 Republicans and 8 Democrats. It came \nout of the Judiciary Committee on a strong bipartisan vote. Every vote \non every amendment was bipartisan, and the vote on final passage was \nstrongly bipartisan as well.\n  I stress the bipartisanship because in the 109th Congress we have a \nlot to do, and it is going to demand that we continue to work together \nin that same spirit. I thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle \nfor their fairness and cooperation. We have delivered to the American \npeople a significant victory in the battle for fairness in the courts.\n  The class action bill does protect plaintiffs' rights while reining \nin the rampant abuse within the system itself. The consumer bill of \nrights protects plaintiffs from predatory lawyers and guarantees that \nthey receive just compensation. The legislation restores justice to our \ncourt system by ending that practice of forum shopping, where we had \nnationwide cases that genuinely impact interstate commerce being moved \nto the Federal courts where they belong.\n  It took a while to have this success last week. Senator Grassley, who \nwas\n\n[[Page S1362]]\n\nthe lead sponsor on the bill, has been working on this for over a \ndecade, and versions of this bill passed through the Judiciary \nCommittee in each of the last two Congresses. In 2003, it came within \none vote of passage. Finally, because of the continuing work of both \nsides of the aisle, people came together to recognize the intent was \nright, the legislation at different points could be improved, it was \nimproved, and then we had relatively quick passage of it. The House \nwill be addressing the bill shortly. Then hopefully we can have a bill \nto the President of the United States to be signed into law for the \nbenefit of the American people.\n  Also, at the beginning of last week, on Monday, we passed a \nresolution commending the Iraqi people on their January 30 elections. \nAs we saw over the weekend, those elections were finalized and, in \nterms of the final reports, again, it is a great victory for freedom \nand liberty throughout the world. It was an extraordinary event, and it \nwas fitting that we came together on this floor to celebrate and \ncommend the process and the results in those elections.\n  It was in the midst of terrorist blasts and terrorist threats that 8 \nmillion Iraqi voters streamed to over 5,000 polling stations to express \nthat influence, that power and dignity that comes with voting. The \nvarious pictures that we all saw of families bringing their sons and \ndaughters so that they could witness this moment in history is \nsomething that captures us all.\n  As I mentioned, over the weekend the votes were tallied of the 8.5 \nmillion people voting. For the first time in decades the Iraqi people \nhave been able to speak and to speak freely--and they were heard, as we \nsaw with the outcome. It is a transformation that is fundamental. It is \na fundamental transformation of power from the people, instead of over \nthe people. This has renewed a sense of momentum and optimism and hope.\n\n  The process, as we see, continues to unfold with negotiations going \non as to who will be part of the Presidential Council. Again, looking \nfrom afar, from where we sit it is very encouraging to see the various \ncoalitions working with each other, Shiites working with the Sunnis and \nworking with other minority parties, all working together to fashion \nthis government. It is an exciting time for the Iraqi people and all \nwho watch.\n  Jumping ahead, today we will, as I mentioned in my opening statement, \nvote on the nomination of Judge Michael Chertoff to lead the Department \nof Homeland Security. We have heard much about the judge, both in \ncommittee and then on the floor yesterday, and we will over the course \nof today. He has a long and distinguished career in public service and \nlaw enforcement. In the mid-1980s he was an assistant U.S. attorney \nalongside Rudy Giuliani. He aggressively prosecuted mob and political \ncorruption cases. He then went on to become New Jersey's U.S. attorney, \nwhere he oversaw high-profile and politically sensitive prosecutions in \nJersey City, actually prosecuting the mayor of Jersey City, Mayor \nGerald McCann, New York chief judge Sol Wachtler, and the kidnappers \nand killers of Exxon oil executive Sidney Reso. Fearless and scrupulous \nas a prosecutor, he became known not only for his legal brilliance but \nalso for his skills as a manager and leader.\n  We all saw that take real meaning after 9/11. For the 20 hours after \nthat worst ever attack on American soil, Judge Chertoff was central in \ndirecting our response. It was through his work as Chief of the Justice \nDepartment's Criminal Division that they traced the 9/11 killers back \nto al-Qaida, a central focus. We are indebted for all these things to \nhis strong and unwavering leadership.\n  For the next 2 years Judge Chertoff was the key figure shaping our \nantiterrorism policies. His experience working directly with law \nenforcement, his expertise in homeland security policy, and his proven \nability to lead in times of national crisis make him overwhelmingly \nqualified to direct our Homeland Security Department.\n  He earned unanimous approval in committee last week, with one member \nvoting ``present.'' I am confident that today Judge Chertoff, who has \nalready been confirmed by this body three times, will receive \noverwhelming, strong bipartisan support. He is an outstanding candidate \nand we all look forward to working with him in his new capacity.\n  Another matter of security, a different type of security, which I \nhope we will be addressing this week--I mentioned it also a little \nearlier--is the Genetic Nondiscrimination Act. This is the security of \ninformation about us that can be used to give us health care security. \nIt is a bill that many of us on the floor have been working on \naggressively over the last 7, 8 years. The bill, the Genetic \nNondiscrimination Act, is just that. The bill is designed to protect \nAmericans from having valuable genetic health information abused or \nmisused by others--for example, being used against them to get health \ninsurance coverage or being used in some way to discriminate \nagainst them for a future job. This whole field of genetic testing and \ngenetic information has blossomed, in part because of a wonderful \npublic-private project that was over about a 10-year period called the \nHuman Genome Project. This explosion of information has introduced \nthese genetic tests that can have--and it is early, they are early--but \nthey do have the potential for having great predictive value regarding \nwhat disease or illness you might have later in life, and would allow \nyou to prevent that, to take preventive measures if that is the case.\n\n  Right now, scientists tell us most Americans have about a half dozen \npotentially harmful genetic mutations. That is a statement that will \nchange a week from now, a month from now, a year from now, as we learn \nmore and more about it, but the point of this bill is that people run \nthe risk of losing their jobs or not being promoted or not being able \nto get an insurance policy based on getting this test which could be of \nso much benefit to them. We need to prevent it, and we need to do it \nnow, instead of waiting until it becomes a huge problem in the future.\n  One study in 2003 found that 40 percent of people at risk for colon \ncancer refused to participate in a screening exam, many citing the fear \nthat the results might in some way cause them to lose their health \ninsurance. That means they don't get this test. If they don't get the \ntest, they lose the potential benefit to their own health and health \nsecurity in the future. The knowledge of genetic risk has the power to \nsave lives. As we look at tests that are early, and they are just being \nproven--the tests for heart disease, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, a host \nof other diseases--there is great hope in these genetic tests becoming \na powerful tool. The legislation we are considering this week is \nintended to make sure genetic testing is used as a tool to help and not \nhurt. I hope we will be able to pass that bill so that medical science \ndoes deliver a meaningful solution and keeps America moving forward.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/02/15/senate-section/article/S1362-1", "month": "02", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1362]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, pursuant to that consent, I would like to \nbe recognized to speak to an issue which the whole world has focused on \nover the last several weeks and months. Within a few weeks, the Senate \nis likely to vote to send hundreds of millions\n\n[[Page S1363]]\n\nof dollars in assistance to the nations that were devastated by the \ntsunami on December 26. We have seen the videotapes. We cannot forget \nthem. Within a matter of minutes on that terrible day, whole families \nand villages were swept to sea. Schools, clinics, and hospitals were \ndestroyed. Coastal cities were eliminated. What infrastructure there \nwas in place was wiped out.\n  We are doing the right thing to come to the assistance of the victims \nof this disaster, one of the 10 most devastating natural disasters in \nrecent history, but we should not overlook the fact there are many \nother challenges in this world. Millions have died in the Congo and the \nSudan. Hundreds of thousands are still at risk. Preventable, treatable \ndiseases kill millions more every year. Someone dies of AIDS every 10 \nseconds in this world. Someone new is infected every 6 seconds. Poverty \nkills. Bad water, hunger, poor sanitation kills; they are the weapons \nof economic injustice and economic disparity.\n  Nelson Mandela said recently:\n\n       Like slavery and apartheid, poverty is not natural. It is \n     man-made and it can be overcome and eradicated by the actions \n     of human beings.\n\n  Overcoming poverty is not just a gesture of charity; it is an act of \njustice. It is the protection of a fundamental human right, the right \nto dignity and a decent life. Our attention now focuses on the Indian \nOcean, as it should. But let's not overlook the suffering in the world.\n  A number of years ago I went to Bangladesh. I went there to look at \nfood programs. In the course of my visit, I met one of the most \nextraordinary people I ever had the pleasure to meet. His name was \nMuhammad Yunus. Muhammad Yunus, not that long ago in 1976, was an \neconomics professor. Having taken a few economic courses--I remembered \nmy professors--he would have blended in with the faculty of most \nuniversities.\n  He had an idea. It was an idea that was borne out of human \nexperience. It involves basic economics. Dr. Yunus thought for a \nmoment, what if we gave the poorest people on Earth a small sum of \nmoney, what would they do with it? Would they pay it back? They were \ntwo very basic questions. The issue came up because he saw in many of \nthe poorest villages of Bangladesh people who were being exploited by \nthose who would lend them money and charge them outrageous interest \nrates. He started something called Grameen Bank, which means the \npeople's bank in their local language in 1976. The concept behind it \nwas to give a very small loan to people who were very poor.\n  Now, 29 years later, as I stand in the Senate, Dr. Yunus's theory of \nmicrocredit and the Grameen Bank grew from a class project to a world-\nwide phenomenon. Today, there are 80 million families in the world who \nare benefiting from Dr. Yunus's concept of microcredit. We estimate \nsome 400 million people will benefit; 98 percent of them are \nwomen. These are people who are part of a quiet revolution. I have seen \nit firsthand. Their lives have been transformed. They have enough money \nto feed their children, to buy basic tools, maybe to buy a goat for \nmilk, perhaps to buy a sewing machine--basic things that transform \ntheir lives.\n\n  They pay the money back. They pay it back so others in the village \ncan borrow money, as well. The average loan for many of Dr. Yunus's \nclients in Bangladesh is $9. With $9, many people go from being a \nbeggar to a businessperson. He actually decided that because Bangladesh \ndid not have a telephone system that he would buy cell phones and he \nwould loan money to people so they could purchase them. Go to the \nremote villages and there sit 10 women holding a cell phone. With these \ncell phones, they go to their villages, they sell them minutes on the \nphone, and they make a living. They are the Grameen Telephone Company, \nthe telephone women who borrowed enough money to buy a cell phone and \nnow make a living with that cell phone. Incidentally, they charge their \ncell phones with a solar-powered generator. They are thinking ahead. \nThis type of thing is happening all over the world.\n  The reason I raise it is because when Dr. Yunus came to see me 2 \nweeks ago here in Washington we talked about the tsunami. He said there \nis so much that needs to be done there. They need to rebuild \ncommunities. They need to rebuild lives, but do not overlook the fact \nthat the ocean, as it came in, swept away the schools and the teachers \nwith it. Now the surviving children who are there are in camps trying \nto survive instead of thinking about thriving, going to school and \ngiving back.\n  Dr. Yunus said to me, this man who comes up with amazing, simple \nideas: Senator, why don't we create a tsunami scholars program? Why \naren't we focusing on these children and their education? It is so \nsimple and so obvious: To rebuild the schools, to bring in trained \nteachers so these kids have a chance but to take it a step beyond. What \nif we said across this world that we would challenge all colleges and \nuniversities to take two students from the tsunami area, students who \nwould qualify to come to school, but to give these kids a chance at an \neducation so they could go home and rebuild those villages and rebuild \nthose nations?\n  Another challenge from Dr. Yunus, very basic, from a man who \nunderstands poverty at the most basic level. We are working on that \nnow. We think we can put together a proposal that the United States can \nhelp to lead the world into considering.\n  The devastation of the tsunami took only a few minutes. It will take \nyears to overcome. If we do the right things, we can rebuild those \nsocieties in the right way. The people living there are going to know a \nlot about us in the process. They will know that some of what they have \nbeen told about the United States is not true. Some who want them to be \nterrorists and to hate the United States will have a hard time \nexplaining how the United States came to the assistance of these poor \npeople after the tsunami and how we stood by them and their children in \ntheir education afterwards.\n  It is a small thing. It is important. It helps explain who we are. \nTsunami scholarships are one example of how we can make certain we do \nnot abandon the victims of this disaster after the headlines are gone. \nIt is important we show this to the world, especially to the Muslim \nworld, of what the American character is made.\n\n  I want to give these children of Indonesia, Thailand, Sri Lanka, \nIndia, and elsewhere a chance at an education that will not only \ntransform their lives but allow them to go back and transform their \ncountries.\n  The poet, Lord Byron, advised: Be thou the rainbow to the storms of \nlife.\n  The peoples of the Indian Ocean have seem the storms. Let us be the \nrainbow that follows. Education is the most valuable tool you can put \nin the hands of anyone, particularly a child. As the children of the \ntsunami grow, let's make sure their opportunities for education are not \nconstrained by misfortune or geography.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I understand we are in Republican-\nallocated time on morning business.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, for the last 4 years, the United States \nhas been locked in combat with the forces of terror. These extremists \ndo not understand freedom and are trying even to this very day to \nspread their message of hate and oppression. America did not fire the \nfirst shot. Those killed on September 11 were innocent and did not \ndeserve to die. They should be with us today. The forces of terror \nremain determined to defeat our Nation. They believe the United States \nwill abandon Iraq and Afghanistan. They question our will to fight. \nThey doubt our courage and our fortitude. They are wrong.\n  Our Nation has stepped up to fight and has never looked back. Under \nPresident Bush's leadership, our country has taken the battle to the \nenemy. As the President said in his State of the Union Address:\n\n       Our country is still the target of terrorists who want to \n     kill many and intimidate us all,\n\n[[Page S1364]]\n\n     and we will stay on the offensive against them until the \n     fight is won.\n\n  In less than 3 months after September 11, United States and Afghan \nforces toppled the Taliban regime, a brutal theocracy shielding al-\nQaida and other terrorists. A year after September 11, the President \nchallenged the United Nations to confront another protector of terror, \nSaddam Hussein. This cruel dictator threatened his neighbors, his \npeople, and our country with his support for terror and his pursuit of \nweapons of mass destruction. He lied, cajoled, intimidated, and \nmurdered. Our Nation did not stop with Afghanistan and Iraq. Our forces \nhave sought out the enemy, cut off his funding resources, and disrupted \nhis plans. We have captured thousands of terrorists, destroyed \ntheir networks, and prevented new attacks. There have been many \nsuccesses in this war, and we should be encouraged and strengthened by \nour progress.\n\n  Our men and women in our Armed Forces are the real heroes in this \nconflict. They have fought and sacrificed for our country. Tragically, \nsome have paid the ultimate price. Today nearly 200,000 soldiers, \nsailors, airmen, and marines are deployed in hotspots around the world. \nThey continue to take the fight to the enemy and defeat him wherever he \nappears. Our men and women in uniform are determined and ready.\n  I visited our troops in Iraq and Afghanistan, and I have seen with my \nown eyes their commitment and determination. It is phenomenal. They \nbelieve in what they are doing. They know they are making a difference. \nI am reminded of those who have already sacrificed much but yet have \nnot given up and remain committed to their duty. Soldiers such as Army \nCPT David Roselle have been an inspiration to me and many other \nColoradans. While on patrol last year in Iraq, Captain Roselle lost a \nleg when an antitank mine went off nearby. After several surgeries and \nintense physical therapy, Captain Roselle rebuilt and retrained his \nmuscles. He conducted 4-hour sessions of daily exercise, including \nmountain biking, weight lifting, swimming, and climbing. Six months \nafter his last surgery, Captain Roselle was skiing down the slopes of \nthe Colorado Rockies.\n  But the story does not end there. Now just over a year later, Captain \nRoselle is still in the Army, and commands the headquarters company of \nthe 3rd Army Cavalry and is preparing to deploy with the unit this \nspring. It is Captain Roselle's relentlessness, his call to duty, and \nhis determination to defend our great Nation that tells me that our \nforces are strong and victory remains the only option.\n  Our men and women deployed in combat are not the only heroes. I \ncannot fully express my admiration for the families of these soldiers, \nsailors, airmen, and marines. For months at a time, military families \nare asked to hold everything together and support their loved ones \noverseas. They have done this and have done it with pride.\n  Organizations such as Colorado's Home Front Heroes have also stepped \nup and supported our troops. Home Front Heroes has provided family \nsupport when none was available and sent thousands of care packages to \nour soldiers deployed overseas. The organization led the drive to get \nthe State of Colorado to designate March 29 Support Our Troops Day. And \nin one case, Home Front Heroes actually paid for family members to \ntravel to Germany to visit their wounded loved ones.\n  I see it all over Colorado. There is a steely determination to see \nthe global war on terrorism completed and victory achieved. That is why \nit is more important than ever for Congress to do its part.\n  This week the Senate will receive the President's request for \nsupplemental appropriations. This money is critical to continuing the \nwar on terror and ensuring our troops have the necessary equipment, \ntraining, and information to succeed on the battlefield. While some may \nargue that this money should be included in the budget or that certain \nitems are not emergencies, none of us would argue that the money is not \nneeded. We know our troops need improved protection. Our chief of staff \nfor the Army has testified that much of the Army's equipment is worn \ndown and should be replaced. We owe it to our military families to \nprovide the increased death gratuity.\n  As we consider this important appropriation, let us remember our \nsuccesses so far. Fifty million people in Afghanistan and Iraq have \ntasted freedom and for most were able to cast a vote for the first \ntime. Cities are being rebuilt and market economies are being \ndeveloped. Terror networks have collapsed and funding for these \nnetworks is drying up. The war is not over, but we are making a \ndifference. Congress must do its part. Now is the time for Congress to \nact.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from South Dakota is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I recently had the good fortune to travel \nto Iraq with my colleagues Senator Inhofe and Senator Isakson. With my \nown eyes, I saw the political genesis of a nation moving from tyranny \nto liberty. This process was made possible by the skill and \ndetermination of our troops, the strides being made by the Iraqi \nsecurity forces, and the growing determination of the Iraqi people to \nengage in the democratic process.\n  I cannot say enough about the sacrifice and dedication of our troops. \nTheir professionalism and devotion to duty are truly inspiring. And I \nam convinced now more than ever the United States has the finest \nmilitary in the world. To those who know it best, our military's might \nis not defined only by its sheer firepower but by the individual \nsoldiers who all play their part in making a multifaceted operation \nlike this possible.\n  Of course, our service members perform their military \nresponsibilities with pride, with diligence, and with professionalism. \nBut many of them also work hand to hand with the Iraqis every day \ntrying to bridge the gaps in language, culture, and community, to forge \na common bond cemented by freedom. In doing so, our men and women in \nuniform represent all that is good about our country.\n  My fellow Senators and I also visited wounded American soldiers in a \nmilitary hospital in Germany on our way back from Iraq. These brave men \nand women who have already sacrificed so much for the cause of freedom \nwere mostly and primarily concerned with getting back together with \ntheir units and for the well-being of their peers who are still in \nIraq. That warrior spirit among these brave men and women is inspiring \nand gave me pause to consider what is clearly at stake for the Iraqi \npeople.\n  Our National Guard and Reserves are also playing a critical role in \nIraq. Three days ago I was honored to be able to welcome home the \nSecond Battalion, 147th Field Artillery of the South Dakota National \nGuard from Iraq. These citizen soldiers put their lives on hold for \nover a year to provide critically needed support. They performed their \nmission effectively and honorably, and I applaud their selfless \nsacrifice.\n\n  The Iraqi people also deserve our admiration and thanks. While in \nIraq we met with General David Petraeus who is in charge of training \nIraqi securities forces. He was upbeat about their progress and the \nefficiency that is beginning to take root. General Petraeus's \nconvictions were legitimized by the effectiveness shown by the Iraqi \nsecurity forces on election day. Those forces were the first line of \ndefense in successfully protecting over 5,000 polling stations \nthroughout Iraq, none of which were penetrated by the insurgents. Some \nof the Iraqi security forces even gave their lives so their fellow \ncountrymen could vote.\n  Perhaps the bravest of all on election day were the Iraqi citizens \nwho also risked their lives by taking that critical first step on their \njourney to self-determination. The insurgents and terrorists grossly \nunderestimated the Iraqi people's courage and thirst for freedom. The \nIraqi people did not buckle under threats of violence and murder. \nInstead they spoke out with a great voice that has been heard \nthroughout the world and well into the annals of recorded history. They \nhave demanded their right to self-determination, their right to live \ntheir lives as they see fit, free from tyranny, free from fear, free \nfrom extremism. On election day, they earned that right.\n  Let me be clear, there is still much work that needs to be done, and \nthere are still enemies to fight. But freedom's light does not shine \nwithout a\n\n[[Page S1365]]\n\nprice. The Iraqi people know this. They understand a new Iraq must not \nbe dominated by only one ethnic or religious sect. Many Iraqis I met \nwith, including Shiites and others, expressed the belief that for \ndemocracy to work, the Sunnis, who now find themselves the minority, \nmust be a part of and represented in an inclusive Iraqi government.\n\n  Of course we all look forward to a free and stable Iraq. But we \nshould not attempt to impose an artificial time line on this goal. \nInstead we should focus on a conditions-based schedule that allows for \na responsible transfer of responsibility from American to Iraqi troops. \nOur generals support that concept, not arbitrary deadlines. When the \nconditions are right for us to leave, we will know and so will a free \nand sovereign Iraq.\n  I believe the recent elections and the self-confidence they have \ninspired in the Iraqi people may represent a turning point in the \nstruggle for democracy in Iraq. With the bravery and the dedication of \nour troops and the courage of the Iraqi people and their security \nforces, we can look forward to the day when our troops come home with \nthe honor they have earned.\n  We will soon be debating legislation that will provide funding and \nresources for our troops to complete their mission. It is critical that \nin the course of this debate we understand what is happening today in \nIraq and what it means for American troops who are bringing about \nfreedom and democracy. We must make sure they have the resources, the \nequipment, the training, and the weaponry to succeed in this mission.\n  The insurgents, who continue to prey upon the fears of the Iraqi \npeople, who resort to tactics and thuggery and indiscriminately kill \ninnocent people, are not going to go quietly. It is important that we \ncomplete this mission. It is important that we win and secure the \nfreedom of the Iraqi people. It was clear to me, having traveled to \nIraq and listened firsthand to the stories that have been shared and \nconveyed by Iraqi voters, who for the first time were able to take that \nink-stained finger and mark a ballot, that they are committed to the \ncause of freedom and democracy in their own country.\n  We heard statements such as ``we are profoundly grateful.'' We heard \nstatements talking about how the mission is succeeding, but it is still \nfragile, how we need to continue to focus on training and equipping \nIraqi security forces, and that the reconstruction needs to move \nfaster.\n  Engagement with the Iraqis is the way for us to succeed, and giving \nthe Iraqis the opportunity to govern, which is what the elections were \nall about. Giving the Iraqis the opportunity to defend the freedom they \nsecured when they voted on election day should be our mission in Iraq. \nIt is important as a nation, as a Congress, and here in the Senate, \nthat we take the steps necessary to ensure that our troops--our young \nmen and women who are bravely and courageously setting and laying the \nfoundation for a safe, strong, and free Iraq--have what they need to \ncomplete that mission.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Georgia is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. IZAKSON. Mr. President, the President has sent to us an $81.9 \nbillion supplemental for our war against terror and the fight in Iraq \nand Afghanistan. This morning, in Congress Daily, I read a quote about \nthat supplemental from the distinguished ranking member of the \nAppropriations Committee:\n\n       This supplemental request provides support for our men and \n     women in uniform, but it provides little basis for optimism \n     for a stable and secure Iraq.\n\n  The comment of the respected distinguished Senator from West Virginia \ndeserves amplification in terms of stability and security in Iraq.\n  I am pleased to have just returned from Iraq with Senator Thune, who \njust spoke, and to have had the chance to see firsthand the results of \nwhat our men and women in our Armed Forces have been doing in Iraq \nsince we deposed Saddam Hussein and began providing peace and a \nfoundation for future security. In fact, it is that foundation I would \nlike to address.\n  There are three key pillars to security and stability in Iraq. The \nfirst pillar is for us to continue this year, and for a time uncertain, \nto provide the Iraqi people with security so they can complete the \nwriting of their constitution, hold their permanent elections, and \nallow their democracy to flourish. The second pillar is that government \nitself. It is essential that we pass this supplemental to continue the \nsecurity and allow those who were recently elected to form their \nconstitution and do their work.\n\n  When you talk about optimism, I have to share a story about the \nrecent visit. Senator Thune, Senator Inhofe, and I met with deputy \nAmbassador Salih, a Kurd. We met alone, with no staff, no press, no \nencouragement, total candor. We asked Mr. Salih, a Kurd in the \nminority--and even though the results of the election were not complete \nat the time we were there, we knew they would be in a minority. We \nasked:\n\n       Don't you fear that the Shiites, who will inevitably be in \n     the majority, will overrun you?\n\n  He said:\n\n       Oh, no, we have a secret weapon.\n\n  This is a Kurdish leader in the middle of Iraq in the 21st century \nwho said he had a secret weapon. He said that secret weapon is one \nword: ``Filibuster.'' Then he proceeded to describe their study of \nAmerican democracy and our Republic. If there were ever a reason for \noptimism about what this supplemental provides for the people of Iraq \nand their stability and security, it is one of their minority leaders \nproudly stating one of the pillars and principles of our Government as \nthe way they would ensure that the majority never overran the minority.\n  Following that meeting, we went and met with Dr. Al-Rubiae, a Shiite, \nobviously to be in the majority. We worried that since, for so many \nyears, they had been the victims of the Sunnis--since they now would be \nin a majority, would there be a propensity to overrun the minority? So \nwe asked:\n\n       Dr. al-Rubiae, what will you do? Will the minority have a \n     voice?\n\n  He said:\n\n       The American Constitution requires two-thirds vote to amend \n     the Constitution. We will require two-thirds vote to adopt \n     ours.\n\n  The point is very clear. He, too, had studied Adams and Jefferson and \nour Founding Fathers. Knowing he would be in the majority, he \nrecognized that the peace, strength, and stability in Iraq was \npredicated upon the majority not overrunning the minority.\n  So when we question whether this supplemental provides any optimism \nfor stability and security in Iraq, I submit those two absolutely \naccurate quotes of two gentlemen--one in the majority and one in the \nmajority--those who will take part in writing the constitution. Who \nwould have thought they would quote Jefferson or Adams or our \nConstitution 6 months ago, or a year ago, or 2 years ago? It is because \nof the men and women we have sent into harm's way, the coalition \nforces, our commitment to freedom, and our present commitment to \nspreading democracy around the globe that today provides great optimism \nin Iraq.\n  But there is a third pillar we must consider as well, which is the \nfuture ability of the Iraqis--once their constitution is written, their \ngovernment is established, and our troops lessen--to be able to secure \nthemselves. There have been a lot of comments about whether they can do \nthat. I give you comments that Lieutenant General Petraeus shared with \nus on our visit.\n  First, the coalition forces have trained 136,065 Iraqis. Our goal by \nthe end of this year is 200,000. Recruiting has mushroomed since the \nelection. In fact, on television, some of you have seen the lines the \nday after the election that showed up at recruiting centers that were \npreviously vacant. So we know the resources are coming. Our coalition \nforces are helping us with their training, and already the Iraqis who \nare trained are demonstrating heroism just like the heroism of our \nAmerican soldiers. There is no better example than this: On election \nday, when at a polling place an Iraqi-trained soldier by our coalition \nforces was in the first line of defense, as were Iraqis at every \npolling place, all 5,200. He spotted a suspicious character. He \napproached him. He noticed the bulging waistline, symmetrically \nindicating a bomb. He threw himself on the bomber and the bomber \ndetonated the bomb. The Iraqi soldier, trained by coalition forces,\n\n[[Page S1366]]\n\ngave his life. Those in line to vote, identifying with their index \nfinger their commitment to liberty, were not injured and did not leave. \nThey voted and democracy was born in that precinct, in that district in \nIraq, in large measure, because of the bravery and heroism of that \nIraqi soldier, trained by United States and coalition forces.\n\n  So as we consider the $81.9 billion for the continuation of our \neffort in Iraq and Afghanistan, and to a certain extent in the Middle \nEast, if we look for optimism, it surrounds us everywhere. Only after \nour engagement in Afghanistan were the Taliban deposed. Only after our \nengagement in Iraq was Hussein captured. Only after our commitment \nagainst terrorism and countries that harbor terrorists did Libya give \nup its weapons of mass destruction.\n  Recently, the Palestinians elected a new leader, Abbas, and already \nthe prospect for hope and peace in the Middle East between Israel and \nPalestine is brighter. To me, that is great optimism for the future of \nsecurity and stability, not only in Iraq, not only in the Middle East, \nbut throughout the world.\n  We also must ask ourselves this: If we don't have optimism in the \ninvestment we make in the war on terror and the spreading of democracy, \nthen what dividend would we receive by making no investment at all?\n  My submission to you is that we would be fighting the war on terror \nnot only overseas but on our own streets. We would be spending more \nthan we invested in this war to try to be a defensive country, rather \nthan an offensive country helping to spread democracy wherever people \nyearn for it.\n  I have great respect for those who will question any spending we \nmight entertain. I understand the concerns about the investment that we \nmay make in the coming weeks in the supplemental for Iraq. But I will \ntell you that with the comments of Deputy Ambassador Salih, the \ncomments of Dr. al-Rubiae, and the evidence of the heroism of the Iraqi \nsoldier at the polling place Sunday, a week ago, it is clear to me this \nsupplemental will continue that major pillar of support for democracy \nin the Middle East; that is, the presence of U.S. men and women in our \nArmed Forces to continue to secure that nation so it can finalize a \nconstitution and have permanent elections for its peace and its \nsecurity.\n  Our President has sent us a document to make an expanded investment \nin peace and democracy. I submit to you that the evidence for optimism \nabounds in Iraq and I, for one, will stand by this President and stand \nby our men and women in harm's way, so that their democracy, which has \nnow bloomed, will flourish in a part of the world that has never seen \nit.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, as I understand, we are in a period for \nmorning business?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Is there a time limit on statements in morning business?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The time until 12:30 p.m. is \nequally divided.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the Chair.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/02/15/senate-section/article/S1366-1", "month": "02", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1366-S1369]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     NOMINATION OF MICHAEL CHERTOFF\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I support the nomination of Mr. Chertoff \nto be Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security. He brings a \nwealth of experience to this position and that experience will serve \nhim well, because the challenges facing this department in the post 9/\n11 era continue to be immense. The agency can never afford to drop its \nguard for a moment. From protecting our borders to managing difficult \nimmigration issues, Mr. Chertoff will be at the heart of many of the \ncountry's most complex security issues.\n  Just under 2 years ago, the Department of Homeland Security was \ncreated in the largest overhaul of Federal agencies in more than half a \ncentury. It merged 185,000 Federal workers and 22 agencies in order to \ncreate a more national effort to protect ourselves in the wake of \nSeptember 11.\n  It is a job that requires overseeing the development of innovative \nmethodologies and techniques to prevent and deter terrorist attacks. It \nrequires rapid response to threats and hazards, and it requires \neffective information analysis and information sharing between agencies \nat all levels--Federal, State and local.\n  The Secretary's job is to strengthen and maintain the security of our \nairports, seaports and land borders. But, equally important is the \nSecretary's ability to welcome the more than 500 million citizens, \npermanent residents, lawful visitors, students, and temporary workers \nwho cross our borders each year.\n  As Secretary, Mr. Chertoff will have a major role on immigration \npolicy. One of the most important responsibilities of his position is \nto see that the immigration service and enforcement functions are well-\ncoordinated, and that the service functions are not given short shrift. \nWithout strong leadership and the insistence on close coordination, the \nofficials in the various immigration bureaus of the department are \nprone to issue conflicting policies and legal interpretations and \ncreate disarray in the department's mission.\n  Questions have been raised about Mr. Chertoff's role in the Criminal \nDivision of the Department of Justice in developing the investigative \nstrategy that led to the department's detention of hundreds of \nimmigrants after 9/11. According to the report of the department's \nInspector General in June 2003, there were ``significant problems in \nthe way the detainees were handled.'' There were also problems that \nincluded a failure to distinguish detainees suspected of ties to \nterrorism from detainees with no such connection. The Inspector General \nfound there was inhumane treatment of detainees at Federal detention \ncenters, unnecessarily prolonged detention resulting from the \ndepartment's ``hold until cleared'' policy, secret detentions without \nformal charges, interference with access to counsel, and closed \nhearings.\n  I met with Judge Chertoff and raised my concerns about these \ndetainees and his role in formulating the policy. He recognized and \nunderstood that significant problems had occurred at the Justice \nDepartment in the treatment of the detainees and indicated a \nwillingness to re-evaluate current policies and put in place protocols \nto prevent these abuses from recurring.\n  Unfortunately, the administration has not been nearly as \naccommodating. It has refused to provide vital documents to the two \nSenate Committees charged with oversight over the Department of \nHomeland Security, the Homeland Security and Government Accountability \nCommittee and the Judiciary Committee. Specifically, the administration \ncontinues to play hide and seek with documents that would shed light on \nthe issues of torture and interrogation. In doing so, the \nadministration persists in displaying a disturbing disregard for our \nconstitutional role in Presidential nominations. By refusing to come \nclean and provide necessary documents, and by discouraging \nresponsiveness and candor from its nominees on the issue of torture, \nthe administration is only making the crisis worse, further \nembarrassing the Nation in the eyes of the world, and casting greater \ndoubt on its commitment to the rule of law.\n  As Senator Levin has emphasized, FBI e-mails state that while Mr. \nChertoff headed the Criminal Division, discussions occurred between the \nFBI and the Justice Department about interrogation abuses. The e-mails \nindicate that FBI personnel were deeply concerned about the \ninterrogation techniques being used at Guantanamo Bay by the Department \nof Defense and the FBI communicated their concerns directly to certain \npersons in the Criminal Division.\n  The e-mails in their public form, however, were heavily redacted to \navoid disclosing who spoke to whom. Although the e-mails were never \nprovided by the administration to the Senate, we were able to obtain \nthe documents in the same way as the general public obtained them, by \nsurfing the web for the redacted documents as released in a Freedom of \nInformation Act lawsuit.\n  Senator Levin and Senator Lieberman asked for the unedited version of \nthe e-mails in order to learn who in the FBI communicated the \ninformation and who in the Criminal Division received it. The request \nwas denied, even though the information might well have been highly \nrelevant\n\n[[Page S1367]]\n\nto our consideration of Mr. Chertoff's nomination. It is beyond debate \nthat our advice and consent function under the constitution includes \ninquiries into matters which may reflect on the nominee.\n  Mr. Chertoff may have no knowledge about the e-mails or the FBI \ndiscussion, but part of our constitutional obligation is to obtain \nenough information to make an informed decision. The American people \ndeserve to know whether we have done our constitutional job \nresponsibly.\n  Senator Levin has already spoken passionately about the stiff-arm \nthat he and Senator Lieberman and their committee received from the \nDepartment of Justice as they sought to give meaning to the words \n``advice and consent.'' From the text of the redacted version, it's \nobvious that Mr. Chertoff should have been asked about the torture \nissues in the depth that the documents would have enabled. He was head \nof the Criminal Division during the relevant time period. Naturally, \nthey asked to see the unredacted version of the document prior to any \nvote on the nomination.\n  But the administration flatly refused to cooperate. The White House \ncould easily have provided the documents only to Senators and to staff \nwith appropriate security clearances. It did not. Instead, it concealed \nthe full text of the e-mails in what amounts to an obvious coverup.\n  In addition, Senator Leahy and I sent a letter to the Department of \nJustice on February 4, asking it to provide a separate department \ndocument which reportedly advised the CIA on the legality of specific \ninterrogation techniques at a time when Mr. Chertoff was head of the \nCriminal Division. Again, the administration refused to provide it, \nclaiming that its contents were classified, even though Senators are \ncleared to review classified material.\n  Our problems with the administration on this nomination, however, \npale in comparison with the failure of the Senate Republican majority \nto carry out its own constitutional responsibilities on this \nnomination. Instead of insisting on adequate answers to the questions \nraised by the documents, they have acquiesced in the administration's \ncoverup and abdicated their own independent constitutional \nresponsibility to provide ``advice and consent'' on Presidential \nnominations. They have allowed partisanship to trump the Constitution.\n  In effect, the Republican Senate is acting as George Bush's poodle. \nThe Founders of our country would be appalled at what has happened in \nthis case. Obvious questions about this nomination have gone \nunanswered, and the Republican leadership of the Senate, instead of \nmeeting its constitutional responsibility to seek answers, rolls over \nand shirks its duty to see that the Senate's consent on this nomination \nis an informed consent, not a blatantly defective consent.\n  The Founders of our country did not create a parliamentary democracy. \nThey created a democracy based on the fundamental principle of \nseparation of powers with the Congress and the Judiciary acting as \nchecks and balances on the power of the President We ignore that \nfundamental principle at our peril.\n  A major issue in the 2006 congressional elections will clearly be the \nrubberstamp Congress. The refusal by the Republican Senate majority to \nexercise its constitutional responsibilities on this nomination is a \nflagrant example of that problem.\n  An essential part of winning the war on terrorism and protecting the \ncountry for the future is protecting the ideals and values that America \nstands for here at home and around the world. That means standing up \nagainst torture. It means shedding light on an administration that \nprefers to act in darkness. It also means living up to our oath of \noffice as Senators to protect and defend the Constitution.\n  The checks and balances in the Constitution are essential to our \ndemocracy and a continuing source of our country's strength. They are \nnot obstacles or inconveniences to be jettisoned in times of crisis. We \nowe it to those who come after us to be vigilant. Republicans and \nDemocrats alike must insist that our constitutional obligations and \nprerogatives be respected. I hope very much that this blatant \nabdication of our constitutional responsibility will not be repeated.\n  Regardless of the difficulties we have faced in obtaining these \nimportant documents, I am looking forward to working closely with Mr. \nChertoff. His long history of government service and dedication to the \npublic good are impressive. He has left the security of lifetime tenure \non the federal bench to accept the challenge of steering the Department \nof Homeland Security through difficult waters. His willingness to \nrespond to the President's call speaks well of his character.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sununu). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burr). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to be able to \nproceed for 10 minutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise this afternoon to discuss briefly the \nnomination of Judge Michael Chertoff, of New Jersey, to be Secretary of \nHomeland Security. I thank our colleagues on the Homeland Security and \nGovernmental Affairs Committee, especially Chairwoman Susan Collins and \nmy dear friend and colleague from Connecticut, Joseph Lieberman, for \ntheir close consideration of this nomination. The task of reviewing the \nnominee for Secretary of Homeland Security is a difficult one, and the \ncommittee did a fine job.\n  I have reviewed the credentials of Judge Chertoff. They are \nimpressive. In a legal career spanning over a quarter of a century, \nJudge Chertoff has shown a respectable dedication to public service. In \nmy view, he has also demonstrated an ability effectively to manage a \nvariety of security issues. For these reasons, I believe that Judge \nChertoff is qualified and capable to serve as Secretary of the \nDepartment of Homeland Security. I plan on voting for his nomination.\n  The job for which Judge Chertoff is being nominated is a challenging \none. In this post 9/11 era, the Secretary of Homeland Security bears \nthe primary responsibility of ensuring the safety of all Americans from \nthreats that range from terrorist attacks to natural phenomena. In \norder to meet this responsibility, the Secretary must oversee 22 \nseparate agencies and 180,000 employees, all of whom carry out critical \ndaily duties that include safeguarding our borders, securing our \ndomestic infrastructure, and providing emergency disaster assistance. \nWe all know that success in carrying out these duties will rest on the \nability of the Secretary to coordinate and manage the resources at his \ndisposal. They are huge.\n  If confirmed, Judge Chertoff will unfortunately find that the current \nresources at his disposal are inadequate to ensure the operation of an \neffective Department of Homeland Security. I strongly agree with \nseveral of my colleagues on the Homeland Security and Government \nAffairs Committee who argue that more must be done to improve the \nDepartment's ability to identify security threats and to respond to \nthese threats in an effective and appropriate manner.\n  I agree that the Department of Homeland Security must be given \nadequate resources to address the plethora of security vulnerabilities \nthat continue to plague our borders, airports, seaports, transportation \nsystems, utility networks, and financial networks. I also agree that \nmore work must be done to develop and implement a Government-wide \nstrategy on homeland security activities, and to devise specific plans \nof action for specific threats. Furthermore, I strongly concur that \nmore resources must be provided to our first responders--the millions \nof brave men and women who make up our front lines of defense at home.\n  For any homeland security response to be fully effective and \nsuccessful, our firefighters, law enforcement personnel, and emergency \nresponse teams require the most updated equipment and training to \nfunction. Regrettably, the administration's fiscal year 2006 budget \ndeeply cuts these and other initiatives related to homeland security.\n\n[[Page S1368]]\n\n  All of these challenges that I mention demand immediate and long-term \ninvestments. While I applaud the work that has already been done to \nenhance our domestic security since 9/11, I remain, as many of my \ncolleagues do, deeply disturbed by the administration's continued \ndisinclination to invest adequately in these activities. As more gaps \nin our security are uncovered and exploited, and as more work is being \ndone to enhance our capabilities in identifying closing these gaps, the \nBush administration's policy has been to provide less resources, \nincluding unthinkable cuts of $615 million to State homeland security \ninitiatives and our first responders. How can we fully expect to be \nsafe as a nation if the very people who are committed to our safety are \ndeprived of the vital resources that ensure our safety?\n  In his testimony before the Homeland Security and Governmental \nAffairs Committee, Judge Chertoff indicated his determination to `` . . \n. improve our technology, strengthen our management practices, secure \nour borders and transportation systems, and most important, focus each \nand every day on keeping America safe from attacks.''\n  I am encouraged by these remarks, and I hope Judge Chertoff's \ndetermination can allow him to meet the challenges, but he faces some \nawesome ones within the administration, if, in fact, these budget cut \nproposals are enacted into law.\n  I am also encouraged by the remarks he made regarding the rights to \ndue process that all Americans enjoy. In his testimony to the Homeland \nSecurity and Governmental Affairs Committee, Judge Chertoff said:\n\n       I believe that we cannot live in liberty without security, \n     but we would not want to live in security without liberty.\n\n  I believe this position is noteworthy, especially in light of the \nreport issued by the Department of Justice inspector general in 2003 \nthat criticized the prolonged detention of hundreds of people--\nprimarily immigrants--of suspected ties to terrorism that were later \ndeemed groundless. Judge Chertoff admitted that mistakes were made in \nthe detention and treatment of these individuals--an admission rarely \nheard from this administration--and vowed to prevent them from \nhappening again.\n  The question for our country is not whether Judge Chertoff is the \nright man for the job--I believe he is--but whether Judge Chertoff will \nbe given an impossible job by the President who nominated him. We \nsurely cannot meet the needs of our homeland security apparatus on a \ntin-cup budget, just as we cannot meet the needs of our military, our \nschools, and our health care facilities.\n  I find it troubling that--at the same time as it cuts support for \npolice, firefighters, schoolchildren, and hospitals--this \nadministration continues to view as sacrosanct the massive tax cuts \nworth $1.6 trillion that benefit only some of the most wealthy \nindividuals in our Nation. Clearly, the President is not willing to ask \nany of these people--although I think many of them would be more than \nwilling--to make the sacrifice for the well-being of our Nation. Yet, \nat the same time, the President is willing to tell firefighters, law \nenforcement personnel, and emergency response teams--people who risk \ntheir lives every day for our Nation--that not only are they going to \nget fewer resources each year, but they are required to do more with \nless. This severely skewed set of priorities is simply stunning. While \nit may be difficult for many of us to see this mismatch clearly today, \nI believe future historians who write about this period will harshly \njudge it as such.\n  If confirmed, Judge Chertoff faces formidable and daunting \nchallenges--challenges that must be overcome if we are to ensure the \nsafety of this country and well-being of all Americans. I speak on \nbehalf of all of my colleagues when I wish him the best in this very \ndifficult endeavor he is willing to undertake.\n\n  I am also here to discuss another issue raised by our colleague, \nSenator Carl Levin of Michigan. The issue concerns the repeated failure \nof this administration to provide the Senate with information necessary \nto carry out its constitutional responsibilities of giving advice and \nconsent and conducting oversight of the executive branch.\n  In a letter written by the Department of Justice to Senators \nLieberman and Levin on February 7--just over a week ago--the Department \nof Justice claimed that an unredacted document related to the Chertoff \nnomination would not be provided to the Homeland Security and \nGovernmental Affairs Committee because `` . . . it contains information \ncovered by the Privacy Act . . . as well as deliberative process \nmaterial.'' The assertion by the Department of Justice that their \ninability to comply rests on the Privacy Act is absurd and wholly \nunacceptable.\n  As Senator Levin has stated--and I strongly agree with him in this--\nthe Privacy Act protects private individuals from having personal \ninformation released without their consent. In this case, the \nDepartment of Justice is using the Privacy Act to conceal the names of \npublic officials who have engaged in Government activities at \ntaxpayers' expense. That is precisely the kind of case in which \nCongress ought to have full knowledge of Government personnel and their \nactivities in order to exercise its advice and consent responsibility \nfully.\n  To deny the Senate information about what public officials are doing \nat taxpayers' expense is essentially to deny the American people their \nright to know what their Government is or is not doing in the name of \nits citizens. To deny the American people their right to know of their \nGovernment's actions is an abuse of not only the Privacy Act, it is an \nabuse of power, in my view.\n\n  This may seem like a small matter to some, just one document. \nHowever, it should be noted that Senator Levin has precisely and \ncarefully raised an issue that would be deeply disturbing to anyone who \nis committed to openness and accountability in our Government. I \nsuggest to my colleagues that we are going to be seeing this issue \narise over and over again if we as a body--all of us here--do not \nchallenge it. I do not care what party is in the White House. If any \nadministration starts making the case in the Executive Branch that the \nPrivacy Act applies to Government personnel and Government documents \nthat Congress may need to fulfill its Constitutional obligations, then \na dangerous precedent will be set--one that I think we will deeply \nregret.\n  This matter reflects an already persistent, almost obsessive \npreoccupation by the current administration with secrecy, thereby \navoiding accountability to Congress and, of course, to the citizens we \nseek to represent.\n  The examples of this preoccupation are almost too many to recite. One \nexample that comes to mind is when Members of Congress and \nenvironmental organizations were unable to ascertain who--just the \nnames--participated in the Vice President's energy task force, the \ngroup which laid the blueprints for the administration's current energy \npolicy.\n  Another example is the refusal of the recent nominee, now current \nAttorney General, to provide information to the Judiciary Committee \npertaining to the development of his legal rationale for permitting \ntorture. Of particular note in this case, when asked to provide \ninformation, the Attorney General said:\n\n       I do not know what notes, memoranda, e-mails, or other \n     documents others may have about these meetings, nor have I \n     conducted a search.\n\n  The unwillingness even to search for information requested by \nCongress epitomizes a certain official arrogance that sets a dangerous \nprecedent because, when carried to its conclusion, it impairs and even \nimpedes most congressional oversight. Government employees are named in \ncountless documents that Congress needs in order to carry out its \nconstitutionally mandated responsibilities and to shine the light where \nappropriate for the people of this country on the actions of our \nGovernment.\n\n  In closing, I do not believe Judge Chertoff is an architect of the \npolicy to deny the public their right to know what their Government is \ndoing. That point needs to be made crystal clear. If I thought that \nwere the case, I would not support this nominee. I think Judge Chertoff \nhas made clear how he views these matters. But Senator Levin has raised \na very important issue that transcends this nomination and reaches \nevery agency and office in this government. It is the issue of \npreserving the openness, transparency,\n\n[[Page S1369]]\n\nand accountability of our democratic government. I thank Senator Levin \nwho, once again, during his service here, has proved how valuable \nattention to detail is. I commend my colleague for raising it.\n  I thank the indulgence of the Chair. I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/02/15/senate-section/article/S1369-1", "month": "02", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1369]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the Senate will \nproceed to executive session and resume consideration of the following \nnomination, which the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read the nomination of Michael \nChertoff, of New Jersey, to be Secretary of Homeland Security.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished \nSenator from Tennessee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Maine for \nyielding me time.\n  I am in support of the President's nominee, Judge Michael Chertoff. \nHe seems to have worked for almost every part of the Federal \nGovernment, including this body. I heard the Senator from Maine say \nthat she had never seen a better witness before her committee.\n  As Secretary of Homeland Security, Judge Chertoff will play a very \nimportant and visible role in our everyday lives, protecting us from \nterrorism, but my purpose today is to highlight another job he has. He \nis also the chief immigration officer. As Secretary, he will oversee \nthe Bureau of Citizenship and Immigration Services, the successor to \nthe INS, which manages immigration in this country. This job of Judge \nChertoff is not primarily about keeping people out of the United \nStates; it is also about welcoming new Americans into the United \nStates.\n  The numbers are down some since 2001, but as many as 1 million \nimmigrants become new American citizens each year.\n  I have attended a number of the ceremonies which are held in Federal \ncourthouses all over America every month to welcome and naturalize \nthese new citizens. I was in Nashville in December when 50 or 60 people \nfrom all backgrounds were administered the oath of allegiance by Judge \nEchols. The oath requires each new American to renounce any old \nallegiance and swear a new one to the United States of America.\n  Each one of these new citizens has waited at least 5 years. They have \nlearned English. They have learned something about U.S. history. They \nhave proved they are of good character. Many new citizens have tears in \ntheir eyes as they recite that oath. It is an inspiring scene. Each of \nthese new citizens brings a new background and cultural tradition to \nthe rich fabric of American life. That increases our magnificent \ndiversity, but diversity is not our most important characteristic.\n  Jerusalem is diverse. The Balkans are diverse. Iraq is diverse. A lot \nof the world is diverse. What is unique about the United States of \nAmerica is that we take all of that diversity and make ourselves into \none country. We are able to say we are all Americans. We do that \nbecause we unify it with principles and values in which we all believe: \nliberty, equality, rule of law. It also helps that we speak a common \nlanguage. It is hard to be one people if we cannot talk with one \nanother. Many of these new citizens and many others living in this \ncountry lack a solid grasp of our common language or a clear \nunderstanding of our history and civic culture. Without proficiency in \nEnglish, our common language, and an understanding of our history and \nvalues, immigrants will find it difficult to integrate themselves into \nour American society.\n  So my hope today is that Judge Chertoff does a magnificent job in his \nrole at preventing terrorism. My hope also is that he does a good job \nin keeping out of this country people who are not legally supposed to \nbe here. But equally important is Secretary Chertoff's role in \nwelcoming new citizens to this country, helping them learn our history, \nour common language--helping all of us remember those principles that \nunite us as one country. That is a part of the Department of Homeland \nSecurity. It is of increasing interest to Members of the Senate on both \nsides of the aisle, and I look forward to working with Judge Chertoff \nin this new role and I support his confirmation.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished \nSenator from Virginia and, from the minority's time, I will yield 10 \nminutes to the distinguished Senator from New York.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the Senator from Virginia \nis recognized.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I am privileged to be the new boy on \nSenator Collins's committee. My mission is to try to achieve the \nsmoothest working relationship between the Department of Defense, with \nwhich I have been privileged to work these 27 years in the Senate, and \nthe distinguished new department and the committee for homeland defense \nover which my colleague presides as able chairman together with Senator \nLieberman.\n  Just a word or two I want to speak on Judge Chertoff. I, frankly, had \nnot met him prior to the President's very wise selection of this able \nindividual. I rise today to urge my colleagues to give the strongest \nendorsement possible to this nominee.\n  I started my career as a young lawyer, a prosecutor, but my first job \nout of law school was law clerk to a Federal circuit court judge, the \nsame position that Judge Chertoff holds today. I recall all through law \nschool and the early part of, I guess about 8 or 10 years that I \npracticed law, lawyers always thought: Maybe someday I could be a \njudge, a Federal judge. The whole bar looks up to the judicial branch, \nas they should. It is the third branch of our magnificent Republic. \nWhen an individual is selected by a President and confirmed in the \nSenate, he or she then dons that black robe, and it is a lifetime \nappointment.\n  I was privileged to observe the life of a Federal judge. My judge was \nE. Barrett Prettyman, and I had the privilege of standing on this very \nfloor several years ago and recommending the Federal courthouse here in \nWashington be named for Judge Prettyman. I am always grateful to the \nSenate for its wisdom in accepting my recommendation. But I remember \nthat judge so well. He had the strongest influence on my life. I \naspired at one time to be a Federal judge, but I hastily tell my \ncolleagues I am not sure I ever would have been qualified, for various \nreasons.\n  But when you accept that appointment you take that oath of office for \nlife. That is why I, and I think most if not every one of my \ncolleagues, spend so much time working with our Presidents to find the \nbest qualified people to assume these important jobs in the Federal \njudiciary. But it is a lifetime appointment.\n  When I looked at Judge Chertoff in my office, we compared \nexperiences. He was a law clerk on the Supreme Court, so he had gone \nthrough some of the similar experiences that I had as a lawyer, and \nalso I was assistant U.S. attorney as was he. I said: You have to \nexplain to me why you gave up a lifetime appointment to a position in \nwhich you can control your hours and largely control your vacations and \nhave a magnificent family life and everything else to take on this \nenormous, uncertain challenge.\n  He looked me in the eye, and he said: In America, you have to step up \nand be counted when the President and the citizens of this Nation need \nyou. I give\n\n[[Page S1370]]\n\nup this position with great reluctance, but I accept the next position \nand I will give it everything I have ever been taught in terms of how \nto do something for this country.\n  That deeply touched me, Madam Chairman. I feel very confident that, \nwith the advice and consent of this august body, we will send forth an \nindividual eminently qualified to handle this position, and one who \nwill bring about the necessary security that this country deserves and \nneeds and expects.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York is recognized.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I also rise to speak in support of the \nnomination of Michael Chertoff.\n  Today we vote on one of the most important Cabinet positions in our \nGovernment, and that is Secretary of the Department of Homeland \nSecurity. New York, perhaps more than any other State in the Union, \nknows the need for a strong defense at home. Therefore, I take this \nvote very seriously. I have considered carefully Judge Michael \nChertoff's background. I have considered his experience, and I met with \nhim personally to express the needs and concerns of the citizens of New \nYork and my own concerns about what we have and have not been doing \nwhen it comes to homeland security.\n  After careful review and after hearing his commitment to work with me \nand other Members of this body, I intend to vote in favor of Judge \nChertoff's nomination for this vital post. It is clear, crystal clear, \nthat Judge Chertoff has the intelligence and the skill to run this \nbehemoth Department. There is no question about that. But what has \nreally been missing from the Government is an advocate for funds and \nfocus in homeland security that will protect New York and the rest of \nthe country. Judge Chertoff assured me he would fight within the \nadministration for resources that have been missing in homeland \nsecurity.\n  It is no secret that, while we have given all the money it takes to \nfight the war on terror overseas, we have shortchanged the domestic war \non terror at home. Program after program, which we all admit is \nnecessary to defend us at home, is shortchanged when it comes to \nfunding and focus.\n  The Department of Homeland Security was run by admirable people, but \ntheir constitution was such that when they went into the Oval Office, \nthey didn't make much of a fight for the things that were necessary.\n  I asked Judge Chertoff about that when I met him. I said: I am sure \nyou are not going to make a public fight, but are you privately, within \nthe confines of the Oval Office, going to demand the funds that this \nDepartment needs to make us secure? He told me he would.\n  There is no doubt Judge Chertoff has been blessed with a brilliant \nmind, and he has formidable experience as a prosecutor, as Chief of the \nJustice Department's Criminal Division, and more recently as an \nappellate judge. He now faces the toughest challenge of his thus far \nimpressive career. He will be called upon to lead and manage a \nDepartment of 170,000 employees, forged out of 22 separate Government \nagencies, still not all working together. That is no small task.\n  Judge Chertoff will have to be smart, tough, dedicated, and savvy--\nbut a keen mind and a strong work ethic will not be enough. As I have \nsaid, what has been missing from homeland security has been funds and \nfocus. A color-coded warning system can have all the colors in the \nrainbow, but without adequate funding for vital programs and without a \nlaser-like focus, we are not serving the people well. Judge Chertoff \nassured me he would fight hard for the funds and maintain a strong \nfocus to maintain these programs at the Department if confirmed. If my \nreading of his character and personality is correct, he will make those \nfights inside the administration that have been lacking thus far.\n  Judge Chertoff, of course, will also have to commit himself to \nworking with Members of Congress in a bipartisan way, so together we \ncan best protect the homeland.\n  Unfortunately, as I said in the past, sometimes this administration \nhas acted with too much secrecy and too often it has failed to consult \nCongress. Too often it behaved as if it has a monopoly on wisdom. I am \noptimistic that Judge Chertoff will, as he has assured me, work with us \nin a bipartisan way. I have also talked to him about the need for \nchanging the funding formula so funds are not distributed simply as if \nthey were dropped from an airplane, but go to the places of the \ngreatest need.\n\n  I have told him it is unconscionable Wyoming gets more on a per-\ncapita basis for homeland security than New York. He has told me that \nwe have a real problem with the funding formula; he knows it has to be \nchanged and he would work to change it.\n  I have also raised with Judge Chertoff the serious problems of \nstaffing we have at the northern border with Canada. New York, of \ncourse, has a 300-mile such border. As of last year, we were short more \nthan 1,400 Customs and Border Protection officers on that border. Judge \nChertoff promised to make securing the northern border a priority, \nshould he be confirmed by the Senate.\n  I also pressed Judge Chertoff on other matters, areas in which the \nGovernment should do more to protect the homeland. I discussed with him \nthe creation of an assistant secretary for cybersecurity, something I \nhave raised before, given reports of the mounting attacks on our \ncomputer systems. On these and on other matters, Judge Chertoff has \nshown a willingness to deliberate and be openminded and that means a \nlot in my book.\n  In conclusion, the task of the next Secretary will be difficult. The \nstakes couldn't be higher. Based on his record of achievement and my \npersonal meetings with him, I have high hopes for Judge Chertoff. I \nhope and pray he lives up to those high hopes. I will vote yes on the \nnomination of Michael Chertoff as Secretary of the Department of \nHomeland Security.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from New York for \nhis excellent statement.\n  I see a very valuable member of the committee, the Senator from \nHawaii, is here to speak. I am prepared to yield to him 10 minutes from \nthe minority side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the nomination of \nJudge Michael Chertoff to be Secretary of the Department of Homeland \nSecurity, DHS.\n  Since the inception of DHS in 2003, Secretary Tom Ridge has led the \ndepartment with strength and grace. His tenure sets a high standard for \nfuture secretaries to meet. I would like to take this opportunity to \nthank Secretary Ridge for his hard work and dedication to his country.\n  As a member of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs \nCommittee, I was able to discuss with Judge Chertoff his positions on \nissues such as the DHS personnel regulations, civil liberties, and \nbioterrorism. Judge Chertoff expressed his commitment to these issues \nand promised he would investigate and report back to the committee on a \nnumber of DHS policies of concern to me.\n  There were five main points that I raised with Judge Chertoff. First, \nI asked for his assurance that he will defend the Constitution to \nsafeguard our civil liberties. The price of security should never erode \nour constitutional freedoms, which are essential to the preservation of \nthis democracy. One specific activity I have concerns about is data \nmining, which could involve the collection of personal data that could \nviolate an individual's privacy rights. Judge Chertoff affirmed his \ncommitment to liberty and privacy, and I will continue to monitor DHS \nclosely to ensure that he fulfills that commitment.\n  We also discussed the just-released personnel regulations covering \nthe 180,000 men and women who staff DHS. To make these new regulations \nwork, there must be significant and meaningful outreach to this \ndedicated workforce, their unions, and their managers. A well-managed \norganization values employee input and understands the important role \nemployees play in protecting against mismanagement. To undermine \nopportunities for employees to voice concerns or even have notice of \ndepartmental changes unnecessarily harms workers.\n  My third concern is the protection of whistleblower rights in the \ndepartment. Whistleblowers alert Congress\n\n[[Page S1371]]\n\nand the public to threats to health, waste of taxpayer money, and other \ninformation vital to running an effective and efficient government. I \nasked Judge Chertoff to pledge to protect whistleblowers and foster an \nopen work environment that promotes the disclosure of Government \nmismanagement and Government illegality. In response, he promised ``to \nsupport whistleblowers and to support candid assessments by employees \nwhen there are problems in the department.'' I am pleased he \nacknowledges the importance of whistleblowers to a Federal agency and \nhas vowed to protect their rights. As ranking member of the \nSubcommittee on Oversight of Government Management, the Federal \nWorkforce, and the District of Columbia, and the author of \nwhistleblower protection legislation, I will be monitoring the \ndepartment closely to ensure that Judge Chertoff follows through on \nthis promise.\n  The fourth issue on which I asked for Judge Chertoff's commitment was \nbioterrorism and, more specifically, agriculture security. Since 2001, \nI have urged the administration to develop a coordinated response to \nbioterrorism and agroterrorism through legislation, which is critical \nto the health and safety of Americans.\n  Yesterday, I had the opportunity to participate in a gaming exercise \ncalled ``Scarlet Shield'' at the National Defense University that \npostulated a bioterrorist attack. This exercise brought home to me the \nneed to do much more in ensuring an effective, coordinated response.\n  I will introduce shortly the Homeland Security Food and Agriculture \nAct of 2005, which will improve State, local, and tribal governments' \nability to respond to an attack on the food supply and facilitate DHS's \ncoordination with other Federal agencies with food and agriculture \nresponsibilities. Judge Chertoff agrees with me that bioterrorism is \none of the greatest threats our Nation currently faces, and as such I \nhope I can count on his support for my bill.\n  The final issue I discussed with the Judge is the security challenges \nfor my home State of Hawaii, 2,500 miles from the West Coast. Being the \nonly island State, Hawaii has been blessed with diverse and \nbreathtaking geography and a unique culture. However, its geographic \nlocation poses challenges to securing the State from asymmetric \nthreats. For example, when disaster strikes, Hawaii cannot call on \nneighboring States for assistance due to distance and time difference. \nOur eight inhabited islands must be self sufficient. For that reason, I \nhave established positive working relationships with Secretary Ridge \nand senior policymakers from DHS as well as from PACOM and NORTHCOM to \nensure that when national homeland security policies are being \nformulated, the needs of Hawaii are kept under consideration. Judge \nChertoff promised to be mindful of these unique needs and to continue \nthe positive relationship Hawaii has enjoyed with Secretary Ridge.\n  I also note I am pleased Judge Chertoff has stressed the importance \nof close cooperation with Congress, particularly the Homeland Security \nand Governmental Affairs Committee, and has promised to provide the \ninformation we need to fulfill our oversight responsibilities.\n  With Judge Chertoff's assurances that he will protect civil liberties \nand whistleblower rights, work openly with Congress, and prioritize the \nother issues I have detailed today, I will support his nomination to be \nthe Secretary of Homeland Security. I believe he has the \nprofessionalism and the commitment to serve the department well, and I \nhope we, in the Congress, will enjoy a long and productive relationship \nwith him.\n  Thank you very much, Madam Chairman.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Hawaii for his \nexcellent statement. He is a very valuable member of the committee, and \nI very much enjoy working with him.\n  I rise again today in support of the nomination of Judge Michael \nChertoff to be the new Secretary of Homeland Security. As the Presiding \nOfficer knows better than most, this is one of the most challenging and \ncritical jobs in the entire Federal Government. Judge Chertoff is \nclearly the right person to take the helm of this Department, and it is \npast time to put him in that post.\n  The Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs held a \nnomination hearing for Judge Chertoff on February 2. It was a long and \nthorough hearing. Judge Chertoff answered every question posed to him \nfully and candidly. His responses to more than 250 written questions my \ncommittee presented to him were just as forthright. His nomination was \nendorsed by a unanimous vote.\n  I mention this because there should be no impression among our \ncolleagues that our committee did not do a thorough job in questioning \nJudge Chertoff. To the contrary, he was subjected to hundreds of \nquestions. He responded to every question posed to him at our \ncommittee's lengthy nomination hearing. And every member of the \ncommittee, on both sides of the aisle, had ample opportunity to \nquestion Judge Chertoff on whatever issues they wished to raise with \nhim.\n  In fact, I am aware of no opposition to his nomination. Virtually the \nonly issue we have debated during the course of these proceedings is \none that I believe has no bearing whatsoever on Judge Chertoff's \nfitness to serve in this critical capacity. This issue is the demand, \nby a few of our colleagues, for information regarding the FBI's \npersonnel working at Guantanamo Bay's detention facility and what \ninformation they may have had about interrogation techniques used on \ndetainees by Department of Defense personnel.\n  Let me make clear that all of us have concerns about the proper and \nhumane treatment of our detainees. The distinguished chairman of the \nArmed Services Committee, who also serves on our committee, held a \nnumber of hearings to explore the treatment of detainees. It is my \nunderstanding that the Senate Intelligence Committee is also embarking \non an investigation of the treatment of detainees by CIA personnel. So \nthis is an issue. But the problem is, this is not an issue in which \nJudge Chertoff has been involved in setting policy. He is being asked \nfor information he simply does not have.\n  At our committee's nomination hearing, Judge Chertoff was asked about \nthese concerns by my distinguished colleague from Michigan, Senator \nLevin. Judge Chertoff's answer was unequivocal. Let me read it to you. \nHe said:\n\n       I was not aware during my tenure at the Department of \n     Justice that there were practices at Guantanamo, if there \n     were practices at Guantanamo, that would be torture or \n     anything even approaching torture.\n\n  He was not aware--not he did not recall not he was not sure; He was \nnot aware. That is unambiguous testimony.\n  Our responsibility as Senators to advise and consent on executive \nbranch nominees is a solemn one. It is one, as chairman of the \ncommittee, I take very seriously. If there were a good reason to delay \nconsideration of a nomination in order to secure important information, \nthen delay would be appropriate; it would be called for. But expecting \na nominee to provide information that he has sworn under oath he does \nnot know is not a good reason for delaying his nomination.\n\n  The questions about Judge Chertoff's knowledge of the treatment of \ndetainees have been asked and answered, repeatedly. They have been \nasked in prehearing questions. They have been asked at the hearing. And \nthey have been asked posthearing.\n  Judge Michael Chertoff is eminently qualified for this important \nposition. In his distinguished career, he has established a strong \nreputation as a tough prosecutor. But he has established a reputation \nas a fierce defender of civil liberties. His position on the balance \nbetween these two critical roles was made clear in his testimony before \nthe committee. He said:\n\n       I believe that we cannot live in liberty without security, \n     but we would not want to live in security without liberty.\n\n  I cannot think of a more eloquent statement by a nominee, showing \nus--demonstrating beyond a doubt--he clearly understands that as he \nincreases security for our Nation, he must be ever mindful of privacy \nrights, of civil liberties, of the very freedoms that define us as \nAmericans, and that we cherish. Indeed, we would be handing the \nterrorists a victory if we so\n\n[[Page S1372]]\n\ncompromised our freedoms in the name of security. Judge Chertoff \nunderstands that tension, that balance, the need for constant \nevaluation.\n  Judge Chertoff has also demonstrated a great ability to work with law \nenforcement agencies at all levels of Government. He has a keen \nunderstanding of the broad range of homeland security vulnerabilities \nfaced by States and communities throughout the country.\n  When I have talked to law enforcement officials from Maine to \nCalifornia about Judge Chertoff, they have unanimously and \nenthusiastically embraced his nomination. They know he will listen to \nState and local law enforcement, and that he views them as partners in \nour fight to tighten and improve our homeland security.\n  I point out that Judge Chertoff was confirmed three times previously \nby this body. He was confirmed overwhelmingly by both sides of the \naisle 2 years ago for one of the highest courts in the land. And now, \nhaving attained a lifelong appointment at the pinnacle of his legal \nprofession, he nevertheless is giving that up. He is giving up a \nlifetime appointment on one of the most prestigious courts in the \ncountry to step forward to serve our Nation in one of the most \ndifficult jobs imaginable, one of the most thankless jobs in the \nFederal Government.\n  I remind my colleagues of what he told our committee when I asked him \nwhy he was willing to give up that judgeship, why he was willing to \nmake that sacrifice. He said--and his words are eloquent--\n\n       September 11th and the challenge it posed was, at least to \n     my lights, the greatest challenge of my generation, and it \n     was one that touched me both personally and in my work at the \n     Department of Justice.\n       The call to serve in helping to protect America was the one \n     call I could not decline.\n\n  We are fortunate to have an individual of Michael Chertoff's quality, \nwith his commitment to public service, who is willing to answer the \ncall of his country. I hope he will be unanimously confirmed later this \nafternoon.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for up to 10 minutes and that this speech not \ninterrupt the debate on the Chertoff nomination.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I will withhold that request so that the \nSenator from New Jersey, who has just come to the Chamber, may speak on \nthe nomination. I yield him 10 minutes from the minority side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I thank the chairman of the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee for that courtesy. This is a task we are \npleased to take on. For me, it is a moment of special significance. We \nare proud of the fact that Judge Michael Chertoff, the nominee to be \nSecretary of Homeland Security, is from New Jersey. I hope we are going \nto see a strong vote for his confirmation.\n  I thank our chairman and leader in the Governmental Affairs Committee \nfor her persistence in moving some very important matters through that \ncommittee. She worked very hard at it. First it was the intelligence \nreform bill. While I was annoyed that I had to work Saturdays and other \ndays, the fact is, without the diligence shown by the Senator from \nMaine, we would not have gotten it through. We were on the edge of the \nprecipice when finally it passed, and I was enthusiastic to try to be \nof help there. So it is with this issue as well.\n  This is an important day for America. We all are concerned about the \nissue that haunts us constantly. Memories of 9/11 will never leave the \nminds of those who were alive or who study American history in the \nfuture. It was a terrible day for America. We live every day with the \nremnants of that reminder.\n  This morning, in the Commerce Committee on which I sit, we had a \ndiscussion on aviation safety and baggage security requirements. I came \ndown this morning from New Jersey and, because of some security \ninvolvements, was unable to catch two airplanes. But it had to be done. \nIt was not that I was particularly suspicious looking, but there was a \nline to get through, and that is what happens. So we are always \nreminded. Go into a building, popular places, and you cannot go into \nthose places, wherever they are, whether they are concerts or whether \nthey are educational forums, if it has any volume of attendance, you \nwill invariably see the security process at play. We are worried about \nour families and our society, how we function.\n\n  Judge Chertoff has been selected to be the next Secretary for \nHomeland Security. It is fair to say that Secretary Ridge did a good \njob in trying to amalgamate all these parts into an organization with \n180,000 people. It is an enormous task. Fortunately, the foresight to \nname someone such as Michael Chertoff to this post did present an \nunusual and appropriate candidate. He received undergraduate law \ndegrees with honor from Harvard University. After law school, he \nclerked on the Second Circuit Court of Appeals. Following that \nclerkship, he went on to serve as a clerk for a great New Jerseyan, \nSupreme Court Justice William J. Brennan.\n  In 1990, Michael Chertoff, in his meteoric rise to the top because of \nhis ability, became the U.S. attorney for the District of New Jersey. \nDuring that tenure, less than 4 years, he was so aggressive in tackling \norganized crime, public corruption, health care, and bank fraud, with \ngreat success in making the perpetrators of these crimes pay the price \nand get out of the community orbit so we could approach things \ncorrectly and honestly.\n  Michael Chertoff also played a critical role in helping the New \nJersey State legislature investigate racial profiling in our State. It \nwas a blight on our community. Driving while Black should not be a \ncrime, and we identified that very clearly. As a matter of fact, oddly \nenough, the present attorney general of the State of New Jersey, a \nfellow named Peter Harvey, distinguished attorney and outstanding \nmember of the Governor's cabinet, was stopped on one of our highways. \nHe had pulled into a restaurant parking lot, and a policeman came over \nand asked to check his license and to inspect his car for no reason \nother than the fact that he was Black. There was no other reason. He \nhad no suspicion surrounding his presence. Yet our attorney general, \nthen a lawyer, was stopped because of color. That should not be a \ncrime. Thanks in part to Judge Chertoff's efforts, the State \nlegislature passed a bill to ban racial profiling. That prompted me to \nintroduce the first bill in the U.S. Senate to address this issue. The \nresults have been excellent.\n  Judge Chertoff now serves on the prestigious U.S. Court of Appeals \nfor the Third Circuit. A good measure of his commitment to public \nservice, one he has been questioned about publicly in place after \nplace, including our committee, is the question as to why he would give \nup a lifetime tenure on the second highest court in the land to accept \na call to duty. We hope this tenure will be better, but it will have to \nbe earned every day of his career.\n  The mission of the Department of Homeland Security is critical to our \ncountry and to my State of New Jersey. On September 11, 2001, 700 of \nthe almost 3,000 people who perished that day came from the State of \nNew Jersey. There is hardly anyone in our State who didn't know someone \nor some family member of someone who died that day in the World Trade \nCenter.\n  I was a commissioner of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey \nwhen I was elected to the Senate, and those Trade Center buildings were \nkind of a business home for me.\n  From the location where I live now, I could see the silhouette and \nthe trade centers always as a landmark. It was a pleasure to get up in \nthe morning and see the sun coming over the tops of those buildings. \nYes, when we saw what happened that day, smoke rising from the World \nTrade Center buildings, as each one collapsed in a crush of flames and \ndebris, that can never be forgotten. The New York/New Jersey region \nbore the brunt of those attacks on that terrible day.\n\n[[Page S1373]]\n\n  It continues to be identified, by the way, by the FBI as the most at-\nrisk area for terrorist attack. The 2 miles that go from Newark Liberty \nAirport to the New York/New Jersey harbor are said by the FBI to be the \nmost inviting targets for terrorists. Judge Chertoff understands this. \nWhen Senator Corzine and I talked with Michael Chertoff, we didn't have \nto remind him about what that area looks like, what that stretch of \nland is like that could be so inviting to terrorists. I am confident \nJudge Chertoff will work to target homeland security grants to areas \nwhere the actual risk and threat of terrorism are the greatest.\n  This is not just about New York and New Jersey. There are many high-\nrisk States--some are colored red in the political description that we \nuse today, and some are blue. Examples: Texas, Florida, California, \nGeorgia, Illinois, Virginia--the list goes on of States where there are \ninviting targets for terrorists. These high-risk States are not getting \nenough funding because, under current law, 40 percent of all homeland \nsecurity grants--over $1 billion each year--is given to each and every \nState regardless of risk and threat. That doesn't make sense.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coleman). The Senator has used his 10 \nminutes.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \npermitted 5 more minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I will make clear that it is coming from \nthe Democrats' time.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. We are glad to take that responsibility. I may ask \nfor a minute or two more.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for 5 more minutes.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, the 9/11 Commission report stated:\n\n       Homeland security assistance should be based strictly on an \n     assessment of risks and vulnerabilities. Federal homeland \n     security assistance should not remain a program for general \n     revenue sharing.\n\n  The 9/11 Commission correctly understood that homeland security is \ntoo important to be caught up in pork-barrel politics. That is why \nSenator Corzine and I introduced a bill last week, S. 308, requiring \nthat all homeland security grants for terrorism prevention and \npreparedness be based on relative risks, threats, and vulnerabilities. \nI hope my colleagues will see that that is in the national interest and \nsupport that legislation. I know Judge Chertoff understands that \nproblem. He is a highly intelligent, competent, and dedicated public \nservant who has compiled a number of impressive accomplishments in all \nthree branches of the Federal Government. I ask my colleagues to vote \nto confirm him.\n  I would like to add a word. Right now, we are talking about whether \nthe minority is obstructing progress on different issues--Social \nSecurity and other legislation that is before us that needs attention. \nHere is an example of where we can arrive at a consensus view with \ndispatch--get it done. We know Judge Chertoff is an excellent \ncandidate, but that is not to say there may not be a vote against him. \nThere were votes against the confirmation of Secretary Condoleezza \nRice. There was a difference of view. It was the same thing with Mr. \nGonzales. But it reflects the fact that the minority is represented. \nThere were many people from the Democratic side who voted for Secretary \nRice and for Attorney General Gonzales. But why is there a move \nunderway--I use this opportunity to say this--to undercut the voice of \nthe minority? It was said by our leader here that 48 million people \nvoted Democrat in the last Presidential election. Do we want to say \nthat those voices should not be heard? Never.\n\n  Mr. President, I know you and our chairperson, Senator Collins, were \nelected with good support from your constituents. Does that free you \nfrom representing the part of the constituency that didn't vote for \nyou? Not at all. We have to recognize that schemes that would deprive \nthe minority from registering their point of view are against the \nConstitution. It is against the fabric of our democratic society to say \nif you didn't vote for us, we are going to nail you; you are not going \nto have your view; you are obstructionists. That is not right. Here we \nhave a chance once again to express some bipartisanship by voting for \nan outstanding candidate to be the next Secretary of Homeland Security.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, We are here today discussing the \nnomination of Judge Michael Chertoff to be the next Secretary of the \nUnited States Department of Homeland Security.\n  Let me begin by thanking Secretary Ridge for all he did in leading \nthe department through its creation and start-up. It was a difficult \njob and the Nation owes him a debt of gratitude for tackling this \ndifficult task.\n  I opposed the creation of the Department of Homeland Security, in \npart, because I was concerned that by combining disparate areas of the \nFederal Government we could create more problems than benefits. Several \nrecent reports from the Government Accountability Office have shown \nthat this is a valid concern.\n  The next Secretary of the Homeland Security Department will need to \nfocus time and energy on ensuring that the various divisions within the \ndepartment become integrated. A separate and divided Department of \nHomeland Security cannot work to increase our national security. Our \nbest chance for preventing another terrorist attack relies on a \ncoordinated and well run agency. If this does not occur, I fear that my \noriginal concern regarding the creation of this entity will be \nrealized.\n  Judge Chertoff has an impressive resume and, in fact, has already \nbeen confirmed by the Senate for several positions. His experience \nincludes serving as a Federal appellate court judge, United States \nAttorney, and head of the Criminal Division at the United States \nDepartment of Justice. However, questions have been raised about the \npotential involvement of Judge Chertoff in the prison abuse scandals, \nan issue that was pivotal in my opposition to Judge Gonzales being \nconfirmed as the United States Attorney General.\n  Senators Levin and Lieberman have been working to determine whether \nJudge Chertoff had any knowledge about the scandal, and they deserve \nour profound thanks. However, as in too many cases, this administration \nhas made a decision to keep much of the information from the public. \nThe citizens of the United States deserve honesty and openness from the \ngovernment.\n  The information that has been revealed shows that Judge Chertoff had \nno knowledge or involvement in the torture scandal. I must make a \ndecision based on the record I have in front of me, not on the \npossibility of the record I do not know. Reviewing this record leads me \nto believe that Judge Chertoff would be capable of performing the \nduties of Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, and I will \nthus support his confirmation to that position.\n  It is my hope that Judge Chertoff will complete the work that \nSecretary Ridge began and create an integrated Department of Homeland \nSecurity. I also hope that Judge Chertoff will be able to lead by \nexample and create the open environment at the Department of Homeland \nSecurity that my constituents and the citizens of this Nation deserve \nand expect.\n  It will take many hours of hard work and it will not be easy. I wish \nhim the best of luck in accomplishing the task.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, today I rise in strong support of the \nnomination of Judge Michael Chertoff to become Secretary of Homeland \nSecurity.\n  Voting in favor of Judge Chertoff and commending him on his \nremarkable accomplishments is beginning to become a habit for us.\n  At the beginning of President Bush's first term, Judge Chertoff was \nnominated to become Assistant Attorney General for the Criminal \nDivision. To this position, he brought years of experience as a Federal \nprosecutor in New York and a highly successful term as the U.S. \nattorney for the District of NewJersey.\n  As a prosecutor, Judge Chertoff handled a wide variety of complex \ncrimes that included successfully prosecuting a RICO murder case \ninvolving the third-ranking member of the Genovese La Cosa Nostra \nFamily and others. The principal defendants were convicted of \nconspiring to murder John Gotti and murdering a mob associate. They \neach received 75 to 80 year prison terms.\n  He also successfully prosecuted the Mafia Commission Case, which \ncharged\n\n[[Page S1374]]\n\nthe bosses of all five New York La Cosa Nostra Families with operating \na national commission through a pattern of racketeering acts such as \nextortion, loan sharking, and the murders of a mafia boss and two \nassociates.\n  Upon his confirmation, Mr. Chertoff ran the Criminal Division of the \nDepartment of Justice during the trying days after September 11. As \nSenator Collins stated:\n\n     since 9/11, Judge Chertoff has established himself as a \n     leading expert on the legal and national security issues \n     surrounding the war on terror.\n\n  After this period, in which I worked closely with the Criminal \nDivision of the Justice Department to formulate the PATRIOT ACT, Judge \nChertoff was nominated to the third Circuit and was confirmed by a vote \nof 88 to 1.\n  As we all know, becoming a judge on the 3rd Circuit is a lifetime \nappointment and the culminating achievement of many outstanding legal \ncareers. Few leave the bench before retirement. However, Judge Chertoff \nis not a man who will shirk from his duty. His nation called and asked \nhim to sacrifice. He answered that call and stood up to be counted \nduring a period of war.\n  This is true not only for the time that he spent affiliated with the \nJustice Department but in his everyday practice. For example, Judge \nChertoff served as special counsel to the New Jersey Senate Judiciary \nCommittee in its investigation of racial profiling.\n  Under his counsel, the committee held nine hearings examining racial \nprofiling allegations, concluding that the former attorney general had \nmisled the committee and had attempted to cover up the extent of racial \nprofiling in New Jersey from the U.S. Department of Justice.\n  After a convicted rapist was mistakenly released from prison, Mr. \nChertoff again served as special counsel for the New Jersey Senate \nJudiciary Committee during its hearings into the application of Megan's \nLaw, which requires State correction officials to notify prosecutors 90 \ndays prior to the release of a sex offender, and the reasons why it was \nnot being systematically employed by the State.\n  Mr. Chertoff also represented three indigent defendants on death row \nin Arkansas through a program operated by the NAACP Legal Defense Fund. \nThe death sentences of all three defendants were overturned on the \nappeal that he handled.\n  I understand that Judge Chertoff received the unanimous approval of \nthe Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, with one \nmember voting ``present.'' I believe that this is not only a reflection \non the judge's credentials but a realization that securing the homeland \nis not a partisan issue, but a commitment by the Government to its \npeople that we will find the best leaders to defend our Nation. Judge \nChertoff time and time again has set the standard by which others will \nhave to follow.\n  Mr. President, it has been my privilege to know Judge Chertoff for a \nnumber of years and I can honestly say that the President has made an \ninspired decision in this nomination.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the nomination of \nJudge Michael Chertoff to be our Nation's second Homeland Security \nSecretary.\n  Our next Homeland Security chief will face a number of urgent \nchallenges. I believe the most pressing of those will be better \ncoordinating our Federal, State and local homeland security personnel.\n  When I was Colorado's attorney general, I started a new effort to \nbring district attorneys, police departments and sheriffs together to \nfoster interagency cooperation. That was tough, but it allowed us to \ncoordinate and fund better law enforcement training, and better \nprosecute gang violence, fight senior financial fraud, establish school \nhotlines and many other vital efforts to fight crime that knows no \njurisdictional boundaries.\n  The challenge for DHS is, of course, even larger.\n  Unfortunately, 3 years after 9/11 there is a huge gap between \nWashington and our first responders on the ground. In his fiscal year \n2006 budget, the President proposed consolidating and reducing funding \nfor State and local heroes.\n  At a time when our law enforcement agencies are being asked to do \nmore with less, the President apparently believes they should have even \nless. The President's budget for next year eliminates funding for new \nhires under the COPS grants, which have helped to put 1,289 additional \nofficers on the streets in Colorado. The President's budget also calls \nfor a 24 percent cut in homeland security grants to States and a \ncomplete elimination of grants to rural fire fighters.\n  At the same time, the Homeland Security grant money that is available \nis not flowing effectively to State and local agencies. Police, fire \nand emergency medical departments are not getting the help they need. \nWorse yet, critical anti-terrorism intelligence is not getting to the \nlaw enforcement personnel on the ground who can act on it.\n  I met with Mike Chertoff and he promised me that he would work to \nbetter coordinate Federal, State and local agencies. I appreciated his \ncandor in our meeting, but I am very disappointed to see his \nunwillingness to respond to a series of very straightforward questions \nposed by Senators Levin and Lieberman.\n  Here is why this matters: we need a straight-shooting and straight-\ntalking person in this job. Judge Chertoff will face the awesome task \nof wrangling the 180,000 employees and 22 agencies that form the \nDepartment of Homeland Security. Secretary Tom Ridge started the \nprocess of cutting the bureaucratic red tape and integrating the \ndepartment. DHS took a number of steps, including establishing an \nOperational Integration Staff, but a great deal is still left to do.\n  Judge Chertoff has experience moving unwieldy bureaucracy in times of \ncrisis. As Assistant Attorney General of the Criminal Division of the \nDepartment of Justice from 2001-2003, Chertoff shared information and \ncoordinated antiterrorism efforts not only across DOJ, but also with \nDHS and foreign law enforcement. Chertoff also pushed resources to the \nfield where they were needed most.\n  Chertoff was essentially the Nation's attorney as it prosecuted the \nwar on terrorism. I know a little about this. As Colorado's former top \nattorney, I can tell my colleagues that one needs a good lawyer to \nfight crime and prevent terror.\n  Chertoff will also have to balance the need to fight terrorism with \nthe need to preserve our freedom.\n  This is a difficult balance to achieve. In the last few years, we \nhave faced some difficult choices. The administration has detained \nterrorism suspects for long periods without access to an attorney. They \nhave tried to use military tribunals instead of civilian courts. And \nworst of all, the administration's uneven record on adherence to the \nGeneva Convention and on the use of torture is an affront to our \nAmerican ideals.\n  Chertoff has expressed his belief that torture is wrong. He expressed \nhis philosophy during his confirmation hearing: ``We cannot live in \nliberty without security, but we would not want to live in security \nwithout liberty.''\n  Judge Chertoff has said all the right things about preserving civil \nliberties. But we will face numerous threats to our security over the \nnext 4 years, and we will be faced with even tougher choices. It is my \nsincere hope that Chertoff will do a better job than his predecessors \nhave done in allowing us to live with both security and liberty.\n  What strikes me most about Mike Chertoff is his commitment to public \nservice. Two years ago, Chertoff was confirmed for a lifetime \nappointment to the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. Chertoff could \neasily have kept that seat forever, but he stepped down from that \nsecure job to face another political gauntlet. In short, when duty \ncalled, Judge Chertoff answered.\n  You could not ask for a tougher job in Washington than Homeland \nSecurity Secretary. I am hopeful Judge Chertoff is the right person for \nthe job.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of the \nconfirmation of Michael Chertoff to be Secretary of Homeland Security. \nHe is an extraordinary professional and a remarkably talented lawyer. \nHe is highly intelligent, honorable, and impartial. He is also a \nstraight shooter, which is exactly what we need right now in this \nposition. He is also a personal friend.\n  Mr. Chertoff has impeccable credentials--not the least of which is \nbeing a native New Jerseyan. He attended Harvard College and Harvard \nLaw School,\n\n[[Page S1375]]\n\nwhere he was editor of the Harvard Law Review. He then served as a \nSupreme Court law clerk. In private practice and public service, he \ndeveloped a reputation as a brilliant, tough, fair, and truly world \nclass litigator, and earned the respect of his peers and adversaries. \nIndeed, one New Jersey paper has even suggested he might be New \nJersey's ``Lawyer Laureate.''\n  In recent years, Judge Chertoff has served as Assistant Attorney \nGeneral for the Criminal Division and circuit judge for the Third \nCircuit. In each of these capacities and throughout his career, he has \nserved our Nation exceptionally well. So when Judge Chertoff told me \nrecently that this position, as Secretary of Homeland Security, is the \nmost important task he has ever undertaken in his public career, I took \nnotice. Given his commitment to public service and the distinguished \nresults of his remarkable career, this statement speaks for itself.\n  I wish to emphasize one particular aspect of Judge Chertoff's career: \nhis role in helping the New Jersey State legislature investigate racial \nprofiling. As special counsel to the State senate Judiciary Committee, \nhe led the committee probe into how top State officials handled racial \nprofiling by the State Police. His work was bipartisan, objective, \nbalanced, and thoroughly professional, and helped expose the fact that \nfor too long, State authorities were aware that statistics showed \nminority motorists were being treated unequally by some law enforcement \nofficials, and yet ignored the problem. This landmark racial profiling \ninvestigation demonstrated Judge Chertoff's ability to balance the \nState's responsibility to provide for the public safety with protecting \nour citizens' civil liberties.\n  Judge Chertoff is uniquely positioned to undertake the enormous \nchallenges that come with the position of Secretary of Homeland \nSecurity. Particularly important to the citizens of New Jersey is his \nunderstanding of the critical importance of allocating our homeland \nsecurity resources to those areas of the country where the risks and \nvulnerabilities are greatest.\n  New Jersey is on the front lines of terrorism. We lost 700 people on \nSeptember 11, 2001. Two of the 9/11 terrorists were based in New \nJersey, and the anthrax that hit this institution originated in New \nJersey. The Post Office in Hamilton, NJ, where the anthrax was sent, \nhas taken years to clean up and will finally reopen next week. The \ncosts are expected to be $72 million for decontamination and $27 \nmillion for the refurbishment of the facility.\n  Newark Liberty Airport, and Port Newark, and the Ports of \nPhiladelphia and Camden are critical vulnerabilities. New Jersey is \nhome to rail lines, bridges, and tunnels to New York City, as well as \nchemical plants and nuclear facilities. Atlantic City has the second \nhighest concentration of casinos in the country, and between tourists \nand those who work there, is visited by as many as 300,000 people.\n  Wall Street and other financial services firms house important front \nand back office operations, including clearance and settlement \nservices, and other operations essential to the functioning of \nAmerica's capital markets in Newark, Jersey City, and Hoboken. And, \nlast summer, Newark was one of three locations including New York City \nand Washington, DC--that was put on Orange Alert for a possible \nterrorist attack as intelligence suggested that the Prudential building \nin downtown Newark could be a target.\n  Yet despite these growing threats to New Jersey from anthrax to the \nOrange Alert, and the ever-expanding costs associated with protecting \nthe most densely populated State in the country--remarkably homeland \nsecurity grants to New Jersey were cut in 2005.\n  Funding was reduced from $93 million in 2004 to $61 million in 2005. \nNewark will see a 17-percent reduction in funds, from $14.9 million to \n$12.4 million. And, incredibly, Jersey City's homeland security funds \nwill drop by 60 percent, from $17 million in 2004 to $6.7 million in \n2005.\n  These cuts leave New Jersey home of countless companies and people \nwho keep our economic engine moving; home of one of the most active and \nexposed ports in the country; home of one of the busiest airports in \nAmerica; home of our Nation's new Homeland Security Secretary--36th in \nthe Nation in per capita homeland security funding.\n  I was pleased that the President's budget called for an allocation of \nhomeland security funding based on risk and vulnerability. This \ncommonsense approach mirrors the recommendations of the 9/11 \nCommission.\n  Senator Frank Lautenberg and I have introduced legislation that would \nrequire that homeland security funding be allocated along these lines. \nThis bill grants the Department of Homeland Security the authority it \nneeds to keep us safe and will allow Michael Chertoff to be an \noutstanding Secretary of Homeland Security.\n  Judge Chertoff also understands the critical importance of protecting \nour chemical facilities. Only a week ago, the former Deputy Homeland \nSecurity Advisor to the President testified to this committee that \nindustrial chemicals are ``acutely vulnerable and almost uniquely \ndangerous,'' presenting a ``mass-casualty terrorist potential rivaled \nonly by improvised nuclear devices, certain acts of bioterrorism, and \nthe collapse of large, occupied buildings.'' He added that chemical \nplant security ``should be the highest critical infrastructure \nprotection priority for the Department of Homeland Security in the next \ntwo years.''\n  There are other critical issues that the nominee will face and that I \nam confident he is prepared to take on. Our rail lines are woefully \nunprotected and recent accidents have demonstrated the risk that rail \ntransport of toxic chemicals could be attacked by terrorists. There is \nimportant work remaining at TSA, where airport screening is far from \ncomplete and where too little attention has been paid to ground \ntransportation.\n  And the Department of Homeland Security has not yet adequately \nconfronted the vulnerabilities of our ports. The checklist is long and \nthe issues complex. And in my view, Judge Chertoff is the best person \nto address them.\n  One of the critical issues to be addressed by the new Secretary of \nHomeland Security will be civil liberties. I strongly believe that we \nas a nation can be both secure and free. Given Judge Chertoff's work on \nracial profiling in New Jersey, I am confident that he will pursue law \nenforcement strategies that are both effective and unbiased. His stated \ncommitment to respecting recent Supreme Court decisions on detainees \nassures me that he will always pursue terrorists within the context of \nour laws and treaty obligations. And his public as well as private \ncalls for a new approach to detainees is indicative of a thoughtful and \nopen-minded professional.\n  While I fully understand the concerns raised by my colleague from \nMichigan, I am disappointed that it delayed this confirmation vote. The \nCongress has an obligation to oversee how this administration is \ntreating detainees, in Guantanamo and around the world. Access to FBI \nmemoranda on this topic are critical to this oversight. But this \nparticular document has nothing to do with Judge Chertoff's \nqualifications for this critical position. Indeed, I have confidence \nthat Judge Chertoff--who has called for more open discussion on the \ntopic of detention--will work closely with Congress so that we can come \nto a full understanding of what has happened and where we go from here.\n  No one knows what the future may bring. The terrorist threat shifts, \nand we are constantly learning about new vulnerabilities. At this \ncritical moment, I believe that Judge Chertoff has the kind of \ncommitment, intellect, and imagination that we need as someone who is \nfocused on keeping us safe, as someone who understands that homeland \nsecurity means identifying the greatest risks and vulnerabilities and \nmaking them a priority, as someone who recognizes that, in protecting \nourselves, we cannot sacrifice our basic principles and values. Mr. \nPresident, I am confident that Michael Chertoff is that person.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the nomination \nof Judge Michael Chertoff to be the new Secretary for the Department of \nHomeland Security.\n  Make no mistake, I believe the challenges facing Judge Chertoff at \nthe 2-year-old Department are monumental. They include negotiating turf \nbattles with other powerful Cabinet Secretaries and ensuring that 22 \nformerly\n\n[[Page S1376]]\n\ndisparate Federal agencies, with a combined workforce of 180,000 \nemployees, work together under one central structure. In addition, \nJudge Chertoff will be responsible for protecting our Nation's critical \ninfrastructure and for improving information sharing among law \nenforcement agencies--without intruding unnecessarily on individual \nprivacy rights. It is a daunting assignment, but I believe Judge \nChertoff is up to it.\n  When Senator Obama and I met with Judge Chertoff last week, we \ndiscussed several issues of concern to us, and Judge Chertoff assured \nus that he will address these issues. Among my key concerns are the new \npersonnel rules for Department of Homeland Security employees. I \nbelieve the new rules are far too restrictive when it comes to \ncollective bargaining, pay negotiations, and adjudicating grievances. \nThe situation at DHS has become even more important since the Bush \nadministration announced its intention to give agencies across the \nFederal Government the option of creating similar human resource \npolicies. Judge Chertoff said he would sit down with the workers who \nwill be affected by the rules to listen to their concerns and \nsuggestions. It is important that he do so. As Judge Chertoff told \nSenator Obama and me:\n\n       It's important to have a happy and satisfied workforce. \n     This is not going to work if people in the department feel \n     like they're being wronged.\n\n  Another issue Judge Chertoff promised to look into is the effort to \nintegrate the separate fingerprint data bases maintained by the \nDepartment of Homeland Security and the FBI. Merging these two systems \ninto a single, integrated system is not simply a good idea, it is a \ncongressional mandate. Yet, a recent report by the Justice Department's \nInspector General concluded that the efforts to achieve a fully \nintegrated biometric fingerprint ID system have stalled. As one who has \npushed for such a system, I am deeply troubled by that assessment. More \nthan three 3 years after 9/11, it is unacceptable that this critical \nimprovement to our homeland security still had not been accomplished. \nJudge Chertoff said the American people ``would go ballistic if we \ncan't get things to mesh.'' He is right and the American people have \nevery right to be angry. This must get done. I take Judge Chertoff at \nhis word when he says he will make development of an integrated \nbiometric fingerprint ID system a priority.\n  Judge Chertoff also promised to look into another possible threat to \nour homeland security, and that is the apparent ease with which an \nordinary citizen can obtain an airline pilot's uniform. This threat was \ndocumented recently by a Chicago TV reporter. Astonishingly, the \nreporter found that he could purchase an authentic pilot's uniform \nonline--with no identification--and the uniform would be delivered to \nhis doorstep in 48 hours. How can this happen in a post-9/11 world? \nSenator Obama and I have asked the Senate Homeland Security and \nGovernmental Affairs Committee and the Transportation Security \nAdministration to answer that question. We will be looking for answers.\n  I look forward to working with Judge Chertoff on several issues of \nparticular importance to Illinois. Among them is a Microbial Risk \nAssessment Center, which has been proposed by the University of Chicago \nand would serve as the national clearinghouse to assess risks from \nanthrax, smallpox, plague, and other possible bioterror threats.\n  In addition, the city of Chicago has developed a state-of-the-art \ncommand center where personnel from the city's police, fire, and rescue \ndepartments and representatives of the city's business community work \ntogether in one room to monitor the city and, if necessary, respond \njointly to disasters. I believe this command center could serve as a \nnational model, and I encourage Judge Chertoff to examine its structure \nand successes.\n  My decision to support Judge Chertoff is the result of serious \ndeliberation. While I am impressed by his record and his openness, I \nalso have some concerns about the role Judge Chertoff played in \ndeveloping certain administration policies while he served as the head \nof the Justice Department's Criminal Division. In that capacity, Judge \nChertoff helped to craft high-profile initiatives that explicitly \ntargeted Arabs and Muslims and resulted in the detention of thousands \nof people. In the aftermath of the 9/11 terrorist attacks, the Justice \nDepartment rounded up at least 1,200 immigrants, the vast majority of \nwhom were Arab or Muslim. The Justice Department's Inspector General \nfound that none of these detainees--not one--was charged with a \nterrorist-related offense, and that the decision to detain them was \n``extremely attenuated'' from the 9/11 investigation. The Inspector \nGeneral also found that detainees were subjected to harsh conditions of \nconfinement and that some were subjected to ``a pattern of physical and \nverbal abuse.''\n  Judge Chertoff also was tangentially involved in the Justice \nDepartment's efforts to legalize abusive interrogation tactics. He \nreviewed the infamous Justice Department ``torture memo'' and provided \nadvice on complying with the antitorture statute, but he told me that \nhe did not provide advice on the legality of any specific interrogation \nmethods.\n  The Justice Department's ``torture memo'' narrowly and, I believe, \nincorrectly redefined torture as limited only to abuse that causes pain \nequivalent to organ failure or death, and concluded that the \nantitorture statute does not apply to interrogations conducted under \nthe President's so-called Commander in Chief authority.\n  This tortured effort to justify torture helped to create a permissive \nenvironment that made it more likely that abuses of detainees would \ntake place and made it possible for the horrors we have since learned \nabout at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba and the Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq. What \nhappened in these places, I believe, has damaged our image and called \ninto question our moral authority in some places and it has increased--\nnot diminished--the dangers our troops and our citizens face in this \nage of terrorism.\n  Unlike many other administration officials, however, Judge Chertoff \nhas acknowledged that the Government made mistakes in the aftermath of \n9/11. He told me that he opposes ethnic and religious profiling and he \nis committed to treating all immigrants fairly and to complying with \nall laws regarding the humane treatment of detainees.\n  I take him at his word. I will expect Judge Chertoff, as Secretary of \nHomeland Security, to balance America's need for security and our \nrespect for civil rights and our heritage as a nation of immigrants. \nThere are practical reasons, in addition to the legal reasons, for \nseeking such balance. Detaining large numbers of Arab and Muslim \nimmigrants involves a massive investment of law enforcement resources \nwith little no return, and it creates fear and resentment of law \nenforcement in exactly the immigrant communities whose cooperation we \nneed to defeat terrorism.\n  Finally, Judge Chertoff assured me that he will maintain open lines \nof communication with Congress so that Congress can fulfill its \nconstitutional requirement to oversee whether, and how well, the \nDepartment is implementing the laws this body passes.\n  For all of these reasons and because of his record of public service \nand his candor during this confirmation process, I will support Judge \nChertoff's nomination to be America's next Secretary of Homeland \nSecurity. I look forward to working with him to make America safer in \nways that are consistent with our national values and heritage, and I \nwish Judge Chertoff the best of luck as he begins his important new \nassignment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, this Senator from New Mexico has known \nMr. Chertoff for a long time. I have been familiar with him \nprofessionally, primarily when he was legal counsel for a committee on \nwhich I served. In that capacity, I got to know his professional \nqualities, his intellect, his care in interpreting both the law and \nfacts, and I am absolutely positive that he is going to make a superb \nhead for this very complicated Department of Homeland Security.\n  Mr. Chertoff is a lawyer by trade and a judge by promotion within the \nprofession of advocacy. Now, regardless of the profession or \nexperiences of the person nominated to this position, there might have \nbeen some who asked: Why not some other particular area of\n\n[[Page S1377]]\n\nexpertise? That could be asked in this case. But I am quite sure that \nwhen one looks at the myriad of problems addressed by and the kind of \nintellect, commitment, and most of all, integrity that Judge Chertoff \nhas, it is clear that he is going to do a superb job on behalf of our \ncountry and the safety of our homeland.\n  My compliments to the President for sending this nomination to the \ncommittee, headed by Senator Collins, that reported him out quickly, \nand to the Senate for overwhelmingly voting for him today. I salute \nJudge Chertoff and wish him the best. I hope he is able to handle this \njob with the same kind of excellence that he has handled all the other \njobs we have given him.\n  He has plenty of help, which he will need. This is not a job he can \ndo alone. It is a very big agency, and I hope everybody who works there \nwill be part of his team as he works to make Homeland Security operate \nin a way that is efficient and good for our country and for our people.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, when the time comes I intend to vote in \nfavor of Judge Chertoff's nomination to be Secretary of Homeland \nSecurity. There is no position in government of greater importance to \nthe security of our country and of my home State of New York. And so I \nam glad that the Senate has agreed to devote some time to a discussion \nof the important issues that the next Secretary of Homeland Security \nwill face.\n  Let me say at the outset that I have some serious concerns about this \nnomination. These concerns have nothing to do with Judge Chertoff's \npersonal abilities: his professional and intellectual qualifications \nare beyond question, as is his commitment to public service. Rather, my \nconcerns are based on the misguided and constitutionally infirm \npolicies that have been drafted by the Department of Justice and \nimplemented by the Administration in its prosecution of the war on \nterror and in the conflicts in Afghanistan and Iraq. Judge Chertoff was \na senior DOJ official at the time that these policies were created. \nBecause he is being nominated to a position for which respect for \nConstitutional and treaty obligations is especially important, his role \nin the formation of these policies is therefore worthy of careful \nscrutiny.\n  My primary concern relates to those policies that have undercut and \nplaced our men and women in uniform in greater danger and diminished \nour standing in the international community. I feel a particular \npersonal obligation as a member of the Armed Services Committee to do \nmy utmost to ensure that our government does not do anything that \nunnecessarily puts our troops in harm's way, that diminishes our \nstanding among our allies, or that blurs the values that distinguish us \nfrom our depraved and nihilistic enemies.\n  The August 1, 2002 memo from the Department of Justice's Office of \nLegal Counsel, with its absurdly narrow definition of torture, is the \nmost shocking and well-known example of the administration's attempt to \nradically weaken this country's commitment to treat all prisoners and \ndetainees humanely and in accordance with international agreements. \nAnother oft-cited example is Attorney General Gonzales' January 2002 \nadvice to President Bush that the ``war on terrorism'' offers a ``new \nparadigm [that] renders obsolete'' the Geneva Convention's protections.\n  I am satisfied by Judge Chertoff's testimony that, as Assistant \nAttorney General for the Criminal Division, he did not provide legal \nadvice that strayed below the standard that is expected from senior \nmembers of the Justice Department. He testified that executive branch \nofficials sought his views on the practical application of laws \nprohibiting torture and on specific techniques. And he testified that \ntorture is illegal and wrong and that he does not believe that the \ndefinition of torture in the August 1, 2002 OLC memo is broad enough. \nHe testified that he told executive branch officials to ``be sure that \nyou have good faith and you've operated diligently to make sure what \nyou are considering doing is well within the law.'' Regarding specific \ntechniques, Judge Chertoff testified that, ``I was not prepared to say \nto people, to approve things in advance, or to give people speculative \nopinions that they might later take as some kind of a license to do \nsomething.''\n  These responses suggest that Judge Chertoff appreciates the \nimportance of upholding America's long tradition of treating prisoners \nhumanely, and of respecting international agreements that protect our \nmen and women in uniform as well as our standing in the international \ncommunity. While I would have preferred that Judge Chertoff had argued \nhis point to the administration more forcefully, I am satisfied that he \ndid not actively promote these wrongheaded, immoral, and \ncounterproductive policies.\n  Another important concern arises from the Justice Department's \ntreatment of more than 750 aliens detained immediately following the \nattacks of September 11. The department's own inspector general \nreleased a report in 2003 that acknowledged the ``difficult \ncircumstances'' in which the department found itself, but concluded \nthere were ``significant problems in the way that the September 11 \ndetainees were treated.'' Among those problems were significant delays \nin the FBI's clearance process, hindrances in access to legal counsel, \nand verbal and physical abuse of detainees. The report specifically \nfinds that the Justice Department, including Judge Chertoff, was aware \nof the FBI's clearance problems at the time. In fact, Judge Chertoff \ntestified that he inquired with the FBI about the clearance delays, but \nthe FBI's resources were ``stretched.'' The inspector general found \nthat the Justice Department should have done more once it learned of \nthe detainee-related problems.\n\n  When asked about this report at his confirmation hearing, Judge \nChertoff acknowledged that there were ``imperfections'' in the \nexecutive branch's response. He testified that he was unaware at the \ntime of the hindrances in detainees' access to counsel, that he was \nunaware of the verbal and physical abuse, and that such mistreatment is \ninappropriate and should not have happened. He also stated the \nimportance of learning from experience.\n  I am disappointed that Judge Chertoff did not express greater regret \nfor the department's role in the mistreatment of detainees, and that he \ndid not testify in detail as to the status of the implementation of the \ninspector general's recommended 21 reforms. Nonetheless, his responses \nto this line of questioning are not, in my view, sufficient to oppose \nhis nomination. I hope that Judge Chertoff will bring to bear the \nlessons we have learned from this experience and work to ensure \nappropriate reforms are successfully carried out.\n  After careful consideration, I am satisfied by Judge Chertoff's \nanswers to the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs \nCommittee regarding his conduct at the Justice Department. Despite the \negregious missteps the department made during his tenure, I do not \nbelieve that his performance there disqualifies him from serving as the \nnext Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security. And in view of \nhis testimony and of his exceptional record during his short time on \nthe Federal bench, I believe that Judge Chertoff understands that the \nnext Secretary of Homeland Security must be both unflagging in his \nefforts to protect us from terrorist attack and steadfast in his \nrespect for our Constitutional order.\n  I also believe that Judge Chertoff has a good understanding of the \nissues and challenges facing the Department of Homeland Security. \nPerhaps the biggest challenge awaiting him is the taming of the \nenormous bureaucratic tangle that is the current department. If \nconfirmed, Judge Chertoff will become the head of a department that was \ncreated via the integration of 22 separate agencies and 180,000 \nemployees. These agencies and employees engage in a wide range of \nactivities related to securing the homeland, and they need a steady and \nfirm hand on the tiller. They also need a creative leader who can cut \nthrough bureaucratic entanglement and get things done. As Secretary, \nJudge Chertoff's central task will be setting priorities and getting a \nvast bureaucracy to work efficiently and in a unified fashion.\n  I am hopeful Judge Chertoff's well-documented intellectual abilities \nand his long experience as a public servant will serve him well as he \nmoves from the role of Federal judge to the head of such a large and \ndemanding Department. He pledged at his confirmation\n\n[[Page S1378]]\n\nhearing to work ``tirelessly'' to safeguard the nation. I hope he \nfollows through on that pledge in a variety of areas of critical \nimportance. He will need to devote substantial energy and political \ncapital if he is to help this still nascent Department develop to its \nfull potential and render all Americans as safe and as secure in their \nliberties as possible.\n  I am encouraged that Judge Chertoff and I agree on a number of \nspecific challenges facing the Department of Homeland Security. One of \nthese issues--Federal funding formulas for state and local \npreparedness--is essential to protecting the homeland. I have \nrepeatedly called upon the administration and my colleagues to \nimplement threat-based homeland security funding, so that homeland \nsecurity resources go to the states and areas where they are needed \nmost. I have introduced legislation in this regard and even developed a \nspecific homeland security formula for administration officials to \nconsider.\n  The latest iteration of that proposal is contained in my Domestic \nDefense Fund Act of 2005, which I introduced on the first legislative \nday of this Congress. Modeled on the Community Development Block Grant \nprogram, the Domestic Defense Fund of 2005 provides $7 billion in \nannual funding to local communities, States, and first responders. The \nact requires that all of that funding be allocated using threat, risk, \nand vulnerability-based criteria that homeland security experts--\nincluding the Homeland Security Independent Task Force of the Council \non Foreign Relations, chaired by former Senators Gary Hart and Warren \nRudman, and the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the \nUnited States--have long recommended.\n  I was heartened to hear Judge Chertoff testify at his confirmation \nhearing, that ``I think we have to have a formula for funding and a \nformula for lending assistance to State and local governments across \nthe board that takes account of the reality of vulnerabilities and \nrisks and making sure that we're making a fair allocation.'' Judge \nChertoff also stated this view when I met with him. His unequivocal \nsupport for threat- and vulnerability-based funding is important for \nNew York, and for the nation.\n\n  Another issue on which Judge Chertoff and I agree is the need for \ngreater sharing of terrorist-related information between and among \nFederal, State, and local government agencies. In the immediate \naftermath of the 9/11 terrorist attacks, I worked with a number of my \ncolleagues in the Senate on a bi-partisan basis in focusing on this \nneed. As I noted in my remarks on the passage of the Intelligence \nReform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004, the sharing of critical \nintelligence information is vitally important if we are to win the War \nagainst terrorism. We need to ensure that our front line solders in the \nwar against terrorism here at home--our local communities and our first \nresponders--are as informed as possible about any possible threat so \nthat they can do the best job possible to protect all Americans. It is \nvital for New York City and other local communities across New York \nState and the Nation to receive accurate and timely information from \nthe department when a potential threat emerges. It is equally important \nthat local communities on the front lines serve as valuable sources of \ninformation for the Federal Government.\n  I was pleased to learn that Judge Chertoff testified at his \nconfirmation hearing that his personal experiences as an Assistant \nUnited States Attorney, a United States Attorney and as head of the \nCriminal Division on September 11, give him a thorough appreciation and \nrespect for State and local perspectives. In his testimony, he \ndescribed ``negotiating cooperation with our state and local government \nofficials'' as one of ``the central elements of the war against \nterrorism. . . .'' He repeatedly referred to the need to work in \npartnership with State and local government.\n  I could not agree more. The Federal Government cannot, and should \nnot, go it alone when it comes to securing the homeland. States and \nlocal communities must be full partners. Much more needs to be done, \nbut Judge Chertoff's testimony demonstrates that he understands the \nimportance of this area as a key to homeland security.\n  I also find it encouraging that Judge Chertoff testified that he is \n``acutely aware'' of the importance of allocating resources to secure \nour ports. Needless to say, having a secretary of homeland security who \nunderstands the importance of the Port of New York and New Jersey is \nlikely to be a good thing for New Yorkers, and for the entire country.\n  There has been little evidence to date that administration is \ninterested in using a threat-based formula for allocating resources. \nIndeed, in Fiscal Year 2004, when the Administration had the \nopportunity to employ such a formula in allocating funds under the \nState Homeland Security Grant Program, SHGP, and the Law Enforcement \nTerrorism Prevention, LETP, grant program, it affirmatively chose not \nto do so, despite pleas from me and many members of Congress on both \nsides of the aisle. Again in Fiscal Year 2005, there was no significant \neffort on the part of the administration to use a threat-based formula.\n  I wrote President Bush imploring him to work with the House and \nSenate leadership on the issue of homeland security funding, but \nlanguage was inserted in the Fiscal Year 2005 Homeland Security \nAppropriations Act to require that SHGP and LETP funds be allocated in \nthat fiscal year as the administration chose to allocate funds in \nFiscal Year 2004, which, unfortunately, was on the basis of population \nalone. Every homeland security expert I know has said that this makes \nno sense. If the terrorists are looking at things such as the presence \nand vulnerability of critical infrastructures as well as population and \npopulation densities, so should we.\n  This year, the administration is again talking a good game on \nhomeland security grant formulas. The Fiscal Year 2006 budget request \ncalls for more than $1 billion in grants to States for the purpose of \nenhancing capabilities to prevent, deter, respond to and recover from \nacts of terrorism, to be allocated by the Secretary of Homeland \nSecurity ``based on risks, threats, vulnerabilities, and unmet \nessential capabilities,'' with a 0.25 percent State minimum. In \naddition, more than $1 billion would go for grants to urban areas, for \nthe same purpose, and on the same basis--minus, of course, a State \nminimum.\n  This is a step in the right direction, but we need to allocate much \nmore funding for this purpose. Whether through direct funding--which I \ncontinue to believe is the best way to disburse homeland security \nfunding to many communities--or funding that is sent to the states and \npassed through to local communities, the Federal Government should be \ndisbursing the homeland security state and local funds to communities \naccording to a threat- and vulnerability-based formula.\n  In addition, my Domestic Defense Fund Act makes it explicit that the \nfunding provided for in my proposed legislation will not supplant or be \nin lieu of funding for traditional first responders programs, such as \nthe Community Oriented Policing Services, COPS, program and the \nAssistance to Fire Fighters, FIRE, Act program. These Federal programs \nhave proven successful in helping first responders perform traditional \nfunctions, such as fighting crime and responding to fires.\n  Unfortunately, the Fiscal Year 2006 budget request seeks to cut or \neliminate a number of these essential first responder programs. Under \nthe President's proposed budget, funding for the COPS program is \nreduced from $379 million to $118 million nationally, which comes on \ntop of previous years' cuts for the COPS program, which once received \nmore than $1.5 billion in funding. And absolutely no funding is \nproposed for the COPS Universal Hiring Program, the COPS MORE program, \nCOPS in Schools program, or the COPS Interoperable Communications \nTechnology Program.\n  The Fiscal Year 2006 budget request also proposes no funding for the \nEdward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant program, named after a \nNew York City police officer killed in the line of duty, and the Local \nLaw Enforcement Block Grant program. These programs in the past have \nprovided states and local governments with Federal funds to support \nefforts to reduce crime and increase public safety, such\n\n[[Page S1379]]\n\nas enhancing security measures around schools, establishing or \nsupporting drug courts, and preventing violent and/or drug-related \ncrime.\n  I find that shameful, especially as our fire fighters, police \nofficers, emergency service workers and other first responders continue \nto be on the front lines of our nation's homeland defense. It is \nimperative that Judge Chertoff, if confirmed, stand by his philosophy \nof risk-based allocation and appreciation for the role of state and \nlocal partners when he prepares his department's budget in coming \nyears.\n  In fact, the outcome of a number of homeland security imperatives \nwill depend to a significant extent on Judge Chertoff's willingness to \nfight hard during the budget process. A good example of this is the \naddition of new border patrol agents mandated in the recently enacted \nIntelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004. If the goals \nof this legislation are realized, the security of the northern border \nwould be improved, a result I have worked for since 2001. Among many \nprovisions, the act calls for an increase of at least 10,000 border \npatrol agents from Fiscal Years 2006 through 2010, many of whom will be \ndedicated specifically to our northern border. And yet the FY06 budget \nrequest did not come close to seeking the 2,000 new border patrol \nagents authorized for this year. Judge Chertoff must be willing to \nfight hard for full funding of this and other programs essential to the \ndepartment's mission.\n  I appreciate that Judge Chertoff understands the critical importance \nof securing chemical facilities. There are hundreds of chemical plants \nin the United States where a terrorist attack could threaten more than \n100,000 Americans with exposure to toxic chemicals. This is a homeland \nsecurity vulnerability that has been recognized by many, yet we still \nhave no mandatory Federal standards for chemical plants, and the \nDepartment of Homeland Security lacks authority to put such standards \nin place. Until Congress provides the department with such authority, \nAmericans will continue to rely on voluntary security measures at \nchemical plants, which have been repeatedly shown to be lax.\n  I believe that the best solution to this problem would be to enact \nthe Chemical Security Act that I have sponsored with Senator Corzine. \nHowever, in order to pass this or other chemical plant security \nlegislation, we will need stronger support from the administration and \nfrom the Secretary of Homeland Security than we have had in the past. \nThat is why I was encouraged by Judge Chertoff's testimony that he is \naware of the significant risk of that sector based on his personal \nexperience. He also testified that ``the Federal Government needs to be \nable to use a whole range of tools to bring the industry up to an \nappropriate standard'' and that ``the President has indicated that he \nsupports, if necessary, the use of authorities to require chemical \ncompanies to come up to certain standards, with appropriate penalties \nif they don't do so.''\n  Thus, on balance, my personal exchange with Judge Chertoff--and the \ntestimony he gave during his confirmation hearing--speak of his \ncommitment to threat- and vulnerability-based funding, his keen \nawareness of other vital homeland security issues for New Yorkers, and \nhis intent to work tirelessly. He is from New Jersey and knows the \nhomeland security needs of the region from personal experience. \nUltimately, his roots in the region, his personal experiences, and his \nexpressions of commitment to policies that are essential to the \nsecurity of New Yorkers, are decisive factors in my decision to vote to \nconfirm.\n  One of the lessons we have learned since September 11 is that \nconstant vigilance is required of the Congress; oversight and \naccountability must be our watch words. Oversight requires us to demand \nthat the rule of law be respected by the executive branch, and that we \ndo not countenance the flouting of the law or of treaties. It requires \nus to hold the executive branch truly accountable for its actions. If \nwe have learned anything since that September day in 2001, particularly \nwith respect to this administration, it is the timeless truth that \n``eternal vigilance is the price of liberty.''\n  It has been said before, but it bears repeating--our Nation faces a \nnew kind of challenge to our way of life. I have no doubt we will \novercome this challenge, but it will only be overcome through \nmaintaining and strengthening our civil society and our commitment to \nbeing a force for decency and respect for law in the world.\n  Judge Chertoff testified that, as Secretary, he will ``be mindful of \nthe need to reconcile the imperatives of security with the preservation \nof liberty and privacy.'' I agree that one of the central dilemmas of \nour time is balancing security with liberty and privacy. As the 9/11 \nCommission said, ``Our history has shown us that insecurity threatens \nliberty. Yet, if our liberties are curtailed, we lose the values that \nwe are struggling to defend.'' I believe that Judge Chertoff is \nprofessionally qualified to be Secretary of Homeland Security, and that \nhe understands and respects the values that the Secretary works to \ndefend. Therefore, I will be voting in favor of his confirmation.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I thank Judge Michael Chertoff for having \nthe courage to take on the challenging tasks of leading the Department \nof Homeland Security. He is an ideal nominee for this position, and I \nlook forward to working with him and other department officials to \nensure that we have the best possible border and port security, cyber \nsecurity, and efficient distribution of DHS resources and personnel.\n  There are several issues that we need to address in the short term, \nparticularly in the areas of state homeland security grants and cyber \nsecurity.\n  For the last 4 years, the Department of Homeland Security has \nprovided billions of dollars throughout the country to prevent, prepare \nfor, and respond to acts of terrorism. There are several effective \nfirst responder grant programs that have raised our nation's overall \nlevel of preparedness and ability to react to all manner of disasters.\n  However, many of the funds distributed to states and local \nGovernments have been allocated by formulas that fail to take into \nconsideration actual needs or are not based on real risks of terrorism. \nIt is time that Congress re-examine the methods of distributing these \ncritical preparedness funds. In order to adequately secure the nation \nagainst terrorist attacks, the Federal Government must strategically \ndistribute grants to states and local governments in an efficient \nmanner and to the places where they will be most effective. Congress \nmust take the lead in reforming the system for distributing these funds \nbased on actual threats and vulnerabilities and enable Federal agencies \nto target critical gaps in state and local terrorism prevention and \npreparedness capabilities.\n  We know that terrorists seek to strike the U.S. where it will do the \nmost damage, either in terms of American lives or our country's economy \nand vital assets. Of course, we should make sure that our population \ncenters are protected, but that does not mean that funds should only go \nto urban areas. When it comes to protecting our economy and vulnerable \ncritical infrastructure, we need to be mindful of protecting all the \nvital components of these systems. Taking the U.S. food supply as an \nexample, this would mean securing both up and down stream components, \nfrom agriculture and food production systems to the ports that ship \nproducts in and out of the country.\n  By targeting terrorism preparedness funds to the communities and \ncomponents of the economy that are most at risk, the whole country \nbenefits.\n  And looking beyond traditional terrorism preparedness, in this age of \nthe Internet and globally interconnected computer systems, securing the \nNation's borders no longer includes just land, air and sea, but also \ncyberspace. As a result, it is critical that the federal government \nprovide strong leadership in cyber security by securing its computer \nsystems and adequately safeguarding key components in our national \ninfrastructure--including the systems the country relies upon that link \nwater, utility, communications, transportation and financial networks.\n  I am encouraged that Judge Chertoff, has committed to closely \nexamining the agency's role in cyber security to ensure it is doing \neverything possible in this critical mission. Toward that goal, we \nshould elevate the issue of cyber security within the agency and create \nthe position of Assistant Secretary of Cyber Security.\n\n[[Page S1380]]\n\n  We made important strides toward making America safer with the \nrecently enacted Intelligence Reform Bill, but we cannot claim to have \nfinished the job of improving our intelligence capability and homeland \nsecurity until we deal comprehensively with the need for enhanced cyber \nsecurity. An organized cyber attack would disrupt national security, \nhalt the production and distribution of needed goods and services, and \nthreaten the very fabric of our Nation's economy.\n  Unfortunately, cyber security is an area that tends to be overlooked \nin the discussion of homeland security. First responders to a cyber \nsecurity attack on America have far different needs and functions than \ntraditional first responders. They require a clear and visible \nleadership within DHS to organize and maintain our security. Given the \ndynamic and ever-expanding threats in the area of cyber security, an \nAssistant Secretary of Cyber Security will provide DHS with an enhanced \nability to interact, influence, and coordinate targeted cyber security \nmissions across all areas of our infrastructure.\n  The effort to secure our nation will not be complete until all \naspects of vulnerability to terrorists are recognized. This is true for \nall our national borders; on land, air, sea, and cyber space. \nRecognizing that threat is an important step, but we must now make \nevery effort to prevent the threat from becoming a crippling reality.\n  I am proud to vote for Judge Chertoff. He has well-deserved \nbipartisan support, and I am confident he will be able to do the job. \nAs Assistant Attorney General for the Criminal Division of the U.S. \nDepartment of Justice, he worked tirelessly following the September \n11th attacks, prosecuting those whose specific goal was to kill \ninnocent citizens in New York, Virginia and elsewhere in this country. \nI look forward to working alongside him on these critical issues, and I \nam sure he will bring courage and commitment to the serious tasks at \nhand.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, the Constitution provides the Senate \nwith a responsibility to evaluate Presidential nominations. This is a \nresponsibility that I take very seriously because the Senate's role \nensures strong leadership at the very highest levels of the Federal \nGovernment.\n  Today, the Senate considers the nomination of Judge Michael Chertoff \nto be Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security. Leading the \nDepartment of Homeland Security is not an easy job, and requires an \nindividual with tireless dedication, unending perseverance, and strong \nleadership.\n  The Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs, \nled by Chairman Collins and ranking member Lieberman, conducted a \nthorough examination of Judge Chertoffs record, and I support the \ncommittee's recommendation to endorse his nomination.\n  The Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security is tasked with a \nserious responsibility--leading our country's unified effort to secure \nAmerica and protect the homeland from terrorist attacks. To take this \njob, Judge Chertoff has walked away from a lifetime appointment to \nthird circuit, a position for which I supported him. I commend him for \nembracing this new responsibility and answering the call of the \nPresident and of all American citizens.\n  In the wake of the attacks on September 11, our Nation was confronted \nwith a challenge to revamp our homeland security posture and adopt a \nstrategic plan to defend America from global threat of terrorism. Many \nof our efforts to strengthen homeland security have been successful, \nand were long overdue. But there are critical networks and \ninfrastructure that need additional attention to reduce their \nvulnerability to terrorist attacks, such as: our food supply, \ntelecommunications and financial networks, rail transportation \ninfrastructure, and chemical facilities.\n  In Washington State, we have looked to the Department of Homeland \nSecurity to assist us in preparing our first responders and providing \nthem with the financial, training, and information resources they need \nto meet new security requirements. I would urge Judge Chertoff to \ncontinue to work closely with local first responders from my state who \nare on the front lines of ensuring that Washington's ports, borders, \nand critical infrastructure are secure.\n  I am confident that Judge Chertoff will be confirmed today. I am \neager to begin working with him to continue to improve the security of \nWashington State and all of America's homeland.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today the Senate will complete the \nconsideration of the nomination of Michael Chertoff to head the \nDepartment of Homeland Security.\n  Judge Chertoff currently serves as a Federal judge on the Court of \nAppeals for the Third Circuit. This is a lifetime appointment that he \nhas held for a relatively short time and that he will be abandoning to \nreturn to executive branch service. I helped expedite and voted in \nfavor of Judge Chertoff when his nomination to the third circuit came \nto the Senate in 2003.\n  Before that he was the Assistant Attorney General in charge of the \nCriminal Division at the Department of Justice. I helped expedite and \nvoted in favor of that nomination in 2001.\n  I have worked with Mike Chertoff and appreciate his background as a \nprosecutor. He is very capable. He works hard. What one sees when you \nconsider his career is that much of the time he acts as a consummate \nprofessional in our best tradition. Although there have been times when \nhe has shown partisanship in an apparent effort to ``earn his spurs'' \nwith those on the extreme right, it is my hope and expectation that he \nwill bring his better angels with him as he embarks on his new role as \nSecretary of the Office of Homeland Security. That is not a position \nthat needs or deserves even a hint of partisanship. Indeed, one of the \nmoments that marred Secretary Ridge's tenure was when he stepped out of \ncharacter to make a blatantly partisan pitch during the run-up to the \nrecent presidential election.\n  I was astonished when President Bush announced that he had chosen \nBernie Kerik to replace Secretary Ridge. When newspapers and news \nmagazines began looking at that nomination, it became apparent that the \nvetting of that nomination was shoddy and that Mr. Kerik was an \nunacceptable choice on a number of grounds. That misadventure cost us \ntime and led to Judge Chertoff's nomination being made later than it \nshould have been by the administration.\n  The Senate has expedited consideration of this nomination. In what I \nhope is a sign of better days to come and of increased responsiveness, \nI note that this nominee has responded in kind by seeking to answer in \none day's time a letter I sent to him. I appreciate that kind of \nresponsiveness.\n  In light of his effort, I will excuse his missing the point in \nfailing to respond directly to my first question. I raised with the \nnominee an aspect of his conversations with representatives of the \nintelligence community while he was serving as a principal law enforcer \ncharged with prosecutions under the anti-torture law. My question to \nJudge Chertoff was an opportunity for him to reflect on the \ninappropriateness of the chief prosecutor advising lawyers for possible \ninvestigatory targets regarding how he would apply the law and what \nmight provide a safe harbor when it came to torture.\n  I commend Senator Levin for trying to get to the substance of those \nconversations during confirmation hearings. Sadly but all too \ncharacteristically, the Bush administration has refused to provide him \nor the Senate with the relevant materials in this regard. I am, \nlikewise, concerned that Mr. Chertoff was not more assertive during \ndiscussions with the Office of Legal Counsel as it headed down the \nwrong road in trying artificially to narrow the definition of torture \nto provide latitude that contributed to widespread international \nscandals in our wrongful treatment of prisoners. I wish someone within \nthe Bush administration at the time had stood up for the rule of law \nand had succeeded in derailing the search directed by Judge Gonzales to \ncreate loopholes in our law.\n  I appreciate that Judge Chertoff has committed to implementing the \nrecommendations of the inspector general with respect to preserving the \ncivil rights of those detained by the Government in his answer to my \nsecond question. That inquiry derived from his testimony to the \nJudiciary Committee in November 2001.\n  Finally, I asked a series of questions about the so-called ``wall'' \nbetween law\n\n[[Page S1381]]\n\nenforcement investigations and intelligence. The 9/11 Commission report \nwent a long way toward dismantling the myth that former Attorney \nGeneral Ashcroft had tried to perpetuate. I recall when even President \nBush upbraided Attorney General Ashcroft following his assault upon \nCommissioner Gorelick at the 9/11 Commission hearings.\n  I pointed out that during the Clinton administration almost one year \nbefore September 11, 2001, the Department of Justice Office of Legal \nCounsel had issued an official memorandum noting the Government's \nposition on ``Sharing Title III Electronic Surveillance Material with \nthe Intelligence Community,'' which concluded that law enforcement \nofficials may share surveillance information with the intelligence \ncommunity to obtain assistance in preventing, investigating or \nprosecuting a crime, or where the information was of overriding \nimportance to national security or foreign relations.\n  As Judge Chertoff recalls, it was Attorney General Ashcroft who \nadopted measures on January 21, 2000, and it was the memorandum issued \nby Deputy Attorney General Thompson on August 6, 2001, that governed \ninformation sharing in the days leading to the disaster that was \nSeptember 11. Indeed, Judge Chertoff notes: ``When it was deemed to be \nappropriate, additional procedures were put in place in specific cases, \nor in sets of related cases.'' He proceeds to concede that without any \nchange in the law, in the time between September 11 and enactment of \nthe USA PATRIOT Act: ``With court approval, some of these procedures \nwere modified between 9/11 and October 26, 2001, the effective date of \nthe USA PATRIOT Act.''\n  The 9/11 Commission established during its investigation that in the \ndays and months before September 11, 2001, information sharing \nrequirements and procedures were misunderstood and misapplied at the \nDepartment of Justice. I appreciated Judge Chertoff's offering a \nglimpse into the inner workings of the Ashcroft Justice Department in \nthe days that led up to 9/11 when he noted that there was a ``vigorous \ninternal debate about the appropriate procedures for sharing \ninformation collected in foreign intelligence and counterterrorism \ninvestigations with criminal agents and prosecutors.'' That ``internal \ndebate'' was unresolved on September 11, 2001, when terrorists struck \nin New York and at the Pentagon and were thwarted in the sky over \nPennsylvania.\n  When the Justice Department came forward to work with the Senate in \nthe weeks following the attacks, I worked with Mr. Chertoff to ensure \nthat law enforcement and intelligence efforts were better coordinated, \nand I urged him, the Attorney General and the Director of the FBI to \nchange the culture that had led to destructive and dysfunctional \nhoarding of essential security information.\n  I ask unanimous consent that copies of my letter to Judge Chertoff \nand his response be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                                   Committee on the Judiciary,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, February 7, 2005.\n     Hon. Michael Chertoff,\n     United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, Martin \n         Luther King, Jr. Federal Building & U.S. Courthouse, \n         Walnut Street, Newark, NJ.\n       Dear Judge Chertoff: Congratulations on your nomination to \n     head the Department of Homeland Security. While I am somewhat \n     surprised to be considering your nomination to an Executive \n     Branch position so soon after your confirmation to the \n     Federal bench, I respect your commitment to public service. \n     The work of the Department of Homeland Security is crucial to \n     the safety and security of the American people, and there are \n     lingering problems in integrating all of the elements of the \n     department and in making them as effective as we need them to \n     be. Managing DHS is one of the toughest assignments in \n     Washington, and I admire and appreciate your willingness to \n     take it. I feel confident that the vetting problems we saw \n     with respect to the Kerik nomination will not plague yours.\n       It is regrettable that the Judiciary Committee has not held \n     a hearing and was not even allowed to participate in a \n     hearing on your nomination. Much of the work of the \n     Department of Homeland Security remains of importance and \n     interest to the Judiciary Committee and within its \n     jurisdiction and expertise.\n       In connection with our committee's oversight \n     responsibilities as the Senate prepares to debate and vote on \n     your nomination, I would ask you to respond regarding three \n     principal matters.\n       First, at your confirmation hearing last week, you \n     acknowledged that while serving as head of the Criminal \n     Division, you consulted with lawyers for the intelligence \n     community regarding specific interrogation techniques. I ask \n     that you reflect upon your conduct in which you were \n     apparently discussing the possible application of the \n     criminal anti-torture statute with representatives of \n     agencies whose personnel might be involved in conduct that \n     you might later be called upon to evaluate for prosecution. \n     In hindsight, should you not have refused to engage in those \n     discussions, or referred the agencies to a non-prosecutorial \n     office of the government such as the Office of Legal Counsel?\n       Second, in your testimony before the Senate Judiciary \n     Committee in November 2001, you stated that the Department of \n     Justice, in its investigation into the September 11 attacks, \n     acted in complete accordance with all statutory and \n     constitutional requirements in place before or after the \n     attack. With what has come to light since then about the \n     treatment of detainees, including the Inspector General's \n     highly critical June 2003 report on that topic, what would \n     you now say about government practices in the months \n     following the 9/11 attacks and how they went wrong? Is it not \n     also true, as indicated in the 9/11 Commission report that \n     information sharing legal requirements and procedures were \n     misunderstood and misapplied before September 11, 2001? \n     Before September 11, 2001, what did you do to improve \n     information sharing between the law enforcement and \n     intelligence communities?\n       Third, what were the policies and practices of the \n     Department of Justice with respect to information sharing \n     between law enforcement and intelligence functions during the \n     period that you headed the Criminal Division? In particular, \n     what were those policies and practices before September 11, \n     2001, and how if at all did they change between September 11, \n     2001, and October 26, 2001, when the USA PATRIOT Act was \n     signed into law? Is it not true that in 2000 the Department's \n     Office of Legal Counsel issued an official memorandum on \n     ``Sharing Title III Electronic Surveillance Material with the \n     Intelligence Community,'' which concluded that law \n     enforcement officials may share surveillance information with \n     the intelligence community to obtain assistance in \n     preventing, investigating or prosecuting a crime, or where \n     the information was of overriding importance to national \n     security or foreign relations?\n       I look forward to your prompt response.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Patrick Leahy,\n     Ranking Democratic Member.\n                                  ____\n\n\n  Post-Hearing Questions for the Record Submitted by Senator Patrick \n   Leahy for the Nomination Hearing of Judge Michael Chertoff To Be \n            Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security\n\n       Question: First, at your confirmation hearing last week, \n     you acknowledged that while serving as head of the Criminal \n     Division, you consulted with lawyers for the intelligence \n     community regarding specific interrogation techniques.\n       I ask that you reflect upon your conduct in which you were \n     apparently discussing the possible application of the \n     criminal anti-torture statute with representatives of \n     agencies whose personnel might be involved in conduct that \n     you might later be called upon to evaluate for prosecution. \n     In hindsight, should you not have refused to engage in those \n     discussions, or referred the agencies to a non-prosecutorial \n     office of the government such as the Office of Legal Counsel?\n       Answer: As I stated at my confirmation hearing, I was asked \n     to provide my views to other attorneys on how the anti-\n     torture statute would be applied by a prosecutor. My position \n     in response was not to give advance, speculative advice about \n     what could be done; rather, it was to make sure that the \n     lawyers understood that what is likely to be critical to a \n     prosecutor evaluating a potential charge is the honest, good-\n     faith assessment by any interrogators of the effects of what \n     they are doing and how those effects measure against the \n     statute.\n       I believe it would have been a dereliction of my duty to \n     refuse to assist the Office of Legal Counsel and lawyers from \n     other government agencies. The Office of Legal Counsel, a \n     component separate and distinct from the Criminal Division, \n     was the primary Department of Justice Component responsible \n     for the guidance on the meaning of the anti-torture statute. \n     I understand that, depending on the legal question under \n     analysis, OLC or lawyers from other government agencies on \n     occasion solicit the views of components of the Department \n     that have expertise in the matter under consideration. I \n     believe it was appropriate for the Criminal Division to offer \n     general guidance on application of the law.\n       Question: Second, in your testimony before the Senate \n     Judiciary Committee in November 2001, you stated that the \n     Department of Justice, in its investigation into the \n     September 11 attacks, acted in complete accordance with all \n     statutory and constitutional requirements in place before or \n     after the attack.\n       With what has come to light since then about the treatment \n     of detainees, including the Inspector General's highly \n     critical June\n\n[[Page S1382]]\n\n     2003 report on that topic, what would you now say about \n     government practices in the months following the 9/11 attacks \n     and how they went wrong?\n       Answer: As explained in the OIG report, I believed that if \n     individuals linked through investigation to the hijackers or \n     terrorism were chargeable with violations of our criminal \n     laws or immigration laws, as enacted by Congress, the \n     government should seek detention in accordance with the \n     applicable law while were investigating to determine if the \n     charged individuals posed an actual threat. In these \n     discussions, I repeatedly emphasized that this policy applied \n     only to those properly chargeable with breaking the law and \n     that detention should be sought consistent with relevant law \n     and regulations.\n       My understanding is that those detained in the course of \n     the 9/11 investigation were detained with an individualized \n     predicate, meaning, a criminal charge, an immigration \n     violation, or a judicially-issued material witness warrant. \n     There was a legal basis for each detention. The top priority \n     of the Justice Department was preventing another terrorist \n     attack against the American people, and the lawful detention \n     of individuals who were known to have violated immigration \n     laws--like the September 11 attackers themselves--was a \n     reasonable policy.\n       I acknowledge that the policy could have been implemented \n     better and it will be in the future. I believe that the \n     Government faced an unparalleled challenge on September 11: \n     How to prevent devastating terrorist attacks that might arise \n     at any moment from al-Qaeda ``sleepers'' who had been \n     specifically programmed to disguise themselves, blend into \n     ordinary life, and to exploit existing networks for obtaining \n     phony documents and other means of support. That challenge \n     was compounded by the fact that the September 11 attacks \n     physically crippled the FBI and U.S. Attorney's Office in New \n     York (which were the repositories of much of the Department's \n     antiterrorism expertise at the time) and impaired \n     communication between New York and Washington for a period of \n     time. Furthermore, because the 9/11 conspirators operated in \n     cities and towns across the country, the 9/11 investigation \n     necessitated following and analyzing many thousands of leads \n     generated by numerous FBI field offices, some of which had \n     little previous experience in conducting terrorism \n     investigations. Looking for a terrorist under these \n     circumstances was akin to looking for a needle in a \n     nationwide haystack, but with the needle masquerading as a \n     stalk of hay.\n       The OIG report identifies concerns that FBI investigative \n     delays or lack of precision in turn led to delays in \n     processing of immigration detainees. In the aftermath of the \n     surprise attack on September 11, the FBI labored under \n     physical and resource constraints in the face of an urgent \n     investigative demand of unprecedented scope. Now, additional \n     resources, training enhancements and reorganizations within \n     the Department and the FBI, as well as the Intelligence \n     Reform Bill--are designed to--and should continue to--\n     increase FBI expertise and capability and streamline \n     coordination, so that in any future nationwide terrorism \n     investigation delays and imprecision will be minimized. \n     Furthermore, I believe that the FBI and DHS should and will \n     continue to build upon their experience to develop and firmly \n     establish appropriate protocols for classifying subjects of \n     terrorism investigations at the appropriate level of concern, \n     setting up appropriate deadlines for notification that a \n     particular detainee is or is no longer a terrorism risk; \n     sharing information between law enforcement and immigration \n     agencies; and finalizing a crisis management plan that \n     clearly delineates each agencies procedures and \n     responsibilities in the event of a national emergency. These \n     enhancements would further reduce the potential for \n     impinging on civil liberties.\n       Finally, so far as the OIG report identified acts of \n     misconduct by guards at detention facilities these were, of \n     course, wrong, and steps should be taken to assure no such \n     behavior occurs in the future. I believe that DHS and DOJ \n     have implemented some of these proposals and, if confirmed, I \n     will work to further increase their successful \n     implementation.\n       Question: Is it not also true, as indicated in the 9/11 \n     Commission report that information sharing legal requirements \n     and procedures were misunderstood and misapplied before \n     September 11, 2001? Before September 11, 2001, what did you \n     do to improve information sharing between the law enforcement \n     and intelligence communities?\n       Answer: I began at the Criminal Division on approximately \n     June 1, 2001. My activities date from that point.\n       Prior to 9/11, the Department--including the Criminal \n     Division under my leadership--was engaged in a vigorous \n     internal debate about the appropriate procedures for sharing \n     information collected in foreign counterintelligence and \n     counterterrorism investigations with criminal agents and \n     prosecutors, and the proper role for prosecutors in such \n     investigations. I understand that the procedures in effect on \n     9/11 were those that had been adopted by the Attorney General \n     on July 19, 1995 (including an annex concerning the Southern \n     District of New York), the interim measures approved by the \n     Attorney General on January 21, 2000, and the memorandum \n     issued by the Deputy Attorney General on August 6, 2001.\n       Question: Third, what were the policies and practices of \n     the Department of Justice with respect to information sharing \n     between law enforcement and intelligence functions during the \n     period that you headed the Criminal Division? In particular, \n     what were those policies and practices before September 11, \n     2001, and how if at all did they change between September 11, \n     2001, and October 26, 2001, when the USA PATRIOT Act was \n     signed into law? Is it not true that in 2000 the Department's \n     Office of Legal Counsel issued an official memorandum on \n     ``Sharing Title III Electronic Surveillance Material with the \n     Intelligence Community,'' which concluded that law \n     enforcement officials may share surveillance information with \n     the intelligence community to obtain assistance in \n     preventing, investigating or prosecuting a crime, or where \n     the information was of overriding importance to national \n     security or foreign relations?\n       Answer: As discussed above, prior to 9/11, the Department--\n     including the Criminal Division under my leadership--was \n     engaged in a vigorous internal debate about the appropriate \n     procedures for sharing information collected in foreign \n     counterintelligence and counterterrorism investigations with \n     criminal agents and prosecutors, and the proper role for \n     prosecutors in such investigations. The procedures in effect \n     on 9/11 were those that had been adopted by the Attorney \n     General on July 19, 1995 (including an annex concerning the \n     Southern District of New York), the interim measures approved \n     by the Attorney General on January 21, 2000, and the \n     memorandum issued by the Deputy Attorney General on August 6, \n     2001. Where it was deemed to be appropriate, additional \n     procedures were put in place in specific cases, or in sets of \n     related cases. With court approval, some of these procedures \n     were modified between 9/11 and October 26, 2001, the \n     effective date of the USA PATRIOT Act. On March 6, 2002, the \n     Attorney General adopted new information sharing procedures \n     that replaced all of the above-referenced procedures. The \n     March 6th procedures, however, did not take full effect until \n     the Foreign Intelligence Court of Review issued a ruling \n     regarding these matters on November 18, 2002.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Heading the Department of Homeland Security is a position \nthat may be one of the more difficult assignments in Washington and in \nGovernment. The work of the Department of Homeland Security, DHS, is \ncrucial to the safety and security of the American people. There remain \nmany problems in integrating the elements of the Department and in \nmaking them as effective as we need them to be. I remain concerned with \na number of issues in need of greater attention at DHS and much more \nsignificant support from the highest levels of the Bush administration. \nWorking with Secretary Chertoff, maybe we will be able to get that \nattention and support.\n  The Bush administration has failed to provide the necessary \nassistance for first responders throughout our Nation. As the costs \nborne by law enforcement agencies across the country continue to rise, \nwe need to increase the partnership help offered to our nation's first \nresponders. Instead, in the President's new budget, he has proposed \ncutting overall funding for first responders by $670 million. These \ncuts target vital emergency services affecting every State, regardless \nof size or population. The President also proposed cutting the all-\nState minimum for first-responder grants from 0.75 percent to 0.25 \npercent. That new formula would result in the loss of funds to police, \nfirefighters and emergency rescue squads in dozens of states from coast \nto coast. In Vermont, this would mean a loss of at least $10 million \ndollars in fiscal year 2006--grant funds that are used to provide \nsecurity services along thousands of miles of our border with three \nstates. Vermont's border with Canada spans approximately 95 miles, but \nthe Swanton Border Patrol is charged with protecting 24,000 square \nmiles, which includes not only the entire State of Vermont, but also \nnumerous counties in New York and New Hampshire. Within this area, the \nSwanton Border Patrol is required to patrol more than 261 miles of \nInternational Boundary.\n  Our approach to port security is also insufficient. More than 90 \npercent of the world's trade is moved in cargo containers. The \nGovernment Accountability Office has found that the information that \nthe Bureau of Customs and Border Patrol uses to determine which cargo \nshould be searched is ``one of the least reliable or useful for \ntargeting purposes.'' In addition, our government has been slow to \ninstall radiation detection portals at our ports, leaving us vulnerable \nto the smuggling of a nuclear or radiological weapon.\n  Mass Transit Measures Idle. Our mass transit systems are similarly at \nrisk. While we spent about $4.5 billion on aviation security last year, \nwe devoted only $65 million to rail security, even though five times as \nmany people take trains as planes every day. The\n\n[[Page S1383]]\n\nMadrid bombing vividly demonstrated the potential vulnerability of mass \ntransit, and I am concerned that the administration is not responding \neffectively enough to this threat. This needs to be a higher priority \nthan the administration has made it. The TSA has been slow in \ndeveloping security procedures at port and rail facilities around the \ncountry, and our transit and freight transportation systems remain at \nrisk. The recent DHS budget submission cuts funding for the following \nessential security programs: port security grants, port security \nincident response, intercity bus grants, container threat assessments, \nnuclear detection and monitoring, hazmat truck tracking and training, \nand rail security inspectors.\n  Air Security Concerns Linger. Despite the dedicated resources to \naviation security, problems remain. There have been several \nreorganizations of the TSA's airport screeners program, but reports \nfrom the GAO and the DHS Office of Inspector General suggest that the \nscreening programs for baggage and passengers at our nation's airports \nare not as effective as they should be. We need to ensure that the \n$4,734,784,000 budget request for aviation security this year is spent \nwisely and properly.\n  Secretary Chertoff, if he is confirmed, will oversee both the \nenforcement of our immigration laws and the granting of immigration \nbenefits. We face a number of important choices on immigration in the \ncoming years, and I hope that he will play a constructive role.\n  I urge him to support the bipartisan efforts in Congress to improve \nthe H-2B visa program, so we can meet the needs of small employers \naround our nation who depend on seasonal immigrant labor to stay in \nbusiness. I hope he will support the bipartisan ``AgJOBS'' bill, which \nprovides relief both to the agriculture industry and to the immigrant \nfarm workers who make up a majority of the farm workforce in our \nnation. And as the Congress debates fundamental immigration reform, I \nhope that Judge Chertoff will work to help ensure that any reform \nefforts recognize and embrace the tremendous contributions of \nimmigrants to our economy and our culture.\n  I would like to note the release last week of a report by the U.S. \nCommission on International Religious Freedom, a bipartisan commission \ncreated by Congress that we asked to study the expedited removal system \nand its effect on asylum seekers. In his response to me last week, \nJudge Chertoff showed a commendable concern for the civil rights of \nthose who were detained due to alleged immigration violations during \nthe 9/11 investigation. His concern should be even more pronounced \nhere, where the Commission found that DHS detains people who seek \nrefuge in the United States--and are not even accused of committing any \ncriminal or civil violation--under conditions that ``are entirely \ninappropriate for asylum seekers fleeing persecution.''\n  If we are to recapture America's rightful place as a haven for the \noppressed, the tragic situation of asylum seekers must be rectified. \nThe Commission offered a number of recommendations that can be \nimplemented through administrative action, such as establishing an \noffice within DHS to oversee the treatment of refugees and asylum \nseekers and issuing formal regulations governing when asylum seekers \nshould be released from detention. I urge Judge Chertoff to begin the \nprocess of making these changes immediately.\n  As secretary, Judge Chertoff will also supervise a number of \noutstanding Federal employees who are Vermonters and work for various \ncomponents of the Department, particularly in DHS' immigration \nagencies. I believe he will be pleased with their efforts and their \nexpertise.\n  Secretary Ridge and I have disagreed strongly about DHS' efforts to \nprivatize Immigration Information Officer, IIO, and other positions at \nthe agency, and Congress has barred that privatization for the current \nfiscal year. Among other duties, IIOs perform background checks on \napplicants for immigration benefits, a function that should be \nperformed by government employees. I urge Secretary Chertoff to \nconsider the repeated votes of both the House and Senate to maintain \nthese positions as government employees and to make no effort to \nrevisit the unwise and unpopular efforts of his predecessor.\n  I will support this nomination. Secretary Chertoff will face great \nchallenges ahead. I hope that he will work with me and others, on both \nsides of the aisle, in finding the best solutions in meeting them.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the nomination \nof Michael Chertoff to be Secretary of the Department of Homeland \nSecurity, DHS. Chairman Stevens and I had the opportunity to meet with \nJudge Chertoff, and I was encouraged by his desire to work with \nCongress to address the nation's homeland security needs. I believe \nthat his stated goal of resolving the internal disputes that have \nplagued DHS since its founding and his commitment to reduce the \nvulnerability of all our transportation systems to terrorist attack \nwill serve him well in this new capacity.\n  Though I support Judge Chertoff's nomination, I want to take this \nopportunity to express some of my thoughts and concerns about the \ncurrent state of DHS and the Transportation Security Administration in \nparticular.\n  In the days following September 11, we all recognized the many \nserious flaws in our homeland security efforts. We were exposed to new \nand unexpected threats in ways we had never before thought possible. We \ncommitted to do everything in our power to ensure that a tragedy like \nSeptember 11 would never happen again. We took bold, speedy, and \nnecessary action. We made transportation security a national security \nfunction by enacting the Aviation Transportation Security Act and the \nMaritime Transportation Security Act, both considered landmark \nlegislation.\n  Although a number of high profile actions have been taken to \nstrengthen aviation security, I fear that the same zealous effort to \nadequately strengthen security across all modes of transportation has \nstalled. In the more than three years since September 11, very little \nhas been done to aggressively promote security of our ports, our \npassenger and freight rail system, motor carriers, pipelines, and \nhazardous materials, despite very specific congressional direction.\n  Meanwhile, the threats to our transportation security are as serious \nas they have always been. From the train bombing in Madrid to the \nmaritime attack off the coast of Yemen, the threats have not waned in \nthe slightest.\n  But, based on the President's Budget, there are apparently some in \nthe Administration who seem to believe that our work is done. The \nPresident's Budget recommends shifting critical work away from the \nTransportation Security Administration, TSA, to other organizations \nwithin DHS that have neither the expertise nor the necessary authority \nto be effective. In my view, further decentralizing the \nresponsibilities of TSA will destroy the remaining, limited \naccountability that TSA provides for transportation security.\n  I recognize that consolidating 22 Federal agencies into one \ndepartment presents significant management challenges and that growing \npains are to be expected as different agencies come together. However, \ngrowing pains are not a license to continue the stovepipe behavior that \nexisted prior to September 11. When Congress created the Department of \nHomeland Security and, more specifically, the Transportation Security \nAdministration, it made clear that ``business as usual'' was not \nacceptable. The Department and TSA need to reread the underlying \nstatutes and start functioning as Congress directed. It is my hope that \nJudge Chertoff will be a leader who understands that necessity.\n  Let me speak for a few minutes about the particulars of TSA and the \nPresident's budget. In truth, the difficult work of securing all of our \nmajor modes of transportation, including ports, shipping, railroads, \nintercity buses, motor carriers, and pipelines is just beginning, and \nthe nation must have a robust agency within the Department dedicated to \nthat task.\n  Security funding for all modes of transportation beyond aviation has \nbeen desperately lacking. The 9/11 Commission found, ``over 90 percent \nof the nation's $5.3 billion annual investment in the TSA goes to \naviation . . . [and] . . . current efforts do not yet reflect a \nforward-looking strategic plan.''\n\n[[Page S1384]]\n\n  According to Senate Banking Committee estimates, the Federal \nGovernment has spent $9.16 per airline passenger each year on enhanced \nsecurity measures, while spending less than a penny annually per person \non security measures for other modes of transportation.\n  Port security and safe maritime transportation is of particular \ninterest to me. They are absolutely essential for my state of Hawaii, \nits economic health, and the life and livelihood of its citizens. \nChairman Stevens' state of Alaska is similarly situated, and I know \nport security is of great importance to him as well.\n  Apparently, though, we need to remind the Administration--and perhaps \nthe nominee--that 95 percent of the Nation's cargo comes through the \nports. The security initiatives at most ports have been, to this point, \nwoefully underfunded, and most are ill prepared for an attack. \nUnfortunately, our maritime system is only as strong as its weakest \nlink. If there is an incident at any one port, the whole system will \nscreech to a halt, as we scramble to ensure security at other ports. If \nwe had to shut down our entire port system, the economic damage would \nbe widespread, catastrophic and possibly irreversible.\n  Judge Chertoff has many tools at his disposal to protect our maritime \nand shipping interests, both through the TSA and the U.S. Coast Guard. \nOur national shore line extends for thousands of miles, with key cities \nand facilities located all along the coasts. Whether it is monitoring, \ncredentialing, or inspecting cargo, there is no doubt, port security is \na daunting and difficult task.\n  If Judge Chertoff has difficulty understanding the importance of \nimproved port security, there are 14 members of our committee with \nmajor ports in their State, and I am sure each would be more than \nwilling to help provide greater clarity.\n  Even though we all recognize the overwhelming task of port security, \nthe President's Budget does not do enough. It is true that the Coast \nGuard increases 7.5 percent over the previous fiscal year, which seems \nlaudable. However, when you look at the numbers, it becomes clear that \nthe administration's request--for the third year in a row--does not \nrecognize that in addition to the Coast Guard's ever-increasing port \nsecurities duties, it must still continue critical functions like \nsearch and rescue efforts and enforcement of coastal and fisheries \nlaws. There is no question that we must provide for increased security, \nbut there is also no question that other critical missions also impact \nthe free flow of maritime commerce.\n  In addition to not providing enough funding for Coast Guard \nactivities, the President's budget also proposes to develop a Targeted \nInfrastructure Protection Program, TIPP, within the Office of State and \nLocal Government Coordination and Preparedness to administer $600 \nmillion in integrated grants for the protection of transit, railroads, \nports, highways and energy facilities.\n  This odd realignment of the grant process adds layers of bureaucracy, \nfurther diminishes accountability and distribution of these critical \nfunds, and it is directly contrary to the law Congress enacted just 6 \nmonths ago. It also shields the fact that the administration is using \nthe same limited pot of money, extending it to a wider range of \ngrantees, and making them compete against one another when each of \ntheir projects merit grant funding.\n  The administration also proposes establishing a new Office of \nScreening Coordination and Operations, SCO, within the Border and \nTransportation Security, BTS, Directorate. This new entity would \npurportedly coordinate procedures to identify and interdict people, \ncargo and other entities that pose a threat to homeland security.\n\n  This short-sighted proposal calls for cutting over 70 percent of \nTSA's funding for rail, trucking, pipeline, and hazmat security-related \ninitiatives. The ``streamlining of duplicative programs and \nactivities'' effectively eliminates TSA's role in allocating \ntransportation security grants, maritime research and development \ngrants, and cedes its regulatory authority to develop the \nTransportation Worker Identity Credential, TWIC, program. In short, \nthis budget ignores congressional direction, transfers these functions \nback to agencies that operate in a stovepipe manner and do not have \nregulatory authority for credentialing, and decimates TSA's Office of \nMaritime and Land.\n  Regarding rail security, the administration's budget fails to propose \nany dedicated funding or specific programs to address rail security, \nand given their proposal to eliminate support for Amtrak, it is clear \nthat the administration is not interested in rail service let alone \nrail security. The recent rail accident in South Carolina and the \nresulting chlorine gas spill remind us that our rail system presents \nunique vulnerabilities that, if exploited, could cause irreparable \neconomic and physical damage to communities across the country.\n  TSA has undertaken several small-scale, ad hoc, efforts to strengthen \nrail security, from rail passenger screening pilot tests to rail \ncorridor threat assessments in specific corridors. But the \nadministration's lack of support for dedicated funding or programs--\nbeyond what the Congress has forced upon the agency through the \nappropriations process--reflects the low priority that TSA leadership \nand the administration place on this important work. They behave as if \nSeptember 11 never happened.\n  The budget proposal for aviation security appears on paper to \nincrease by $156 million, but this funding depends on $1.5 billion in \nnew revenues raised through increased security fees on airline \npassengers.\n  We can debate how much we need for security, but it does not make any \nsense to place the burden for new DHS revenue on an airline industry \nthat is bordering on total bankruptcy, when at the same time the \nadministration is demanding that its unaffordable tax cuts be made \npermanent.\n  The airlines have argued convincingly that they cannot pass along \nincreased security fees to the passengers in their highly competitive \nindustry. Few of the carriers have managed even modest periods of \nprofitability since September 11. I must remind people in this town, \nwho often have a short and selective memory, that by a vote of 100 to 0 \nin the Senate and 410 to 9 in the House, this Congress chose to make \ntransportation security a national security function. Funding homeland \nsecurity is a Federal responsibility.\n  Given the many misplaced priorities that I see in the President's \nBudget proposal, it is clear that the Congress needs to help refocus \nthe Department.\n  Let me state here before my colleagues and for the record, the Senate \nCommerce Committee will not stall in its efforts to continue developing \ncomprehensive, bipartisan legislation to strengthen port, rail, and \nintercity bus security, regardless of the Bush administration's \nrepeated refusal to support or properly address these critical \ninitiatives. Our national transportation system remains an inviting \ntarget for terrorists. The system is vulnerable, and an attack could \ncause widespread, catastrophic economic damage. In fact, in his most \nrecent video tape, Osama bin Laden stated plainly that bankrupting the \nUnited States was a primary, al-Qaida goal, and given al-Qaida's \nprevious attacks, it is clear that transportation systems are high on \ntheir target list.\n  So I come to the floor today to inform my colleagues and the \nadministration that, I, along with many of my fellow Commerce Committee \nmembers, will be introducing a transportation security reauthorization \nproposal, which will provide further direction to the Department's \ncargo security functions, strengthen aviation, maritime, rail, \nhazardous materials, and pipeline security efforts, and improve \ninteragency cooperation.\n  The proposal will incorporate several Commerce Committee-reported and \nSenate-passed bills from the prior Congress and will also put forth new \nideas to enhance transportation security across all modes of \ntransportation.\n  For port security, we will seek to improve interagency cooperation by \nfurther developing joint operation command centers. Additionally, our \nbill will clarify the roles and responsibilities for cargo security \nprograms, while establishing criteria for contingency response plans. \nOur legislation will further encourage the development of effective \ntechnologies that detect terrorist threats by setting a minimum level \nof R funding related to maritime and land security.\n\n[[Page S1385]]\n\n  To address aviation, we will take several steps to strengthen the \nexisting, professional, screening workforce through improved training \nof personnel and by directing a more appropriate use of TSA's \nresources. Additionally, we will seek to streamline and improve \ncollection of airline and passenger security fees to promote a more \nefficient and healthy aviation industry.\n  For rail security, we will incorporate an updated version of the Rail \nSecurity Act of 2004, which the Senate passed by unanimous consent last \nyear, and we will feature new efforts to ensure the security of \nhazardous materials that are shipped by rail.\n  To address the security needs of our other surface transportation \nmodes, the proposal will include funding to improve intercity bus \nsecurity, strengthened hazardous material transportation security \nefforts, new security guidelines for truck rental and leasing \noperations, and the development of pipeline security incident recovery \nplans.\n  I look forward to working with Judge Chertoff, the TSA, and the \nadministration on this effort, and I remain hopeful that his new \nleadership at DHS will inspire the requisite commitment and dedication \nnecessary to meet the security challenges ahead. The work will not be \neasy. While most of us recognize the improvements that have been made \nin airline security over the last few years, others are pushing to roll \nback the progress that we have made.\n  Despite that progress, there are some that continue to urge TSA to \nreturn to the days of private security screening companies, like \nArgenbright Security and its underpaid, poorly trained workforce. These \nefforts are not just shortsighted, they disregard a national imperative \nto treat transportation security as a national security function, and \nthey should be quickly dismissed by the administration. I call on Judge \nChertoff to clarify DHS's position on this matter quickly, so the \ncountry can continue to have faith in the security efforts we have come \nto expect when flying.\n  Similarly, TSA needs more resources and attention paid to port, rail, \nmotor carrier, hazardous materials, and pipeline security matters, not \nless, and I am hopeful that Judge Chertoff will make strengthening all \nareas of transportation security one of his top missions.\n  We must take this opportunity to continue moving in the right \ndirection and avoid taking steps backward. I support the nomination of \nMichael Chertoff as Secretary of Homeland Security and look forward to \nworking with him to ensure that the American people can depend on a \nnational transportation system that is as safe and secure as possible.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine is recognized.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, earlier today, the senior Senator from \nMassachusetts spoke on this nomination. I have enormous respect and \naffection for my colleague from New England, but on this occasion I \nbelieve his comments were well off the mark. Here are some of the words \nmy colleague spoke:\n\n       Our problems with the administration on this nomination \n     pale in comparison with the failure of the Senate Republican \n     majority to carry out its own constitutional responsibilities \n     on this nomination. Instead of insisting on adequate answers \n     to questions raised by the documents, they have acquiesced in \n     the Government's coverup and abdicated their own independent \n     constitutional responsibility to provide advice and consent.\n\n  I sincerely believe that were I fortunate enough to have the senior \nSenator from Massachusetts serve on the committee the Presiding Officer \nand I serve on, he would never have said those words or reached such a \nharsh judgment.\n  He went on in his statement to call these proceedings ``a blatantly \ndefective consent.'' Again, I so wish that the senior Senator from \nMassachusetts had had the opportunity to participate in our committee's \nprocess. He would have found that our committee has the most thorough \nprocess for considering nominations of any committee in the entire \nSenate. I believe our committee is the only one, for example, that has \nthe staff on both sides of the aisle interview the nominee. We posed to \nJudge Chertoff 250 written questions, both before the hearing and after \nthe hearing. We had a lengthy hearing in which members on both sides of \nthe aisle were free to ask the toughest questions possible to the \nnominee.\n  There was no limit on the questions that could be submitted for the \nrecord, and the nominee sat for hours patiently, fully, and candidly \nanswering the questions posed to him by the members of the committee. \nSo I believe that the judgment of the Senator from Massachusetts does \nnot reflect the process we undertook for this nominee. I truly wish he \ncould have seen the process because I think he would have reached a \ndifferent conclusion. And I say that with a great deal of personal \naffection for my friend from Massachusetts.\n  The fact is, first, that Judge Chertoff has undergone intense \nscrutiny by the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee. I \ncannot imagine how anyone could conclude, given the number and the \nscope of questions posed to the judge, that this was somehow \n``defective consent.''\n  Second, on the issue of the e-mails and the nominee's knowledge of \nquestionable interrogation techniques used by certain DOD personnel at \nGuantanamo, Judge Chertoff's testimony could not have been clearer. He \ntold the committee under oath that he was ``not aware'' of any \npractices at Guantanamo that ``even approach[ed] torture.'' He said he \nhad ``no knowledge'' of any interrogation techniques other than those \nthat he described as ``plain vanilla.'' These are straightforward, \nplain words--``I was not aware''; ``I had no knowledge.'' They are not \nsusceptible to multiple interpretations. They are not ambiguous. They \ndo not suggest the need to refresh the nominee's recollection. They do \nnot invite speculation as to what the nominee meant. And there is only \none reason why some of our colleagues would feel the need to ask other \npeople about what they said to Judge Chertoff, and that is, if we did \nnot believe him.\n  This is a distinguished public servant, a sitting Federal judge who \nis testifying before our committee under oath. There is no reason to \ndoubt his testimony. His testimony was clear, it was forthright, it was \ncandid. It is demeaning to suggest that somehow we need to probe this \nfurther because we do not believe this distinguished public official.\n  I asked this question yesterday, but I am going to repeat it again: \nSince when have we become so cynical about good people who are willing \nto step forward, sacrifice, and serve our country? How could our \ncolleagues from Michigan and Massachusetts come to this floor, praise \nJudge Chertoff, pledge to vote to confirm him, and then condemn the \nnomination process when we have concluded that the judge gave us \ntruthful, straightforward answers, and we have no reason to doubt the \nanswers he gave us? He was not evasive. He was straightforward. It does \nnot make sense to criticize the process because the committee refuses \nto engage in an exercise that, at its core, is built upon the premise \nthat Judge Chertoff is somehow being less than truthful with the \ncommittee. I reject that premise. There is no basis for it.\n  Let me close these remarks by saying a word about the Senate's \nconstitutional role of advise and consent because I think a lot that \nhas been said about this role misses an essential point.\n  We, the Senate, advise and consent. It is the President who appoints. \nWe do not appoint. Sometimes I think some of my colleagues believe the \nSenate should do all of the appointing for the President, but that is \nnot how the system works. That is not how our Constitution works. \nIndeed, as Professor Laurence Tribe has noted--and he is a liberal law \nscholar, not a conservative one--the appointments clause ``seeks to \npreserve an executive check upon legislative authority in the interest \nof avoiding an undue concentration of power in Congress''--in \nCongress--``in executing our responsibilities.''\n\n  We should do well to remember that it is the President who is \nappointing these positions. It is our job to advise and consent. We \nhave performed that job well in this case. We subjected this nominee to \nextraordinary scrutiny, despite the fact that he has already been \nconfirmed by this body three previous times. Nevertheless, as is \nappropriate, we went through a full confirmation process with a review \nof his biographical questionnaire, his finances, with a full FBI check, \nwith an extensive public hearing that stretched several\n\n[[Page S1386]]\n\nhours, and with 250 written questions, primarily from Democratic \nmembers, submitted to him for response. What more can we ask? What more \ncan we ask of a nominee who is simply stepping forward to answer the \ncall to serve his country? And what more can we ask of a Senate \ncommittee in carrying out this solemn duty with which we are vested?\n  As much as I have respect and affection for my colleague, the senior \nSenator from Massachusetts, I cannot let his comments pass. That is why \nI felt compelled to explain to all of my colleagues what the process \nwas and that the Senator's description simply does not reflect what was \ndone. I am certain--absolutely certain--that had he been a member of \nthe committee, had he joined with us in the nomination hearing, he \nwould have reached an entirely different conclusion about the integrity \nand thoroughness of the process.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I do anticipate that further of my colleagues will be \ncoming to the floor. I will yield to them when that happens.\n  (The remarks of Ms. Collins pertaining to the introduction of S. 380 \nare printed in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Ms. COLLINS. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, how much time is left on this side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 22 minutes 30 seconds.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I, first, want to express my appreciation to \nsomeone I believe a star of the Senate and that is Carl Levin. Carl \nLevin is such a good example to every Senator. When you work on \nsomething with Carl Levin, you can rest assured that he has read every \nword of it. He is someone who I am sure, before he came to the Senate, \nwas an outstanding lawyer. I am so impressed with his ability to do \nlegal analysis, and I am so impressed with his understanding of \ngovernment generally.\n  What we have here is something that is very typical for Senator \nLevin. The nomination of Michael Chertoff to be Secretary of Homeland \nSecurity is very important. This new Cabinet level office that has been \ncreated is so important. I think it has become one of the most \nimportant posts that the President has. We know how important the \nSecretary of Defense is, we know how important the Secretary of State \nis, but this is so important.\n  Judge Chertoff will be called upon to manage some 180,000 employees, \n22 different agencies, all important to protect this Nation in one way \nor the other. He will be called upon to bolster the efforts of our \nState and local law enforcement officers, firefighters, emergency \nresponse personnel, and in the process of managing these 180,000 \nemployees, he doesn't have enough people. Many of these 22 different \nagencies he is responsible to manage are understaffed. So he will have \na tremendous burden.\n  The people who work in these agencies are public servants first in \nany designation you want to make. They are the frontline protection for \ncommunities across the Nation.\n  Over the course of the last year, I have held in Nevada what I call \nFrontline Focus roundtables. I am meeting with firefighters, sheriffs, \nand emergency response personnel. It has been tremendously enlightening \nto me to talk to them about the problems that we have, from the \ncommunication and resource challenges facing urban centers such as Las \nVegas and Reno, but also rural communities all over the State of \nNevada. They have special needs, special demands.\n  Of course, I mentioned already Las Vegas with its booming tourist \nindustry. About 20 people an hour are moving into Las Vegas. It is \ngrowing and the growth has not stopped. So Nevada's homeland security \nneeds run the gamut. Our State and local officials will need the \nsupport and help of Judge Chertoff and the Department of Homeland \nSecurity in the work they do. His job is a tough and challenging job, \nand that is an understatement.\n  I have confidence in Judge Chertoff. I am confident he will meet \nthese challenges. It was less than 2 years ago that we approved him by \nan overwhelming vote of 88 to 1 to a lifetime appointment on the Court \nof Appeals of the Third Circuit. But he was willing to give up this \nlifetime appointment for a job that will last probably 4 years.\n  Since his confirmation, the administration has been mired in \ncontroversy over its handling of prisoners and detainees. The \nadministration policies have come under great scrutiny and we need to \nlearn, during the course of this confirmation hearing, and we tried to \ndo that, what role he may have played in crafting these policies.\n  Judge Chertoff has testified before the Homeland Security and \nGovernmental Affairs Committee that he was not directly involved in the \nadministration's decision to gut the Geneva Conventions and set out on \na new and dangerous path with regard to interrogations. We have to take \nJudge Chertoff at his word, because the document proof has either been \ndenied to Senators or otherwise has been so heavily redacted that it \nraises questions about the role of the Criminal Division overseen by \nJudge Chertoff.\n  The debate over his nomination, as my colleague, Senator Levin, has \nbrought to the attention of the American people, as he discussed this \nyesterday on the floor, is a debate over the right of the Senate and \nthe American people to have information about the way our Government \ndoes business.\n  The information sought in the context of his nomination by Senator \nLevin would help us understand how the administration arrived at those \npolicy decisions and would help prevent similar mistakes in the future.\n  No one would disagree--I shouldn't say that. Very few people would \ndisagree that the policies undertaken in Guantanamo Bay, Afghanistan, \nand Iraq dealing with interrogation which led to these brutal acts, the \nacts of torture, were wrong. These policies were used to justify forced \nnakedness. Keep in mind we live in a different environment than the \npeople of Iraq. The shaving of the beards was demeaning to these men, \nbut it was done many times. They were placed in stressed positions. \nThey were intimidated with dogs, and on and on. We learned of these \ntorture policies and their impact not from this administration, as is \nour right, but through leaks and lawsuits. Leaks and lawsuits, \nunfortunately, is the way we have to learn much of what is going on \ntoday.\n  The shocking abuses--and there is no other way you can describe it--\nat Abu Ghraib were revealed when the photographs were released to the \nnews media. I can remember going upstairs to S. 407 with other Senators \nand looking at the brutality and the pornographic nature of those \npictures. Even for someone who has seen other acts of torture and \nterror in the work that we do, it was overwhelming. I had no idea that \nis what I would see that day. I waited not too long before I left. I \nsaw enough in about 15 minutes, but I saw a lot.\n  Major General Taguba's report investigating the abuse at Abu Ghraib \nwas discovered after it, too, was leaked to the press. Judge Gonzales's \nJanuary 25th, 2002, memo advising the President that the Geneva \nConventions were ``quaint and obsolete'' was not known until it was \nleaked to the press 2 years later. The Senate only learned of the \nAugust 1, 2002, Bybee torture memo when it was leaked to the press in \nJune of that year.\n  I ask my colleagues, if this information had not come to light, would \nthe administration disavow these practices? I regret that in the \ncontext of this nomination the administration will again deny the \nSenate and the American people a full understanding of how we embarked \non a policy which has imperiled our soldiers and our Nation.\n  In Judge Chertoff's case, we know during his tenure that torture \npolicies authorized by Justice and given effect by the Department of \nDefense were hotly debated by DOD, Justice Department, and FBI \nofficials. We know this only because a private group filed a freedom of \ninformation request for such information. The request produced a series \nof redacted FBI emails\n\n[[Page S1387]]\n\nthat gave voice to the dissenters this administration has tried to \nmuzzle. The redactions prevent us from fully understanding that debate \nand how Criminal Division lawyers under Judge Chertoff's supervision \ndealt with the FBI concerns that the torture policies were not only \nimmoral but ineffectual. It prevents us from truly understanding Judge \nChertoff's role and whether attorneys under his supervision raised the \nissue with him directly. He said he does not remember. I accept the \njudge's statement in that regard. But that does not take away from the \nnecessity of being able to have this information.\n  In response to Senator Levin's request for an unredacted version of \nthe FBI emails, the administration issued its broadest assault against \nthe Senate's duty to evaluate a nominee to get oversight of this \nadministration. The administration claimed it would not turn over the \nunredacted emails because to do so would violate the Privacy Act, even \nthough, through Senate security, any classified information would be \nprotected. The Privacy Act is designed to prevent the Government from \ndisclosing personal information about private individuals who have not \nconsented to disclosure. It is not a tool to conceal identities of \npublic officials engaged in this Nation's business.\n\n  As my colleague from Michigan, Senator Levin, has so forcefully \nstated, the administration's penchant for secrecy threatens each and \nevery Senator's ability to do the people's business and undermines our \nrole in providing advice and consent to the President's nominees and \nundermines our role in conducting oversight into this administration. \nIn the end, what is most troubling is that the administration's culture \nof secrecy may breed further abuses, abuses we know of today, not \nbecause of but in spite of the administration's effort.\n  We must overcome these roadblocks put up by the administration \nbecause the job of protecting the homeland is too important. Judge \nChertoff will have enormous challenges if he assumes his new position, \nwhich I am confident he will. Border security, immigration, port \nsecurity, airport screening, protecting America's critical \ninfrastructure, and so much more will now fall under his purview. He \nhas pledged to work with the Congress in crafting the Department's \npolicies. As much as possible, this must be a nonpartisan exercise. \nWorking together, we can and we must put our country in the strongest \npossible position to defend itself for the many threats we face.\n  In short, what I am criticizing and complaining about, we have some \nemails from the FBI to the Justice Department, saying, in effect, how \nwe conduct our interrogations is appropriate. What the Department of \nDefense is doing with their brutality and their torture is wrong. I am \nconvinced that is true; the FBI was right. I hope somehow we will be \nable to get the names of these individuals and pursue it more carefully \nand also find out what the real words were; I am confident it was \ntorture. One thing we know clearly from these memos is that the FBI \nsays using our methods, the normal methods of interrogation, we are \ngetting more information from the enemy than you are while using your \nacts of violence.\n  I close by saying, again, I want this record spread with the fact \nthat Senator Levin has done a good thing for this country. He has done \ngood work again in allowing us to look at an issue that should be a \nsimple issue that has been made complicated by this administration by \nvirtue of their hiding what it should not.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the quorum call I \nam about to invoke be charged equally to both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burr). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, in a few moments we will be voting on the \nnomination of Judge Michael Chertoff to lead the Department of Homeland \nSecurity. I applaud President Bush for his outstanding choice, and I am \nconfident that Judge Chertoff will receive overwhelming support from \nboth sides of the aisle, making this his fourth confirmation by this \nbody, the Senate.\n  Judge Chertoff has a long and distinguished career in public service \nand law enforcement.\n  The Harvard Law magna cum laude first made his name in the mid-1980s \nputting away five of the biggest Mafia bosses in New York.\n  His success brought him the job of U.S. attorney in New Jersey where \nhe oversaw high-profile and politically sensitive prosecutions.\n  In 2001, Judge Chertoff was chosen by President Bush to lead the \nJustice Department's Criminal Division. It was there that Judge \nChertoff would show his full mettle. For the 20 hours following the \nattacks on 9/11, Judge Chertoff was central in directing our response.\n  His team in the Criminal Division traced the 9/11 killers back to al-\nQaida. And for the next 2 years, Judge Chertoff helped craft our \nantiterrorism policy.\n\n  His experience working directly with law enforcement, his expertise \nin homeland and national security, and his proven ability to lead in \ntimes of national crisis make him overwhelmingly qualified to direct \nour homeland security.\n  Judge Chertoff has said he will be proud to stand again with the men \nand women who form our front line against terror. I know I speak for \nmany when I say we are proud to have a man of his caliber and talent \nserving and protecting the American people.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is, Will the Senate advise and consent to the nomination \nof Michael Chertoff, of New Jersey, to be Secretary of Homeland \nSecurity?

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the attached \nstatement from the Office of Compliance be printed in the Record today \npursuant to section 304(b)(1) of the Congressional Accountability Act \nof 1995 (2 U.S.C. 1384(b)(1)).\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n        FROM THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF THE OFFICE OF COMPLIANCE\n\n     Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, and Request for Comments From \n       Interested Parties\n\n       NEW PROPOSED REGULATIONS IMPLEMENTING CERTAIN SUBSTANTIVE \n     EMPLOYMENT RIGHTS AND PROTECTIONS FOR VETERANS, AS REQUIRED \n     BY 2 U.S.C. 1316a, THE CONGRESSIONAL ACCOUNTABILITY ACT OF \n     1995, AS AMENDED (CAA).\n\n                               Background\n\n       The purpose of this Notice is to issue proposed substantive \n     regulations which will implement the 1998 amendment to the \n     CAA which applies certain veterans' employment rights and \n     protections to employing offices and employees covered by the \n     CAA.\n\n     What is the authority under the CAA for these proposed \n     substantive regulations? In 1998, the CAA was amended through \n     addition of 2 U.S.C. 1316a, a provision of the Veterans' \n     Employment Opportunities Act of 1998 (VEOA), which states in \n     relevant part: ``The rights and protections established under \n     section 2108, sections 3309 through 3312, and subchapter I of \n     chapter 35 of Title 5, shall apply to covered employees.'' As \n     will be described in greater detail below, these sections of \n     Title 5 accord certain hiring and retention rights to \n     veterans of the uniformed services. Section 1316a(4)(B) \n     states that ``The regulations issued . . . shall be the same \n     as the most relevant substantive regulations (applicable with \n     respect to the Executive Branch) promulgated to implement the \n     statutory provisions . . . except insofar as the Board may \n     determine for good cause shown and stated together with the \n     regulation, that a modification of such regulations would be \n     more effective for the implementation of the rights and \n     protections under this section.''\n\n     Will these regulations, if approved, apply to all employees \n     otherwise covered by the CAA? No. Subsection (5) of 2 U.S.C. \n     1316a, states that, for the purpose of application of these \n     veterans' employment rights, the term ``covered employee'' \n     shall not apply to any employee of an employing office: (A) \n     whose appointment is made by the President with the advice \n     and consent of the Senate; (B) whose appointment is made by a \n     Member of Congress or by a committee or subcommittee of \n     either House of Congress; or (C) who is appointed to a \n     position, the duties of which are equivalent to those of a \n     Senior Executive Service position. . . .'' These regulations \n     would apply to all other covered employees.\n\n     Do other veterans' employment rights apply via the CAA to \n     Legislative Branch employing offices and covered employees? \n     Yes. Another statutory scheme regarding veterans' and armed \n     forces members' employment rights is incorporated in part \n     through section 206 of the Congressional Accountability Act \n     of 1995 (CAA). Section 206 of the CAA, 2 U.S.C. 1316, applies \n     certain provisions of Title 38 of the U.S. Code regarding \n     ``Employment and Reemployment Rights of Members of the \n     Uniformed Services.'' Section 206 of the CAA also requires \n     the Board of Directors to issue substantive regulations \n     patterned upon the regulations promulgated by the Secretary \n     of Labor to implement the Title 38 rights of members of the \n     uniformed services. As of this date, the Secretary of Labor \n     has not finally promulgated any such regulations. Therefore, \n     regulations implementing CAA section 206 rights will not be \n     proposed by the Board until the Labor Department regulations \n     have been promulgated. The proposed regulations in this \n     Notice are not based on section 206 of the CAA, but solely on \n     the other veterans' rights referenced in 2 U.S.C. 1316a.\n\n     What are the veterans' employment rights applied to covered \n     employees and employing offices in 2 U.S.C. 1316a? In \n     recognition of their duty to country, sacrifice, and \n     exceptional capabilities and skills, the United States \n     government has accorded veterans a preference in federal \n     employment through a series of statutes and Executive Orders, \n     beginning as the Civil War drew to a close. While \n     interpreting regulations have been modified over time, many \n     of the current core statutory protections have remained \n     largely unchanged since they were first codified in the \n     historic Veterans' Preference Act of 1944, Act of June 27, \n     1944, ch. 287, 58 Stat. 387, amended and codified in various \n     provisions of Title 5, U.S.C. In 1998, Congress passed the \n     Veterans Employment Opportunities Act (``VEOA''), Pub. L. \n     105-339, 112 Stat. 3186 (October 31, 1998), which \n     ``strengthen[s] and broadens''(Sen. Rept. 105-340, 105 Cong., \n     2d Sess. at 19 (Sept. 21, 1998)) the rights and remedies \n     available to military veterans who are entitled to preferred \n     consideration in hiring and in retention during reductions in \n     force (``RIFs''). Among other provisions of the VEOA, \n     Congress clearly stated, in the law itself, that henceforth \n     the ``rights and protections'' of certain veterans' \n     preference law provisions, originally drafted to cover \n     certain Executive Branch employees, ``shall apply'' to \n     certain ``covered employees'' in the Legislative Branch. VEOA \n     Sec. Sec. 4(c)(1) and (5) (emphasis added).\n\n       The selected statutory sections which Congress determined \n     ``shall apply'' to covered employees in the Legislative \n     Branch include, first, a definitional section describing the \n     categories of military veterans who are entitled to \n     preference (``preference eligibles''). 5 U.S.C. Sec. 2108. \n     Generally, a veteran must be disabled or have served on \n     active duty in the Armed Forces during certain specified time \n     periods or in specified military campaigns to be entitled to \n     preference. In addition, certain family members (mainly \n     spouses, widow[er]s, and mothers) of preference eligible \n     veterans are entitled to the same rights and protections.\n       The VEOA also makes applicable to the Legislative Branch \n     certain statutory preferences in hiring. In the hiring \n     process, a preference eligible individual who is tested or \n     otherwise numerically evaluated for a position is entitled to \n     have either 5 or 10 points added to his/her score, depending \n     on his/her military service, or disabling condition. 5 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 3309. Where experience is a qualifying element for a \n     job, a preference eligible individual is entitled to credit \n     for having relevant experience in the military or in various \n     civil activities. 5 U.S.C. Sec. 3311. Where physical \n     requirements (age, height, weight) are a qualifying element \n     for a position, preference eligible individuals (including \n     those who are disabled) may obtain a waiver of such \n     requirements in certain circumstances. 5 U.S.C. Sec. 3512.\n       For certain positions (guards, elevator operators, \n     messengers, custodians), only preference eligible individuals \n     may be considered for hiring so long as such individuals are \n     available. 5 U.S.C. Sec. 3310. (These statutory provisions on \n     hiring in the Executive Branch apply specifically to the \n     competitive service; this point will be discussed further \n     below.)\n\n     Finally, in prescribing retention rights during Reductions In \n     Force for Executive Branch positions (in both the competitive \n     and in the excepted service), the sections in subchapter I of \n     chapter 35 of Title 5, U.S.C., with a slightly modified \n     definition of ``preference eligible,'' require that employing \n     agencies retain an employee with retention preference in \n     preference to other competing employees, provided that the \n     employee's performance has not been rated unacceptable. 5 \n     U.S.C. Sec. 3502(c) (emphasis added).\n\n       Along with this explicit command to retain qualifying \n     employees with retention preference, agencies are to follow \n     regulations governing the release of competing employees, \n     giving ``due effect'' to the following factors: (a) \n     employment tenure (i.e., type of appointment); (b) veterans' \n     preference; (c) length of service; and, (d) performance \n     ratings. 5 U.S.C. Sec. 3502(a). 5 U.S.C. Sec. 3502 also \n     requires certain notification procedures, providing, inter \n     alia, that an employing agency must provide an employee with \n     60 days written notice (the period may be reduced in certain \n     circumstances) prior to being released during a RIF. 5 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 3502(d)(1). Certain protections also apply in connection \n     with a transfer of agency functions from one agency to \n     another. 5 U.S.C. Sec. 3503. In addition, where physical \n     requirements (age, height, weight) are a qualifying element \n     for retention, preference eligible individuals (including \n     those with disabilities) may obtain a waiver of such \n     requirements in certain circumstances. 5 U.S.C. Sec. 3504.\n\n     Are there veterans' employment regulations already in force \n     under the CAA? No.\n\n                          Procedurals Summary\n\n     How are substantive regulations proposed and approved under \n     the CAA? Pursuant to section 304 of the CAA, 2 U.S.C. 1384, \n     the procedure for promulgating such substantive regulations \n     requires that: (1) the Board of Directors adopt proposed \n     substantive regulations and publish a general notice of \n     proposed rulemaking in the Congressional Record; (2) there be \n     a comment period of at least 30 days after the date of \n     publication of the general notice of proposed rulemaking; (3) \n     after consideration of comments by the Board of Directors, \n     that the Board adopt regulations and transmit notice of such \n     action together with the regulations and a recommendation \n     regarding the method for Congressional approval of the \n     regulations to the\n\n[[Page S1389]]\n\n     Speaker of the House and President pro tempore of the Senate \n     for publication in the Congressional Record; (4) committee \n     referral and action on the proposed regulations by resolution \n     in each House, concurrent resolution, or by joint resolution; \n     and (5) final publication of the approved regulations in the \n     Congressional Record, with an effective date prescribed in \n     the final publication. For more detail, please reference the \n     text of 2 U.S.C. 1384. This Notice of Proposed Rulemaking is \n     step (1) of the outline set forth above.\n\n     Are these proposed regulations also recommended by the Office \n     of Compliance's Executive Director, the Deputy Executive \n     Director for the House of Representatives, and the Deputy \n     Executive Director for the Senate? As required by section \n     304(b)(1) of the CAA, 2 U.S.C. 1384(b)(1), the substance of \n     these regulations is also recommended by the Executive \n     Director, the Deputy Executive Director for the House of \n     Representatives and the Acting Deputy Executive Director for \n     the Senate.\n\n     Has the Board of Directors previously proposed substantive \n     regulations implementing these veterans' employment rights \n     and benefits pursuant to 2 U.S.C. 1316a? Yes. On February 28, \n     2000, and March 9, 2000, the Office published an Advanced \n     Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (``ANPR'') in the Congressional \n     Record (144 Cong. Rec. S862 (daily ed., Feb. 28, 2000), H916 \n     (daily ed., March 9, 2000)). On December 6, 2001, upon \n     consideration of the comments to the ANPR, the Office \n     published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (``NPR'') in the \n     Congressional Record ( 147 Cong. Rec. S12539 (daily ed. Dec. \n     6, 2001), H9065 (daily ed. Dec. 6, 2001)). The Board has not \n     acted further on those earlier Notices, and has decided to \n     issue this Notice as the first step in a new effort to \n     promulgate implementing regulations.\n       As noted above, 2 U.S.C. 1316a mandates application to the \n     Legislative Branch of certain statutory provisions originally \n     drafted for the Executive Branch. In its initial proposed \n     rules, the Board noted that this statutory command raised the \n     quandary of determining which Legislative Branch employees \n     should be covered by which statutory provisions. There are \n     longstanding and significant differences between the \n     personnel policies and practices within these two branches. \n     For instance, the Executive Branch distinguishes between \n     employees in the ``competitive service'' and the ``excepted \n     service,'' often with differing personnel rules applying to \n     these two services. The Legislative Branch has no such \n     dichotomy.\n       When Congress directed in the VEOA that certain veterans' \n     employment rights and protections currently applicable to \n     Executive Branch employees shall be made applicable to \n     Legislative Branch employees, the Board took note of a \n     central distinction made in the underlying statute: certain \n     veterans' preference protections (regarding hiring) applied \n     only to Executive Branch employees in the ``competitive'' \n     service, while others (governing reductions in force and \n     transfers) applied both to the ``competitive'' and \n     ``excepted'' service.\n       The Board's initial approach in 2000 was to maintain this \n     distinction by attempting to discern which Legislative Branch \n     employees should be considered as working in positions \n     equivalent to the ``competitive'' service, and which should \n     be considered equivalent to the ``excepted'' service. At that \n     point, the Board concluded that all Legislative Branch \n     employees, with certain possible exceptions (such as those of \n     the Office of the Architect of the Capitol) should be \n     considered excepted service employees. The Board therefore \n     issued regulations, closely following Office of Personnel \n     Management (``OPM'') regulations for the various statutory \n     provisions, with the caveat that the regulations governing \n     hiring would apply only to those employees whom the Board \n     currently deemed working at jobs equivalent to the \n     competitive service (e.g. the Office of the Architect of the \n     Capitol). The NPR acknowledged: ``The Board recognizes that \n     the adoption of these definitions (e.g., competitive and \n     excepted services], consistent with the mandate of section \n     225 [of the CAA], yields an unusual result in that no \n     ``covered employee'' in the Legislative Branch currently \n     satisfies the definition of ``competitive service.'' \n     Moreover, as the substantive protections of veterans'' \n     preference in Legislative Branch appointment apply only to \n     ``competitive service' positions, the regulations which \n     the Board proposes regarding preference in appointment \n     would with one noted exception [employees appointed under \n     the Architect of the Capitol Human Resources Act], \n     currently apply to no one. . . .'' This left the Board in \n     the position of drafting intricate regulations that may \n     have applied to only a minority of ``covered employees,'' \n     or perhaps even to no ``covered employees'' at all--a \n     result in obvious tension with the VEOA's statutory \n     mandate that these veterans' protections ``shall apply'' \n     to ``covered employees'' in the Legislative Branch.\n       The Board received Comments to its initial proposed \n     regulations from the Office of the Architect of the Capitol, \n     the Office of House Employment Counsel, and the Office of the \n     Senate Chief Counsel for Employment, all finding fault with \n     the initial approach. The Comments generally included the \n     following observations. First, commenting offices noted that \n     the Board's approach of drafting intricate regulations that \n     may not apply to any covered employees creates more problems \n     than it solves. This approach was seen as ``impracticable,'' \n     ``obfuscating'' the true sense of the VEOA and what \n     requirements in fact must apply to employing offices; it was \n     seen, in effect, as an attempt to ``place a square peg in a \n     round hole.'' Others charged that the adoption of such \n     regulations went beyond the Board's statutory authorization, \n     and would require, without basis in law, the employing \n     offices to adopt complicated procedures, some governing \n     employment decisions that affected only non-veteran \n     applicants or employees. A commenting office also complained \n     about the application of terms ``foreign and inapplicable'' \n     to its personnel system. Employing offices also submitted \n     that statutes drafted for the Executive Branch competitive \n     service should not apply at all to any Legislative Branch \n     employee.\n       Furthermore, one employing office commented that such \n     modification of OPM regulations does not constitute an \n     adoption of the ``most relevant regulations,'' as regulations \n     that apply to no covered employees can not possibly be the \n     most relevant regulations applicable. As another commenting \n     office aptly put it, ``Unfortunately, the unintended result \n     could very well be that the underlying principles of the \n     veterans' preference laws would lie fallow while the affected \n     legislative branch entities struggle with the task of \n     adopting civil-service type personnel management systems.'' \n     Comments of the Office of House Employment Counsel, Feb. 6, \n     2002 at 9. Additionally, all three employing offices argued \n     that the Board should issue three individual sets of \n     regulations (to pertain to the Senate, House, and covered \n     Congressional instrumentalities), rather than one set. \n     Finally, the Office of the Architect of the Capitol also \n     argued that the Architect of the Capitol Human Resources Act \n     did not create a competitive service in the sense of the \n     veterans' preference laws.\n\n     How are the regulations being proposed in this Notice \n     different from those regulations which the Board previously \n     proposed? In the period since the initial proposed \n     regulations were issued by the Board of Directors and \n     commented upon by various stakeholders, the Office of \n     Compliance has engaged in extensive informal discussions with \n     various stakeholders across Congress and the Legislative \n     Branch, in an effort to ascertain how best to effect the \n     basic purposes of veterans' employment rights in the \n     Legislative Branch.\n       After careful consultation and deliberation, the Board is \n     issuing new proposed regulations which differ in many \n     respects from the initial proposed regulations. The new \n     approach is responsive to the clear statutory mandate \n     contained in the VEOA, and to various Comments regarding the \n     initial proposed regulations. This approach also applies \n     insights gained from the informal discussions with \n     stakeholders.\n       The Board has decided to apply the plain language of the \n     statutory provisions to all covered employees in the \n     Legislative Branch. By doing so, the Board avoids what \n     commenting employing offices styled as the ``anomaly'' of \n     complicated regulations which would practically apply to no \n     employees, an anomaly which not only poorly served the clear \n     Congressional intent that protections ``shall apply to \n     covered employees,'' but which also created confusion for the \n     employing offices.\n       Not only is application of these rights to all covered \n     employees compelled by the plain language of the statute, the \n     legislative history of the VEOA also clearly indicates that \n     the principles of veterans' preference protections must be \n     applied in the Legislative Branch. The authoritative report \n     of the Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs (Senate Report \n     105-340, pages 15 & 17), recognized that the competitive \n     service did not exist in the Legislative Branch, and that 2 \n     U.S.C. 1316a did not require the establishment of such a \n     competitive service. Nonetheless, the Committee noted that \n     veterans' preference principles should be incorporated into \n     the Legislative Branch personnel systems.\n       For these reasons, the Board is persuaded that Congress, in \n     enacting the VEOA's extension of veterans' employment rights \n     to the Legislative Branch, intended a broad application to \n     all CAA covered employees, except for the staff of those \n     employing offices in the House of Representatives and the \n     Senate which Congress specifically excluded from coverage in \n     section 206a(5) of the CAA (2 U.S.C. Sec. 1316a(5)).This \n     result is faithful to the statutory language. Furthermore, \n     the Board has concluded, for the reasons stated above, that \n     the most relevant substantive Executive Branch OPM \n     regulations are at times inapposite to a meaningful \n     implementation of the VEOA in the Legislative Branch, such \n     that a modification of the regulations is necessary for the \n     effective implementation of the rights and protections under \n     the VEOA. As a result, the Office is proposing regulations \n     that reflect the principles of the veterans' preference laws, \n     as discussed by the Senate Committee on Veterans Affairs, \n     without linking such coverage to employees or positions with \n     competitive service status.\n       Furthermore, the Board has also taken note of the \n     legislative history suggesting that employing offices with \n     employees covered by the VEOA should create systems \n     incorporating these veterans' preference principles: ``The \n     Committee notes that the requirement that veterans' \n     preference principles be extended to the legislative and \n     judicial branches does not mandate the creation of civil \n     service-type evaluation or scoring systems by these hiring \n     entities. It does require, however, that they create systems \n     that are consistent with the underlying principles of \n     veterans' preference laws.'' Sen.\n\n[[Page S1390]]\n\n     Comm. Report at 17. The implementation of that provision in \n     the Senate Report can only be accomplished by the employing \n     offices.\n       In their Comments, employing offices strongly expressed \n     their need to preserve their autonomy in determining and \n     administering their respective personnel systems. For \n     example, the Office of the Architect of the Capitol commented \n     that it was incumbent upon the employing offices to create \n     ``systems that are consistent with the underlying principles \n     of veterans'' preference laws,'' pursuant to the Senate \n     Committee Report. The Board agrees, and the newly proposed \n     regulations allow employing offices to do so. What the \n     regulations also do is clearly define the ``underlying \n     principles of veterans'' preference laws'' made applicable to \n     these employing offices, so as to provide a benchmark for the \n     employing offices, applicants, and covered employees, as to \n     whether the systems developed are consistent with these \n     principles.\n\n     What is the approach taken by these revamped proposed \n     substantive regulations? The Board has taken great heed to \n     avoid the intricate, OPM-like regulations that formed the \n     basis for its first proposed regulations. Under the current \n     proposed regulations, employing offices will retain their \n     wide latitude, not similarly enjoyed by many employing \n     agencies in the Executive Branch, to devise and administer \n     their own unique and often flexible personnel systems. \n     However, employing offices with covered employees must \n     incorporate into these individual personnel systems the basic \n     veterans' preference protections under the specific statutory \n     mandate that Congress issued in the VEOA, and they must carry \n     out the administration of these veterans' preference \n     provisions in a manner consistent with the Board's commitment \n     to promoting administrative transparency and accountability.\n       Under this approach, employing offices with the specified \n     covered employees must meet the requirements contained in the \n     statutory mandate of the VEOA, but need not necessarily adopt \n     any of the trappings of an OPM-like personnel system. Thus, \n     should such an employing office choose to administer numeric \n     evaluations of applicants for a position, it must add to a \n     preference eligible's evaluation the points called for in the \n     veterans' preference statutes. If it does not numerically \n     evaluate applicants, it must determine how it will factor \n     veterans' preference status into its employee evaluations and \n     hiring decisions at a level commensurate with the statutory \n     directive. Similarly, should an employing office currently \n     have a policy of placing covered employees who may be \n     potentially subject to a reduction in force on a retention \n     register, it must rank said employees taking into account the \n     directives of the veterans' preference statute. Should an \n     employing office elect not to keep formal retention \n     registers, nothing in these regulations requires it to start \n     doing so. It still must, however, follow the statutory \n     mandate to provide certain veterans' preferences in the \n     course of a reduction in force that affects employees covered \n     by the VEOA.\n       The goal of preserving employing office autonomy in \n     fashioning personnel systems has further compelled the Board \n     to minimize the impact of these proposed regulations on \n     employment decisions not directly involving preference \n     eligibles. Thus, unlike the initial proposed regulations, \n     should an employing office properly determine that no \n     preference eligibles are qualified applicants, or that no \n     preference eligibles are subject to a RIF, these proposed \n     regulations are designed so as not to govern the employment \n     decisions taken by the employing office. By allowing for such \n     employing office autonomy, the Board hopes to allay the \n     concerns of some of the employing offices, expressed in the \n     initial Comments, that a ``morass'' of intricate regulations \n     would apply to decisions that did not affect preference \n     eligibles. (One isolated, but necessary exception to this \n     approach limiting the effect of the regulations to personnel \n     actions involving preference eligibles is proposed \n     Sec. 1.115, governing the transfer of functions between one \n     employing office and another, and the replacement of one \n     employing office by another. This section provides \n     protections for all covered employees, as the term is defined \n     and limited in the VEOA, including non-preference eligibles. \n     The clear statutory language of 5 U.S.C. Sec. 3503 (applying \n     to both the competitive and excepted services) commands this \n     result. Congress chose to include this broad statutory \n     provision in the set of provisions made applicable to the \n     Legislative Branch in the VEOA.)\n       The overall discretion and autonomy reserved to employing \n     offices to administer veterans' preference protections within \n     the context of their personnel systems comes with a \n     responsibility on the part of the employing offices to \n     provide all applicants for covered positions and all covered \n     employees with certain notice and informational rights, as \n     discussed below. This is to ensure that employing offices are \n     equipped with all information necessary to determine and \n     administer veterans' preference eligibility and that such \n     applicants and employees are properly informed of how their \n     employing office has chosen to give life to the veterans' \n     preference protections.\n       In sum, should an employing offices already use personnel \n     policies and procedures similar to those in the competitive \n     service, it must factor in the various veterans' preference \n     protections with respect to applicants for covered positions \n     and covered employees. If an employing office chooses to \n     follow more flexible, or merely different, personnel policies \n     from those referenced in the competitive service, it may do \n     so--but may not refuse to apply the veterans' preferences \n     called for in the statute. This would contravene the clear \n     statutory directive to affirmatively apply the veterans' \n     preference protections to the specified covered employees in \n     the Legislative Branch.\n       In proposing these regulations, the Board has sought to \n     remain faithful to the explicit statutory language of the \n     VEOA. In some cases, we have been guided by OPM veterans' \n     preference implementing regulations. In many cases, ``for \n     good cause shown,'' we have not adopted the OPM regulations \n     so as to tailor simpler and more streamlined regulations. We \n     have issued proposed regulations based on the direct \n     statutory language whenever possible, reserving \n     implementation to the individual employing offices, who then \n     are charged with crafting their own processes and procedures \n     for integrating veterans' preference protections within their \n     personnel systems.\n       Therefore, in accord with 2 U.S.C.1316a(4)(B), which \n     mandates that ``the Board may determine, for good cause shown \n     and stated . . . a modification of such regulations would be \n     more effective for the implementation of the rights and \n     protections under this section,'' these proposed regulations \n     may not track the most relevant substantive regulations \n     applicable with respect to the Executive Branch. However, the \n     proposed regulations endeavor, to the maximum practical \n     extent, to effect the veterans' preference principles that \n     Congress made applicable to the Legislative Branch through \n     section 206a(2) of the CAA, 2 U.S.C. Sec. 1316a(2).\n\n     What responsibilities would employing offices have in \n     effectively implementing these regulations? The Board is \n     charging the employing offices with the responsibility of \n     duly factoring the veterans' preference principles into their \n     individualized hiring and retention processes. We will \n     require that such measures be substantive and verifiable. \n     Otherwise, VEOA implementation would be illusory and the \n     Office's remedial responsibility under 2 U.S.C.1316a(3) might \n     be compromised.\n       Therefore, the proposed regulations would require that all \n     employing offices with covered employees or seeking \n     applicants for covered positions develop a written \n     program, within 120 days of the Congressional approval of \n     the regulations, setting forth each employing office's \n     modality for effecting the veterans' preference principles \n     in its hiring and retention systems. These programs would \n     demonstrate each employing office's efforts to comply with \n     the VEOA. However, technical promulgation of such \n     procedures does not per se relieve an employing office of \n     substantive compliance with the VEOA.\n       Similarly, Subpart E of the proposed regulations contains \n     various important provisions governing recordkeeping, \n     dissemination of VEOA policies, written notice prior to a \n     RIF, and informational requirements regarding veterans' \n     preference determinations. Certain of these provisions \n     (notably that requiring written notice prior to a RIF) derive \n     directly from statutory provisions made applicable to covered \n     employees by the VEOA. The Board has adopted others so as to \n     ensure that the employing offices, which have significant \n     autonomy and discretion in integrating the veterans' \n     preference requirements into their personnel systems, \n     administer the preferences in a way that promotes \n     accountability and transparency. In response to the earlier \n     Comments of the employing offices, however, the Board has \n     refrained from adopting more burdensome procedural \n     requirements, such as keeping formal retention registers (see \n     5 CFR Sec. 351.505).\n\n     Are there substantive differences in the proposed regulations \n     for the House of Representatives, the Senate, and the other \n     employing offices? No. The Board of Directors has identified \n     no ``good cause'' for varying the text of these regulations. \n     Therefore, if these proposed regulations are approved as \n     proposed, there will be one text applicable to all employing \n     offices and covered employees.\n\n     Are these proposed substantive regulations available to \n     persons with disabilities in an alternate format? This Notice \n     of Proposed Regulations is available on the Office of \n     Compliance web site, www.compliance.gov, which is compliant \n     with section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 as \n     amended, 29 U.S.C. 794d.

The CAA applies the rights and protections of 11 \n     federal labor and employment statutes to covered employees \n     and employing offices within the Legislative Branch of \n     Government. The CAA was amended by adding 2 U.S.C. 1316a as \n     part of the enactment of the Veterans' Employment \n     Opportunities Act of 1998 (VEOA), PL 105-339, section 4(c), \n     to provide additional substantive employment rights for \n     veterans. Those additional rights are the subject of these \n     regulations. Section 301 of the CAA (2 U.S.C. 1381) \n     establishes the Office of Compliance as an independent office \n     within the Legislative Branch.\n\n    More Detailed Discussion of the Text of the Proposed Regulations\n\n\n    subpart a--matters of general applicability to all regulations \n                promulgated under section 4 of the veoa\n\n       1.101  Purpose and scope. This section clarifies that the \n     purpose of these regulations is to ensure that the principles \n     of the veterans' preference laws are integrated into the \n     employing offices' existing employment and retention policies \n     and processes, as per the explicit statutory mandate \n     contained in the VEOA. Additionally, through these \n     regulations, the Board seeks to fulfill its goal of achieving \n     transparency in the application of veterans' preference in \n     covered appointment and retention decisions.\n       Finally, it is noted that nothing in these regulations \n     shall be construed to require an employing office to reduce \n     any existing veterans' preference rights and protections that \n     it may currently afford to preference eligible individuals. \n     Any employing agencies that currently provide greater \n     veterans' preferences than required by these regulations may \n     retain them. Note also that, while the VEOA does not directly \n     cover the GAO, GPO, or Library of Congress, should Congress \n     extend Board jurisdiction over any of these entities in the \n     future, it should take their existing veterans' preference \n     policies into account, which may be based on independent \n     statutory mandates. Note, for example, that 31 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 732(h)(1) already mandates that the GAO must afford \n     veterans' preferences (largely similar to those in subchapter \n     I of chapter 35 of title 5 U.S.C.).\n       1.102  General definitions. This section provides \n     straightforward definitions of key terms referred to in the \n     regulations. Several of the definitions are derived from the \n     statutory provisions made applicable via the VEOA, including \n     ``veteran,'' from 5 U.S.C. Sec. 2108(1), ``disabled veteran'' \n     from 5 U.S.C. Sec. 2108(2), and ``preference eligible'' from \n     5 U.S.C. Sec. 2108(3). It also contains several other \n     definitions included for explanatory purposes.\n       The term ``appointment'' is defined as an individual's \n     appointment to employment in a covered position. Consistent \n     with the OPM regulations in 5 C.F.R. Sec. 211.102(c), the \n     term excludes inservice placement actions such as promotions. \n     The term ``covered employee'' follows the language of section \n     101(3) of the CAA, as limited by section 4(c)(5) of the VEOA. \n     Section 4(c)(5) of the VEOA excludes employees whose \n     appointment is made by a committee or subcommittee of either \n     House of Congress. The Board believes this statutory \n     exclusion extends to joint committees and has expressly \n     excluded such employees from the definition of ``covered \n     employee''.\n       The term ``qualified applicant,'' while not directly \n     originating in the text of U.S.C. Title V, is used to capture \n     the principle in 5 U.S.C. Sec. 3309 that only a preference \n     eligible applicant who has received a passing grade in an \n     examination or evaluation for entrance into the competitive \n     service need receive additional points accorded to his or her \n     application (except for certain ``restricted'' positions, \n     discussed below). ``Qualified applicant'' is borrowed from \n     the Americans with Disabilities Act (``ADA,'' 42 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 12101 et seq.) as applied by section 102(a)(3) of the \n     CAA, 2 U.S.C. Sec. 1302(a)(3). The ADA's reference to \n     ``requisite skill, experience, education and other minimum \n     job-related requirements'' has been shortened to ``requisite \n     minimum job-related requirements,'' as not every job may \n     require a particular level of acquired skill, experience, or \n     education.\n       As will be discussed further, we are not requiring an \n     employing office to establish any particular prerequisites or \n     type of evaluation or examination system for applicants. \n     Instead, the term ``qualified applicant'' serves as a means \n     of implementing the statutory mandate that only preference \n     eligible applicants with ``passing scores'' receive \n     preference in the hiring process in the context of \n     appointment processes that do not involve ``scoring'' or \n     similar numeric evaluation.\n       Where the employing office does not use a numerically \n     scored entrance examination or evaluation, we have authorized \n     the employing office to make the determination of whether the \n     applicant is minimally ``qualified'' for a covered position. \n     In doing so, the employing office may rely on any job-related \n     requirements or on any evaluation system, formal or \n     otherwise, which it chooses to employ in assessing and rating \n     applicants for covered positions, provided that the employing \n     office in no way seeks to create or manipulate a standard as \n     to whether an applicant is ``qualified'' so as to avoid \n     obligations imposed upon it by the VEOA.\n       If, however, the employing office uses an entrance \n     examination or evaluation that is numerically scored, the \n     term ``qualified applicant'' shall mean that the applicant \n     has obtained a passing score on the examination or \n     evaluation. The Board notes that it expects the level of \n     ``passing scores'' to be roughly comparable to that in the \n     OPM regulations (70 points on a 100 point scale; 5 CFR \n     Sec. 337.101). We are not requiring employing offices to \n     administer entrance exams at all, or to model an exam or the \n     grading thereof after OPM's models. However, employing \n     offices may not set the bar on a scored entrance examination \n     or evaluation for a covered position so high that minimally \n     qualified preference eligible applicants cannot pass. \n     Moreover, the determination of what will constitute a \n     ``passing score'' should be made and communicated to \n     applicants before they are evaluated or sit for the entrance \n     examination.\n       1.103  Adoption of regulations. This section details the \n     process by which the regulations shall be adopted. It also \n     clarifies that, as discussed extensively in the prefatory \n     comments, supra, the Board has at times deviated from the \n     regulations which otherwise were most applicable, i.e. the \n     regulations issued by OPM implementing these selected \n     provisions of U.S.C. Title V. When the Board has so deviated \n     from the OPM regulations, it has done so in an effort to \n     implement the statutory language of the VEOA in a way that \n     respects the autonomy of employing offices' personnel systems \n     and avoids placing undue administrative burdens upon these \n     offices, and that otherwise respects the legislative intent \n     of the VEOA.\n       1.104  Coordination with section 225 of the Congressional \n     Accountability Act. This section notes that the VEOA requires \n     that regulations promulgated are consistent with section 225 \n     of the CAA. These proposed regulations are consistent with \n     section 225; the regulations follow CAA principles contained \n     therein, including applying CAA definitions and exemptions, \n     and reserving enforcement through CAA procedures, rather than \n     through recourse to the Executive Branch.\n\n\n          subpart b--veterans' preference--general provisions\n\n       1.105  Responsibility for administration of veterans' \n     preference. This section clarifies that employing offices \n     have responsibility for administering veterans' preference, \n     within the parameters of the VEOA and these regulations.\n       1.106  Procedures for bringing claims under the VEOA. This \n     section establishes the procedures for contesting an adverse \n     determination.\n\n\n            subpart c--veterans' preference in appointments\n\n       1.107  Veterans' preference in appointments to restricted \n     covered positions. The VEOA makes 5 U.S.C. Sec. 3310 \n     applicable to the Legislative Branch, thereby extending an \n     absolute preference to veterans who apply for the positions \n     of guard, elevator operator, messenger and custodian. Despite \n     concerns raised by certain employing offices regarding the \n     singling out of these particular positions, the Board may not \n     ignore the statutory requirement that veterans who apply for \n     them be afforded an absolute preference over non-veteran \n     applicants.\n       We have based our definitions of the restricted position \n     terms ``guards,'' ``elevator operators,'' ``custodians,'' and \n     ``messengers,'' upon the definitions employed in the \n     veterans'' preference context by the U.S. Office of Personnel \n     Management in its ``Delegated Examining Operations \n     Handbook.'' See http://www.opm.gov/deu/Handbook_2003. The \n     definitions of custodian and messenger have been modified to \n     include a ``primary duty'' requirement, to allow the \n     performance of some custodial or messenger duties in \n     positions having other primary duties without transforming \n     those positions into restricted positions.\n       1.108  Veterans' preference in appointments to non-\n     restricted covered positions. This section clarifies that \n     preference eligible status is an affirmative factor in the \n     hiring process for covered positions. The requirement that \n     preference eligible status be applied as an ``affirmative \n     factor'' is derived from the directive of the VEOA that \n     the underlying principles of the veterans' preference laws \n     be applied within the Legislative Branch.\n       Where an employing office assigns points to applicants \n     competing for appointment to a covered position, it should \n     add commensurate points for veterans' preference eligible \n     applicants consistent with 5 U.S.C. Sec. 3309, one of the \n     sections made applicable to the Legislative Branch by the \n     VEOA. Should the office choose not to conduct formal \n     evaluations on a point scale, it must apply veterans' \n     preference as an affirmative factor, to\n\n[[Page S1392]]\n\n     a degree consistent with the level of preference applied in 5 \n     U.S.C. Sec. 3309.\n       In no way does this require the creation of any particular \n     type of system of examining or evaluating applicants, and an \n     employing office may properly choose to not assign points at \n     all to applications for covered positions. Rather, this \n     regulation merely states that, whatever system the employing \n     office uses to choose among qualified applicants for a \n     covered position, it must accord a level of preference to \n     preference eligible qualified applicants consistent with the \n     point system indicated in the statute. Thus, the preference \n     must be comparable to affording an additional 5 or 10 points \n     (depending on the status of the preference eligible) on a 100 \n     point scale to qualified applicants, while understanding that \n     under such a point system the applicant must have attained at \n     least 70 points to be considered qualified. (OPM provides a \n     scale for converting other point scales (5 point, 10 point, \n     25 point, etc.) to a 100-point scale.)\n       Section  1.108 applies to both restricted and non-\n     restricted positions. While restricted positions are limited \n     to preference eligibles (should there be preference eligible \n     applicants), in the event that more than one preference \n     eligible applies, the employing office should apply the \n     requirement in this section to provide a higher preference to \n     a disabled preference eligible. Thus, 5 U.S.C. Sec. 3310, \n     while restricting certain positions to preference eligibles \n     (so long as preference eligibles are available), does not \n     except these positions from this requirement in 5 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 3309 to provide higher preference to a disabled \n     preference eligible applicant.\n       1.109  Crediting experience in appointments to covered \n     positions. This language is taken from 5 CFR Sec. 337.101(c), \n     which interprets 5 U.S.C. Sec. 3311, one of the sections made \n     applicable to the Legislative Branch by the VEOA. We have \n     elected to use the regulatory language as it is more clearly \n     written, and serves to better guide employing offices than \n     does the direct statutory text. The statutory and regulatory \n     provisions are laid out below for an easy comparison:\n\n\n  sec. 3311. preference eligibles; examinations; crediting experience\n\n       In examinations for the competitive service in which \n     experience is an element of qualification, a preference \n     eligible is entitled to credit--\n       (1) for service in the armed forces when his employment in \n     a similar vocation to that for which examined was interrupted \n     by the service; and\n       (2) for all experience material to the position for which \n     examined, including experience gained in religious, civic, \n     welfare, service, and organizational activities, regardless \n     of whether he received pay therefor.\n\n\n                           5 u.s.c. Sec. 3311\n\n       (c) When experience is a factor in determining eligibility, \n     OPM shall credit a preference eligible with:\n       (1) Time spent in the military service (i) as an extension \n     of time spent in the position in which he was employed \n     immediately before his entrance into the military service, or \n     (ii) on the basis of actual duties performed in the military \n     service, or (iii) as a combination of both methods. OPM shall \n     credit time spent in the military service according to the \n     method that will be of most benefit to the preference \n     eligible.\n       (2) All valuable experience, including experience gained in \n     religious, civic, welfare, service, and organizational \n     activities, regardless of whether pay was received therefor.\n       5 CFR Sec. 337.101(c). Section 1.109 does not require an \n     employing office to consider experience as an element of \n     qualification, but only requires that preference eligibles be \n     afforded credit for certain experience if the employing \n     office chooses to do so. Also, section 1.109 does not \n     preclude an employing office from granting credit for \n     experience to non-preference eligibles, so long as the credit \n     afforded preference eligibles complies with the VEOA. Note \n     also that section 1.109 of these proposed regulations applies \n     equally to restricted and non-restricted positions.\n       Section 1.110  Waiver of physical requirements in \n     appointments to covered positions. This section contains \n     language derived directly from 5 U.S.C. Sec. 3312, one of the \n     sections made applicable to the Legislative Branch by the \n     VEOA. It requires an employing office to waive physical \n     requirements for a position if it determines, after \n     considering any recommendations of an accredited physician \n     that may be submitted by such an applicant, that he or she is \n     physically able to perform efficiently the duties of the \n     position. Note that OPM has chosen to promulgate regulations \n     interpreting 5 U.S.C. Sec. 3312 which make clear that: \n     ``[A]gencies must waive a medical standard or physical \n     requirement established under this part when there is \n     sufficient evidence that an applicant or employee, with or \n     without reasonable accommodation, can perform the essential \n     duties of the position without endangering the health and \n     safety of the individual or others.''\n       5 CFR 339.204. The Board does not believe that these \n     proposed regulations are the proper vehicle for issuing \n     regulations concerning the Americans with Disabilities Act \n     (``ADA,'' 42 U.S.C. Sec. 12101 et seq.) as applied by section \n     102(a)(3) of the CAA, 2 U.S.C. Sec. 1302(a)(3). Therefore, \n     section 1.110(a)(2) tracks the statutory language rather than \n     the OPM regulation. It also clarifies that the employing \n     office need consider a recommendation of an accredited \n     physician only if such a recommendation is submitted by the \n     preference eligible.\n       The Board does note, however, that Congress passed the ADA \n     subsequent to the veterans' preference protections contained \n     in 5 U.S.C. Sec. 3312, and that, under the ADA as applied by \n     the CAA, employing offices may have obligations towards \n     applicants that may in some circumstances be greater than the \n     protections accorded preference eligible applicants in 5 \n     U.S.C. Sec. 3312. For example, these regulations do not \n     relieve employing offices from complying with the \n     restrictions imposed on disability-based inquiries under the \n     ADA but, as is discussed in the comments to section 1.118, \n     recognize that an employing office may use information \n     obtained through voluntary self-identification of one's \n     disabled status. Accordingly, the Board has made clear in \n     section 1.110 that nothing in this section shall relieve an \n     employing office of any greater obligation it may have \n     pursuant to the ADA.\n\n\n         subpart d--veteran's preference in reductions in force\n\n       1.111  Definitions applicable in reductions in force. This \n     section provides definitions of several terms used in the \n     regulations applying veterans' preference principles in the \n     context of reductions in force. Unless clearly stated \n     otherwise, the general definitions in proposed regulation \n     1.102 continue to apply in the context of reductions in \n     force. For example, as used in the proposed reduction in \n     force regulations, the term ``covered employee'' excludes \n     employees whose appointment is made by a Member of Congress \n     or by a committee or subcommittee of either House of Congress \n     or a joint committee of the House of Representatives and the \n     Senate and other employees excluded under the proposed \n     regulation 1.202(f). The term ``reduction in force'' has been \n     defined to encompass actions that result in termination of \n     employment, reductions in grade or demotions expected to \n     continue for more than 30 days. This definition derives from \n     OPM regulations, which clearly interpret 5 U.S.C. Sec. 3502 \n     to include demotions and include the requirement that the \n     personnel action be for more than 30 days [5 CFR Sec. 351.201 \n     (a)(2)], and from the statutory provisions of the VEOA that \n     charge the Board to follow OPM's regulations except where the \n     Board may determine that a modification of those regulations \n     would be more effective for the implementation of the rights \n     and protections under the VEOA. Caselaw interpreting the \n     veterans' preference laws also indicates that the inclusion \n     of demotions in what constitutes a reduction in force stems \n     from statutory, not just regulatory, language. (See, e.g., \n     AFGE Local 1904 v. Resor, 442 F. 2d 993, 994 (3rd Cir. 1971); \n     Alder v. U.S., 129 Ct. Cl. 150 (1954).)\n       5 U.S.C. Sec. 3501, which has been included in the CAA \n     through Section (c)(2) of the VEOA, contains special \n     definitions for determining whether an employee is a \n     ``preference eligible'' for purposes of applying veterans' \n     preference in reductions in force. The definitions that \n     appear in section 1.111(b) of the regulations are taken \n     directly from the statutory language in 5 U.S.C. Sec. 3501. \n     Note, however, that these definitions do not apply to the \n     application of the provisions of 5 U.S.C. Sec. 3504 (and \n     section 1.114 of these regulations) regarding the waiver of \n     physical requirements in determining qualifications for \n     retention. In that context, the definition of ``preference \n     eligible'' set forth in 5 U.S.C. Sec. 2108 (and section \n     1.102(o) of the Board's regulations) shall apply.\n       As discussed below, 5 U.S.C. Sec. 3502(c) provides that \n     preference eligibles are entitled to retention over other \n     ``competing employees''. In the Executive Branch, the \n     question of who are ``competing employees'' is answered by \n     reference to detailed and rather complex retention registers \n     that Executive Branch agencies are required to maintain. \n     (See, e.g., 5 CFR Sec. 351.203, 5 CFR Sec. 351.404 and 5 CFR \n     Sec. 351.501.) The Comments to our initial proposed \n     regulations noted that few if any employing offices in the \n     Legislative Branch maintain retention registers, and that \n     many of the OPM regulations regarding retention registers \n     rely on personnel practices and systems that do not exist in \n     the Legislative Branch.\n       In keeping with our new approach to the implementation of \n     the VEOA, these regulations do not impose a requirement that \n     an employing office create or maintain OPM-like retention \n     registers but instead provide a framework for determining \n     groups of ``competing employees'' for purposes of applying \n     retention preferences as mandated by 5 U.S.C. Sec. 3502(c). \n     In this respect, the Board has determined that several of the \n     terms in the OPM regulations may be used to implement the \n     concept of ``competing employees'' in the Legislative Branch \n     without imposing Executive Branch personnel practices or \n     systems: generally, ``competing covered employees'' are the \n     covered employees within a particular ``position \n     classification or job classification,'' at or within a \n     particular ``competitive area''.\n       The definition of ``position classification or job \n     classification'' is derived from OPM's basic definition of \n     ``competitive level'' in 5 CFR Sec. 351.403(a)(1). The \n     remaining regulations in 5 CFR Sec. 351.403(a)(2)-(4), \n     (b)(1)-(5) and (c)(1)-(4) prescribe the manner in which an \n     Executive Branch agency may determine a covered employee's \n     competitive level. While some of these rules could be adopted \n     in the Legislative Branch, others are clearly inapplicable. \n     The Board has decided not to adopt these portions of the OPM \n     regulations in order to provide employing offices with a\n\n[[Page S1393]]\n\n     great amount of flexibility in determining an employee's \n     ``position classification or job classification''. This is in \n     keeping with our understanding that the personnel systems \n     used by employing offices within the Legislative Branch vary \n     significantly from those used in the Executive Branch. This \n     flexibility is, of course, subject to the understanding that \n     such determinations may not be manipulated in order to avoid \n     the employing office's obligations under the VEOA.\n       The definition of ``competitive area'' more closely tracks \n     OPM's definition of the same term in 5 CFR Sec. 351.402. We \n     note that the OPM regulations define ``competitive area'' in \n     terms of an agency's ``organizational units'' and \n     ``geographical locations''. The Board is not adopting OPM \n     definitions or descriptions of these terms, but will allow \n     employing offices flexibility in applying these concepts to \n     their own organizational structure. The Board has retained \n     the OPM requirement that the minimum competitive area be a \n     department or subdivision ``under separate administration''. \n     In this respect, ``separate administration'' is not \n     considered to require that the administration of a proposed \n     competitive area has final authority to hire and fire but \n     that it has the authority to administer the day to day \n     operations of the department or subdivision in question.\n       The OPM regulations incorporate the term ``tenure'' in \n     their definition of ``competitive group.'' We have used the \n     term in our definition of ``position classification or job \n     classification'' because the statutory language in 5 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 3502 identifies ``tenure'' as a factor that will \n     override veterans' preference in determining employee \n     retention in a reduction in force. However, we have not \n     adopted OPM's definition of tenure, as it is tied to \n     Executive Branch service classifications that do not exist in \n     the Legislative Branch. See 5 CFR 351.501. Instead, the use \n     of the term ``tenure'' in these definitions refers only to \n     the type of appointment. For example, an employing office may \n     choose to make ``tenure'' distinctions between permanent and \n     temporary employees, probationary and non-probationary \n     employees, etc. By referring to ``permanent'' positions, we \n     are referring to jobs that are not limited in advance to a \n     specific temporal duration. Nothing in these Comments and \n     Regulations is intended to address the ``at-will'' status of \n     any covered position.\n       The Chief Counsel for the Senate noted, in her Comments to \n     the prior proposed regulations, that the Senate does not \n     employ the concept of ``tenure''. If an employing office \n     chooses not to make such distinctions, nothing in these \n     regulations requires it to do so. If the office does, that is \n     one of the factors in the constitution of the ``position \n     classifications or job classifications''. Again, the Board \n     notes that an employing office should not manipulate the \n     creation of tenure so as to avoid its obligations under the \n     VEOA.\n       We have also included a definition of ``undue \n     interruption'' that is taken directly from the definition of \n     the same term in the OPM regulations, 5 CFR Sec. 351.203. The \n     term is used in determining whether various jobs should be \n     included within the same ``position classification'' or ``job \n     classification,'' and is meant to strike a balance between \n     the interests of employing offices in retaining employees who \n     will be able to perform the jobs remaining after a reduction \n     in force, and the interests of preference eligibles whose \n     jobs are being eliminated in remaining employed. OPM struck \n     this balance by generally suggesting that an employee should \n     be able to perform or ``complete'' required work within 90 \n     days of being placed in the position, and the Board considers \n     this time period to be appropriate in the Legislative Branch \n     as well. For example, this protection against ``undue \n     interruption'' would apply if a preference eligible would \n     have to complete a training program of more than 90 days in \n     order to safely and efficiently perform the covered position \n     to which he or she would otherwise be transferred as a result \n     of a RIF. Finally, we note that, since ``undue interruption'' \n     is an affirmative defense, an employing office has the burden \n     of raising it and proving that an employee may not perform \n     work without ``undue interruption'' by objectively \n     quantifiable evidence.\n       1.112 Application of reductions in force to veterans' \n     preference eligibles. The crux of this regulation derives \n     from 5 U.S.C. Sec. 3502(c), which provides:\n\n     An employee who is entitled to retention preference and whose \n     performance has not been rated unacceptable under a \n     performance appraisal system implemented under chapter 43 of \n     this title is entitled to be retained in preference to other \n     competing employees. (Emphasis added.)\n\n       This provision is the statutory lynchpin underlying \n     veterans' preferences in RIF's. The statutory language in \n     section 3502(c) above in effect requires the employing office \n     to terminate covered employees subject to a RIF in inverse \n     order of their veterans' preference status, within the \n     appropriate group of covered employees with similar jobs, so \n     long as the employees' performance has not been rated \n     unacceptable. Under section 3502(c), a preference eligible \n     covered employee (without an unacceptable performance \n     appraisal) must be retained in preference to non-preference \n     eligibles--even if the other covered employees in the group \n     in fact have greater length of service or more favorable \n     performance evaluations.\n       A separate provision in 5 U.S.C. Sec. 3502(a) requires \n     Executive Branch agencies to give ``due effect'' to four \n     factors: tenure, veterans'' preference, length of service, \n     and performance or efficiency evaluations. OPM has \n     promulgated regulations addressing these four factors, but \n     which also incorporate the concept that, within the group of \n     employees competing for retention, appropriate veteran's \n     preference status is a factor that may override other factors \n     such as length of service and performance or efficiency \n     evaluations. (``Tenure,'' as discussed below, is factored in \n     to the group of employees within which employees compete for \n     retention during a RIF.)\n       Case law has also made abundantly clear that section \n     3502(c) requires that this preference eligible status \n     ``trumps'' the ``due effect'' given to length of service and \n     performance. Courts have interpreted the separate requirement \n     under section 3502(a) to give ``due effect'' to these four \n     enumerated factors as being relevant to retention \n     determinations between two preference eligibles, or between \n     two non-preference eligibles--and not relevant to retention \n     determinations between a preference eligible and a non-\n     preference eligible. Hilton v. Sullivan, 334 U.S. 323, 335, \n     336 (1948). The Board has chosen not to explicitly require \n     that length of service or performance or efficiency \n     evaluations be taken into account during RIF's--only that, if \n     they are, veterans' preference remains the controlling factor \n     in making retention decisions within ``position or job \n     classifications'' in a competitive area (assuming other \n     appropriate requirements are also met).\n       Federal courts have interpreted the present statutory \n     language of section 3502(c) as providing preference eligible \n     employees with an ``absolute preference,'' although only \n     within the confines of their competing group. Dodd v. TWA, \n     770 F. 2d 1038, 1041 (Fed. Cir. 1985); see also McKee v. TWA, \n     1999 LEXIS 25663 at *5 (Fed. Cir. 1999) (unpublished). \n     Additionally, the source of this key language in \n     Sec. 3502(c), the Veterans' Preference Act of 1944 (in turn \n     deriving from a series of historical statutes and executive \n     orders, commencing in 1865), and the legislative history of \n     this Act indicate that the section 3502(c) predecessor \n     language was considered the ``heart of the section''. Hilton \n     v. Sullivan, 334 U.S. 323, 338 (1948). To this effect, courts \n     have interpreted Sec. 3502(c) (or its predecessor under the \n     Veterans' Preference Act of 1944) as overriding such factors \n     as length of service when considering retention standing. \n     Hilton v. Sullivan, 334 U.S. at 335, 336, 339 (noting that \n     ``Congress passed the bill with full knowledge that the long \n     standing absolute retention preference of veterans would be \n     embodied in the Act;'' Elder v. Brannan, 341 U.S. 277, 285 \n     (1951). Thus, courts have interpreted section 3502(c) as \n     requiring preference to be given to a minimally qualified \n     preference eligible, within his or her competing group, \n     regardless of the preference eligible's length of service or \n     performance in comparison to non-preference eligibles.\n       To follow this clear statutory directive, the Board has \n     decided that veterans' preference shall be the \n     ``controlling'' factor (provided that the covered employee's \n     performance was not rated unacceptable), in an employment \n     decision taken within ``position or job classifications'' in \n     ``competitive areas,'' as discussed in the Comments to \n     section 1.111 of these proposed regulations, regardless of \n     such factors as length of service or performance or \n     efficiency ratings. Restricting the veterans' preference to \n     RIF's taken within ``position or job classifications'' in \n     ``competitive areas'' provides important limitations on the \n     scope of the preference accorded. As noted above, the \n     preference eligible does not normally compete for retention \n     against all covered employees of an employing office; the \n     definitional terms in section 1.111 restrict the scope of \n     competition only to covered employees in similar occupational \n     groupings (with the further qualification that the preference \n     eligible must perform the position in question without \n     ``undue interruption''(see discussion regarding section 1.111 \n     of these proposed regulations)); in certain facilities \n     involved; and with similar ``tenure,'' or employment status \n     (such as, for example, whether the employee is a permanent or \n     probationary employee). Note that OPM regulations incorporate \n     the concept of ``tenure'' into the definition of ``competing \n     group''; covered employees only compete for retention against \n     co-workers of the same tenure type. As noted in the Comments \n     to section 1.111 of these proposed regulations, employing \n     offices may or may not incorporate the concept of ``tenure,'' \n     and may choose not to make such distinctions as permanent, \n     temporary, or probationary employees. Nothing in these \n     proposed regulations requires employing offices to adopt such \n     distinctions.\n       Another qualification on the veterans' preference as a \n     ``controlling factor'' is that the preference eligible \n     employee's performance must not have been rated \n     ``unacceptable.'' While 5 U.S.C. Sec. 3502(c) contains a \n     reference to performance appraisal systems implemented under \n     5 U.S.C. Sec. 4301 et seq., we are not requiring employing \n     offices to implement a performance appraisal system following \n     5 U.S.C. Sec. 4301 et seq. An employing office may continue \n     to use its own methods for evaluating covered employees and \n     appraising performance, and need not adopt any formal policy \n     regarding performance appraisal. However, the Board notes \n     that employing offices should not manipulate performance \n     appraisals or evaluations so as to avoid obligations under \n     the VEOA.\n       Another significant qualification on this regulation is \n     that it only governs retention decisions in so far as they \n     affect preference\n\n[[Page S1394]]\n\n     eligible covered employees. In no way does it govern \n     decisions that do not affect preference eligible covered \n     employees; in such cases, an employing office is free to make \n     whatever determinations it so chooses, provided that these \n     determinations are consistent with any other applicable law, \n     and are not used to avoid responsibilities imposed by the \n     VEOA. (Of course, an employing office with covered employees \n     must disseminate information regarding its VEOA policy to \n     covered employees, so as to allow for self-identification of \n     preference eligibles. Furthermore, the notice required by \n     section 1.120 of these regulations will allow covered \n     employees who have not been identified as preference \n     eligibles to assert that status before the RIF becomes \n     effective.) Nor does the regulation require the keeping of \n     formal retention registers, as OPM (and these regulations, as \n     initially proposed) generally requires. However, an employing \n     office must preserve any records kept or made regarding these \n     retention decisions, as detailed in Subpart E of these \n     proposed regulations.\n       Note also that the Board has included the provision that a \n     preference eligible covered employee who is a ``disabled \n     veteran'' under section 1.102(h) above, who has a compensable \n     service-connected disability of 30 percent or more, and whose \n     performance has not been rated unacceptable by an employing \n     office is entitled to be retained in preference to other \n     preference eligibles. This provision derives from 5 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 3502(b), which provides a higher level of preference to \n     certain disabled preference eligibles with regard to other \n     preference eligibles.\n       Finally, the Board notes that this section does not relieve \n     an employing office of any greater obligation it may be \n     subject to pursuant to the Worker Adjustment and Retraining \n     Notification Act (29 U.S.C. Sec. 2101 et seq.) as applied by \n     section 102(a)(9) of the CAA, 2 U.S.C. Sec. 1302(a)(9), which \n     would of course apply to all employees covered by the CAA, \n     not only to preference eligible employees covered by the \n     VEOA.\n       1.113  Crediting experience in reductions in force. This \n     section closely follows 5 U.S.C. Sec. 3502(a), one of the \n     sections made applicable to the Legislative Branch by the \n     VEOA, requiring the employing office to provide preference \n     eligible covered employees with credit for certain specified \n     forms of prior service as the office calculates ``length of \n     service'' in the context of a RIF. This provision in no way \n     requires an employing office to utilize ``length of service'' \n     as a factor in its retention decisions regarding employees in \n     the event that the RIF decision does not impact any \n     preference eligible covered employees.\n       1.114  Waiver of physical requirements--retention. This \n     provision closely follows 5 U.S.C. Sec. 3504, one of the \n     sections made applicable to the Legislative Branch by the \n     VEOA, requiring that, when making decisions regarding \n     employee retention during a RIF, an employing office must \n     waive physical requirements for a job for preference \n     eligibles in certain specified circumstances. As discussed in \n     the Comments to section 1.110, nothing in this regulation \n     relieves an employing office of any greater obligation it may \n     have pursuant to the Americans with Disabilities Act (42 \n     U.S.C. Sec. 12101 et seq.) as applied by section 102(a)(3) of \n     the CAA, 2 U.S.C. Sec. 1302(a)(3).\n       1.116  Transfer of functions. The language in this section \n     derives from 5 U.S.C. Sec. 3503, one of the sections made \n     applicable to the Legislative Branch by the VEOA, requiring \n     covered employees to be transferred to another employing \n     office in the event of a transfer of functions from one \n     employing office to the other, or in the event of the \n     replacement of one employing office by another employing \n     office. The Board expects that employing offices shall \n     coordinate any such transfers in a way that respects both the \n     requirements of this regulation and, to the greatest extent \n     possible, the employing offices' own personnel systems and \n     policies. This section is one of the rare instances where an \n     employing office must follow the regulation even in the event \n     that the personnel action taken does not involve any \n     preference eligible covered employees; however, the clear \n     statutory language of 5 U.S.C. Sec. 3503 requires such a \n     result.\n       Employees and employing offices are reminded that the \n     definition of ``covered employee'' in these proposed \n     regulations does not include employees appointed by a Member \n     of Congress, a committee or subcommittee of either House of \n     Congress, or a joint committee of the House of \n     Representatives and the Senate. See proposed regulation \n     1.102(f)(bb). Therefore, proposed regulation 1.116 will not \n     apply to any such employees affected by the election of new \n     Members of Congress or the transfer of jurisdiction from one \n     committee to another.\n\n\n subpart e: adoption of veterans' preference policies, recordkeeping & \n                       informational requirements\n\n       We note that, of the six sections in this Subpart, only \n     section 1.120 derives directly from statutory language. The \n     other sections are borrowed from various other employment \n     statutes, and are promulgated pursuant to the authority \n     granted the Board by section 4(c)(4)(A) of the VEOA because \n     they are considered necessary to the implementation of the \n     VEOA. For example, the informational regulations in sections \n     1.120 and 1.121 are derived from informational regulations \n     promulgated under the Family and Medical Leave Act, which \n     provides employers with some flexibility in determining how \n     the FMLA will be implemented within their own workforce. The \n     Board is strongly committed to transparency as a policy \n     matter. Moreover, for the VEOA rights to become meaningful, \n     applicants for covered positions and covered employees will \n     have to participate in ensuring that this system works \n     properly, since employing offices are permitted to have \n     flexibility in determining their policies, and the Board will \n     not be taking the same active role in policing the veterans' \n     preference requirements that OPM takes in the Executive \n     Branch.\n       We also note that while this approach differs from OPM's, \n     it reflects the far greater flexibility that employing \n     offices have to tailor substantive requirements to their \n     existing personnel systems and imposes less burdensome \n     obligations on employing offices than that which is imposed \n     on executive agencies: under our regulatory approach, \n     employing offices will have reduced procedural burdens in \n     that they will not be subject to the more detailed \n     requirements of keeping formal retention registers, to the \n     more highly regulated requirements regarding employee access \n     to files (see e.g., 5 CFR Sec. 293.101 et seq., 5 CFR \n     Sec. 297.101 et seq., and 5 CFR Sec. 351.505(b)), or to \n     examining or evaluating applicants on a 100-point scale, \n     seeking prior OPM approval of RIF's, etc.\n       Section 1.116 Adoption of veterans' preference policy. As \n     noted at the outset of these Comments, the regulations will \n     require each employing office that employs one or more \n     covered employees or seeks applicants for covered positions \n     to develop, within 120 days of the Congressional approval of \n     the regulations, a written program or policy setting forth \n     that employing office's methods for implementing the VEOA's \n     veterans' preference principles in the employing office's \n     hiring and retention systems. Employing offices that have no \n     employees covered by the VEOA are not required to adopt such \n     a policy or program.\n       Because these regulations afford the employing offices a \n     great amount of flexibility in determining how to implement \n     veterans' preference within their own personnel systems, it \n     is imperative that the methods chosen by the employing \n     offices be reduced to writing and disseminated to covered \n     applicants and employees. This will further the goals of \n     accountability and transparency, as well as consistency in \n     the application of the employing office's veterans' \n     preference procedures. An existing policy may be amended or \n     replaced by the employing office from time to time, as it \n     deems necessary or appropriate to meet changing personnel \n     practices and needs. We note, however, that the employing \n     office's policy or program will at all times remain subject \n     to the requirements of the VEOA and these regulations. \n     Accordingly, while the adoption of a policy or program will \n     demonstrate the employing office's efforts to comply with the \n     VEOA, it will not relieve an employing office of substantive \n     compliance with the VEOA.\n       Sections 1.117 Preservation of records kept or made. The \n     requirements set forth in this section are derived from OPM \n     regulations regarding retention of RIF records, 5 CFR \n     Sec. 351.505, and EEOC regulations regarding the preservation \n     of personnel and employment records kept or made by \n     employers, 29 CFR Sec. 1602.14. This section requires that \n     relevant records be retained for one year from the date of \n     the making of the record or the date of the personnel action \n     involved or, if later, one year from the date on which the \n     applicant or employee is notified of the personnel action. In \n     addition, where a claim has been brought under section 401 of \n     the CAA against an employing office under the VEOA, the \n     respondent employing office must preserve all personnel \n     records relevant to the claim until final disposition of the \n     claim.\n       Section 1.118 Dissemination of veterans' preference \n     policies to applicants for covered positions. Section 1.118 \n     requires that employing offices must furnish information to \n     applicants for covered positions before appointment decisions \n     are made. Before these decisions are made, it is important \n     that applicants be given the opportunity to self-identify \n     themselves as preference eligibles, and that they receive \n     information regarding the employing office's policies and \n     procedures for implementing the VEOA, in order to ensure that \n     they are aware of the VEOA obligations that may apply to \n     their situation. Accordingly, the regulations require that \n     information regarding the employing office's policies and \n     procedures for implementing the VEOA in appointments be \n     furnished to applicants at various stages when the employing \n     office is hiring into covered positions. We note that \n     inviting applicants to voluntarily self-identify as a \n     disabled veteran for purposes of the application of an \n     employing office's veterans' preference policies, as outlined \n     in the proposed regulation, is consistent with the EEOC's ADA \n     Enforcement Guidance: Preemployment Disability-Related \n     Questions and Medical Examinations (EEOC Oct. 10, 1995).\n       This requirement does not prevent an employing office from \n     appropriately modifying its veterans' preference policies \n     when it sees fit to do so, but is intended to ensure that \n     applicants will be made aware of the employing office's then-\n     current policies and procedures. The requirement that an \n     employing office allow applicants a ``reasonable time'' to \n     provide information regarding their veterans' preference \n     status is intentionally flexible. If an employing office must \n     fill a covered position within a matter of days, one working \n     day may be a ``reasonable time'' for submission of the \n     information. However, if the employing office's appointment \n     process is more prolonged, more time should be allowed.\n\n[[Page S1395]]\n\n       Sections 1.119 and 1.120 Dissemination of information of \n     veterans' preference policies to covered employees, and \n     notice requirements applicable in RIFs. It is also important \n     that covered employees receive information regarding the \n     employing office's policies and procedures for implementing \n     the VEOA in connection with RIFs, in order to ensure that \n     they are aware of the VEOA obligations that may apply to that \n     situation. Accordingly, section 1.119 requires that \n     information regarding the employing office's policies and \n     procedures for implementing the VEOA in appointments be \n     disseminated through employee handbooks, if the employing \n     office has covered employees and ordinarily distributes such \n     handbooks to those employees, or through any other written \n     policy or manual that the employing office may distribute to \n     covered employees concerning their employee rights or \n     reductions in force.\n       The notice requirements attendant to a RIF are set out \n     separately in section 1.120 of the regulations. These \n     regulations derive from the express statutory language in 5 \n     USC Sec. 3502(d) and (e), which have been applied to the \n     Legislative Branch by the VEOA. The language of section \n     3502(d) and (e) has been modified in section 1.120 to be \n     consistent with the terms and approach used in the rest of \n     these regulations. Among other changes, section 1.120 refers \n     to ``covered employees'' and the provision in 5 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 3502(e) that the ``President'' may shorten the 60 day \n     advance notice period to 30 days has been changed to the \n     ``director of the employing agency.'' Additionally, the \n     provision regarding Job Training Partnership Act notice has \n     been omitted. The requirement to inform the employee of the \n     place where he or she may inspect regulations and records \n     pertaining to this case derives from 5 CFR \n     Sec. 351.802(a)(3).\n       The statutory language requiring notice of ``the employee's \n     ranking relative to other competing employees, and how that \n     ranking was determined'' has been modified to require that \n     the notice state whether the covered employee is preference \n     eligible and that the notice separately state the ``retention \n     status'' (i.e., whether the employee will be retained or not) \n     and preference eligibility of the other covered employees in \n     the same job or position classification within the covered \n     employee's competitive area. The Board is not requiring the \n     keeping of retention registers or the ranking of employees \n     within a job or position classification affected by a RIF. \n     However, the statutory language clearly compels employing \n     offices to provide employees who will be adversely affected \n     by a reduction in force with advance notice of how and why \n     the agency decided to subject that particular employee to the \n     reduction in force. At a minimum, this includes whether the \n     affected employee has preference eligible status, and an \n     objective indication why the employee was not retained in \n     relation to other employees in the affected position \n     classifications or job classifications.\n       Section 1.121 Informational requirements regarding \n     veterans' preference determinations. Once an appointment or \n     reduction in force decision has been made, it is important \n     that applicants for covered positions and covered employees \n     receive information regarding the employing office's \n     decision, in order to ensure that the rights and obligations \n     created by the VEOA may be effectively enforced under the CAA \n     as contemplated by section 4(c)(3)(B) of the VEOA. \n     Accordingly, section 1.121 of the regulations requires that \n     certain limited information regarding the employing office's \n     decision be made available to applicants for covered \n     positions and to covered employees, upon request.\n\n                    Proposed Substantive Regulations\n\n       PART 1--Extension of Rights and Protections Relating to \n     Veterans' Preference Under Title 5, United States Code, to \n     Covered Employees of the Legislative Branch (section 4(c) of \n     the Veterans Employment Opportunities Act of 1998)\n\n\n    subpart a--matters of general applicability to all regulations \n                promulgated under section 4 of the veoa\n\n     Sec.\n     1.101  Purpose and scope.\n     1.102  Definitions.\n     1.103  Adoption of regulations.\n     1.105  Coordination with section 225 of the Congressional \n         Accountability Act.\n\n\n                      sec. 1.101 purpose and scope\n\n       (a) Section 4(c) of the VEOA. The Veterans Employment \n     Opportunities Act (VEOA) applies the rights and protections \n     of sections 2108, 3309 through 3312, and subchapter I of \n     chapter 35 of title 5 U.S.C., to certain covered employees \n     within the Legislative Branch.\n       (b) Purpose and scope of regulations. The regulations set \n     forth herein are the substantive regulations that the Board \n     of Directors of the Office of Compliance has promulgated \n     pursuant to section 4(c)(4) of the VEOA, in accordance with \n     the rulemaking procedure set forth in section 304 of the CAA \n     (2 U.S.C. Sec. 1384). The purpose of subparts B, C and D of \n     these regulations is to define veterans' preference and the \n     administration of veterans' preference as applicable to \n     Federal employment in the Legislative Branch. (5 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 2108, as applied by the VEOA). The purpose of subpart E \n     of these regulations is to ensure that the principles of the \n     veterans' preference laws are integrated into the existing \n     employment and retention policies and processes of those \n     employing offices with employees covered by the VEOA, and to \n     provide for transparency in the application of veterans' \n     preference in covered appointment and retention decisions. \n     Provided, nothing in these regulations shall be construed so \n     as to require an employing office to reduce any existing \n     veterans' preference rights and protections that it may \n     afford to preference eligible individuals.\n\n\n                         sec. 1.102 definitions\n\n       Except as otherwise provided in these regulations, as used \n     in these regulations:\n       (a) Act or CAA means the Congressional Accountability Act \n     of 1995, as amended (Pub.

Sec. 2108, \n     or any superseding legislation.\n\n\n                   sec. 1.103 adoption of regulations\n\n       (a) Adoption of regulations. Section 4(c)(4)(A) of the VEOA \n     generally authorizes the Board to issue regulations to \n     implement section 4(c). In addition, section 4(c)(4)(B) of \n     the VEOA directs the Board to promulgate regulations that are \n     ``the same as the most relevant substantive regulations \n     (applicable with respect to the Executive Branch) promulgated \n     to implement the statutory provisions referred to in \n     paragraph (3)'' of section 4(c) of the VEOA. Those statutory \n     provisions are section 2108, sections 3309 through 3312, and \n     subchapter I of chapter 35, of title 5, United States Code. \n     The regulations issued by the Board herein are on all matters \n     for which section 4(c)(4)(B) of the VEOA requires a \n     regulation to be issued. Specifically, it is the Board's \n     considered judgment based on the information available to it \n     at the time of promulgation of these regulations, that, with \n     the exception of the regulations adopted and set forth \n     herein, there are no other ``substantive regulations \n     (applicable with respect to the Executive Branch) promulgated \n     to implement the statutory provisions referred to in \n     paragraph (3)'' of section 4(c) of the VEOA that need be \n     adopted.\n       (b) Modification of substantive regulations. As a \n     qualification to the statutory obligation to issue \n     regulations that are ``the same as the most substantive \n     regulations (applicable with respect to the Executive \n     Branch),'' section 4(c)(4)(B) of the VEOA authorizes the \n     Board to ``determine, for good cause shown and stated \n     together with the regulation, that a modification of such \n     regulations would be more effective for the implementation of \n     the rights and protections under'' section 4(c) of the VEOA.\n       (c) Rationale for Departure from the Most Relevant \n     Executive Branch Regulations. The Board concludes that it \n     must promulgate regulations accommodating the human resource \n     systems existing in the Legislative Branch; and that such \n     regulations must take into account the fact that the Board \n     does not possess the statutory and Executive Order based \n     government-wide policy making authority underlying OPM's \n     counterpart VEOA regulations governing the Executive Branch. \n     OPM's regulations are designed for the competitive service \n     (defined in 5 U.S.C. Sec. 2102(a)(2)), which does not exist \n     in the employing offices subject to this regulation. \n     Therefore, to follow the OPM regulations would create \n     detailed and complex rules and procedures for a workforce \n     that does not exist in the Legislative Branch, while \n     providing no VEOA protections to the covered Legislative \n     Branch employees. We have chosen to propose specially \n     tailored regulations, rather than simply to adopt those \n     promulgated by OPM, so that we may effectuate Congress' \n     intent in extending the principles of the veterans' \n     preference laws to the Legislative Branch through the VEOA.\n\n\n     sec. 1.104 coordination with section 225 of the congressional \n                           accountability act\n\n       Statutory directive. Section 4(c)(4)(D) of the VEOA \n     requires that promulgated regulations must be consistent with \n     section 225 of the CAA. Among the relevant provisions of \n     section 225 are subsection (f)(1), which prescribes as a rule \n     of construction that definitions and exemptions in the laws \n     made applicable by the CAA shall apply under the CAA, and \n     subsection (f)(3), which states that the CAA shall not be \n     considered to authorize enforcement of the CAA by the \n     Executive Branch.\n\n\n          subpart b--veterans' preference--general provisions\n\n     Sec.\n     1.105 Responsibility for administration of veterans' \n         preference.\n     1.106 Procedures for bringing claims under the VEOA.\n\n\n  sec. 1.105 responsibility for administration of veterans' preference\n\n       Subject to Section 1.106, employing offices are responsible \n     for making all veterans' preference determinations, \n     consistent with the VEOA.\n\n\n        sec. 1.106 procedures for bringing claims under the veoa\n\n       Applicants for appointment to a covered position and \n     covered employees may contest adverse veterans' preference \n     determinations, including any determination that a preference \n     eligible is not a qualified applicant, pursuant to sections \n     401-416 of the CAA, 2 U.S.C.

The provisions of sections 1.109 and \n     1.110 below shall apply to the appointment of a preference \n     eligible to a restricted covered position.

Sec. 3309.\n       (b) In all other situations involving appointment to a \n     covered position, employing offices shall consider veterans' \n     preference eligibility as an affirmative factor that is given \n     weight in a manner that is proportionately comparable to the \n     points prescribed in 5 U.S.C.

Sec. 2108(3)(c) who has a compensable service-\n     connected disability of 30 percent or more is not able to \n     fulfill the physical requirements of the covered position, \n     the employing office shall notify the preference eligible of \n     the reasons for the determination and of the right to respond \n     and to submit additional information to the employing office, \n     within 15 days of the date of the notification. Should the \n     preference eligible make a timely response the employing \n     office, at the highest level within the employing office, \n     shall render a final determination of the physical ability of \n     the preference eligible to perform the duties of the \n     position, taking into account the response and any additional \n     information provided by the preference eligible.

Sec. 12101 et \n     seq.) as applied by section 102(a)(3) of the CAA, 2 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 1302(a)(3).\n\n\n         subpart d--veteran's preference in reductions in force\n\n     Sec.\n     1.111  Definitions applicable in reductions in force.\n     1.112  Application of preference in reductions in force.\n     1.113  Crediting experience in reductions in force.\n     1.114  Waiver of physical requirements in reductions in \n         force.\n     1.115  Transfer of functions.\n\n\n        sec. 1.111 definitions applicable in reductions in force\n\n       (a) Competing covered employees are the covered employees \n     within a particular position or job classification, at or \n     within a particular competitive area, as those terms are \n     defined below.\n       (b) Competitive area is that portion of the employing \n     office's organizational structure, as determined by the \n     employing office, in which covered employees compete for \n     retention. A competitive area must be defined solely in terms \n     of the employing office's organizational unit(s) and \n     geographical location, and it must include all employees \n     within the competitive area so defined. A competitive area \n     may consist of all or part of an employing office. The \n     minimum competitive area is a department or subdivision of \n     the employing office under separate administration within the \n     local commuting area.\n       (c) Position classifications or job classifications are \n     determined by the employing office, and shall refer to all \n     covered positions within a competitive area that are in the \n     same grade, occupational level or classification, and which \n     are similar enough in duties, qualification requirements, pay \n     schedules, tenure (type of appointment) and working \n     conditions so that an employing office may reassign the \n     incumbent of one position to any of the other positions in \n     the position classification without undue interruption.\n       (d) Preference Eligibles. For the purpose of applying \n     veterans' preference in reductions in force, except with \n     respect to the application of section 1.114 of these \n     regulations regarding the waiver of physical requirements, \n     the following shall apply:\n       (1) ``active service'' has the meaning given it by section \n     101 of title 37;\n       (2) ``a retired member of a uniformed service'' means a \n     member or former member of a uniformed service who is \n     entitled, under statute, to retired, retirement, or retainer \n     pay on account of his/her service as such a member; and\n       (3) a preference eligible covered employee who is a retired \n     member of a uniformed service is considered a preference \n     eligible only if--\n       (A) his/her retirement was based on disability--\n       (i) resulting from injury or disease received in line of \n     duty as a direct result of armed conflict; or\n       (ii) caused by an instrumentality of war and incurred in \n     the line of duty during a period of war as defined by \n     sections 101 and 1101 of title 38;\n       (B) his/her service does not include twenty or more years \n     of full-time active service, regardless of when performed but \n     not including periods of active duty for training; or\n       (C) on November 30, 1964, he/she was employed in a position \n     to which this subchapter applies and thereafter he/she \n     continued to be so employed without a break in service of \n     more than 30 days.\n       The definition of ``preference eligible'' as set forth in 5 \n     U.S.C Sec. 2108 and section 1.102(o) of these regulations \n     shall apply to waivers of physical requirements in \n     determining an employee's qualifications for retention under \n     section 1.114 of these regulations.\n       (e) Reduction in force is any termination of a covered \n     employee's employment or the reduction in pay and/or position \n     grade of a covered employee for more than 30 days and that \n     may be required for budgetary or workload reasons, changes \n     resulting from reorganization, or the need to make room for \n     an employee with reemployment or restoration rights. This \n     does not encompass terminations or other personnel actions \n     predicated upon performance, conduct or other grounds \n     attributable to an employee.\n       (f) Undue interruption is a degree of interruption that \n     would prevent the completion of required work by a covered \n     employee 90 days after the employee has been placed in a \n     different position under this part. The 90-day standard \n     should be considered within the allowable limits of time and \n     quality, taking into account the pressures of priorities, \n     deadlines, and other demands. However, a work program would \n     generally not be unduly interrupted even if a covered \n     employee needed more than 90 days after the reduction in \n     force to perform the optimum quality or quantity of work. The \n     90-day standard may be extended if placement is made under \n     this part to a program accorded low priority by the employing \n     office, or to a vacant position. An employing office has the \n     burden of proving ``undue interruption'' by objectively \n     quantifiable evidence.\n\n\n      sec. 1.112 application of preference in reductions in force\n\n       Prior to carrying out a reduction in force that will affect \n     covered employees, employing offices shall determine which, \n     if any, covered employees within a particular group of \n     competing covered employees are entitled to veterans' \n     preference eligibility status in accordance with these \n     regulations. In determining which covered employees will be \n     retained, employing offices will treat veterans' preference \n     as the controlling factor in retention decisions among such \n     competing covered employees, regardless of length of service \n     or performance, provided that the preference eligible \n     employee's performance has not been rated unacceptable. \n     Provided, a preference eligible who is a ``disabled veteran'' \n     under section 1.102(h) above who has a compensable service-\n     connected disability of 30 percent or more and whose \n     performance has not been rated unacceptable by an employing \n     office is entitled to be retained in preference to other \n     preference eligibles. Provided, this section does not relieve \n     an employing office of any greater obligation it may be \n     subject to pursuant to the Worker Adjustment and Retraining \n     Notification Act (29 U.S.C. Sec. 2101 et seq.) as applied by \n     section 102(a)(9) of the CAA, 2 U.S.C.

An employing \n     office may amend or replace its veterans' preference policies \n     as it deems necessary or appropriate, so long as the \n     resulting policies are consistent with the VEOA and these \n     regulations.\n\n\n            sec. 1.117 preservation of records made or kept\n\n       An employing office that employs one or more covered \n     employees or that seeks applicants for a covered position \n     shall maintain any records relating to the application of its \n     veterans' preference policy to applicants for covered \n     positions and to workforce adjustment decisions affecting \n     covered employees for a period of at least one year from the \n     date of the making of the record or the date of the personnel \n     action involved or, if later, one year from the date on which \n     the applicant or covered employee is notified of the \n     personnel action.

Sec. 12101 et seq.) as \n     applied by section 102(a)(3) of the CAA, 2 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 1302(a)(3), that refusal to provide it will not subject \n     the individual to any adverse treatment except the \n     possibility of an adverse determination regarding the \n     individual's status as a preference eligible as a disabled \n     veteran under the VEOA, and that any information obtained in \n     accordance with this section concerning the medical condition \n     or history of an individual will be collected, maintained and \n     used only in accordance with the Americans with Disabilities \n     Act (42 U.S.C.

Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the public service \nof Mark Morse of Las Vegas, NV.\n  Mark has served as field manager for the Bureau of Land Management's \nLas Vegas Field Office for the last 5 years. Serving as a field manager \nfor any BLM office is a challenge, but nowhere are the competing \ndemands of recreation and conservation, urban development and species \npreservation more pronounced than in southern Nevada.\n  Some might throw up their hands in the face of such challenges, but \nMark confronted them head on. He is respected by such diverse groups as \nlocal and county government officials, environmental organizations, and \nrecreation advocates for balancing the needs of all who take an \ninterest in our public lands.\n  He has forged partnerships between the BLM and local organizations, \nincluding the Red Rock Canyon Interpretive Association, Friends of Red \nRock Canyon, the National Wild Horse Association, Master Gardeners, \nUNLV, and the Clark County School District. These partnerships have not \nonly included the local community in the stewardship of our public \nlands; they have ensured that these lands are better cared for than \nthey would be under only BLM supervision. Red Rock enthusiasts are \nimproving the BLM's interpretation of Red Rock Canyon; students from a \nlocal high school are discovering the unique history of Tule Springs. \nIt was Mark's vision that made these partnerships happen.\n  We in Nevada's congressional delegation have also handed Mark his \nshare of challenges. The Nevada BLM oversees an enormously successful \nprogram that disposes of Federal land in southern Nevada while using \nthe proceeds to preserve Nevada's natural treasures. This program has \nmade federal land agencies work together in ways that have no precedent \nin our country. Mark has helped create interagency teams that improve \nboth the care of Federal lands and the efficiency of the agencies \ncharged with that care. Without Mark's leadership, this program would \nnot be such a success story.\n  Mark has helped the Las Vegas Field Office adapt to the unique nature \nof managing Federal land in this growing urban setting. He is proud of \nhis team, and he would say it has embraced change and achieved \nexcellence. The BLM is not always a popular entity in Nevada, but \nMark's accomplishments have greatly improved its reputation.\n  Mark's retirement is the culmination of 39 years of service with the \nBLM in the West, including time in northern California and Colorado as \nwell as Nevada. I wish Mark the best, and I hope I will have the \nprivilege of working with him again in the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/02/15/senate-section/article/S1399-2", "month": "02", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1399]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   BALTAZAR CERVANTES' 100TH BIRTHDAY\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I speak today in recognition of Mr. Baltazar \nCervantes' 100th birthday.\n  Mr. Cervantes was born and raised in Mexico, and he came to the \nUnited States in 1919, making Nevada his home in 1958.\n  He worked for the Southern Pacific Railroad for 36 years, then worked \npart time for the city of Elko, in northeast Nevada, for the next 20 \nyears. He finally retired in 1993 at the age of 88.\n  Throughout his life, Mr. Cervantes has dedicated himself to his \nfamily, a group that has continued to grow over time. Today his \nextended family include 10 children, 44 grandchildren, 54 great \ngrandchildren, and 1 great-great-grandchild.\n  Mr. Cervantes has experienced many things during his life, and he has \nseen some historic figures. When he was a young boy, he saw Pancho \nVilla in Mexico, and after he moved to the United States he was \nfortunate enough to see the legendary Babe Ruth play baseball.\n  Mr. Cervantes has long been an avid baseball fan, and his favorite \nteam is the Atlanta Braves. He tells his children that even though the \nBraves. didn't enjoy much success during the early years when he \nwatched them, he always knew they would turn it around. I am sure Mr. \nCervantes has enjoyed the Braves' 13 consecutive playoff appearances.\n  Today Mr. Cervantes lives with his daughter Norma and her daughter \nKara, and he enjoys watching Braves games in the company of his loving \nfamily. It gives me great pleasure to offer my sincerest \ncongratulations to this special man on the occasion of his 100th \nbirthday.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/02/15/senate-section/article/S1399-3", "month": "02", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1399-S1400]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 EGYPT\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, in his recent State of the Union \naddress, President Bush stated:\n\n     the great and proud nation of Egypt, which showed the way \n     toward peace in the Middle East, can now show the way toward \n     democracy in the Middle East.\n\n  In light of the President's statement, I would like to submit for the \nRecord an op-ed by Jackson Diehl that appeared in today's Washington \nPost titled ``Egypt's Gamble.''\n  In this piece, Mr. Diehl notes with concern that the Egyptian \nGovernment appears to be acting under the assumption that, despite the \nPresident's strong statement on the need for democratic reforms in the \ncountry, the United States will still turn a blind eye to the recent \nheavy-handed actions taken by the Egyptian authorities toward \nprodemocracy activists. Mr. Diehl's piece notes:\n\n     The U.S. Embassy in Cairo is urging caution; it argues that \n     an overly aggressive U.S. reaction [to the crackdown] would \n     play into the hands of Egyptian ``hardliners.''\n\n  Mr. President, I am deeply troubled about these reports, if they are \ntrue.\n  President Bush's statement of policy with respect to Egypt could not \nbe more clear. Nonetheless, it appears that there are those in the \nBureau of Near Eastern Affairs at the State Department who are \nattempting to return to ``business as usual'' with respect to U.S. \npolicy toward Egypt. I would like to go on record as reiterating my \nstrong support for the need for Egypt to reform its political and \neconomic institutions, and I look forward to working with Secretary \nRice to ensure that the President's vision of democracy in the region \nis not diluted at lower levels of the Department through bureaucratic \ninertia and intransigence.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the op-ed be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Feb. 14, 2005]\n\n                             Egypt's Gamble\n\n                           (By Jackson Diehl)\n\n       The appearance of Egyptian Foreign Minister Ahmed Aboul \n     Gheit and intelligence chief Omar Suleiman in Washington this \n     week should bring to a head a bold attempt by their country's \n     strongman, Hosni Mubarak, to neuter President Bush's campaign \n     for democracy in the Middle East within weeks of his \n     inaugural address.\n\n[[Page S1400]]\n\n       Mubarak's brazen gambit was encapsulated by two events on \n     successive days last week. On Tuesday he played host in Sharm \n     el-Sheikh as Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon and \n     Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas declared a cease-fire. On \n     Wednesday his police in Cairo arrested the deputy leader of \n     the new, liberal democratic Tomorrow political party and \n     banned its newspaper from publishing its first issue--even \n     though 10 days before the Bush administration had strongly \n     objected to the arrest of the party's chairman, Ayman Nour.\n       Mubarak is betting that Gheit and Suleiman will be greeted \n     at the State Department and White House as close \n     collaborators in a budding Israeli-Palestinian detente, not \n     as representatives of a government engaged in an expanding \n     crackdown on its secular and democratic opposition. If so, \n     the 76-year-old president will feel secure in continuing a \n     campaign aimed at crushing what has been mounting opposition \n     among the Egyptian political and business elite to his plan \n     to extend his quarter-century in office by six years through \n     a rigged referendum this fall. His son, Gamal, waits in the \n     wings to succeed him.\n       Bush, who in his State of the Union speech called on Egypt \n     to ``show the way'' toward democracy in the Middle East, will \n     look feckless and foolish if a regime so deeply dependent on \n     U.S. military and economic aid stages another fraudulent \n     election while jailing the very politicians who support his \n     vision. But Mubarak is betting that this U.S president, like \n     those who preceded him, won't seriously confront him or \n     threaten his economic lifeline at a sensitive moment in the \n     ``peace process.''\n       He may or may not be right. Some officials tell me that the \n     Egyptians will get a cool, if not cold, reception in \n     Washington and will be told that the jailing of Nour and his \n     deputy, Moussa Mustafa, is unacceptable. Bush, one source \n     said, is ``furious'' about the arrests. A U.S. diplomatic \n     letter has been drafted, but not yet dispatched, to other \n     members of the Group of Eight industrial nations; it \n     describes Mubarak's political crackdown in harsh terms and \n     suggests that G-8 participation in an early March meeting in \n     Egypt with the Arab League should be reconsidered.\n       One official I spoke to pointed out that Condoleezza Rice \n     is due to pay her first visit as secretary of state to the \n     Arab Middle East for the Arab League meeting. If Nour is not \n     freed, the official predicted, Rice may cancel the trip: \n     ``She is not going to sit there like a potted plant while the \n     Egyptians do this.'' But Rice hasn't addressed the issue, and \n     there is no consensus inside the administration on such a \n     tough response. Predictably, the U.S. Embassy in Cairo is \n     urging caution; it argues that an overly aggressive U.S. \n     reaction would play into the hands of Egyptian ``hard-\n     liners.'' Such limp logic, of course, is exactly what the \n     chief hard-liner--Mubarak--is counting on.\n       Whatever comes of the Nour affair, the State Department has \n     launched a committee to review policy toward Egypt. That will \n     give democracy advocates at State and the White House a \n     platform for arguing that relations with Cairo should be \n     fundamentally shifted in the coming year. They can count on \n     support in Congress, where key Republicans, such as Sen. \n     Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, have grown increasingly \n     impatient with Mubarak's refusal to liberalize.\n       Few believe that Mubarak can now be stopped from granting \n     himself another term as president. But proponents of change \n     will argue that Bush must at least push Mubarak to make a \n     major concession to his moderate opposition. This is not a \n     matter of the United States dictating reform: Nour, a new \n     coalition of political groups and even some officials in the \n     ruling party have been pressing for a constitutional rewrite \n     that would make future elections democratic and limit the \n     president's power and tenure. They also want lifted the \n     ``emergency laws'' that Mubarak has used to suppress \n     political activity. Bush need only embrace this homegrown \n     agenda.\n       The old autocrat probably won't yield unless his annual \n     dose of $1.2 billion in U.S. aid is put at stake. Critics \n     have been arguing for years that that huge subsidy, which \n     dates to the Cold War, buys the United States little but \n     greater enmity from the millions of Arabs who loathe the \n     region's corrupt autocracies and blame the United States for \n     propping them up.\n       The fact is, Mubarak has far more to lose than Bush from a \n     rupture in U.S.-Egyptian relations. By contrast, if the \n     dictator sails to reelection with the apparent consent of \n     Washington, it is Bush who will be the big loser.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/02/15/senate-section/article/S1400-1", "month": "02", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1400-S1407]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             RULES OF PROCEDURE--SELECT COMMITTEE ON ETHICS\n\n  Mr. VOINOVICH.

Whenever the \n     Chairman or Vice Chairman is authorized to make any \n     determination, then the determination may be released at his \n     or her discretion. Each member of the Committee shall be \n     given a reasonable opportunity to have separate views \n     included as part of any Committee report. (See Rule 8 on \n     Procedures for Handling Committee Sensitive and Classified \n     Materials.)\n       (k) Ineligibility or Disqualification of Members and Staff:\n       (1) A member of the Committee shall be ineligible to \n     participate in any Committee proceeding that relates \n     specifically to any of the following:\n       (A) a preliminary inquiry or adjudicatory review relating \n     to (i) the conduct of (I) such member; (II) any officer or \n     employee the member supervises; or (ii) any complaint filed \n     by the member; and\n       (B) the determinations and recommendations of the Committee \n     with respect to any preliminary inquiry or adjudicatory \n     review described in subparagraph (A).\n       For purposes of this paragraph, a member of the committee \n     and an officer of the Senate shall be deemed to supervise any \n     officer or employee consistent with the provision of \n     paragraph 12 of Rule XXXVII of the Standing Rules of the \n     Senate.\n       (2) If any Committee proceeding appears to relate to a \n     member of the Committee in a manner described in subparagraph \n     (1) of this paragraph, the staff shall prepare a report to \n     the Chairman and Vice Chairman. If either the Chairman or the \n     Vice Chairman concludes from the report that it appears that \n     the member may be ineligible, the member shall be notified in \n     writing of the nature of the particular proceeding and the \n     reason that it appears that the member may be ineligible to \n     participate in it. If the member agrees that he or she is \n     ineligible, the member shall so notify the Chairman or Vice \n     Chairman. If the member believes that he or she is not \n     ineligible, he or she may explain the reasons to the Chairman \n     and Vice Chairman, and if they both agree that the member is \n     not ineligible, the member shall continue to serve. But if \n     either the Chairman or Vice Chairman continues to believe \n     that the member is ineligible, while the member believes that \n     he or she is not ineligible, the matter shall be promptly \n     referred to the Committee. The member shall present his or \n     her arguments to the Committee in executive session. Any \n     contested questions concerning a member's eligibility shall \n     be decided by a majority vote of the Committee, meeting in \n     executive session, with the member in question not \n     participating.\n       (3) A member of the Committee may, at the discretion of the \n     member, disqualify himself or herself from participating in \n     any preliminary inquiry or adjudicatory review pending before \n     the Committee and the determinations and recommendations of \n     the Committee with respect to any such preliminary inquiry or \n     adjudicatory review.\n       (4) Whenever any member of the Committee is ineligible \n     under paragraph (1) to participate in any preliminary inquiry \n     or adjudicatory review, or disqualifies himself or herself \n     under paragraph (3) from participating in any preliminary \n     inquiry or adjudicatory review, another Senator shall be \n     appointed by the Senate to serve as a member of the Committee \n     solely for purposes of such preliminary inquiry or \n     adjudicatory review and the determinations and \n     recommendations of the Committee with respect to such \n     preliminary inquiry or adjudicatory review. Any member of the \n     Senate appointed for such purposes shall be of the same party \n     as the member who is ineligible or disqualifies himself or \n     herself.\n       (5) The President of the Senate shall be given written \n     notice of the ineligibility or disqualification of any member \n     from any preliminary inquiry, adjudicatory review, or other \n     proceeding requiring the appointment of another member in \n     accordance with subparagraph (k)(4).\n       (6) A member of the Committee staff shall be ineligible to \n     participate in any Committee proceeding that the staff \n     director or outside counsel determines relates specifically \n     to any of the following:\n       (A) the staff member's own conduct;\n       (B) the conduct of any employee that the staff member \n     supervises;\n       (C) the conduct of any member, officer or employee for whom \n     the staff member has worked for any substantial period; or\n       (D) a complaint, sworn or unsworn, that was filed by the \n     staff member. At the direction or with the consent of the \n     staff director or outside counsel, a staff member may also be \n     disqualified from participating in a Committee proceeding in \n     other circumstances not listed above.\n       (l) Recorded Votes: Any member may require a recorded vote \n     on any matter.\n       (m) Proxies; Recording Votes of Absent Members:\n       (1) Proxy voting shall not be allowed when the question \n     before the Committee is the initiation or continuation of a \n     preliminary inquiry or an adjudicatory review, or the \n     issuance of a report or recommendation related thereto \n     concerning a Member or officer of the Senate. In any such \n     case an absent member's vote may be announced solely for the \n     purpose of recording the member's position and such announced \n     votes shall not be counted for or against the motion.\n       (2) On matters other than matters listed in paragraph \n     (m)(1) above, the Committee may order that the record be held \n     open for the vote of absentees or recorded proxy votes if the \n     absent Committee member has been informed of the matter on \n     which the vote occurs and has affirmatively requested of the \n     Chairman or Vice Chairman in writing that he be so recorded.\n       (3) All proxies shall be in writing, and shall be delivered \n     to the Chairman or Vice Chairman to be recorded.\n       (4) Proxies shall not be considered for the purpose of \n     establishing a quorum.\n       (n) Approval of Blind Trusts and Foreign Travel Requests \n     Between Sessions and During Extended Recesses: During any \n     period in which the Senate stands in adjournment between \n     sessions of the Congress or stands in a recess scheduled to \n     extend beyond fourteen days, the Chairman and Vice Chairman, \n     or their designees, acting jointly, are authorized to approve \n     or disapprove blind trusts under the provision of Rule XXXIV.\n       (o) Committee Use of Services or Employees of Other \n     Agencies and Departments: With the prior consent of the \n     department or agency involved, the Committee may (1) utilize \n     the services, information, or facilities of any such \n     department or agency of the Government, and (2) employ on \n     a reimbursable basis or otherwise the services of such \n     personnel of any such department or agency as it deems \n     advisable. With the consent of any other committee of the \n     Senate, or any subcommittee, the Committee may utilize the \n     facilities and the services of the staff of such other \n     committee or subcommittee whenever the Chairman and Vice \n     Chairman of the Committee, acting jointly, determine that \n     such action is necessary and appropriate.\n\n\n     rule 2: procedures for complaints, allegations, or information\n\n       (a) Complaint, Allegation, or Information: Any member or \n     staff member of the Committee shall report to the Committee, \n     and any other person may report to the Committee, a sworn \n     complaint or other allegation or information, alleging that \n     any Senator, or officer, or employee of the Senate has \n     violated a law, the Senate Code of Official Conduct, or any \n     rule or regulation of the Senate relating to the conduct of \n     any individual in the performance of his or her duty as a \n     Member, officer, or employee of the Senate, or has engaged in \n     improper conduct which may reflect upon the Senate. Such \n     complaints or allegations or information may be reported to \n     the Chairman, the Vice Chairman, a Committee member, or a \n     Committee staff member.\n       (b) Source of Complaint, Allegation, or Information: \n     Complaints, allegations, and information to be reported to \n     the Committee may be obtained from a variety of sources, \n     including but not limited to the following:\n       (1) sworn complaints, defined as a written statement of \n     facts, submitted under penalty of perjury, within the \n     personal knowledge of the complainant alleging a violation of \n     law, the Senate Code of Official Conduct, or any other rule \n     or regulation of the Senate relating to the conduct of \n     individuals in the performance of their duties as members, \n     officers, or employees of the Senate;\n\n[[Page S1402]]\n\n       (2) anonymous or informal complaints;\n       (3) information developed during a study or inquiry by the \n     Committee or other committees or subcommittees of the Senate, \n     including information obtained in connection with legislative \n     or general oversight hearings;\n       (4) information reported by the news media; or\n       (5) information obtained from any individual, agency or \n     department of the executive branch of the Federal Government.\n       (c) Form and Content of Complaints: A complaint need not be \n     sworn nor must it be in any particular form to receive \n     Committee consideration, but the preferred complaint will:\n       (1) state, whenever possible, the name, address, and \n     telephone number of the party filing the complaint;\n       (2) provide the name of each member, officer or employee of \n     the Senate who is specifically alleged to have engaged in \n     improper conduct or committed a violation;\n       (3) state the nature of the alleged improper conduct or \n     violation;\n       (4) supply all documents in the possession of the party \n     filing the complaint relevant to or in support of his or her \n     allegations as an attachment to the complaint.\n\n\n        rule 3: procedures for conducting a preliminary inquiry\n\n       (a) Definition of Preliminary Inquiry: A ``preliminary \n     inquiry'' is a proceeding undertaken by the Committee \n     following the receipt of a complaint or allegation of, or \n     information about, misconduct by a Member, officer, or \n     employee of the Senate to determine whether there is \n     substantial credible evidence which provides substantial \n     cause for the Committee to conclude that a violation within \n     the jurisdiction of the Committee has occurred.\n       (b) Basis for Preliminary Inquiry: The Committee shall \n     promptly commence a preliminary inquiry whenever it has \n     received a sworn complaint, or other allegation of, or \n     information about, alleged misconduct or violations pursuant \n     to Rule 2.\n       (c) Scope of Preliminary Inquiry:\n       (1) The preliminary inquiry shall be of such duration and \n     scope as is necessary to determine whether there is \n     substantial credible evidence which provides substantial \n     cause for the Committee to conclude that a violation within \n     the jurisdiction of the Committee has occurred. The Chairman \n     and Vice Chairman, acting jointly, on behalf of the Committee \n     may supervise and determine the appropriate duration, scope, \n     and conduct of a preliminary inquiry. Whether a preliminary \n     inquiry is conducted jointly by the Chairman and Vice \n     Chairman or by the Committee as a whole, the day to day \n     supervision of a preliminary inquiry rests with the Chairman \n     and Vice Chairman, acting jointly.\n       (2) A preliminary inquiry may include any inquiries, \n     interviews, sworn statements, depositions, or subpoenas \n     deemed appropriate to obtain information upon which to make \n     any determination provided for by this Rule.\n       (d) Opportunity for Response: A preliminary inquiry may \n     include an opportunity for any known respondent or his or her \n     designated representative to present either a written or oral \n     statement, or to respond orally to questions from the \n     Committee. Such an oral statement or answers shall be \n     transcribed and signed by the person providing the statement \n     or answers.\n       (e) Status Reports: The Committee staff or outside counsel \n     shall periodically report to the Committee in the form and \n     according to the schedule prescribed by the Committee. The \n     reports shall be confidential.\n       (f) Final Report: When the preliminary inquiry is \n     completed, the staff or outside counsel shall make a \n     confidential report, oral or written, to the Committee on \n     findings and recommendations, as appropriate.\n       (g) Committee Action: As soon as practicable following \n     submission of the report on the preliminary inquiry, the \n     Committee shall determine by a recorded vote whether there is \n     substantial credible evidence which provides substantial \n     cause for the Committee to conclude that a violation within \n     the jurisdiction of the Committee has occurred. The Committee \n     may make any of the following determinations:\n       (1) The Committee may determine that there is not such \n     substantial credible evidence and, in such case, the \n     Committee shall dismiss the matter. The Committee, or \n     Chairman and Vice Chairman acting jointly on behalf of the \n     Committee, may dismiss any matter which, after a preliminary \n     inquiry, is determined to lack substantial merit. The \n     Committee shall inform the complainant of the dismissal.\n       (2) The Committee may determine that there is such \n     substantial credible evidence, but that the alleged violation \n     is inadvertent, technical, or otherwise of a de minimis \n     nature. In such case, the Committee may dispose of the matter \n     by issuing a public or private letter of admonition, which \n     shall not be considered discipline and which shall not be \n     subject to appeal to the Senate. The issuance of a letter of \n     admonition must be approved by the affirmative recorded vote \n     of no fewer than four members of the Committee voting.\n       (3) The Committee may determine that there is such \n     substantial credible evidence and that the matter cannot be \n     appropriately disposed of under paragraph (2). In such case, \n     the Committee shall promptly initiate an adjudicatory review \n     in accordance with Rule 4. No adjudicatory review of conduct \n     of a Member, officer, or employee of the Senate may be \n     initiated except by the affirmative recorded vote of not less \n     than four members of the Committee.\n\n\n        rule 4: procedures for conducting an adjudicatory review\n\n       (a) Definition of Adjudicatory Review: An ``adjudicatory \n     review'' is a proceeding undertaken by the Committee after a \n     finding, on the basis of a preliminary inquiry, that there is \n     substantial cause for the Committee to conclude that a \n     violation within the jurisdiction of the Committee has \n     occurred.\n       (b) Scope of Adjudicatory Review: When the Committee \n     decides to conduct an adjudicatory review, it shall be of \n     such duration and scope as is necessary for the Committee to \n     determine whether a violation within its jurisdiction has \n     occurred. An adjudicatory review shall be conducted by \n     outside counsel as authorized by section 3(b)(1) of Senate \n     Resolution 338 unless the Committee determines not to use \n     outside counsel. In the course of the adjudicatory review, \n     designated outside counsel, or if the Committee determines \n     not to use outside counsel, the Committee or its staff, may \n     conduct any inquiries or interviews, take sworn statements, \n     use compulsory process as described in Rule 6, or take any \n     other actions that the Committee deems appropriate to secure \n     the evidence necessary to make a determination.\n       (c) Notice to Respondent: The Committee shall give written \n     notice to any known respondent who is the subject of an \n     adjudicatory review. The notice shall be sent to the \n     respondent no later than five working days after the \n     Committee has voted to conduct an adjudicatory review. The \n     notice shall include a statement of the nature of the \n     possible violation, and description of the evidence \n     indicating that a possible violation occurred. The Committee \n     may offer the respondent an opportunity to present a \n     statement, orally or in writing, or to respond to questions \n     from members of the Committee, the Committee staff, or \n     outside counsel.\n       (d) Right to a Hearing: The Committee shall accord a \n     respondent an opportunity for a hearing before it recommends \n     disciplinary action against that respondent to the Senate or \n     before it imposes an order of restitution or reprimand (not \n     requiring discipline by the full Senate).\n       (e) Progress Reports to Committee: The Committee staff or \n     outside counsel shall periodically report to the Committee \n     concerning the progress of the adjudicatory review. Such \n     reports shall be delivered to the Committee in the form and \n     according to the schedule prescribed by the Committee, and \n     shall be confidential.\n       (f) Final Report of Adjudicatory Review to Committee: Upon \n     completion of an adjudicatory review, including any hearings \n     held pursuant to Rule 5, the outside counsel or the staff \n     shall submit a confidential written report to the Committee, \n     which shall detail the factual findings of the adjudicatory \n     review and which may recommend disciplinary action, if \n     appropriate. Findings of fact of the adjudicatory review \n     shall be detailed in this report whether or not disciplinary \n     action is recommended.\n       (g) Committee Action:\n       (1) As soon as practicable following submission of the \n     report of the staff or outside counsel on the adjudicatory \n     review, the Committee shall prepare and submit a report to \n     the Senate, including a recommendation or proposed resolution \n     to the Senate concerning disciplinary action, if appropriate. \n     A report shall be issued, stating in detail the Committee's \n     findings of fact, whether or not disciplinary action is \n     recommended. The report shall also explain fully the reasons \n     underlying the Committee's recommendation concerning \n     disciplinary action, if any. No adjudicatory review of \n     conduct of a Member, officer or employee of the Senate may be \n     conducted, or report or resolution or recommendation relating \n     to such an adjudicatory review of conduct may be made, except \n     by the affirmative recorded vote of not less than four \n     members of the Committee.\n       (2) Pursuant to S. Res. 338, as amended, section 2 (a), \n     subsections (2), (3), and (4), after receipt of the report \n     prescribed by paragraph (f) of this rule, the Committee may \n     make any of the following recommendations for disciplinary \n     action or issue an order for reprimand or restitution, as \n     follows:\n       (i) In the case of a Member, a recommendation to the Senate \n     for expulsion, censure, payment of restitution, \n     recommendation to a Member's party conference regarding the \n     Member's seniority or positions of responsibility, or a \n     combination of these;\n       (ii) In the case of an officer or employee, a \n     recommendation to the Senate of dismissal, suspension, \n     payment of restitution, or a combination of these;\n       (iii) In the case where the Committee determines, after \n     according to the Member, officer, or employee due notice and \n     opportunity for a hearing, that misconduct occurred \n     warranting discipline less serious than discipline by the \n     full Senate, and subject to the provisions of paragraph (h) \n     of this rule relating to appeal, by a unanimous vote of six \n     members order that a Member, officer or employee be \n     reprimanded or pay restitution or both;\n       (iv) In the case where the Committee determines that \n     misconduct is inadvertent, technical, or otherwise of a de \n     minimis nature, issue a public or private letter of \n     admonition to a Member, officer or employee, which shall not \n     be subject to appeal to the Senate.\n       (3) In the case where the Committee determines, upon \n     consideration of all the evidence, that the facts do not \n     warrant a finding that there is substantial credible evidence \n     which provides substantial cause for\n\n[[Page S1403]]\n\n     the Committee to conclude that a violation within the \n     jurisdiction of the Committee has occurred, the Committee may \n     dismiss the matter.\n       (4) Promptly, after the conclusion of the adjudicatory \n     review, the Committee's report and recommendation, if any, \n     shall be forwarded to the Secretary of the Senate, and a copy \n     shall be provided to the complainant and the respondent. The \n     full report and recommendation, if any, shall be printed and \n     made public, unless the Committee determines by the recorded \n     vote of not less than four members of the Committee that it \n     should remain confidential.\n       (h) Right of Appeal:\n       (1) Any individual who is the subject of a reprimand or \n     order of restitution, or both, pursuant to subsection \n     (g)(2)(iii), may, within 30 days of the Committee's report to \n     the Senate of its action imposing a reprimand or order of \n     restitution, or both, appeal to the Senate by providing \n     written notice of the appeal to the Committee and the \n     presiding officer of the Senate. The presiding officer shall \n     cause the notice of the appeal to be printed in the \n     Congressional Record and the Senate Journal.\n       (2) S. Res. 338 provides that a motion to proceed to \n     consideration of an appeal pursuant to paragraph (1) shall be \n     highly privileged and not debatable. If the motion to proceed \n     to consideration of the appeal is agreed to, the appeal shall \n     be decided on the basis of the Committee's report to the \n     Senate. Debate on the appeal shall be limited to 10 hours, \n     which shall be divided equally between, and controlled by, \n     those favoring and those opposing the appeal.\n\n\n                    RULE 5: PROCEDURES FOR HEARINGS\n\n       (a) Right to Hearing: The Committee may hold a public or \n     executive hearing in any preliminary inquiry, adjudicatory \n     review, or other proceeding. The Committee shall accord a \n     respondent an opportunity for a hearing before it recommends \n     disciplinary action against that respondent to the Senate or \n     before it imposes an order of restitution or reprimand. (See \n     Rule 4(d).)\n       (b) Non-Public Hearings: The Committee may at any time \n     during a hearing determine in accordance with paragraph 5(b) \n     of Rule XXVI of the Standing Rules of the Senate whether to \n     receive the testimony of specific witnesses in executive \n     session. If a witness desires to express a preference for \n     testifying in public or in executive session, he or she shall \n     so notify the Committee at least 5 days before he or she is \n     scheduled to testify.\n       (c) Adjudicatory Hearings: The Committee may, by the \n     recorded vote of not less than four members of the Committee, \n     designate any public or executive hearing as an adjudicatory \n     hearing; and any hearing which is concerned with possible \n     disciplinary action against a respondent or respondents \n     designated by the Committee shall be an adjudicatory hearing. \n     In any adjudicatory hearing, the procedures described in \n     paragraph (j) shall apply.\n       (d) Subpoena Power: The Committee may require, by subpoena \n     or otherwise, the attendance and testimony of such witnesses \n     and the production of such correspondence, books, papers, \n     documents or other articles as it deems advisable. (See Rule \n     6.)\n       (e) Notice of Hearings: The Committee shall make public an \n     announcement of the date, place, and subject matter of any \n     hearing to be conducted by it, in accordance with Rule 1(f).\n       (f) Presiding Officer: The Chairman shall preside over the \n     hearings, or in his absence the Vice Chairman. If the Vice \n     Chairman is also absent, a Committee member designated by the \n     Chairman shall preside. If an oath or affirmation is \n     required, it shall be administered to a witness by the \n     Presiding Officer, or in his absence, by any Committee \n     member.\n       (g) Witnesses:\n       (1) A subpoena or other request to testify shall be served \n     on a witness sufficiently in advance of his or her scheduled \n     appearance to allow the witness a reasonable period of time, \n     as determined by the Committee, to prepare for the hearing \n     and to employ counsel if desired.\n       (2) The Committee may, by recorded vote of not less than \n     four members of the Committee, rule that no member of the \n     Committee or staff or outside counsel shall make public the \n     name of any witness subpoenaed by the Committee before the \n     date of that witness's scheduled appearance, except as \n     specifically authorized by the Chairman and Vice Chairman, \n     acting jointly.\n       (3) Any witness desiring to read a prepared or written \n     statement in executive or public hearings shall file a copy \n     of such statement with the Committee at least 2 working days \n     in advance of the hearing at which the statement is to be \n     presented. The Chairman and Vice Chairman shall determine \n     whether such statements may be read or placed in the record \n     of the hearing.\n       (4) Insofar as practicable, each witness shall be permitted \n     to present a brief oral opening statement, if he or she \n     desires to do so.\n       (h) Right to Testify: Any person whose name is mentioned or \n     who is specifically identified or otherwise referred to in \n     testimony or in statements made by a Committee member, staff \n     member or outside counsel, or any witness, and who reasonably \n     believes that the statement tends to adversely affect his or \n     her reputation may--\n       (1) Request to appear personally before the Committee to \n     testify in his or her own behalf; or\n       (2) File a sworn statement of facts relevant to the \n     testimony or other evidence or statement of which he or she \n     complained. Such request and such statement shall be \n     submitted to the Committee for its consideration and action.\n       (i) Conduct of Witnesses and Other Attendees: The Presiding \n     Officer may punish any breaches of order and decorum by \n     censure and exclusion from the hearings. The Committee, \n     by majority vote, may recommend to the Senate that the \n     offender be cited for contempt of Congress.\n       (j) Adjudicatory Hearing Procedures:\n       (1) Notice of Hearings: A copy of the public announcement \n     of an adjudicatory hearing, required by paragraph (e), shall \n     be furnished together with a copy of these Rules to all \n     witnesses at the time that they are subpoenaed or otherwise \n     summoned to testify.\n       (2) Preparation for Adjudicatory Hearings:\n       (A) At least 5 working days prior to the commencement of an \n     adjudicatory hearing, the Committee shall provide the \n     following information and documents to the respondent, if \n     any:\n       (i) a list of proposed witnesses to be called at the \n     hearing;\n       (ii) copies of all documents expected to be introduced as \n     exhibits at the hearing; and\n       (iii) a brief statement as to the nature of the testimony \n     expected to be given by each witness to be called at the \n     hearing.\n       (B) At least 2 working days prior to the commencement of an \n     adjudicatory hearing, the respondent, if any, shall provide \n     the information and documents described in divisions (i), \n     (ii) and (iii) of subparagraph (A) to the Committee.\n       (C) At the discretion of the Committee, the information and \n     documents to be exchanged under this paragraph shall be \n     subject to an appropriate agreement limiting access and \n     disclosure.\n       (D) If a respondent refuses to provide the information and \n     documents to the Committee (see (A) and (B) of this \n     subparagraph), or if a respondent or other individual \n     violates an agreement limiting access and disclosure, the \n     Committee, by majority vote, may recommend to the Senate that \n     the offender be cited for contempt of Congress.\n       (3) Swearing of Witnesses: All witnesses who testify at \n     adjudicatory hearings shall be sworn unless the Presiding \n     Officer, for good cause, decides that a witness does not have \n     to be sworn.\n       (4) Right to Counsel: Any witness at an adjudicatory \n     hearing may be accompanied by counsel of his or her own \n     choosing, who shall be permitted to advise the witness of his \n     or her legal rights during the testimony.\n       (5) Right to Cross-Examine and Call Witnesses:\n       (A) In adjudicatory hearings, any respondent and any other \n     person who obtains the permission of the Committee, may \n     personally or through counsel cross-examine witnesses called \n     by the Committee and may call witnesses in his or her own \n     behalf.\n       (B) A respondent may apply to the Committee for the \n     issuance of subpoenas for the appearance of witnesses or the \n     production of documents on his or her behalf. An application \n     shall be approved upon a concise showing by the respondent \n     that the proposed testimony or evidence is relevant and \n     appropriate, as determined by the Chairman and Vice Chairman.\n       (C) With respect to witnesses called by a respondent, or \n     other individual given permission by the Committee, each such \n     witness shall first be examined by the party who called the \n     witness or by that party's counsel.\n       (D) At least 1 working day before a witness's scheduled \n     appearance, a witness or a witness's counsel may submit to \n     the Committee written questions proposed to be asked of that \n     witness. If the Committee determines that it is necessary, \n     such questions may be asked by any member of the Committee, \n     or by any Committee staff member if directed by a Committee \n     member. The witness or witness's counsel may also submit \n     additional sworn testimony for the record within 24 hours \n     after the last day that the witness has testified. The \n     insertion of such testimony in that day's record is subject \n     to the approval of the Chairman and Vice Chairman acting \n     jointly within 5 days after the testimony is received.\n       (6) Admissibility of Evidence:\n       (A) The object of the hearing shall be to ascertain the \n     truth. Any evidence that may be relevant and probative shall \n     be admissible unless privileged under the Federal Rules of \n     Evidence. Rules of evidence shall not be applied strictly, \n     but the Presiding Officer shall exclude irrelevant or unduly \n     repetitious testimony. Objections going only to the weight \n     that should be given evidence will not justify its exclusion.\n       (B) The Presiding Officer shall rule upon any question of \n     the admissibility of testimony or other evidence presented to \n     the Committee. Such rulings shall be final unless reversed or \n     modified by a recorded vote of not less than four members of \n     the Committee before the recess of that day's hearings.\n       (C) Notwithstanding paragraphs (A) and (B), in any matter \n     before the Committee involving allegations of sexual \n     discrimination, including sexual harassment, or sexual \n     misconduct, by a Member, officer, or employee within the \n     jurisdiction of the Committee, the Committee shall be guided \n     by the standards and procedures of Rule 412 of the Federal \n     Rules of Evidence, except that the Committee may admit \n     evidence subject to the provisions of this paragraph only \n     upon a determination of not less than four members of\n\n[[Page S1404]]\n\n     the full Committee that the interests of justice require that \n     such evidence be admitted.\n       (7) Supplementary Hearing Procedures: The Committee may \n     adopt any additional special hearing procedures that it deems \n     necessary or appropriate to a particular adjudicatory \n     hearing. Copies of such supplementary procedures shall be \n     furnished to witnesses and respondents, and shall be made \n     available upon request to any member of the public.\n       (k) Transcripts:\n       (1) An accurate stenographic or recorded transcript shall \n     be made of all public and executive hearings. Any member of \n     the Committee, Committee staff member, outside counsel \n     retained by the Committee, or witness may examine a copy \n     of the transcript retained by the Committee of his or her \n     own remarks and may suggest to the official reporter any \n     typographical or transcription errors. If the reporter \n     declines to make the requested corrections, the member, \n     staff member, outside counsel or witness may request a \n     ruling by the Chairman and Vice Chairman, acting jointly. \n     Any member or witness shall return the transcript with \n     suggested corrections to the Committee offices within five \n     working days after receipt of the transcript, or as soon \n     thereafter as is practicable. If the testimony was given \n     in executive session, the member or witness may only \n     inspect the transcript at a location determined by the \n     Chairman and Vice Chairman, acting jointly. Any questions \n     arising with respect to the processing and correction of \n     transcripts shall be decided by the Chairman and Vice \n     Chairman, acting jointly.\n       (2) Except for the record of a hearing which is closed to \n     the public, each transcript shall be printed as soon as is \n     practicable after receipt of the corrected version. The \n     Chairman and Vice Chairman, acting jointly, may order the \n     transcript of a hearing to be printed without the corrections \n     of a member or witness if they determine that such member or \n     witness has been afforded a reasonable time to correct such \n     transcript and such transcript has not been returned within \n     such time.\n       (3) The Committee shall furnish each witness, at no cost, \n     one transcript copy of that witness's testimony given at a \n     public hearing. If the testimony was given in executive \n     session, then a transcript copy shall be provided upon \n     request, subject to appropriate conditions and restrictions \n     prescribed by the Chairman and Vice Chairman. If any \n     individual violates such conditions and restrictions, the \n     Committee may recommend by majority vote that he or she be \n     cited for contempt of Congress.\n\n\n                   RULE 6: SUBPOENAS AND DEPOSITIONS\n\n       (a) Subpoenas:\n       (1) Authorization for Issuance: Subpoenas for the \n     attendance and testimony of witnesses at depositions or \n     hearings, and subpoenas for the production of documents and \n     tangible things at depositions, hearings, or other times and \n     places designated therein, may be authorized for issuance by \n     either (A) a majority vote of the Committee, or (B) the \n     Chairman and Vice Chairman, acting jointly, at any time \n     during a preliminary inquiry, adjudicatory review, or other \n     proceeding.\n       (2) Signature and Service: All subpoenas shall be signed by \n     the Chairman or the Vice Chairman and may be served by any \n     person eighteen years of age or older, who is designated by \n     the Chairman or Vice Chairman. Each subpoena shall be served \n     with a copy of the Rules of the Committee and a brief \n     statement of the purpose of the Committee's proceeding.\n       (3) Withdrawal of Subpoena: The Committee, by recorded vote \n     of not less than four members of the Committee, may withdraw \n     any subpoena authorized for issuance by it or authorized for \n     issuance by the Chairman and Vice Chairman, acting jointly. \n     The Chairman and Vice Chairman, acting jointly, may withdraw \n     any subpoena authorized for issuance by them.\n       (b) Depositions:\n       (1) Persons Authorized to Take Depositions: Depositions may \n     be taken by any member of the Committee designated by the \n     Chairman and Vice Chairman, acting jointly, or by any other \n     person designated by the Chairman and Vice Chairman, acting \n     jointly, including outside counsel, Committee staff, other \n     employees of the Senate, or government employees detailed to \n     the Committee.\n       (2) Deposition Notices: Notices for the taking of \n     depositions shall be authorized by the Committee, or the \n     Chairman and Vice Chairman, acting jointly, and issued by the \n     Chairman, Vice Chairman, or a Committee staff member or \n     outside counsel designated by the Chairman and Vice Chairman, \n     acting jointly. Depositions may be taken at any time during a \n     preliminary inquiry, adjudicatory review or other proceeding. \n     Deposition notices shall specify a time and place for \n     examination. Unless otherwise specified, the deposition shall \n     be in private, and the testimony taken and documents produced \n     shall be deemed for the purpose of these rules to have been \n     received in a closed or executive session of the Committee. \n     The Committee shall not initiate procedures leading to \n     criminal or civil enforcement proceedings for a witness's \n     failure to appear, or to testify, or to produce documents, \n     unless the deposition notice was accompanied by a subpoena \n     authorized for issuance by the Committee, or the Chairman and \n     Vice Chairman, acting jointly.\n       (3) Counsel at Depositions: Witnesses may be accompanied at \n     a deposition by counsel to advise them of their rights.\n       (4) Deposition Procedure: Witnesses at depositions shall be \n     examined upon oath administered by an individual authorized \n     by law to administer oaths, or administered by any member of \n     the Committee if one is present. Questions may be propounded \n     by any person or persons who are authorized to take \n     depositions for the Committee. If a witness objects to a \n     question and refuses to testify, or refuses to produce a \n     document, any member of the Committee who is present may rule \n     on the objection and, if the objection is overruled, direct \n     the witness to answer the question or produce the document. \n     If no member of the Committee is present, the individual who \n     has been designated by the Chairman and Vice Chairman, acting \n     jointly, to take the deposition may proceed with the \n     deposition, or may, at that time or at a subsequent time, \n     seek a ruling by telephone or otherwise on the objection from \n     the Chairman or Vice Chairman of the Committee, who may refer \n     the matter to the Committee or rule on the objection. If the \n     Chairman or Vice Chairman, or the Committee upon referral, \n     overrules the objection, the Chairman, Vice Chairman, or the \n     Committee as the case may be, may direct the witness to \n     answer the question or produce the document. The Committee \n     shall not initiate procedures leading to civil or criminal \n     enforcement unless the witness refuses to testify or produce \n     documents after having been directed to do so.\n       (5) Filing of Depositions: Deposition testimony shall be \n     transcribed or electronically recorded. If the deposition is \n     transcribed, the individual administering the oath shall \n     certify on the transcript that the witness was duly sworn in \n     his or her presence and the transcriber shall certify that \n     the transcript is a true record of the testimony. The \n     transcript with these certifications shall be filed with the \n     chief clerk of the Committee, and the witness shall be \n     furnished with access to a copy at the Committee's offices \n     for review. Upon inspecting the transcript, within a time \n     limit set by the Chairman and Vice Chairman, acting jointly, \n     a witness may request in writing changes in the transcript to \n     correct errors in transcription. The witness may also bring \n     to the attention of the Committee errors of fact in the \n     witness's testimony by submitting a sworn statement about \n     those facts with a request that it be attached to the \n     transcript. The Chairman and Vice Chairman, acting jointly, \n     may rule on the witness's request, and the changes or \n     attachments allowed shall be certified by the Committee's \n     chief clerk. If the witness fails to make any request under \n     this paragraph within the time limit set, this fact shall be \n     noted by the Committee's chief clerk. Any person authorized \n     by the Committee may stipulate with the witness to changes in \n     this procedure.\n\n\n   Rule 7: Violations of Law; Perjury; Legislative Recommendations; \n   Educational Mandate; and Applicable Rules and Standards of Conduct\n\n       (a) Violations of Law: Whenever the Committee determines by \n     the recorded vote of not less than four members of the full \n     Committee that there is reason to believe that a violation of \n     law, including the provision of false information to the \n     Committee, may have occurred, it shall report such possible \n     violation to the proper Federal and State authorities.\n       (b) Perjury: Any person who knowingly and willfully swears \n     falsely to a sworn complaint or any other sworn statement to \n     the Committee does so under penalty of perjury.

The Chairman and \n     Vice Chairman, acting jointly, shall approve the dismissal of \n     any staff member.\n       (d) Staff Works for Committee as Whole: All staff employed \n     by the Committee or housed in Committee offices shall work \n     for the Committee as a whole, under the general direction of \n     the Chairman and Vice Chairman, and the immediate direction \n     of the staff director or outside counsel.\n       (e) Notice of Summons to Testify: Each member of the \n     Committee staff or outside counsel shall immediately notify \n     the Committee in the event that he or she is called upon by a \n     properly constituted authority to testify or provide \n     confidential information obtained as a result of and during \n     his or her employment with the Committee.\n\n\n           RULE 16: CHANGES IN SUPPLEMENTARY PROCEDURAL RULES\n\n       (a) Adoption of Changes in Supplementary Rules: The Rules \n     of the Committee, other than rules established by statute, or \n     by the Standing Rules and Standing Orders of the Senate, may \n     be modified, amended, or suspended at any time, pursuant to a \n     recorded vote of not less than four members of the full \n     Committee taken at a meeting called with due notice when \n     prior written notice of the proposed change has been provided \n     each member of the Committee.\n       (b) Publication: Any amendments adopted to the Rules of \n     this Committee shall be published in the Congressional Record \n     in accordance with Rule XXVI(2) of the Standing Rules of the \n     Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/02/15/senate-section/article/S1407-1", "month": "02", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1407-S1410]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  RULES OF PROCEDURE--COMMITTEE ON HOMELAND SECURITY AND GOVERNMENTAL \n                                AFFAIRS\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, pursuant to the requirements of rule \nXXVI, section 2, of the Standing Rules of the Senate, I ask unanimous \nconsent to have printed in the Record the rules of the Committee on \nHomeland Security and Governmental Affairs for the 109th Congress \nadopted by the committee on February 10, 2005.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  Rules of the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental \n                                Affairs\n\n\n      RULE 1. MEETINGS AND MEETING PROCEDURES OTHER THAN HEARINGS\n\n       A. Meeting dates. The Committee shall hold its regular \n     meetings on the first Thursday of each month, when the \n     Congress is in session, or at such other times as the \n     chairman shall determine. Additional meetings may be called \n     by the chairman as he/she deems necessary to expedite \n     Committee business. (Rule XXVI, Sec. 3, Standing Rules of the \n     Senate.)\n       B. Calling special Committee meetings. If at least three \n     members of the Committee desire the chairman to call a \n     special meeting, they may file in the offices of the \n     Committee a written request therefor, addressed to the \n     chairman. Immediately thereafter, the clerk of the committee \n     shall notify the chairman of such request. If, within 3 \n     calendar days after the filing of such request, the chairman \n     fails to call the requested special meeting, which is to be \n     held within 7 calendar days after the filing of such request, \n     a majority of the committee members may file in the offices \n     of the committee their written notice that a special \n     Committee meeting will be held, specifying the date and hour \n     thereof, and the Committee shall meet on that date and hour.\n       Immediately upon the filing of such notice, the Committee \n     clerk shall notify all Committee members that such special \n     meeting will be held and inform them of its date and hour. \n     (Rule XXVI, Sec. 3, Standing Rules of the Senate.)\n       C. Meeting notices and agenda. Written notices of Committee \n     meetings, accompanied by an agenda, enumerating the items of \n     business to be considered, shall be sent to all Committee \n     members at least 3 days in advance of such meetings, \n     excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays in which the \n     Senate is not in session. The written notices required by \n     this Rule may be provided by electronic mail. In the event \n     that unforeseen requirements or Committee business prevent a \n     3-day notice of either the meeting or agenda, the Committee \n     staff shall communicate such notice and agenda, or any \n     revisions to the agenda, as soon as practicable by telephone \n     or otherwise to members or appropriate staff assistants in \n     their offices.\n       D. Open business meetings. Meetings for the transaction of \n     Committee or Subcommittee business shall be conducted in open \n     session, except that a meeting or series of meetings on the \n     same subject for a period of no more than 14 calendar days \n     may be closed to the public on a motion made and seconded to \n     go into closed session to discuss only whether the matters \n     enumerated in clauses (1) through (6) below would require the \n     meeting to be closed, followed immediately by a record vote \n     in open session by a majority of the Committee or \n     Subcommittee members when it is determined that the matters \n     to be discussed or the testimony to be taken at such meeting \n     or meetings--\n       (1) will disclose matters necessary to be kept secret in \n     the interests of national defense or the confidential conduct \n     of foreign relations of the United States;\n       (2) will relate solely to matters of Committee or \n     Subcommittee staff personnel or internal staff management or \n     procedure;\n       (3) will tend to charge an individual with crime or \n     misconduct, to disgrace or injure the professional standing \n     of an individual, or otherwise expose an individual to public \n     contempt or obloquy or will represent a clearly unwarranted \n     invasion of the privacy of an individual;\n       (4) will disclose the identity of an informer or law \n     enforcement agent or will disclose any information relating \n     to the investigation or prosecution of a criminal offense \n     that is required to be kept secret in the interests of \n     effective law enforcement;\n       (5) will disclose information relating to the trade secrets \n     of financial or commercial information pertaining \n     specifically to a given person if--\n       (A) an Act of Congress requires the information to be kept \n     confidential by Government officers and employees; or\n       (B) the information has been obtained by the Government on \n     a confidential basis, other than through an application by \n     such person for a specific Government financial or other \n     benefit, and is required to be kept secret in order to \n     prevent undue injury to the competitive position of such \n     person; or\n       (6) may divulge matters required to be kept confidential \n     under other provisions of law or Government regulations. \n     (Rule XXVI, Sec. 5(b), Standing Rules of the Senate.) \n     Notwithstanding the foregoing, whenever disorder arises \n     during a Committee or Subcommittee meeting that is open to \n     the public, or any demonstration of approval or disapproval \n     is indulged in by any person in attendance at any such \n     meeting, it shall be the duty of the chairman to enforce \n     order on his or her own initiative and without any point of \n     order being made by a member of the Committee or \n     Subcommittee; provided, further, that when the chairman finds \n     it necessary to maintain order, he/she shall have the power \n     to clear the room, and the Committee or Subcommittee may act \n     in closed session for so long as there is doubt of the \n     assurance of order. (Rule XXVI, Sec. 5(d), Standing Rules of \n     the Senate.)\n       E. Prior notice of first degree amendments. It shall not be \n     in order for the committee, or a Subcommittee thereof, to \n     consider any amendment in the first degree proposed to any \n     measure under consideration by the Committee or Subcommittee \n     unless a written copy of such amendment has been delivered to \n     each member of the Committee or Subcommittee, as the case may \n     be, and to the office of the Committee or Subcommittee, at \n     least 24 hours before the meeting of the Committee or \n     Subcommittee at which the amendment is to be proposed. The \n     written copy of amendments in the first degree required by \n     this Rule may be provided by electronic mail. This \n     subsection may be waived by a majority of the members \n     present. This subsection shall apply only when at least 72 \n     hours written notice of a session to mark-up a measure is \n     provided to the Committee or Subcommittee.\n       F. Meeting transcript. The Committee or Subcommittee shall \n     prepare and keep a complete transcript or electronic \n     recording adequate to fully record the proceeding of each \n     meeting whether or not such meeting or any part thereof is \n     closed to the public, unless a majority of the Committee or \n     Subcommittee members vote to forgo such a record. (Rule XXVI, \n     Sec. 5(e), Standing Rules of the Senate.)\n\n\n                            RULE 2. QUORUMS\n\n       A. Reporting measures and matters. A majority of the \n     members of the Committee shall constitute a quorum for \n     reporting to the Senate any measures, matters or \n     recommendations. (Rule XXVI, Sec. 7(a)(1), Standing Rules of \n     the Senate.)\n       B. Transaction of routine business. One-third of the \n     membership of the Committee shall constitute a quorum for the \n     transaction of routine business, provided that one member of \n     the minority is present. For the purpose of this paragraph, \n     the term ``routine business'' includes the convening of a \n     meeting and the consideration of any business of the \n     Committee other than reporting to the Senate any measures, \n     matters or recommendations. (Rule XXVI, Sec. 7(a)(1), \n     Standing Rules of the Senate.)\n\n[[Page S1408]]\n\n       C. Taking testimony. One member of the Committee shall \n     constitute a quorum for taking sworn or unsworn testimony. \n     (Rule XXVI, Sec. 7(a)(2) and 7(c)(2), Standing Rules of the \n     Senate.)\n       D. Subcommittee quorums. Subject to the provisions of \n     sections 7(a) (1) and (2) of Rule XXVI of the Standing Rules \n     of the Senate, the Subcommittees of this Committee are \n     authorized to establish their own quorums for the transaction \n     of business and the taking of sworn testimony.\n       E. Proxies prohibited in establishment of quorum. Proxies \n     shall not be considered for the establishment of a quorum.\n\n\n                             RULE 3. VOTING\n\n       A. Quorum required. Subject to the provisions of subsection \n     (E), no vote may be taken by the Committee, or any \n     Subcommittee thereof, on any measure or matter unless a \n     quorum, as prescribed in the preceding section, is actually \n     present.\n       B. Reporting measures and matters. No measure, matter or \n     recommendation shall be reported from the Committee unless a \n     majority of the Committee members are actually present, and \n     the vote of the Committee to report a measure or matter shall \n     require the concurrence of a majority of those members who \n     are actually present at the time the vote is taken. (Rule \n     XXVI, Sec. 7(a)(1) and (3), Standing Rules of the Senate.)\n       C. Proxy voting. Proxy voting shall be allowed on all \n     measures and matters before the Committee, or any \n     Subcommittee thereof, except that, when the Committee, or any \n     Subcommittee thereof, is voting to report a measure or \n     matter, proxy votes shall be allowed solely for the purposes \n     of recording a member's position on the pending question. \n     Proxy voting shall be allowed only if the absent Committee or \n     Subcommittee member has been informed of the matter on which \n     he/she is being recorded and has affirmatively requested that \n     he or she be so recorded. All proxies shall be filed with the \n     chief clerk of the Committee or Subcommittee thereof, as the \n     case may be. All proxies shall be in writing and shall \n     contain sufficient reference to the pending matter as is \n     necessary to identify it and to inform the Committee or \n     Subcommittee as to how the member establishes his or her vote \n     to be recorded thereon. (Rule XXVI, Sec. 7(a)(3) and 7(c)(1), \n     Standing Rules of the Senate.)\n       D. Announcement of vote.\n       (1) Whenever the Committee by roll call vote reports any \n     measure or matter, the report of the Committee upon such a \n     measure or matter shall include a tabulation of the votes \n     cast in favor of and the votes cast in opposition to such \n     measure or matter by each member of the Committee. (Rule \n     XXVI, Sec. 7(c), Standing Rules of the Senate.)\n       (2) Whenever the Committee by roll call vote acts upon any \n     measure or amendment thereto, other than reporting a measure \n     or matter, the results thereof shall be announced in the \n     Committee report on that measure unless previously announced \n     by the Committee, and such announcement shall include a \n     tabulation of the votes cast in favor of and the votes cast \n     in opposition to each such measure and amendment thereto by \n     each member of the Committee who was present at the meeting. \n     (Rule XXVI, Sec. 7(b), Standing Rules of the Senate.)\n       (3) In any case in which a roll call vote is announced, the \n     tabulation of votes shall state separately the proxy vote \n     recorded in favor of and in opposition to that measure, \n     amendment thereto, or matter. (Rule XXVI, Sec. 7(b) and (c), \n     Standing Rules of the Senate.)\n       E. Polling.\n       (1) The Committee, or any Subcommittee thereof, may poll \n     (a) internal Committee or Subcommittee matters including the \n     Committee's or Subcommittee's staff, records and budget; (b) \n     steps in an investigation, including issuance of subpoenas, \n     applications for immunity orders, and requests for documents \n     from agencies; and (c) other Committee or Subcommittee \n     business other than a vote on reporting to the Senate any \n     measures, matters or recommendations or a vote on closing a \n     meeting or hearing to the public.\n       (2) Only the chairman, or a Committee member or staff \n     officer designated by him/her, may undertake any poll of the \n     members of the Committee. If any member requests, any matter \n     to be polled shall be held for meeting rather than being \n     polled. The chief clerk of the Committee shall keep a record \n     of polls; if a majority of the members of the Committee \n     determine that the polled matter is in one of the areas \n     enumerated in subsection (D) of Rule 1, the record of the \n     poll shall be confidential. Any Committee member may move at \n     the Committee meeting following the poll for a vote on the \n     polled decision, such motion and vote to be subject to the \n     provisions of subsection (D) of Rule 1, where applicable.\n\n\n             RULE 4. CHAIRMANSHIP OF MEETINGS AND HEARINGS\n\n       The chairman shall preside at all Committee meetings and \n     hearings except that he/she shall designate a temporary \n     chairman to act in his/her place if he/she is unable to be \n     present at a scheduled meeting or hearing. If the chairman \n     (or his/her designee) is absent 10 minutes after the \n     scheduled time set for a meeting or hearing, the ranking \n     majority member present shall preside until the chairman's \n     arrival. If there is no member of the majority present, the \n     ranking minority member present, with the prior approval of \n     the chairman, may open and conduct the meeting or hearing \n     until such time as a member of the majority arrives.\n\n\n                RULE 5. HEARINGS AND HEARINGS PROCEDURES\n\n       A. Announcement of hearings. The Committee, or any \n     Subcommittee thereof, shall make public announcement of the \n     date, time, and subject matter of any hearing to be conducted \n     on any measure or matter at least 1 week in advance of such \n     hearing, unless the Committee, or Subcommittee, determines \n     that there is good cause to begin such hearing at an earlier \n     date. (Rule XXVI, Sec. 4(a), Standing rules of the Senate.)\n       B. Open hearings. Each hearing conducted by the Committee, \n     or any Subcommittee thereof, shall be open to the public, \n     except that a hearing or series of hearings on the same \n     subject for a period of no more than 14 calendar days may be \n     closed to the public on a motion made and seconded to go into \n     closed session to discuss only whether the matters enumerated \n     in clauses (1) through (6) below would require the hearing to \n     be closed, followed immediately by a record vote in open \n     session by a majority of the Committee or Subcommittee \n     members when it is determined that the matters to be \n     discussed or the testimony to be taken at such hearing or \n     hearings--\n       (1) will disclose matters necessary to be kept secret in \n     the interests of national defense or the confidential conduct \n     of foreign relations of the United States;\n       (2) will relate solely to matters of Committee or \n     Subcommittee staff personnel or internal staff management or \n     procedure;\n       (3) will tend to charge an individual with crime or \n     misconduct, to disgrace or injure the professional standing \n     of an individual, or otherwise expose an individual to public \n     contempt or obloquy or will represent a clearly unwarranted \n     invasion of the privacy of an individual;\n       (4) will disclose the identity of an informer or law \n     enforcement agent or will disclose any information relating \n     to the investigation or prosecution of a criminal offense \n     that is required to be kept secret in the interests of \n     effective law enforcement;\n       (5) will disclose information relating to the trade secrets \n     of financial or commercial information pertaining \n     specifically to a given person if--\n       (A) an Act of Congress requires the information to be kept \n     confidential by Government officers and employees; or\n       (B) the information has been obtained by the Government on \n     a confidential basis, other than through an application by \n     such person for a specific Government financial or other \n     benefit, and is required to be kept secret in order to \n     prevent undue injury to the competitive position of such \n     person; or\n       (6) may divulge matters required to be kept confidential \n     under other provisions of law or Government regulations. \n     (Rule XXVI, Sec. 5(b), Standing Rules of the Senate.) \n     Notwithstanding the foregoing, whenever disorder arises \n     during a Committee or Subcommittee meeting that is open to \n     the public, or any demonstration of approval or disapproval \n     is indulged in by any person in attendance at any such \n     meeting, it shall be the duty of the chairman to enforce \n     order on his/her own initiative and without any point of \n     order being made by a member of the Committee or \n     Subcommittee; provided, further, that when the chairman finds \n     it necessary to maintain order, he/she shall have the power \n     to clear the room, and the Committee or Subcommittee may act \n     in closed session for so long as there is doubt of the \n     assurance of order. (Rule XXVI, Sec. 5(d), Standing rules of \n     the Senate.)\n       C. Full Committee subpoenas. The chairman, with the \n     approval of the ranking minority member of the Committee, is \n     authorized to subpoena the attendance of witnesses or the \n     production of memoranda, documents, records, or any other \n     materials at a hearing or deposition, provided that the \n     chairman may subpoena attendance or production without the \n     approval of the ranking minority member where the chairman or \n     staff officer designated by him/her has not received \n     notification from the ranking minority member or a staff \n     officer designated by him/her of disapproval of the subpoena \n     within 72 hours, excluding Saturdays and Sundays, of being \n     notified of the subpoena. If a subpoena is disapproved by the \n     ranking minority member as provided in this subsection, the \n     subpoena may be authorized by vote of the members of the \n     Committee. When the Committee or chairman authorizes \n     subpoenas, subpoenas may be issued upon the signature of the \n     chairman or any other member of the Committee designated by \n     the chairman.\n       D. Witness counsel. Counsel retained by any witness and \n     accompanying such witness shall be permitted to be present \n     during the testimony of such witness at any public or \n     executive hearing or deposition to advise such witness while \n     he or she is testifying, of his or her legal rights, \n     provided, however, that in the case of any witness who is an \n     officer or employee of the government, or of a corporation or \n     association, the Committee chairman may rule that \n     representation by counsel from the government, corporation, \n     or association or by counsel representing, other witnesses, \n     creates a conflict of interest, and that the witness may only \n     be represented during interrogation by staff or during \n     testimony before the Committee by personal counsel not from \n     the government, corporation, or association or by personal \n     counsel not representing other witnesses. This subsection \n     shall not be construed to excuse a witness from testifying in \n     the event his or her counsel is ejected for conducting \n     himself or herself in such manner so as to prevent, impede, \n     disrupt, obstruct or interfere with the orderly \n     administration of the\n\n[[Page S1409]]\n\n     hearings; nor shall this subsection be construed as \n     authorizing counsel to coach the witness or answer for the \n     witness. The failure of any witness to secure counsel shall \n     not excuse such witness from complying with a subpoena or \n     deposition notice.\n       E. Witness transcripts. An accurate electronic or \n     stenographic record shall be kept of the testimony of all \n     witnesses in executive and public hearings. The record of his \n     or her testimony whether in public or executive session shall \n     be made available for inspection by the witness or his or her \n     counsel under Committee supervision; a copy of any testimony \n     given in public session or that part of the testimony given \n     by the witness in executive session and subsequently quoted \n     or made part of the record in a public session shall be \n     provided to any witness at his or her expense if he or she so \n     requests. Upon inspecting his or her transcript, within a \n     time limit set by the chief clerk of the Committee, a witness \n     may request changes in the transcript to correct errors of \n     transcription and grammatical errors; the chairman or a staff \n     officer designated by him/her shall rule on such requests.\n       F. Impugned persons. Any person whose name is mentioned or \n     is specifically identified, and who believes that evidence \n     presented, or comment made by a member of the Committee or \n     staff officer, at a public hearing or at a closed hearing \n     concerning which there have been public reports, tends to \n     impugn his or her character or adversely affect his or her \n     reputation may:\n       (a) File a sworn statement of facts relevant to the \n     evidence or comment, which statement shall be considered for \n     placement in the hearing record by the Committee;\n       (b) Request the opportunity to appear personally before the \n     Committee to testify in his or her own behalf, which request \n     shall be considered by the Committee; and\n       (c) Submit questions in writing which he or she requests be \n     used for the cross-examination of other witnesses called by \n     the Committee, which questions shall be considered for use by \n     the Committee.\n       G. Radio, television, and photography. The Committee, or \n     any Subcommittee thereof, may permit the proceedings of \n     hearings which are open to the public to be photographed and \n     broadcast by radio, television or both, subject to such \n     conditions as the Committee, or Subcommittee, may impose. \n     (Rule XXVI, Sec. 5(c), Standing Rules of the Senate.)\n       H. Advance statements of witnesses. A witness appearing \n     before the Committee, or any Subcommittee thereof, shall \n     provide 100 copies of a written statement and an executive \n     summary or synopsis of his proposed testimony at least 48 \n     hours prior to his appearance. This requirement may be waived \n     by the chairman and the ranking minority member following \n     their determination that there is good cause for failure of \n     compliance. (Rule XXVI, Sec. 4(b), Standing Rules of the \n     Senate.)\n       I. Minority witnesses. In any hearings conducted by the \n     Committee, or any Subcommittee thereof, the minority members \n     of the Committee or Subcommittee shall be entitled, upon \n     request to the chairman by a majority of the minority \n     members, to call witnesses of their selection during at least \n     1 day of such hearings. (Rule XXVI, Sec. 4(d), Standing Rules \n     of the Senate.)\n       J. Full Committee depositions. Depositions may be taken \n     prior to or after a hearing as provided in this subsection.\n       (1) Notices for the taking of depositions shall be \n     authorized and issued by the chairman, with the approval of \n     the ranking minority member of the Committee, provided that \n     the chairman may initiate depositions without the approval of \n     the ranking minority member where the chairman or a staff \n     officer designated by him/her has not received notification \n     from the ranking minority member or a staff officer \n     designated by him/her of disapproval of the deposition within \n     72 hours, excluding Saturdays and Sundays, of being notified \n     of the deposition notice. If a deposition notice is \n     disapproved by the ranking minority members as provided in \n     this subsection, the deposition notice may be authorized by a \n     vote of the members of the Committee. Committee deposition \n     notices shall specify a time and place for examination, and \n     the name of the Committee member or members or staff officer \n     or officers who will take the deposition. Unless otherwise \n     specified, the deposition shall be in private. The Committee \n     shall not initiate procedures leading to criminal or civil \n     enforcement proceedings for a witness' failure to appear or \n     produce unless the deposition notice was accompanied by a \n     Committee subpoena.\n       (2) Witnesses may be accompanied at a deposition by counsel \n     to advise them of their legal rights, subject to the \n     provisions of Rule 5D.\n       (3) Oaths at depositions may be administered by an \n     individual authorized by local law to administer oaths. \n     Questions shall be propounded orally by Committee member or \n     members or staff. If a witness objects to a question and \n     refuses to testify, the objection shall be noted for the \n     record and the Committee member or members or staff may \n     proceed with the remainder of the deposition.\n       (4) The Committee shall see that the testimony is \n     transcribed or electronically recorded (which may include \n     audio or audio/video recordings). If it is transcribed, the \n     transcript shall be made available for inspection by the \n     witness or his or her counsel under Committee supervision. \n     The witness shall sign a copy of the transcript and may \n     request changes to it, which shall be handled in accordance \n     with the procedure set forth in subsection (E). If the \n     witness fails to sign a copy, the staff shall note that fact \n     on the transcript. The individual administering the oath \n     shall certify on the transcript that the witness was duly \n     sworn in his presence, the transcriber shall certify that the \n     transcript is a true record of the testimony, and the \n     transcript shall then be filed with the chief clerk of the \n     Committee. The chairman or a staff officer designated by him \n     may stipulate with the witness to changes in the procedure, \n     deviations from this procedure which do not substantially \n     impair the reliability of the record shall not relieve the \n     witness from his or her obligation to testify truthfully.\n\n\n                 RULE 6. COMMITTEE REPORTING PROCEDURES\n\n       A. Timely filing. When the Committee has ordered a measure \n     or matter reported following final action the report thereon \n     shall be filed in the Senate at the earliest practicable \n     time.

Such views shall then be included in the Committee \n     report and printed in the same volume, as a part thereof, and \n     their inclusion shall be noted on the cover of the report. In \n     the absence of timely notice, the Committee report may be \n     filed and printed immediately without such views, (Rule XXVI, \n     Sec. 10(c), Standing Rules of the Senate.)\n       C. Notice by Subcommittee chairmen. The chairman of each \n     Subcommittee shall notify the chairman in writing whenever \n     any measure has been ordered reported by such Subcommittee \n     and is ready for consideration by the full Committee.\n       D.

The \n     evaluation shall include (a) an estimate of the numbers of \n     individuals and businesses who would be regulated and a \n     determination of the groups and classes of such individuals \n     and businesses, (b) a determination of the economic impact of \n     such regulation on the individuals, consumers, and businesses \n     affected, (c) a determination of the impact on the personal \n     privacy of the individuals affected, and (d) a determination \n     of the amount of paperwork that will result from the \n     regulations to be promulgated pursuant to the bill or joint \n     resolution, which determination may include, but need not be \n     limited to, estimates of the amount of time and financial \n     costs required of affected parties, showing whether the \n     effects of the bill or joint resolution could be substantial, \n     as well as reasonable estimates of the record keeping \n     requirements that may be associated with the bill or joint \n     resolution. Or, in lieu of the forgoing evaluation, the \n     report shall include a statement of the reasons for failure \n     by the Committee to comply with these requirements as \n     impracticable, in the event of inability to comply therewith. \n     (Rule XXVI, Sec. 11(b), Standing Rules of the Senate.)\n\n\n           RULE 7. SUBCOMMITTEES AND SUBCOMMITTEE PROCEDURES\n\n       A. Regularly established Subcommittees. The Committee shall \n     have three regularly established Subcommittees.

Ad hoc Subcommittees. Following consultation with the \n     ranking minority member, the chairman shall, from time to \n     time, establish such ad hoc Subcommittees as he/she deems \n     necessary to expedite Committee business.\n       C. Subcommittee membership. Following consultation with the \n     majority members, and the ranking minority member of the\n\n[[Page S1410]]\n\n     Committee, the chairman shall announce selections for \n     membership on the Subcommittees referred to in paragraphs A \n     and B, above.\n       D. Subcommittee meetings and hearings. Each Subcommittee of \n     this Committee is authorized to establish meeting dates and \n     adopt rules not inconsistent with the rules of the \n     Committee except as provided in Rules 2(D) and 7(E).\n       E. Subcommittee subpoenas. Each Subcommittee is authorized \n     to adopt rules concerning subpoenas which need not be \n     consistent with the rules of the Committee; provided, \n     however, that in the event the Subcommittee authorizes the \n     issuance of a subpoena pursuant to its own rules, a written \n     notice of intent to issue the subpoena shall be provided to \n     the chairman and ranking minority member of the Committee, or \n     staff officers designated by them, by the Subcommittee \n     chairman or a staff officer designated by him/her immediately \n     upon such authorization, and no subpoena shall be issued for \n     at least 48 hours, excluding Saturdays and Sundays, from \n     delivery to the appropriate offices, unless the chairman and \n     ranking minority member waive the 48 hour waiting period or \n     unless the Subcommittee chairman certifies in writing to the \n     chairman and ranking minority member that, in his/her \n     opinion, it is necessary to issue a subpoena immediately.\n       F. Subcommittee budgets. During the first year of a new \n     Congress, each Subcommittee that requires authorization for \n     the expenditure of funds for the conduct of inquiries and \n     investigations, shall file with the chief clerk of the \n     Committee, by a date and time prescribed by the Chairman, its \n     request for funds for the two (2) 12-month periods beginning \n     on March 1 and extending through and including the last day \n     of February of the 2 following years, which years comprise \n     that Congress.

The chairman may request additional reports \n     from the Subcommittees regarding their activities and budgets \n     at any time during a Congress. (Rule XXVI, Sec. 9, Standing \n     Rules of the Senate.)\n\n\n             RULE 8. CONFIRMATION STANDARDS AND PROCEDURES\n\n       A. Standards. In considering a nomination, the Committee \n     shall inquire into the nominee's experience, qualifications, \n     suitability, and integrity to serve in the position to which \n     he or she has been nominated.

For the purpose of assisting the \n     Committee in the conduct of this inquiry, a majority \n     investigator or investigators shall be designated by the \n     chairman and a minority investigator or investigators shall \n     be designated by the ranking minority member. The chairman, \n     ranking minority member, other members of the Committee and \n     designated investigators shall have access to all \n     investigative reports on nominees prepared by any Federal \n     agency, except that only the chairman, the ranking minority \n     member, or other members of the Committee, upon request, \n     shall have access to the report of the Federal Bureau of \n     Investigation. The Committee may request the assistance of \n     the General Accounting Office and any other such expert \n     opinion as may be necessary in conducting its review of \n     information provided by nominees.\n       D. Report on the Nominee. After a review of all information \n     pertinent to the nomination, a confidential report on the \n     nominee shall be made in the case of judicial nominees and \n     may be made in the case of non-judicial nominees by the \n     designated investigators to the chairman and the ranking \n     minority member and, upon request, to any other member of the \n     Committee.

Hearings. The Committee shall conduct a public hearing \n     during which the nominee shall be called to testify under \n     oath on all matters relating to his or her suitability for \n     office, including the policies and programs which he or she \n     will pursue while in that position. No hearing shall be held \n     until at least 72 hours after the following events have \n     occurred: The nominee has responded to prehearing questions \n     submitted by the Committee; and, if applicable, the report \n     described in subsection (D) has been made to the chairman and \n     ranking minority member, and is available to other members of \n     the Committee, upon request.\n       F. Action on confirmation. A mark-up on a nomination shall \n     not occur on the same day that the hearing on the nominee is \n     held.

Application. The procedures contained in subsections \n     (C), (D), (E), and (F) of this rule shall apply to persons \n     nominated by the President to positions requiring their full-\n     time service.

PERSONNEL ACTIONS AFFECTING COMMITTEE STAFF\n\n       In accordance with Rule XLII of the Standing Rules of the \n     Senate and the Congressional Accountability Act of 1995 (P.L. \n     104-1), all personnel actions affecting the staff of the \n     Committee shall be made free from any discrimination based on \n     race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, state of \n     physical handicap, or disability.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/02/15/senate-section/article/S1410-1", "month": "02", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1410]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ENHANCEMENT ACT OF 2005\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today speak about the need for hate \ncrimes legislation. Each Congress, Senator Kennedy and I introduce hate \ncrimes legislation that would add new categories to current hate crimes \nlaw, sending a signal that violence of any kind is unacceptable in our \nsociety. Likewise, each Congress I have come to the floor to highlight \na separate hate crime that has occurred in our country.\n  Last summer, a young man and two of his gay friends were on their way \nto a bar. A 38-year-old male confronted one of the gay men and began to \nharass him.

Mr. President, it is with great honor that I submitted \nthis resolution, S. Res. 45, paying tribute to John Hume. Throughout \nthe long and difficult years of civil strife and turmoil, John \ndedicated himself to achieving a peaceful, just, and lasting settlement \nof the conflict in Northern Ireland.\n\n[[Page S1411]]\n\n  I have known John for over 30 years, and he has always been one of \nthe people I have admired most in the world. I have consistently been \nimpressed by his insights, his commitment to peace, and his dedication \nto the people of Northern Ireland. He is truly a profile in courage, \nand he won the Nobel Prize for it in 1998.\n  I first contacted John in 1972, shortly after he founded the Social \nDemocratic and Labour Party in Northern Ireland. I was planning a trip \nto Western Europe for a NATO meeting in Bonn. I was concerned about the \nviolence erupting in Northern Ireland, and I was told that John Hume \nwas the best person to see in the North. So I called him in Derry, and \nsaid: ``Mr. Hume, it's Ted Kennedy. I understand you're the person to \ntalk to about what's going on over there.'' He didn't believe it. He \nsaid: ``Pull my other leg.''\n  I resisted though and told him that I would be in Bonn for the \nmeeting of NATO. He graciously agreed to meet me there, and it was the \nbeginning of our extraordinary friendship over the years.\n  John has been an indispensable voice for peace and reconciliation in \nNorthern Ireland. His call for respect for both the Catholic and the \nProtestant traditions has been eloquent and historic for more than \nthree decades.\n  In a very real sense, it was John who, in large part, became the glue \nthat held Northern Ireland together, halted the descent into anarchy \nand civil war, and produced realistic hope for peace and further \nprogress.\n  In 1983, largely as a result of John's efforts, the principal \npolitical parties in Ireland and the SDLP in Northern Ireland \nestablished what was called the New Ireland Forum. It developed new \nideas for peace, and prepared a landmark report that laid the \ngroundwork for an unprecedented, new initiative on the North between \nBritain and Ireland, culminating in 1985 with the signing of the \nhistoric Anglo-Irish Agreement by Margaret Thatcher of Great Britain \nand Garret FitzGerald of Ireland.\n  That in turn led to the cease-fire by the Irish Republican Army in \n1994, the famous Good Friday Agreement in 1998, and the further \nprogress that has brought both sides so close to a permanent peace \ntoday.\n  John has been a familiar face to many of us in the United States over \nthe years. Perhaps his greatest achievement was educating Irish America \nabout the conflict and the most effective way forward.\n  The civil rights movement in the United States in the 1960s planted \nthe seed for a comparable movement by the Catholic minority in Northern \nIreland. But, as the movement gained strength, it encountered intense \nresistance, and there was a very real feeling that violence was the \nonly path to a better future. Much of Irish America agreed with that \nview, and there was a strong financial support in the United States for \nthe IRA.\n  John Hume changed all that. He became an apostle of nonviolence, just \nas Martin Luther King did at a critical time in our own civil rights \nmovement. The violence began to ebb, and more and more citizens in \nNorthern Ireland recognized that peaceful change could be achieved in a \nway that would benefit people of both communities in the North. Others \nhad important roles as well, but at a critical time in the history of \nNorthern Ireland, John Hume stepped up and led the way toward peace, \nand history will honor him forever for all he did so well.\n  The pending resolution pays tribute to John Hume's brilliant \nachievements in the cause of peace for all the people of Northern \nIreland, and I urge my colleagues to support it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/02/15/senate-section/article/S1411-1", "month": "02", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1411]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                  HONORING THE CAREER OF DENNIS HAGNY\n\n Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise today to publicly commend \nMr. Dennis Hagny, general manager and chief executive officer of \nNorthern Electric Cooperative, for devoting more than 40 years of \nservice to advancing the ambitions and objectives of the rural electric \nprogram. After four decades with Northern Electric, Dennis is retiring \nand looks forward to traveling with his wife, Mary, and visiting their \ntwo children, Jennifer and Jeff.\n  Over the years, Dennis guided Northern Electric as it grew from a \nbasic electric service provider into a progressive electric system that \ncurrently serves more than 6,000 residential, farm and industrial \ncustomers. Under Dennis' leadership, Northern Electric headed up many \nprojects designed to technologically integrate South Dakota, such as \nthe North Central Area Interconnect, which Northern Electric built and \nfunded. North Central Area Interconnect, created in 1993, is a fully-\ninteractive long distance learning system comprised of eight school \ndistricts, spanning three separate counties. This system provides high \nschool students the opportunity to take college level classes via \npersonal computer. Likewise, Dennis' innovation and commitment to rural \ncommunities inspired the creation of Northern Rural Cable TV, the \nNation's first rural cooperative wireless cable television system.\n  Dennis has used Northern Electric to connect South Dakotans not only \nwith each other, but with the global market, as well. During Dennis' \ntenure, Northern Electric developed WOWnet, a high speed, wireless \ninternet service for underserved areas. Similarly, Dennis helped \nfinance the construction of Aberdeen's first ``smart park,'' a 150-acre \nindustrial park wired for high-speed telecommunications.\n  In addition to his tremendous contributions to rural South Dakota, \nDennis, a native of Gettysburg, SD, is also a Vietnam veteran. \nFollowing his graduation from Gettysburg High School in 1961, Dennis \nserved in the U.S. Army and Iowa National Guard from 1965 to 1969.\n  Dennis has always been devoted to improving conditions in the \ncommunities he served. As a result, he is a founding member of the \nRural Electric Economic Development Revolving Loan Fund, REED, and is \nactively involved with numerous local boards and organizations. REED, a \nnonprofit corporation that provides financing for projects in small \ncommunities and rural areas of South Dakota, is credited with creating \nmore than 3,000 jobs throughout South Dakota. Additionally, Dennis is \nchairman of Avera St. Luke's Board of Directors, and is a member of St. \nLuke's Foundation Board. Also, he serves on the Northern Electric \nRegional Board of the Governors Office of Economic Development, the \nPresentation College Board of Trustees, and is founding and past member \nof South Dakota Rural Enterprise. He is also a life member of Veterans \nof Foreign Wars and the American Legion.\n  It is with great honor that I share Dennis' accomplishments with my \ncolleagues and publicly commend him for his excellent service to South \nDakota. I wish him the very best, along with his wife, Mary; their two \nchildren, Jennifer and Jeff; and their three grandchildren.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/02/15/senate-section/article/S1411-2", "month": "02", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1411-S1412]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     SOUTH DAKOTAN STUDENTS HONORED\n\n Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I congratulate and honor two young \nSouth Dakota students who have achieved national recognition for \nexemplary volunteer service in their communities. Michelle Rydell of \nVermillion and Molly Stehly of Sioux Falls have just been named State \nHonorees in the 2005 Prudential Spirit of Community Awards program. \nThey have proved themselves to be a part of the extraordinary youth of \nour country who understand the importance of civic duty and service in \nthe community.\n  Michelle is being recognized for her creation of a ``Dream Team'' \nthat collected essential goods for impoverished people in Guatemala and \nhelped raise awareness of poverty in the region. She gave more than \ngoods to the people of a foreign land, she gave them hope.\n  Molly is being recognized for her help with her mother's special \neducation class. She offered freely of herself, at the young age of 13, \nin an effort to help the students with special needs to move toward \ngreater independence.\n  In a State like South Dakota, selfless acts of goodwill toward the \ncommunity are often commonplace. Michelle and Molly stand out, however, \nfor their constant contributions to others without consideration for \nthemselves. The Prudential Spirit of Community Awards program has \nconsidered more than 20,000 young people this year and Michelle and \nMolly are among the handful selected for the honor.\n  I heartily applaud Michelle and Molly for their initiative in seeking \nto\n\n[[Page S1412]]\n\nmake others' lives better.

A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to provide for \nan influenza vaccine awareness campaign, ensure a sufficient influenza \nvaccine supply, and prepare for an influenza pandemic or epidemic, to \namend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to encourage vaccine production \ncapacity, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I rise today to encourage increased \nproduction of influenza vaccines in the United States. I am happy to \nhonor my commitment to reintroduce the Flu Protection Act of 2005, \nalong with Senator Bayh.\n  We dodged a bullet this year because we had a relatively mild flu \nseason. Also, because the administration and public health officials \ndid an excellent job of immediately addressing the vaccine shortage \nwhen it was announced in October. While this season's vaccine shortage \ndidn't have as strong an impact as it might have, we should not go a \nday without looking for a path toward solving this problem so that we \ndon't have the same issues in years to come. We may not always be so \nfortunate. Scientists believe that the return of an especially strong \npandemic strain of flu is overdue. This legislation supports the \nadministration's efforts to take steps to prepare for the imminent \nthreat of avian flu.\n  The Bush administration has made progress on this issue, but Congress \nneeds to address the underlying problems. The United States is \ndisturbingly underprepared to deal with a massive outbreak or a sudden \nshortage of vaccine. We don't want to get caught short next year. We \nmust aggressively encourage vaccine companies to come into this market \nand pass building incentives for existing companies.\n  I am encouraged that some sections of this legislation have been \nincluded in the majority's priority legislative package and look \nforward to working with other Members of Congress to ensure that the \nmost comprehensive piece of legislation possible can be approved. We \nmust move quickly to pass legislation that ensures sufficient flu \nvaccine supply, encourages an increase in production capacity, supports \na flu vaccine awareness campaign, and prepares the United States to \ncombat a pandemic or epidemic.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. HUTCHISON:\n  S. 376. A bill to improve intermodal shipping container \ntransportation security; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I rise to introduce a bill that will \nmake much-needed improvements to our container security system. The \nFederal Government currently has no coordinated strategy which \nintegrates the many aspects of inter-modal container shipping.\n  We may not be able to physically screen every container on the move \nin our Nation's vast economy, but we should not leave vast shipments of \ncargo completely unchecked. My bill lays out a systematic plan to \ncoordinate and expand existing methods of screening and securing \nmaterials using available technology.\n  The cost to the U.S. economy of port closures on the West Coast due \nto a labor dispute last year was approximately $1 billion per day for \nthe first five days, and rose sharply thereafter. These disruptions \nhave become so costly because the container shipping system is designed \nfor speed and efficiency; as a result, the U.S. and its global trading \npartners have in effect become hostages to a ``just-in-time'' \ndistribution model where any disruption of the system has far reaching \nand immediate global impact.\n  I am eager to prevent a similar situation from occurring, since in my \nhome State the Port of Houston, a $15 billion petrochemical complex, is \nthe second-largest port in the U.S. and first in international tonnage. \nTexas has 13 deepwater ports, many of which subsequently move freight \nby rail, a model typical nationwide.\n  My bill will require the Department of Homeland Security to \nincorporate aviation, maritime, rail and highway security in a single \nplan. We need a coordinated strategy to make the most of federal, \nstate, and local capabilities.\n  The bill requires a ``smart box'' standard to reduce the cost of \ninspecting shipping containers and calls for all containers to meet \nthis standard by 2009. It establishes penalties for commercial \nshippers, to hold them, and by extension their clients, responsible for \nproperly documenting the contents of their shipments. Finally, it \nsignificantly increases U.S. Customs' presence overseas, because \nidentifying a dirty bomb after it is unloaded onto U.S. soil may be too \nlate.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation and I ask unanimous \nconsent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was  ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows: \n\n                                 S. 376\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Intermodal Shipping \n     Container Security Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. NATIONAL TRANSPORTATION SECURITY STRATEGY.\n\n       In carrying out section 114(f) of title 49, United States \n     Code, the Under Secretary of Homeland Security for Border and \n     Transportation Security shall take into account the National \n     Maritime Transportation Security Plan prepared under section \n     70103 of title 46, United States Code, by the Secretary of \n     the department in which the Coast Guard is operating when the \n     plan is prepared in order to ensure that the strategy for \n     dealing with threats to transportation security developed \n     under section 114(f)(3) of title 49, United States Code, \n     incorporates relevant aspects of the National Maritime \n     Transportation Security Plan and addresses all modes of \n     commercial transportation to, from, and within the United \n     States.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to require negotiation and appropriate action with \nrespect to certain countries that engage in currency manipulation; to \nthe Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, today, February 15, 2005, I rise to \nintroduce a bill, proposing we enact the Fair Currency Enforcement Act \nof 2005. The present legislation addresses the practice of some \ngovernments to intervene aggressively in currency markets, or to peg \ntheir currencies at a fixed--artificially low--exchange rate, thus \nsubsidizing their export sales and raising price barriers to imports \nfrom the United States. I introduced similar legislation last Congress, \nyet the problem remains unsolved.\n  In recent years, particularly China has been pressed to float their \ncurrency upward. Specifically, the Europeans, the International \nMonetary Fund and the Bank for International Settlements have put \npressure on the Chinese to at a minimum repeg their currency to a \nhigher dollar value. The Administration has talked about this idea, but \nhas been ineffective. As a consequence there has been no movement on \nthe part of the Chinese.\n  As a result of the heavy dollar buying, the Asian Central banks have \nallowed their foreign-exchange reserves to swell from less than $800 \nbillion at the start of 1999 to over $1.5 trillion in 2003. This is \nalmost two-thirds of the global total.\n  The world's seven biggest holders of foreign-exchange reserves are \nall in Asia.\n  This legislation proposes that our Administration promptly open \nnegotiations with the four Asian countries that exemplify this \npractice, with the intent to put a stop to it. These countries are: \nChina, Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan. This practice hurts American \nmanufacturers: it impedes their ability to introduce new products and \ntechnologies and provide Americans with quality jobs. It has caused and \ncontinues to cause the current economic recovery to be a jobless one, \nparticularly in the manufacturing sector.\n  Experts indicate that the United States has the right and the power \nto address unfair competitive practices under the following laws, rules \nand agreements: 1. Section 3004 of the Omnibus Trade and \nCompetitiveness Act of 1988 2. Article IV of the Articles of Agreement \nof the International Monetary Fund Article 3. XV of the Exchange \nAgreements of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 4. The \nAgreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures of the World Trade \nOrganization (as described in section 101(d)(12)) of the Uruguay Round \nAgreements Act. 5. Article XXIII of the General Agreement on Tariffs \nand Trade. 6. Sections 301 and 406 of the Trade Act of 1974. 7. The \nprovisions of the United States-China Bilateral Agreement on World \nTrade Organization Accession.\n  These laws, rules and agreements provide us with ample process to do \nthis right and it is important we act now. Therefore, beginning on the \ndate of enactment of this Act, the President will be required to start \na 90 day period of negations. If these negotiations fail to bear fruit, \nhe is required to seek redress through the various international trade \nlaws by instituting appropriate proceedings, or report to congress in \ndetail why this is not a proper course of action.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the Bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 377\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Fair Currency Enforcement \n     Act of 2005''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The manufacturing sector is an important driver of the \n     United States economy, contributing almost 30 percent of our \n     economic growth during the 1990's, and twice the productivity \n     growth of the service sector during that period.\n       (2) The manufacturing sector contributes significantly to \n     our Nation's development of new products and technologies for \n     world markets, performing almost 60 percent of all research \n     and development in the United States over the past two \n     decades.\n       (3) The manufacturing sector provides high quality jobs, \n     with average weekly wages between 20 and 30 percent higher \n     than jobs in the service sector.\n       (4) The manufacturing growth creates a significant number \n     of jobs and investments in other sectors of the economy, and \n     this ``multiplier effect'' is reckoned by economists to be \n     larger (2.43 to 1) than for any other significant sector of \n     the economy.\n       (5) The ``jobless recovery'' from the recent recession has \n     witnessed the worst job slump since the Great Depression and \n     the weakest employment recovery on record.\n       (6) The manufacturing sector has been hit the hardest by \n     the jobless recovery.\n       (7) A significant factor in the loss of valuable United \n     States manufacturing jobs is the difficulty faced by United \n     States manufacturers in competing effectively against lower \n     priced foreign products.\n       (8) A significant obstacle to United States manufacturers \n     in competing against foreign manufacturers is the practice of \n     some governments of intervening aggressively in currency \n     markets, or pegging their currencies at fixed rates, to \n     maintain their own currencies at artificially low valuations, \n     thus subsidizing their export sales and raising price \n     barriers to imports from the United States.\n       (9) Certain Asian countries exemplify this practice. China, \n     Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan together have accumulated \n     approximately \\1/2\\ of the world's total currency reserves. \n     The vast majority of these reserves, perhaps as high as 90 \n     percent, are in dollars. These same 4 countries account for \n     60 percent of the United States world trade deficit in \n     manufactured goods. These reserves are symptomatic of a \n     strategy of intervention to manipulate currency values.\n       (10) The People's Republic of China is particularly \n     aggressive in intervening to maintain the value of its \n     currency, the renminbi, at an artificially low rate. China \n     maintains this rate by mandating foreign exchange sales at \n     its central bank at a fixed exchange rate against the dollar, \n     in effect, pegging the\n\n[[Page S1418]]\n\n     renminbi at this rate. This low rate represents a significant \n     reason why China has contributed the most to our trade \n     deficit in manufactured goods.\n       (11) Economists estimate that as a result of this \n     manipulation of the Chinese currency, the renminbi is \n     undervalued by between 15 and 40 percent, effectively \n     creating a 15- to 40-percent subsidy for Chinese exports and \n     giving Chinese manufacturers a significant price advantage \n     over United States and other competitors.\n       (12) The national currency of Japan is the yen. Experts \n     estimate that the yen is undervalued by approximately 20 \n     percent or more, giving Japanese manufacturers a significant \n     price advantage over United States competitors.\n       (13) In addition to being placed at a competitive \n     disadvantage by foreign competitors' exports that are \n     unfairly subsidized by strategically undervalued currencies, \n     United States manufacturers also may face significant \n     nontariff barriers to their own exports to these same \n     countries. For example, in the past in China, until \n     remediated, a complex system involving that nation's value \n     added tax and special tax rebates ensured that semiconductor \n     devices imported into China were taxed at 17 percent while \n     domestic devices are effectively taxed at 6 percent.\n       (14) The United States has the right and power to redress \n     unfair competitive practices in international trade involving \n     currency manipulation.\n       (15) Under section 3004 of the Omnibus Trade and \n     Competitiveness Act of 1988, the Secretary of the Treasury is \n     required to determine whether any country is manipulating the \n     rate of exchange between its currency and the dollar for the \n     purpose of preventing effective balance of payments \n     adjustments or gaining unfair advantage in international \n     trade. If such violations are found, the Secretary of the \n     Treasury is required to undertake negotiations with any \n     country that has a significant trade surplus.\n       (16) Article IV of the Articles of Agreement of the \n     International Monetary Fund prohibits currency manipulation \n     by a member for the purposes of gaining an unfair competitive \n     advantage over other members, and the related surveillance \n     provision defines ``manipulation'' to include ``protracted \n     large-scale intervention in one direction in the exchange \n     market''.\n       (17) Under Article XV of the Exchange Agreements of the \n     General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, all contracting \n     parties ``shall not, by exchange action, frustrate the intent \n     of the provisions of this Agreement, nor by trade action, the \n     intent of the Articles of Agreement of the International \n     Monetary Fund''. Such actions are actionable violations. The \n     intent of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade Exchange \n     Agreement, as stated in the preamble of that Agreement, \n     includes the objective of ``entering into reciprocal and \n     mutually advantageous arrangements directed to substantial \n     reduction of tariffs and other barriers to trade,'' and \n     currency manipulation may constitute a trade barrier \n     disruptive to reciprocal and mutually advantageous trade \n     arrangements.\n       (18) Deliberate currency manipulation by nations to \n     significantly undervalue their currencies also may be \n     interpreted as a violation of the Agreement on Subsidies and \n     Countervailing Measures of the World Trade Organization (as \n     described in section 101(d)(12)) of the Uruguay Round \n     Agreements Act, which could lead to action and remedy under \n     the World Trade Organization dispute settlement procedures.\n       (19) Deliberate, large-scale intervention by governments in \n     currency markets to significantly undervalue their currencies \n     may be a nullification and impairment of trade benefits \n     precluded under Article XXIII of the General Agreement on \n     Tariffs and Trade, and subject to remedy.\n       (20) The United States Trade Representative also has \n     authority to pursue remedial actions under section 301 of the \n     Trade Act of 1974.\n       (21) The United States has special rights to take action to \n     redress market disruption under section 406 of the Trade Act \n     of 1974 adopted pursuant to the provisions of the United \n     States-China Bilateral Agreement on World Trade Organization \n     Accession.\n       (22) While large-scale manipulation of currencies by \n     certain major trading partners to achieve an unfair \n     competitive advantage is one of the most pervasive barriers \n     faces by the manufacturing sector in the United States, other \n     factors are contributing to the decline of manufacturing and \n     small and mid-sized manufacturing firms in the United States, \n     including but not limited to non-tariff trade barriers, lax \n     enforcement of existing trade agreements, and weak or under \n     utilized government support for trade promotion.\n\n     SEC. 3. NEGOTIATION PERIOD REGARDING CURRENCY NEGOTIATIONS.\n\n       Beginning on the date of enactment of this Act, the \n     President shall begin bilateral and multilateral negotiations \n     for a 90-day period with those governments of nations \n     determined to be engaged most egregiously in currency \n     manipulation, as defined in section 7, to seek a prompt and \n     orderly end to such currency manipulation and to ensure that \n     the currencies of these countries are freely traded on \n     international currency markets, or are established at a level \n     that reflects a more appropriate and accurate market value. \n     The President shall seek support in this process from \n     international agencies and other nations and regions \n     adversely affected by these currency practices.\n\n     SEC. 4. FINDINGS OF FACT AND REPORT REGARDING CURRENCY \n                   MANIPULATION.\n\n       (a) In General.--During the 90-day negotiation period \n     described in section 3, the International Trade Commission \n     shall--\n       (1) ascertain and develop the full facts and details \n     concerning how countries have acted to manipulate their \n     currencies to increase their exports to the United States and \n     limit their imports of United States products;\n       (2) quantify the extent of this currency manipulation;\n       (3) examine in detail how these currency practices have \n     affected and will continue to affect United States \n     manufacturers and United States trade levels, both for \n     imports and exports;\n       (4) review whether and to what extent reduction of currency \n     manipulation and the accumulation of dollar-denominated \n     currency reserves and public debt instruments might adversely \n     affect United States interest rates and public debt \n     financing;\n       (5) make a determination of any and all available \n     mechanisms for redress under applicable international trade \n     treaties and agreements, including the Articles of Agreement \n     of the International Monetary Fund, the General Agreement on \n     Tariffs and Trade, the World Trade Organization Agreements, \n     and United States trade laws; and\n       (6) undertake other appropriate evaluations of the issues \n     described in paragraphs (1) through (5).\n       (b) Report.--Not later than 90 days after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the International Trade Commission \n     shall provide a detailed report to the President, the United \n     States Trade Representative, the Secretary of the Treasury, \n     and the appropriate congressional committees on the findings \n     made as a result of the reviews undertaken under paragraphs \n     (1) through (6) of subsection (a).\n\n     SEC. 5. INSTITUTE PROCEEDINGS REGARDING CURRENCY \n                   MANIPULATION.\n\n       At the end of the 90-day negotiation period provided for in \n     section 3, if agreements are not reached by the President to \n     promptly end currency manipulation, the President shall \n     institute proceedings under the relevant provisions of \n     international law and United States trade laws including \n     sections 301 and 406 of the Trade Act of 1974 with respect to \n     those countries that, based on the findings of the \n     International Trade Commission under section 4, continue to \n     engage in the most egregious currency manipulation. In \n     addition to seeking a prompt end to currency manipulation, \n     the President shall seek appropriate damages and remedies for \n     the Nation's manufacturers and other affected parties. If the \n     President does not institute action, the President shall, not \n     later than 120 days after the date of enactment of this Act, \n     provide to the appropriate congressional committees a \n     detailed explanation and accounting of precisely why the \n     President has determined not to institute action.\n\n     SEC. 6. ADDITIONAL REPORTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS.\n\n       (a) National Security.--Within 90 days of the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Defense shall provide \n     a detailed report to the appropriate congressional committees \n     evaluating the effects on our national security of countries \n     engaging in significant currency manipulations, and the \n     effect of such manipulation on critical manufacturing \n     sectors.\n       (b) Other Unfair Trade Practices.--Within 90 days of the \n     date of enactment of this Act, the United States Trade \n     Representative and the International Trade Commission shall \n     evaluate and report in detail to the appropriate \n     congressional committees on other trade practices and trade \n     barriers by major East Asian trading nations potentially in \n     violation of international trade agreements, including the \n     practice of maintaining a value-added or other tax regime \n     that effectively discriminates against imports by \n     underpricing domestically produced goods, or setting \n     technology standards that effectively limit imports.\n       (c) Trade Enforcement.--Within 90 days of the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the United States Trade Representative \n     and the International Trade Commission shall report in detail \n     to the appropriate congressional committees on steps that \n     could be taken to significantly improve trade enforcement \n     efforts against unfair trade practices by competitor trading \n     nations, including making recommendations for additional \n     support for trade enforcement efforts.\n       (d) Trade Promotion.--Within 90 days of the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Secretaries of State and Commerce, \n     and the United States Trade Representative, shall prepare a \n     detailed report with recommendations on steps that could be \n     undertaken to significantly improve trade promotion for \n     United States goods and services, including recommendations \n     on additional support to improve trade promotion.\n\n     SEC. 7.

A bill to make it a criminal act to willfully use a weapon \nwith the intent to cause death or serious bodily injury to any person \nwhile on board a passenger vessel, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Reducing \nCrime and Terrorism at America's Seaports Act, along with the Chairman \nof the Judiciary Committee Senator Specter, and the Chairman and \nRanking Member of the Terrorism Subcommittee, Senators Kyl and \nFeinstein. My colleagues and I have worked on this legislation for the \npast four years and I am hopeful this package of common-sense criminal \nlaw improvements will be approved by the Senate early this Session.\n  The bipartisan legislation we introduce today should be familiar to \nmy colleagues. It was introduced as S. 2653 in the 108th Congress, \nwhere I worked closely with the then-Chairman of the Committee Senator \nHatch and Senator Leahy to ensure they were comfortable with the bill's \nprovisions. The language has been reviewed by the United States Coast \nGuard, the American Association of Port Authorities, the American \nInstitute of Marine Underwriters, the Inland Marine Underwriters \nAssociation, the Maritime Exchange for the Delaware River and Bay, the \nTransportation Security Administration, and the AFL-CIO. Senator Kyl \nincluded this language in his Tools to Fight Terrorism Act of 2004 and \nit was the subject of a hearing in the Judiciary Subcommittee on \nTerrorism on September 13, 2004. This Congress, identical language was \nintroduced by Senator Gregg at Title IV of S. 3, the majority's \nProtecting America in the War on Terror Act of 2005.\n  Our bill will double the maximum term of imprisonment for anyone who \nfraudulently gains access to a seaport or waterfront. The Interagency \nCommission on Crime and Security at U.S. Seaports concluded that \n``control of access to the seaport or sensitive areas within the \nseaports'' poses one of the greatest potential threats to port \nsecurity. Such unauthorized access continues and exposes the nation's \nseaports, and the communities that surround them, to acts of terrorism, \nsabotage or theft. Our bill will help deter those who seek unauthorized \naccess to our ports by imposing stiffer penalties.\n  Our bill would also increase penalties for noncompliance with certain \nmanifest reporting and record-keeping requirements, including \ninformation regarding the content of cargo containers and the country \nfrom which the shipments originated. An estimated 95 percent of the \ncargo shipped to the U.S. from foreign countries, other than Canada and \nMexico, arrives through our seaports. Accordingly, the Interagency \nCommission found that this enormous flow of goods through U.S. ports \nprovides a tempting target for terrorists and others to smuggle illicit \ncargo into the country, while also making ``our ports potential targets \nfor terrorist attacks.'' In addition, the smuggling of non-dangerous, \nbut illicit, cargo may be used to finance terrorism. Despite the \ngravity of the threat, we continue to operate in an environment in \nwhich terrorists and criminals can evade detection by underreporting \nand misreporting the content of cargo. Increased penalties can help \nhere.\n  The legislation we introduce today would also make it a crime for a \nvessel operator to fail to slow or stop a ship once ordered to do so by \na Federal law enforcement officer, for any person on board a vessel to \nimpede boarding or other law enforcement action authorized by Federal \nlaw, or for any person on board a vessel to provide false information \nto a Federal law enforcement officer. The Coast Guard is the main \nFederal agency responsible for law enforcement at sea. Yet, its ability \nto force a vessel to stop or be boarded is limited. While the Coast \nGuard has the authority to use whatever force is reasonably necessary, \na vessel operator's refusal to stop is not currently a crime. This bill \nwould create that offense.\n  In addition, the Coast Guard maintains over 50,000 navigational aids \non more than 25,000 miles of waterways. These aids, which are relied \nupon by all commercial, military and recreational mariners, are \ncritical for safe navigation by commercial and military vessels. They \ncould be inviting targets for terrorists. Our legislation would make it \na crime to endanger the safe navigation of a ship by damaging any \nmaritime navigational aid maintained by the Coast Guard, place in the \nwaters anything which is likely to damage a vessel or its cargo, \ninterfere with a vessel's safe navigation, or interfere with maritime \ncommerce, or dump a hazardous substance into U.S. waters with the \nintent to endanger human life or welfare.\n  Each year, thousands of ships enter and leave the U.S. through \nseaports, smugglers and terrorists exploit this massive flow of \nmaritime traffic to transport dangerous materials and dangerous people \ninto this country. This legislation would make it a crime to use a \nvessel to smuggle into the United States either a terrorist or any \nexplosive or other dangerous material for use in committing a terrorist \nact. The bill would also make it a crime to damage or destroy any part \nof a ship, a maritime facility, or anything used to load or unload \ncargo and passengers, commit a violent assault on anyone at a maritime \nfacility, or knowingly communicate a hoax in a way which endangers the \nsafety of a vessel. In addition, the Interagency Commission concluded \nthat existing laws are not stiff enough to stop certain crimes, \nincluding cargo theft, at seaports. Our legislation would increase the \nmaximum term of imprisonment for low-level thefts of interstate or \nforeign shipments from 1 year to 3 years and expand the statute to \noutlaw theft of goods from trailers, cargo containers, warehouses, and \nsimilar venues.\n  These are improvements we should make to our criminal code. I am \nunder no illusion, however, that enactment of our bill will guarantee \nthe security of our seaports. We need to dramatically increase the \nfinancial assistance we are giving our ports so that they can harden \ntheir own facilities against potential attackers. I was disappointed to \nread in the Administration's budget that the President wants to \neliminate the Department of Homeland Security's dedicated port security \ngrant program. His budget instead will force our ports to compete \nagainst all other transit systems for scarce federal funds. We've spent \nonly about $750 million to secure seaports since September 11th--the \nCoast Guard reports that is not nearly enough to meet the requirements \nof the Maritime Transportation Security Act. We also need to increase \nthe number of inspections of ships and shipping containers that are \ncoming into our ports. But the amendments to Federal criminal law that \nwe propose here will provide an important deterrent effect and they \nwill give Federal prosecutors new tools to go after terrorists who \nwould target our seaports. I urge my colleagues to support our bill, \nand I look forward to its prompt consideration.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. MIKULSKI (for herself, Mr. Sarbanes, Mr. Durbin, and Mr. \n        Obama).\n  S. 379. A bill to build capacity at community colleges in order to \nmeet increased demand for community college education while maintaining \nthe affordable tuition rates and the open-door policy that are the \nhallmarks on the community college system; to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the ``Community \nCollege Opportunity Act.'' Community colleges are the gateway to the \nfuture--for first time students looking for an affordable college \neducation, and for mid-career students looking to get ahead in the \nworkplace. As college tuition at four-year colleges continues to rise, \nmore and more students are turning to community colleges for the \neducation they need to prepare for 21st century jobs.\n  Yet soon we may not be able to count on our community colleges being \navailable to everyone. The combination of budget cuts and increased \nenrollments is forcing community colleges to make tough choices--\nbetween raising tuition and turning students away. This important \nlegislation will help keep the doors of our community colleges open to \nincreasing numbers of students without sending tuition through the \nroof. My bill authorizes $500 million for a competitive grant program \nto help community colleges serve more students. Community colleges \ncould apply\n\n[[Page S1420]]\n\nfor a grant to help with the cost of constructing or renovating \nfacilities, hiring faculty, purchasing new computers and scientific \nequipment, and investing in creative ways of addressing overcrowding--\nlike distance learning.\n  Why is this important? Community colleges are one of the great \nAmerican social inventions. I used to teach night school at Baltimore \nCity Community College. I know firsthand the vital role they play in \nour communities. Their low cost, convenient location, and open door \nadmissions policy have made them the key to the American dream for so \nmany. Many generations of immigrants pursued the American dream by \nworking all day and going to night school at night. After World War II, \nthe GI bill gave returning veterans a chance to get ahead by going to \nlocal junior colleges.\n  Now, more than ever, it's important to invest in community colleges. \nIn the next ten years, 40 percent of new jobs will require college \neducation. At the same time, college tuition is on the rise. Tuition at \nthe University of Maryland is up by as much as 32 percent. That's \ncausing many students to take a second look at community colleges \nbecause they're more affordable. They're also leaders in training \nworkers for 21st century jobs--from nurses to computer techies, and \neven lab techs for new industries, like biotechnology. They're playing \na key role in addressing shortages in nursing and teaching. In \nMaryland, community colleges train 55 percent of new nurses.\n  Yet our community colleges are bursting at the seams. They're growing \nfaster than 4-year colleges. Enrollment at Maryland's community \ncolleges is expected to grow 30 percent in the next 10 years, while 4-\nyear colleges will grow by 15 percent. Community colleges are holding \nclasses from 7 in the morning to 10 at night, on weekends, and over the \ninternet. In my own State of Maryland, they are starting to turn \nstudents away because there isn't enough room. Almost 1,000 students \nwere shut out of Montgomery College last spring because they couldn't \nget into the classes they needed or they couldn't afford the cost. \nPrince George's Community College had to turn away 630 prospective \nnursing students and 1,000 prospective education students.\n  It's great that so many Americans are going to community colleges. \nFor so many Americans, community colleges are the only way to get the \neducation they need to be competitive for 21st century jobs. Yet the \nrapid increase of students is threatening the very mission of community \ncolleges. If we want a world-class workforce, we need to invest in \nhigher education. We need to make sure we always have institutions \navailable to everyone who wants a college degree--or just a couple of \ncourses. That means investing in our community colleges, so they can \ncontinue to be affordable, accessible, and successful at training the \nnext generation of nurses, teachers, and techies.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 379\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to establish a \nState family support grant program to end the practice of parents \ngiving legal custody of their seriously emotionally disturbed children \nto State agencies for the purpose of obtaining mental health services \nfor those children; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I am very pleased today to join several \nof my colleagues--Senator Pryor, Senator DeWine, Senator Bingaman, \nSenator Smith, Senator Lieberman, and the Presiding Officer, Senator \nColeman--in introducing the Keeping Families Together Act. This \nlegislation is intended to reduce the barriers to care for children who \nare struggling with serious mental illness. It is intended to ensure \ntheir parents are no longer forced to give up custody of their children \nsolely for the purpose of securing mental health treatment.\n  As the Presiding Officer is well aware, because he was an active \nparticipant in them, the Governmental Affairs Committee in the last \nCongress held extensive hearings on this issue.\n  What we heard was a tragedy. We heard case after case where families\n\n[[Page S1421]]\n\nmade the wrenching choice to give up custody of their children in order \nto secure the mental health treatment that they needed. No family \nshould ever be forced to make that decision.\n  Imagine what it feels like for a child who is suffering from mental \nillness to be wrenched from his family, put into either the juvenile \njustice system or the foster care system simply because that is the \nonly way to get that child the care that he so desperately needs.\n  Serious mental illness afflicts millions of our Nation's children and \nadolescents. It is estimated that as many as 20 percent of American \nchildren under the age of 17 suffer from a mental, emotional or \nbehavioral illness. What I find most disturbing, however, is the fact \nthat two-thirds of all young people who need mental health treatment \nare not getting it.\n  Behind each of these statistics is a family that is struggling to do \nthe best it can to help a son or a daughter with serious mental health \nneeds to be just like every other kid--to develop friendships, to do \nwell in school, and to get along with their siblings and other family \nmembers. These children are almost always involved with more than one \nsocial service agency, including the mental health, special education, \nchild welfare, or the juvenile justice systems. Yet no one agency, at \neither the State or the Federal level, is clearly responsible or \naccountable for helping these children and their families.\n  My interest in this issue was triggered by a compelling series of \nstories by Barbara Walsh in the Portland Press Herald which detailed \nthe obstacles that many Maine families have faced in getting \ndesperately needed mental health services for their children. Too many \nfamilies in Maine and elsewhere have been forced to make wrenching \ndecisions when they have been advised that the only way to get the care \nthat their children so desperately need is to relinquish custody and \nplace them in either the child welfare or juvenile justice system.\n  When a child has a serious physical health problem like diabetes or a \nheart condition, the family turns to their doctor. When the family \nincludes a child with a serious mental illness, it is often forced to \ngo to the child welfare or juvenile justice system to secure treatment.\n  Yet neither system is intended to serve children with serious mental \nillness. Child welfare systems are designed to protect children who \nhave been abused or neglected. Juvenile justice systems are designed to \nrehabilitate children who have committed criminal or delinquent acts. \nWhile neither of these systems is equipped to care for a child with a \nserious mental illness, in far too many cases, there is nowhere else \nfor the family to turn.\n  In some extreme cases, families feel forced to file charges against \ntheir child or to declare that they have abused or neglected them in \norder to get the care that they need. As one family advocate observed, \n``Beat 'em up, lock 'em up, or give 'em up,'' characterizes the choices \nthat some families face in their efforts to get help for their \nchildren's mental illness.\n  In 2003, the Government Accountability Office, GAO, issued a report \nthat I requested with Representatives Pete Stark and Patrick Kennedy \nthat found that, in 2001, parents placed more than 12,700 children into \nthe child welfare or juvenile justice systems so that these children \ncould receive mental health services. I believe that this is just the \ntip of the iceberg, since 32 States--including five States with the \nlargest populations of children--did not provide the GAO with any data.\n  Other studies indicate that the problem is even more pervasive. A \n1999 survey by the National Alliance for the Mentally III found that 23 \npercent--or one in four of the parents surveyed--had been told by \npublic officials that they needed to relinquish custody of their \nchildren to get care, and that one in five of these families had done \nso.\n  Some States have passed laws to limit custody or prohibit custody \nrelinquishment. Simply banning the practice is not a solution, however, \nsince it can leave children with mental illness and their families \nwithout services and care. Custody relinquishment is merely a symptom \nof the much larger problem, which is the lack of available, affordable \nand appropriate mental health services and support systems for these \nchildren and their families.\n  Last Congress, I chaired a series of hearings in the Governmental \nAffairs Committee to examine this issue further. We heard compelling \ntestimony from mothers who told us that they were advised that the only \nway to get the intensive care and services that their children needed \nwas to relinquish custody and place them in the child welfare or \njuvenile justice system. This is a wrenching decision that no family \nshould be forced to make. No parent should have to give up custody of \nhis or her child just to get the services that the child needs.\n  The mothers also described the barriers they faced in getting care \nfor their children. They told us about the limitations in both public \nand private insurance coverage. They also talked about the lack of \ncoordination and communication among the various agencies and programs \nthat service children with mental health needs. One parent, desperate \nfor help for her twin boys, searched for 2 years until she finally \nlocated a program--which she characterized as ``the best kept secret in \nIllinois''--that was able to help.\n  Parents should not be bounced from agency to agency, knocking on \nevery door they come to, in the hope that they will happen upon someone \nwho has an answer. It simply should not be such a struggle for parents \nto get services and treatment for their children.\n  We also need to question what happens to these children when they are \nturned over to the child welfare or juvenile justice authorities. I \nreleased a report last year with Congressman Henry Waxman that found \nthat all too often they are simply left to languish in juvenile \ndetention centers, which are ill-equipped to meet their needs, while \nthey wait for scarce mental health services.\n  Our report, which was based on a national survey of juvenile \ndetention centers, found that the use of juvenile detention facilities \nto ``warehouse'' children with mental disorders is a serious national \nproblem. It found that, over a six month period, nearly 15,000 young \npeople--roughly 7 percent of all of the children in the centers \nsurveyed--were detained solely because they were waiting for mental \nhealth services outside the juvenile justice system. Many were held \nwithout any charges pending against them, and the young people \nincarcerated unnecessarily while waiting for treatment were as young as \nseven years old. Finally, the report estimated that juvenile detention \nfacilities are spending an estimated $100 million of the taxpayers' \nmoney each year simply to warehouse children and teenagers while they \nare waiting for mental health services.\n  The Keeping Families Together Act, which we are introducing today, \nwill help to improve access to mental health services and assist states \nin eliminating the practice of parents relinquishing custody of their \nchildren solely for the purpose of securing treatment.\n  The legislation authorizes $55 million over 6 years for competitive \ngrants to states to create an infrastructure to support and sustain \nstatewide systems of care to serve children who are in custody or at \nrisk of entering custody of the State for the purpose of receiving \nmental health services. States already dedicate significant dollars to \nserve children in state custody. These Family Support Grants would help \nStates to serve children more effectively and efficiently, while \nkeeping them at home with their families.\n\n  The legislation would also remove a current statutory barrier that \nprevents more States from using the Medicaid home and community-based \nservices waiver to serve children with serious mental health needs. \nThis waiver provides a promising way for States to address the \nunderlying lack of mental health services for children that often leads \nto custody relinquishment. While a number of States have requested \nthese waivers to serve children with developmental disabilities, very \nfew have done so for children with serious mental health conditions. \nOur legislation would provide parity to children with mental illness by \nmaking it easier for States to offer them home- and community-based \nservices under this waiver as an alternative to institutional care.\n  And finally, the legislation calls for the creation of a federal \ninteragency task force to examine mental health issues in the child \nwelfare and juvenile\n\n[[Page S1422]]\n\njustice systems and the role of those agencies in promoting access by \nchildren and youth to needed mental health services. The task force \nwould also be charged with monitoring the Family Support grants, making \nrecommendations to Congress on how to improve mental health services, \nand fostering interagency cooperation and removing interagency barriers \nthat contribute to the problem of custody relinquishment.\n  The Keeping Families Together Act takes a critical step forward to \nmeeting the needs of children with serious mental or emotional \ndisorders. Our legislation has been endorsed by a broad coalition of \nmental health and children's groups, including the National Alliance \nfor the Mentally Ill, the Federation of Families for Children's Mental \nHealth, the Bazelon Center for Mental Health Law, the National Child \nWelfare League, the National Mental Health Association, the American \nCorrectional Association, the American Psychological Association, the \nAmerican Psychiatric Association, the American Academy of Child and \nAdolescent Psychiatry, and Fight Crime, Invest in Kids.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that their letters of \nendorsement for the bill be printed in the Congressional Record, and I \nurge all of our colleagues to join us as cosponsors.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                February 14, 2005.\n     Hon.

Patrick Kennedy,\n     U.S. House of Representatives,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Collins and Pryor and Representatives \n     Ramstad, Johnson, Stark, and Kennedy: As national \n     organizations representing mental health consumers, families, \n     advocates, professionals and providers dedicated to improving \n     the lives of children and adolescents living with mental \n     disorders and their families, we applaud your leadership in \n     reintroducing the Keeping Families Together Act in the 109th \n     Congress.\n       This legislation promises to help end a scandal that has \n     lingered too long in states throughout our nation. As you \n     know, thousands of families every year are forced to give up \n     custody of their children to the state in order to secure \n     vitally necessary mental health services. This unthinkable \n     practice tears families apart, is devastating for parents and \n     caregivers and leaves children feeling abandoned in their \n     hour of greatest need.\n       This practice occurs because most families have \n     discriminatory and restrictive caps on their private mental \n     health coverage or insurers fail to cover the required \n     treatment. The majority of these families are not eligible \n     for Medicaid coverage because of their income. This truly \n     unfortunate practice also exists because of the lack of \n     appropriate mental health services in many states and \n     communities for children and adolescents with mental \n     disorders. This was well documented in President Bush's New \n     Freedom Commission report on mental health (July 2003).\n       This legislation promises to help end this growing crisis \n     by providing grants to states to establish interagency \n     systems of care for children and adolescents with serious \n     mental disorders. The grants will allow states to build more \n     efficient and effective mental health systems for children \n     and families. It also eliminates barriers to home and \n     community-based care for children by enabling a greater \n     number of children to receive mental health services under \n     the Section 1915(c) Medicaid home- and community-based \n     waiver. The waiver promises to make appropriate services \n     available to children in their homes and communities and \n     close to their loved ones at a considerable cost savings over \n     providing those services in an institutional setting.\n       The legislation also calls for the creation of a federal \n     interagency task force to examine mental health issues in the \n     child welfare and juvenile justice systems. A GAO report \n     released in April 2003 showed that when parents give up \n     custody of their child to secure mental health services, \n     those children are placed in one of these two systems--\n     neither of which is designed to be a mental health service \n     agency.\n       No family in our nation should ever be asked to make the \n     heart-wrenching decision to give up parental rights of their \n     seriously ill child in exchange for mental health treatment \n     and services.\n       We welcome this legislation as a critical step toward \n     ending this practice and toward delivering more cost \n     effective and appropriate services for children and families.\n       Once again, we thank you for your leadership and commitment \n     to ending this practice and for continuing to stand up for \n     children, families and common sense.\n           Sincerely,\n       Adoptions Together, Inc.\n       Alabama Foster and Adoptive Association.\n       Alliance for Children and Families.\n       American Academy of Child & Adolescent Psychiatry.\n       American Correctional Association.\n       American Counseling Association.\n       American Mental Health Counselors Association.\n       American Association for Marriage and Family Therapy.\n       American Psychiatric Association.\n       American Psychological Association.\n       Association of University Centers on Disabilities.\n       Bazelon Center for Mental Health Law.\n       Child and Adolescent Bipolar Foundation.\n       Children's Action Alliance.\n       Children and Adults with Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity \n     Disorder.\n       Child Welfare League of America.\n       Children Awaiting Parents.\n       Children's Defense Fund.\n       Depression and Bipolar Alliance.\n       Family Voices.\n       Federation of Families for Children's Mental Health.\n       Foster Family-based Treatment Association.\n       Girls Incorporated of Memphis.\n       Learning Disabilities Association of America.\n       Lutheran Children and Family Service.\n       National Alliance for the Mentally Ill.\n       National Association for Children of Alcoholics.\n       National Association for Children's Behavioral Health.\n       National Association of County Behavioral Health and \n     Disability Directors.\n       National Association of Mental Health Planning and Advisory \n     Councils.\n       National Association of Protection and Advocacy Systems.\n       National Association of School Psychology.\n       National Association of Social Workers.\n       National Association of State Mental Health Program \n     Directors.\n       National CASA Association (Court Appointed Special \n     Advocates).\n       National Foster Parent Association.\n       National Independent Living Association.\n       National Mental Health Association.\n       National Respite Coalition.\n       Physicians for Human Rights.\n       School Social Work Association of America.\n       Suicide Prevention Action Network USA.\n       Supportive Child Adult Network, Inc.

Susan Collins,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Collins: On behalf of the more than 2,000 \n     sheriffs, police chiefs, prosecutors, and victims of violence \n     who constitute the national anti-crime group FIGHT CRIME: \n     INVEST IN KIDS, thank you for introducing the Keeping \n     Families Together Act. This bill would take an important step \n     toward ending the practice of inappropriately placing kids in \n     juvenile detention facilities solely because of the absence \n     of affordable and accessible mental health treatment for \n     them. These placements drain significant resources from an \n     already underfunded juvenile justice system, diverting \n     funding that would otherwise support effective violence \n     prevention programs for at-risk kids and intervention \n     programs for kids who have already committed a criminal or \n     delinquent act.\n       A July 2003 General Accounting Office report, Child Welfare \n     and Juvenile Justice: Several Factors Influence the Placement \n     of Children Solely to Obtain Mental Health Services, revealed \n     that over 9,000 kids in selected counties in 17 states were \n     placed in the juvenile justice system merely to obtain mental \n     health services. Furthermore, a House Committee on Government \n     Reform report demonstrated that two-thirds of juvenile \n     detention facilities inappropriately hold kids waiting for \n     mental health services. In 33 states, kids who did not have \n     any criminal charges were held in detention facilities while \n     awaiting community mental health treatment. Other kids had \n     been charged with an offense but would not have been placed \n     in detention but for the lack of available mental health \n     treatment. In fact, the House Committee report revealed that, \n     each night, nearly 2,000 kids wait in detention for community \n     mental health services, representing 7 percent of all youth \n     held in juvenile detention. It is estimated that juvenile \n     detention facilities spend approximately $100 million each \n     year to keep kids who are inappropriately placed as they wait \n     for mental health treatment. This cost does not account for \n     the additional service provision and staff time often needed \n     in juvenile facilities to care for kids with severe mental \n     health problems, although over half of responding facilities \n     reported that staff receives poor, very poor, or no mental \n     health training.\n       Every year, 1.4 million kids are charged with an offense \n     for which an adult could be tried in a criminal court. The \n     juvenile justice system is responsible for rehabilitating \n     these kids so that they can leave the system and become \n     productive citizens instead of continuing a life of crime, as \n     well as for preventing such acts in the first place. \n     Inappropriately placing kids who need mental health treatment \n     in juvenile detention facilities places an unnecessary \n     financial burden on the inadequately-resourced juvenile\n\n[[Page S1423]]\n\n     justice system, and jeopardizes the safety of our \n     communities. The Keeping Families Together Act would provide \n     grants to help states provide and coordinate the needed array \n     of mental health services to children so that families do not \n     need to relinquish their kids to the juvenile justice system. \n     This legislation would also establish a federal interagency \n     task force to examine mental health issues in the child \n     welfare and juvenile justice systems.\n       We are proud that our Senator introduced the Keeping \n     Families Together Act to help keep families together, focus \n     juvenile justice resources on delinquent and at-risk kids, \n     and make our communities safer.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Mark Westrum,\n                                    Sheriff, Sagadahoc County, ME.\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleagues, Senator \nCollins and Senator Pryor, in introducing the ``Keeping Families \nTogether Act''. This bill will expand Medicaid's home and community \nbased services waiver to cover children and adolescents in residential \ntreatment facilities. Currently, most state Medicaid agencies, \nincluding Oregon, do not cover this intensive treatment.\n  In 2001, 101 Oregon children and adolescents were placed in State \ncustody because this was the only way they could get the mental health \ntreatment they need. This situation occurs most often in middle-income \nfamilies, where the family's employer-based insurance does not cover \nintensive treatment for serious mental illness, but the family income \nis too high for them to qualify for Medicaid services. With no other \nway to get their child treatment, parents are forced to choose between \ncustody and care. Passage of this legislation is urgently needed so \nthat thousands of parents are not forced to relinquish their custody \nrights to State child welfare or juvenile agencies in order to obtain \nmental health care for their seriously mentally ill children.\n  In Oregon, children with serious mental illnesses are being taken \naway from their families at a time when they most need to be close to \nhome. The availability of family support services, community-based \nservices and other effective interventions will help reduce the need \nfor costly residential care and consequently reduce the need to place \nchildren in a setting away from their homes, families and communities. \nKeeping Families Together Act will also establish a Federal interagency \ntask force to examine mental health issues in the child welfare and \njuvenile justice systems so that we can hopefully see an end to this \npractice, not just in Oregon, but in every State in our nation.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in support of this critical \nlegislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SMITH (for himself, Mr. Conrad, Ms. Snowe, and Mrs. \n        Clinton):\n  S. 381. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to \nencourage guaranteed lifetime income payments from annuities and \nsimilar payments of life insurance proceeds at dates later than death \nby excluding from income a portion of such payments; to the Committee \non Finance.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, America will soon be facing a new and \nserious retirement challenge. Americans are living longer. Yet, recent \neconomic and demographic shifts will put the retirement security of \nmany retirees at risk. Current projections regarding the solvency of \nthe Social Security program are not favorable. And, with 77 million \nbaby boomers set to begin retiring in 2008, the number of retirees in \nthe Social Security program is expected to double. In addition, fewer \nretirees in the future will be able to depend on monthly pension checks \nthat many employers once paid. A growing number of retirees will be \nfacing the difficult challenge of managing their own savings.\n  In response to these trends, I am offering legislation aimed at \nassisting Americans maintain their financial independence and their \nstandard of living throughout their retirement by making it easier for \nthem to secure a steady income for life. Under the Retirement Security \nfor Life Act that Senator Conrad and I are introducing today, a tax \nincentive would be enacted that encourages retirees to provide \nthemselves with a guaranteed lifetime income. Specifically, the \nproposal would exclude from federal taxes one-half of the income \npayments from an annuity purchased with after tax dollars, a so- called \nnon-qualified annuity.\n  Importantly, we have proposed a cap on the exclusion so that no more \nthat $20,000 could be excluded in a year. For a typical American in the \n25 percent tax bracket, this would provide an annual maximum tax \nsavings of up to $5,000. I believe that this modest tax incentive will \nenable some retirees to consider annuitizing a portion of their nest \negg so that they have a guaranteed lifetime of income.\n  In recent years, the ``retirement security'' debate in Congress has \nalmost entirely focused on the need to accumulate a nest egg prior to \nretirement. And, Congress is doing much to encourage personal saving \nand employer-provided retirement plans. I am proud of both our \nsuccesses and our continuing efforts in these areas. Encouraging more \nsavings is an important step, but it is not enough. What has received \nlittle attention is the retirement income or ``payout'' phase of the \nretirement security equation. That is, we need to be thinking about the \nmanagement of market and longevity risk so that a life's savings can \nprovide a secure retirement. Longevity risk--the risk of outliving \none's savings--is one of the biggest risks facing retirees. While we \nhave some control over when we retire, we have very little control over \nhow long we will live. It is my goal that Americans will be able to \nenjoy a lifetime of income from their hard-earned savings long after \nthey have put their years in the workforce behind them.\n  Please join me in supporting our proposal as a crucial step in \nproviding a secure retirement for all Americans. I ask unanimous \nconsent that the text of the legislation be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 381\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

S. 383. A bill to shorten the term of broadcasting licenses under the \nCommunications Act of 1934 from 8 to 3 years, to provide better public \naccess to broadcasters' public interest issues and programs lists and \nchildren's programming reports, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the ``Localism \nin Broadcasting Reform Act of 2005.'' This legislation would reduce the \nlicense term for broadcasters from 8 years to 3 years, thereby \nrequiring broadcasters to provide the Federal Communications Commission \n(FCC or Commission) with information every 3 years on why their license \nshould be renewed. Prior to 1981, broadcast licenses were granted for a \nterm of 3 years.\n  The bill would require the full Commission to review 5 percent of all \nlicense and renewal applications. Currently, the Media Bureau randomly \naudits 5 percent of all license renewal applications. The FCC first \nstarted an audit process back in the 1980s when the FCC changed its \nlicense renewal process from one where stations submitted evidence of \n``public interest'' obligations compliance to one where stations self \ncertify compliance, critics call it a ``post card renewal''. This \nsection would take the audit process a step further by requiring the \nCommissioners to review the applications selected for audit rather than \nthe Media Bureau.\n  The bill would command broadcasters to post on their Internet sites \ninformation detailing their commitment to local public affairs \nprogramming and children's programming. The bill also calls for the FCC \nto complete\n\n[[Page S1425]]\n\nits proceeding on whether public interest obligations should apply to \nbroadcasters in the digital era.\n  To ensure that viewers or listeners can fully participate in a \nbroadcaster's license renewal, the bill would codify the Commission's \nrule that a viewer or listener has standing to challenge a license if \nhe demonstrates either that he resides in the station's service area or \nthat he regularly listens or views the station and that such listening \nor viewing is not the result of transient contacts with the station.\n  Lastly, the bill would allow the Commission, during a license renewal \nproceeding, to review not only the performance of the station seeking \nrenewal, but also the performance of all stations owned by the licensee \nseeking renewal. The current statute restricts the Commission's review \nonly to that station seeking the renewal.\n  Last June, FCC Chairman Michael Powell and I challenged all local \nbroadcast television and radio stations to provide their local \ncommunities with significant information on the local political issues \nfacing communities, the local candidates' campaign platforms, and the \nlocal candidate debates during the 2004 election. In response to the \nchallenge, many broadcasters sent volumes of material detailing their \nextensive election coverage and committing to increase their coverage \nin 2004. Today, the Norman Lear Center at the Annenberg School for \nCommunication at the University of Southern California released \nfindings showing that local news coverage of local political campaigns \nis dismal. Specifically, the study found that 92 percent of the news \nbroadcasts studied contained no stories about races for the U.S. House, \nState senate or assembly, mayor, city council, law-enforcement posts, \njudgeships, education offices, or regional or county offices.\n  Therefore, I feel it is now time to introduce legislation to bring \nlocal back into local broadcasting. I believe this legislation is a \nstep in the right direction. It will have a small impact on those \nstations that are currently meeting their public interest obligations, \nbut it should have a large impact on those citizens whose local \nbroadcaster is not meeting its obligations. I refuse to believe that \nthe ``public interest'' is served by minimal campaign coverage, such as \na 12 second sound bite on from a candidate during a half-hour local \nnews program as found in the study. Citizens deserve more from their \nlocal broadcaster.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 383\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Food Security Act of 1985 to restore \nintegrity to and strengthen payment limitation rules for commodity \npayments and benefits; to the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and \nForestry.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, the American people recognize the \nimportance of the family farmer to our Nation, and the need to provide \nan adequate safety net for family farmers. In recent years, however, \nassistance to farmers has come under increasing scrutiny.\n  Critics of farm payments have argued that the largest corporate farms \nreap most program benefits. The reality is over 72 percent of the \npayments have gone to only 10 percent of our Nation's farmers. There is \ngood reason to be critical of our farm programs.\n  What's more, farm payments that were originally designed to benefit \nsmall- and medium-sized family farmers have contributed to their own \ndemise. Unlimited farm payments have placed upward pressure on land \nprices\n\n[[Page S1426]]\n\nand have contributed to overproduction and lower commodity prices, \ndriving many family farmers off the farm.\n  The Senate has agreed, by an overwhelming bipartisan vote during the \n2002 farm bill debate and two Senate Budget Committee markups that \ntargeting Federal assistance to small- and medium-sized family farmers \nis the right thing to do.\n  It has been my hope since the 2002 farm bill conference committee \ndropped the payment limit amendment that Congress would establish \nlegitimate, reasonable payment limits similar to S. 667, the payment \nlimits bill we introduced last session.\n  While we have not yet achieved our ultimate goal, no one can question \nthat the votes have been there for payment limits. Unfortunately, a \ntwo-thirds majority in the Senate hasn't been enough to protect this \nissue in conference. But times are clearly changing thanks to the \nPresident's support for payment limits in his budget proposal.\n  The legislation we are introducing today adopts the President's \nproposed cap of $250,000, while maintaining other concepts from S. 667 \nthat the President has embraced like limiting the subterfuge \nsurrounding the three-entity rule, curtailing the use of generic \ncertificates, and developing a measurable standard to determine who \nshould and should not be receiving farm subsidies.\n  I look forward to working with Senator Dorgan again on this issue. \nWith the President's support I believe we will have success.\n  I ask unanimous consent, that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 385\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Rural America Preservation \n     Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. PAYMENT LIMITATIONS.\n\n       Section 1001 of the Food Security of 1985 (7 U.S.C. 1308) \n     is amended--\n       (1) in subsection (b)(1), by striking ``$40,000'' and \n     inserting ``$20,000'';\n       (2) in subsection (c)(1), by striking ``$65,000'' and \n     inserting ``$30,000'';\n       (3) in subsection (d), by striking ``(d)'' and all that \n     follows through the end of paragraph (1) and inserting the \n     following:\n       ``(d) Limitations on Marketing Loan Gains, Loan Deficiency \n     Payments, and Commodity Certificate Transactions.--\n       ``(1) Loan commodities.--The total amount of the following \n     gains and payments that a person may receive during any crop \n     year may not exceed $75,000:\n       ``(A)(i) Any gain realized by a producer from repaying a \n     marketing assistance loan for 1 or more loan commodities \n     under subtitle B of title I of the Farm Security and Rural \n     Investment Act of 2002 (7 U.S.C. 7931 et seq.) at a lower \n     level than the original loan rate established for the loan \n     commodity under that subtitle.\n       ``(ii) In the case of settlement of a marketing assistance \n     loan for 1 or more loan commodities under that subtitle by \n     forfeiture, the amount by which the loan amount exceeds the \n     repayment amount for the loan if the loan had been settled by \n     repayment instead of forfeiture.\n       ``(B) Any loan deficiency payments received for 1 or more \n     loan commodities under that subtitle.\n       ``(C) Any gain realized from the use of a commodity \n     certificate issued by the Commodity Credit Corporation for 1 \n     or more loan commodities, as determined by the Secretary, \n     including the use of a certificate for the settlement of a \n     marketing assistance loan made under that subtitle, with the \n     gain reported annually to the Internal Revenue Service and to \n     the taxpayer in the same manner as gains under subparagraphs \n     (A) and (B).'';\n       (4) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(h) Single Farming Operation.--\n       ``(1) In general.--Notwithstanding subsections (b) through \n     (d), subject to paragraph (2), if a person participates only \n     in a single farming operation and receives, directly or \n     indirectly, any payment or gain covered by this section \n     through the farming operation, the total amount of payments \n     or gains (as applicable) covered by this section that the \n     person may receive during any crop year may be up to but not \n     exceed twice the applicable dollar amounts specified in \n     subsections (b), (c), and (d).\n       ``(2) Individuals.--The total amount of payments or gains \n     (as applicable) covered by this section that an individual \n     person may receive during any crop year may not exceed \n     $250,000.\n       ``(i) Spouse Equity.--Notwithstanding subsections (b) \n     through (d), except as provided in subsection (e)(2)(C)(i), \n     if an individual and spouse are covered by subsection \n     (e)(2)(C) and receive, directly or indirectly, any payment or \n     gain covered by this section, the total amount of payments or \n     gains (as applicable) covered by this section that the \n     individual and spouse may jointly receive during any crop \n     year may not exceed twice the applicable dollar amounts \n     specified in subsections (b), (c), and (d).\n       ``(j) Regulations.--\n       ``(1) In general.--Not later than 270 days after the date \n     of enactment of this subsection, the Secretary shall \n     promulgate regulations--\n       ``(A) to ensure that total payments and gains described in \n     this section made to or through joint operations or multiple \n     entities under the primary control of a person, in \n     combination with the payments and gains received directly by \n     the person, shall not exceed twice the applicable dollar \n     amounts specified in subsections (b), (c), and (d);\n       ``(B) in the case of a person that in the aggregate owns, \n     conducts farming operations, or provides custom farming \n     services on land with respect to which the aggregate payments \n     exceed the applicable dollar amounts specified in subsections \n     (b), (c), and (d), to attribute all payments and gains made \n     on crops produced on the land to--\n       ``(i) a person that rents land as lessee or lessor through \n     a crop share lease and receives a share of the payments that \n     is less than the usual and customary share of the crop \n     received by the lessee or lessor, as determined by the \n     Secretary;\n       ``(ii) a person that provides custom farming services \n     through arrangements under which--\n\n       ``(I) all or part of the compensation for the services is \n     at risk;\n       ``(II) farm management services are provided by--\n\n       ``(aa) the same person;\n       ``(bb) an immediate family member;

Mr. President, on Wednesday, the U.N.

This legislation builds upon three principles: the need \nfor shared responsibilities between developed and developing countries; \nthe linkages between environmental, economic, and energy policies; and \nthe employment of greenhouse gas intensity as the best measurement upon \nwhich to build an effective climate policy.\n  I thank Senators Alexander, Craig, and Dole for their support and for \nagreeing to cosponsor these bills, which are titled: The Climate Change \nTechnology Deployment in Developing Countries Act; The Climate Change \nTechnology Deployment Act; and, The Climate Change Technology Tax \nIncentives Act.\n  Global climate policy affects the world's economic, energy, and \nenvironmental policies. These circles of interest in policy are \ninterconnected. Climate change does not recognize national borders. It \nis a shared responsibility for all nations. Dealing with global climate \npolicy requires a level of diplomatic intensity and coordination worthy \nof the magnitude of the challenge.\n  We all agree on the need for a clean environment and stable climate. \nThe debate is about solutions. The question we face is not whether we \nshould take action, but what kind of action we should take.\n  Climate change initiatives should include commitments to research and \ndevelopment, technology, and a more efficient and productive use of \nenergy and resources.\n  My climate change legislation authorizes new programs, policies, and \nincentives to address the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions.\n  It focuses on the role of technology, private and public \npartnerships, and developing countries.\n  Any climate policy initiative must include clear metrics that \nrecognize the links between energy, the economy, and the environment. \nToo often these policies are considered in vacuums. It is a global \nissue.\n  Bringing in the private sector and creating incentives for \ntechnological innovation will be critical to real progress on global \nclimate policy. I believe that greenhouse gas intensity, or the amount \nof carbon emitted relative to economic output, is the best measurement \nfor dealing with climate change.\n  Greenhouse gas emission intensity is the measurement of how \nefficiently a nation uses carbon emitting fuels and technology in \nproducing goods and services. It captures the links between energy \nefficiency, economic development, and the environment.\n  The first bill, the Climate Change Technology Deployment in \nDeveloping Countries Act, provides the Secretary of State with new \nauthority for coordinating assistance to developing countries for \nprojects and technologies that reduce greenhouse gas intensity.\n  It supports the development of a U.S. global climate strategy to \nexpand the role of the private sector, develop public-private \npartnerships, and encourage the deployment of greenhouse gas reducing \ntechnologies in developing countries. This bill directs the Secretary \nof State to engage global climate change as a foreign policy issue.\n  It directs the U.S. Trade Representative to negotiate the removal of \ntrade-related barriers to the export of greenhouse gas intensity \nreducing technologies, and establishes an inter-agency working group to \npromote the export of greenhouse gas intensity reducing technologies \nand practices from the United States.\n  The legislation authorizes fellowship and exchange programs for \nforeign officials to visit the United States and acquire the expertise \nand knowledge to reduce greenhouse gas intensity in their countries. \nCurrent international approaches to global climate change overlook the \nrole of developing countries as part of either the problem or the \nsolution.\n  In July 1997, months before the Protocol was signed, the Senate \nunanimously passed. S. Res. 98, the Byrd-Hagel Resolution, which called \non the President not to sign any treaty or agreement in Kyoto unless \ntwo conditions were met.\n  First, the United States should not be party to any legally binding \nobligations on greenhouse gas emission reductions unless developing \ncountry, parties are required to meet the same standards. Second, the \nPresident should not sign any treaty that ``would result in serious \nharm to the economy of the United States.''\n  Kyoto does not meet either of these conditions. As it stands, \ndeveloping countries are exempt from the Kyoto obligations, leaving \nmore than 30 developed countries to address greenhouse gas emissions. \nDeveloping nations are becoming the major emitters of greenhouse gases, \nbut they are exempted from the Kyoto Protocol.\n  A recent Congressional Budget Office--CB0--report explains that \ndeveloping countries are projected within the next 20 years to account \nfor two-thirds of the growth in carbon dioxide emissions as their \npopulations and economies expand. There are reasons for this.\n  Developing nations cannot achieve. greenhouse gas reductions until \nthey achieve higher standards of living. They lack clean energy \ntechnology and they cannot absorb the economic impact of the changes \nnecessary for emissions reductions. New policies will require \nrecognition of the limitations of developing nations to meet these \nstandards, and the necessity of including them in any successful future \ninitiative.\n  Because Kyoto does not include developing countries, its approach is \nunrealistic. Any reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by the United \nStates and other developed countries will soon be eclipsed by emissions \nfrom developing nations, such as China, which will soon be the world's \nlargest emitter of manmade greenhouse gases.\n  It is in the shared interests of the United States and industrialized \nnations to help developing countries by sharing cleaner technology. \nDeveloping countries can then ``leapfrog'' over the highly polluting \nstages of development that countries like the U.S. have already been \nthrough.\n  My legislation includes tax incentives for American businesses to \nwork with foreign countries to help develop clean energy projects and \nfuel-efficient technologies.\n  Our second bill, the Climate Change Technology Deployment Act, \nsupports establishing domestic public-private partnerships for \ndemonstration projects that employ greenhouse gas intensity reduction \ntechnologies. Our plan provides credit-based financial assistance and \ninvestment protection for American businesses and projects that deploy \nadvanced climate technologies or systems. Federal financial assistance \nincludes direct loans, loan guarantees, standby interest coverage, and \npower production incentive payments.\n  We are most successful in confronting the most difficult issues when \nwe draw on the strength of the private sector. Public-private \npartnerships meld together the institutional leverage of the government \nwith the innovation of industry.\n  This bill directs the Secretary of Energy to lead an inter-agency \nprocess to develop and implement a national climate strategy provided \nby the Office of Science and Technology Policy. It establishes a \nClimate Coordinating Committee and Climate Credit Board to assess, \napprove, and fund these projects.\n\n[[Page S1428]]\n\n  Our third bill, the Climate Change Technology Tax Incentives Act, \namends the tax code to provide incentives for investment in climate \nchange technology. It also expresses our support for making permanent \nthe current research and development tax credit, which otherwise \nexpires on December 31, 2005. An article in the Wall Street Journal on \nFebruary 4, 2005, reported on the potential for ``geologic storage'' of \ncarbon dioxide as a means to dramatically reduce carbon dioxide \nemissions.\n  Geologic storage involves pumping carbon dioxide into the ground, \nrather than dumping it into the atmosphere. BP has been using geologic \nstorage in Algeria's Sahara Desert and Statoil has been working on this \nin Norway's North Sea. Chevron Texaco is planning a project off the \ncoast of Australia.\n  The article reports that:\n\n       the concept is drawing growing interest because it could \n     curb global warming more quickly than switching to \n     alternative energy sources or cutting energy use.\n\n  There is still much work to be done. But this kind of technology that \nwas described in the Wall Street Journal article is the kind of \ntechnology that must be employed around the world to achieve results in \nreducing greenhouse gas emissions. My legislation would support more of \nthis type of activity.\n  The American people and all global citizens need to better understand \nglobal climate change, its connections to our economic and energy \npolicies, and what the realistic options are for addressing this \nchallenge. Any recommendations regarding climate policy must meet the \ndemands of economic growth and development, especially in the \ndeveloping world. This will require a market-driven, technology-based \napproach that complements the world's environmental interests, and \nconnects the public and private sectors.\n  Achieving reductions in greenhouse gas emissions is one of the \nimportant challenges of our time. America has an opportunity and a \nresponsibility for global climate policy leadership. But it is a \nresponsibility to be shared by all nations. I look forward to working \nwith my colleagues in the Congress, the Bush administration, the \nprivate sector, public interest groups, and America's allies on \nachievable climate change policy.\n  By harnessing our many strengths, we can help shape a worthy future \nfor all people, and build a better world.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I am pleased to be on the floor at this \nmoment to join my colleague Chuck Hagel in the introduction of \nlegislation that he has put together out of a variety of avenues of \ninterest and importance to deal with the issue of climate change, a \nissue in which he and I have been engaged for a good long while. I am \nnot quite sure how many years ago it was that I, as the freshman \nchairman of the Republican Policy Committee, turned to Chuck to see if \nhe could bring Senators together in a bipartisan way on what we \nbelieved at the moment--and we still believe today--was a critically \nimportant issue to be addressed.\n  Out of that effort grew the Hagel-Byrd resolution which passed this \nbody by an overwhelming vote, and was a very clear message to America--\nand to the world--on what we believed was necessary and important if we \nwere to responsibly and effectively engage in the debate of climate \nchange outside and well beyond the Kyoto protocol.\n  The legislation Senator Hagel brings to the floor today, of which I \nam proud to be a cosponsor, is what I believe is a needed and necessary \nnext step to work cooperatively with this administration and with \ncountries around the world to begin to recognize all that is the makeup \nof this issue.\n  Our policy must recognize the legitimate needs of our bilateral \ntrading partners to use their resources to meet the needs of their \npeople. Yet, at the same time, the initial debate basically suggested \nthat if in fact human involvement in the climate of the world was \nchanging the climate of the world, the only way you could save the \nclimate was to turn the lights out. It did not address the human need. \nIt did not address the economic growth that was critically necessary at \nthat time. That is why our country pushed back and said no, we would \nnot ratify Kyoto; that we would go much further than that in bringing \nabout the changes that were necessary and that this administration \nengaged in.\n\n  This legislation does a great deal more toward recognizing the need \nfor bringing resources together.\n  Senator Hagel has made clear the other important things this \nlegislation will do. Above all, this legislation is a true \nacknowledgment that climate variability and change is a top priority as \nan issue for the United States--and for all nations--to be involved in.\n  There can be an honest debate about whether the United States should \ndo more or whether too much reliance is being placed on voluntary \ninitiatives, but to claim that the United States is not acting \nseriously reflects, at best, a lack of knowledge or, at worst, \npolitical posturing.\n  An objective review of Government and private sector programs to \nreduce increases in greenhouse gas now and in the future would have to \nconclude that the United States is doing at least as much, if not more, \nthan countries that are part of the Kyoto Protocol which will go into \neffect tomorrow. The best evidence of this is our domestic rate of \nimprovement in greenhouse gas intensity relative to the improvements \nother countries are making.\n  The term I just used, ``greenhouse gas intensity,'' is defined in \nlegislation as the ratio of greenhouse gas emissions to economic \noutput. This is a far wiser measure of progress because it complements, \nrather than conflicts with, a nation's goal of growing its economy and \nmeeting the needs and aspirations of its people.\n  Too much attention is being paid to the mandatory nature of Kyoto. \nToo little results are being achieved. It is very interesting to note \nthat most of the countries that ratified Kyoto will not meet the \ngreenhouse gas reduction targets by the deadlines required by Kyoto. \nIndeed, when I and Senator Craig Thomas and Congressman Joe Barton were \nin Buenos Aires at the COP-10 conference in December, many nations were \nquietly acknowledging that they could not get to where they promised \nthey would get, and, in fact, some have even suggested that by 2012 \nthey would find it incumbent upon themselves and their nations to back \nout of Kyoto. However, all still recognize the importance of this \nissue, understanding it, and clearly defining it.\n\n  What Senator Hagel's legislation does is shape for us a variety of \nthings that are already underway, while still allowing us clearly to \ndefine them and to say, both here at home with our domestic policy as \nwell as internationally, that we mean what we say and we mean what we \ndo.\n  The United States is currently spending in excess of $5 billion \nannually in scientific and technological initiatives. When we were in \nBuenos Aires, I was very proud to stand before my colleagues from \naround the world and before nongovernmental organizational groups and \nstate that the United States is spending more on this issue, in both \nadvances in science and technological change, than the rest of the \nworld combined times two. Then I reminded them that all that we do, \nthey could have also: that our technology would be in the world, that \nour science would be available to them, and that to work our way out of \nor to change the character of our economies without damaging those \neconomies would in large part be the responsibility of new \ntechnologies.\n  This legislation does not pick one technology over another or one \nenergy source over another. That has always been the debate. Somehow we \nhad to go around and selectively turn out the lights if we were going \nto change the climate around us. We knew that was not acceptable to the \ndeveloping world and in large part that is why the developing world \nwould not come along. How can you deny a country the right to use its \nresources for the economic, humanitarian, and health benefits of its \npeople? You cannot do that. Nor should we be engaged in trying to do \nthat.\n  What we can do as a developed and advanced Nation is offer up exactly \nwhat we are doing; offer up what the Hagel legislation brings together. \nThat is all we are doing now, and advancing and incentivizing, through \nthis legislation, countries to do more in the area of technology.\n\n[[Page S1429]]\n\n  These programs are designed to advance our state of knowledge, \naccelerate the development and the deployment of energy technologies, \naid developing countries in using energy more efficiently, and achieve \nan 18-percent reduction in energy intensity by 2012--a phenomenally \nresponsive goal and something we clearly can take to the world \ncommunity.\n  Our administration today in a series of bilateral agreements is \nworking with other countries to help them get to where we want and \nwhere they want to get, and for the sake of the environment, where we \nall want us all to go.\n  I was extremely proud sitting in different forums in Buenos Aires to \nsee the United States talk about the leadership role it has taken and \nthe bilateral partnerships it has agreed to, and all the things that we \ncan help with in the world of change today. It is clearly to our \nadvantage and to the advantage of the world at large.\n  What Senator Hagel has effectively done today is to get our arms \naround this issue to try to more directly define it, and to show that \nwe are sensitive to it; that we are responding to the issue as clearly \nas our administration has and continues to do.\n  Domestically, the United States has and continues to make world \nleading investments in climate change science technology. The United \nStates has also implemented a wide range of national greenhouse control \ninitiatives, cash sequestration programs, and international \ncollaborative programs. All of those are bound up within the bilaterals \nI have talked about that we are engaged in.\n\n  The legislation we have introduced today furthers all of these goals.\n  President Bush has consistently acknowledged how human activity can \naffect our climate, and that the climate variability does not recognize \nnational borders. The key issue is not whether there is any human-\ninfluenced effect. Instead, the issues are how large any human \ninfluence may be as compared to natural variability; how costly and how \neffective human intervention may be in reversing climate variability; \nand how and what technology may be required over the near and the long \nterm as determined by developments in climate science.\n  As I said, there can be a legitimate debate about whether more can be \ndone while meeting our Nation's economic objectives. I, for one, \nsupport doing more in the areas of technological development to help \nlift developing countries from the depths of their plights and to \nadvance their cause as we advance ours. That is why I am proud to be \nworking with my colleagues in the Senate. I thank Senator Hagel, \nSenator Alexander, Senator Dole, and others for the hard work they have \nput in and the cooperative effort reflected in the bill introduced this \nafternoon.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I salute Senator Hagel for his \nleadership and his contribution on this issue. I am glad to be here \nwith my colleague, Senator Craig, who is one of the Senate's real \nauthorities on energy.\n  We have had some trouble passing an energy bill in the Senate. We are \nhaving some trouble passing a clean air bill in the Senate. If we are \nbeing logical--which is hard for a Senate to be--we would set clean air \nobjectives and pass a clean energy bill to help reach that objective, \ndo it at once, and give ourselves a low cost, reliable supply of \nenergy, less dependent on the rest of the world, and do it in a way \nthat is environmentally sound.\n  That is our objective. We have different approaches on this, but \nSenator Hagel has put his emphasis today exactly where it needs to be. \nThe United States of America is a country that has about a third of all \nthe GDP in the world. We have 5 to 6 percent of the people and a third \nof all the money is one way to put it.\n  How did we get that money? How did we get our position? The National \nAcademy of Sciences says that since World War II, half our new jobs \nhave come from advances in science and technology. There are other \ncountries in the world--a growing number of countries--that have great \ncapacity for science and technology. Some of the greatest scientists \nand engineers who have worked in this country have come from other \ncountries in the world. But if any country in the world ought to be \nputting a focus on science and technology as a way of helping not just \ntheir country but the rest of the world deal with the issue of \ngreenhouse gases, it ought to be the United States of America. Senator \nHagel is exactly right to put the spotlight there. He does it in a \nthree-part bill. In the first part, he talks about international \ncooperation. That also makes a lot of sense.\n  Three weeks ago, I was visiting with the chairman of one of the \nlargest energy companies in Germany. If there is a country in the world \nthat has a more irrational energy policy than we do, it would be \nGermany. They have just decided to close 19 nuclear powerplants at the \nsame time, across the Rhine river, France is 85 percent nuclear power. \nOf course, Germany will never do that because they will not be able to \nmeet the Kyoto carbon standards if they close the plants. But the point \nthat my friend from Germany was making is that we are headed, in his \nwords, toward an energy catastrophe.\n  It is a catastrophe of two kinds. One is energy supply, and one is \nclean air. Now, why is that? It is because other countries in the world \nare growing. In China, the average Chinese person uses about one-sixth \nthe amount of energy that the average person in the European Union \nuses, in the 15 original countries. Now, in China, when the average \nChinese person, with all the people there, gets up to three-sixths or \nfour-sixths or five-sixths or six-sixths, as they will, there will be \nan unbelievable demand for energy in this country. We are already \nseeing it in the prices for natural gas, in the prices for oil.\n  The figures we heard in our Energy Committee were that over the next \n25 years--and my numbers are approximate--China might build 650 new \ncoal plants to begin to supply its energy, and India might build 800. \nThat does not count the rest of Southeast Asia or what Brazil might do. \nSo we cannot just look at this issue in terms of what is happening in \nthe United States.\n  If there is not a supply of energy, and the other countries are \ndemanding so much, our prices will be so high that our million chemical \njobs in the country will move overseas looking for cheap natural gas. \nAnd it will not make much difference how we clean the air in the United \nStates of America if China and India and Brazil build so many old coal \nplants and throw stuff up in the air because it will blow around the \nworld and come over here.\n  So we have, on two counts, a major, major challenge: energy supply \nand clean air. It would make enormous sense for the scientists and \nengineers in the United States to work with the scientists and \nengineers in Germany who have exactly the same challenge and the \nscientists and engineers in China who have even more of a challenge. \nThey have just stopped 26 of their coal plants because of environmental \nconcerns, but they will not be able to stop them for long because of \ntheir need for an energy supply.\n  What the Senator from Nebraska has done is to say to us, hey, we are \ntalking about mandates and rules and regulations, but what we ought to \nbe trying to do is to create a solution to the problem using the thing \nthat we in the United States do better than anybody, or historically \nhave, and that is our science and technology. This is the country with \nthe 50 great research universities. This is the country with the 20 \nNational Laboratories. The Oak Ridge National Laboratory, in my home \nState, is already doing important work on how we recapture carbon.\n\n  One of the things we can do in the Senate, without arguing about \nKyoto, without arguing about mandates, is to say, let's see if we can--\nthrough technology, working with people in other parts of the world, \nand encouraging our own businesses and laboratories--find better ways \nto deal with greenhouse gases. I salute the Senator for that. I am glad \nto have a chance to be associated with this bill.\n  Now, the second thing I would like to say is that is not all there is \nto do. We have different opinions in this body about so-called global \nwarming. I believe, of course, there is global warming. Our \ngrandparents can tell us that. The question, as Senator Craig said, is, \nWhat is causing it? And do we know enough about it to take steps? We \nhave different opinions about that issue. That does not mean we are all \nunconcerned about it; we just have different\n\n[[Page S1430]]\n\ndegrees of understanding of it and different opinions about the \nevidence we see.\n  I have a little different opinion than the Senator from Idaho. I \nsupport legislation that Senator Carper and Senator Chafee and Senator \nGregg and I supported in the last session of Congress that put modest \ncaps on the utilities section for the production of carbon. I was not \nwilling to go further than that because of the science I read and I'm \nnot sure we know exactly how to solve this problem. My reading of it \ndid not persuade me, one, that we know all that we need to know about \nglobal warming; and, two, maybe more importantly, I was not sure we \nknew what we were doing by just saying, OK, we will do this, and \nwithout having the solution.\n  Again, Senator Hagel has suggested, well, let's come up with some \ntechnology. Let's come up with some science. And then we can make a \nbetter assessment about what we would be able to do if we were to put a \ncap on it.\n  I would suggest that in addition to Senator Hagel's technology that \nhe encourages in his legislation--that is one way to do it--a second \nway to do it is with some kind of caps, and there are a variety of \nproposals in this body to do that. That also encourages, in my opinion, \ntechnology. But then there is also a third point to make, and that \ntakes us out of the debate as to whether it is a good idea or a bad \nidea to put on mandatory caps.\n  If China is going to build hundreds of coal-fired powerplants and \nIndia is going to build hundreds of coal-fired powerplants because that \nis the only technology available to them and the only source of fuel \nthey have readily available, then we had better get busy trying to \nfigure out a way to recapture carbon--not to comply with the Kyoto \nTreaty, but because we are going to have to have it in this world. Any \nrealistic look at the sources of energy in the world says that for the \nnext 20 or 25 years, nuclear power, natural gas, oil, and coal will be \nalmost all of it.\n  There is a lot of support for renewable energy. Some people want to \nput up wind turbines taller than football fields covering square miles. \nI do not. I think that destroys the American landscape, and it does not \nproduce much energy.\n  But one of the most thoughtful presentations I have heard on the \nsolution to our common issues of clean energy and clean air has come \nfrom the National Resources Defense Council, one of the leading \nenvironmental organizations in this country. They are in favor of a \ncoal solution--I hope I am attributing this correctly to them--of a \ncoal solution for our clean air, clean energy policy. A big part of \ntheir reasoning is, they see what is happening in the rest of the \nworld. If the United States, they reason, can figure out a way to \ngasify coal and then recapture the carbon, that gets rid of most of the \nnoxious pollutants--sulfur, nitrogen, mercury. It recaptures the \ncarbon, which we have not really figured out how to do yet, but it does \nnot just do that for the United States, it shows the rest of the world \nhow to do it. And then China, instead of building 800 new coal plants \nwith the old technology, will build 800 coal gasification plants and \nrecapture the carbon. India will do the same, and maybe Germany will do \nthe same. There will be more energy, and we will all be able to \nbreathe. And that is quite irrespective of mandatory caps.\n  One of the things I like about Senator Hagel's proposal is there is \nnot any way to study the technology of how we deal with greenhouse \ngases without getting into questions of coal gasification and the \nrecapturing of carbon. There is not any way to do that. He is leading \nus to the tantalizing possibility that in the United States we might \none day be able to say: We are the Saudi Arabia of coal. We have 500 \nyears' worth of it. We can turn it into gas. We can recapture the \ncarbon. We can use that to create the hydrogen for the hydrogen economy \nthat we think might one day be down the road, and that, plus our \nsupplies of natural gas and nuclear power, will give us clean energy \nand will give us clean air and will show the world how to do the same.\n\n  The Senator from Nebraska has put the spotlight where the spotlight \nought to be. The United States of America, of all countries, should \nstart with technology and science and say: Greenhouse gases is a \nproblem. We are still researching how much of a problem it is. But we \nshould, working with other countries, use our science and technology to \ndeal with it and, in the process, see if it can lead us toward that \nbrilliant intersection of clean energy and clean air that will one day \ngive us a steady supply of energy and clean air that we can breathe.\n  I salute the Senator for his leadership and am glad to be a \ncosponsor. I look forward to working with him. As chairman of the \nSenate subcommittee on energy, we have some jurisdiction over global \nwarming as well as energy technology commercialization. Senator \nDomenici, chairman of our full committee, had a full roundtable the \nother day on natural gas. We have one coming up on coal and coal \ngasification. I can assure my colleagues that the Hagel legislation \nwill be an important part of that roundtable. I will do my best to make \nit an important part of energy hearings.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DURBIN:\n  S. 389. A bill to provide for fire safety standards for cigarettes, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Fire Safe \nCigarette Act of 2005. Last year the State of New York enacted a bold \nnew law. As of June 2004, all cigarettes sold in the State are tested \nfor fire safety and required to self-extinguish.\n  Nationwide the statistics regarding cigarette-related fires are \nstartling. Cigarette-ignited fires account for an estimated 140,800 \nfires in the United States, representing the most common ignition \nsource for fatal home fires and causing 30 percent of the fire deaths \nin the United States. Such fires cause more than 900 deaths and 2,400 \ninjuries every year. Annually, more than $400 million in property \ndamage is reported due to a fire caused by a cigarette. According to \nthe National Fire Protection Association, one out of every four fire \ndeaths in the United States are attributed to tobacco products--by far \nthe leading cause of fatal home fires in the United States. Overall, \nthe Consumer Product Safety Commission estimates that the cost of the \nloss of human life and personal property from not having a fire-safe \ncigarette standard is approximately $4.6 billion per year.\n  In my State of Illinois, cigarette-related fires have also caused too \nmany senseless tragedies. In 1998 alone, the most recent year for which \nwe have data, there were more than 1,700 cigarette-related fires, of \nwhich more than 900 were in people's homes. These fires led to 109 \ninjuries and 8 deaths.\n  Tobacco companies spend billions on marketing and learning how to \nmake cigarettes appealing to kids. It is not unreasonable to ask those \nsame companies to invest in safer cigarette paper to make their \nproducts less likely to bum down a house. As of today cigarettes are \ndesigned to continue burning when left unattended. A common scenario is \nthe delayed ignition of a sofa or mattress by a lit cigarette dropped \nby a smoker.\n  The Fire Safe Cigarette Act of 2005 requires the Consumer Product \nSafety Commission to promulgate a fire safety standard, specified in \nthe legislation, for cigarettes. The CPSC would also have the authority \nto regulate the ignition propensity of cigarette paper for roll-your-\nown tobacco products. The Act gives the Consumer Product Safety \nCommission authority over cigarettes only for purposes of implementing \nand enforcing compliance with this Act and with the standard \npromulgated under the Act. It also allows states to pass more stringent \nfire-safety standards for cigarettes.\n  Two decades ago Joe Moakley set out to ensure that the tragic \ncigarette-caused fire that killed five children and their parents in \nWestwood, MA was not repeated. He introduced three bills, two of which \npassed. One commissioned a study that concluded it was technically \nfeasible to produce a cigarette with a reduced propensity to start \nfires. The second required that the National Institute of Standards and \nTechnology develop a test method for cigarette fire safety, and the \nlast and final bill, the Fire-Safe Cigarette Act of 1999, mandates that \nthe Consumer Product Safety Commission use this knowledge to regulate \ncigarettes with regard to fire safety.\n\n[[Page S1431]]\n\n  Today I respectfully introduce this bill to bring fire-safe standards \nto all cigarettes sold in this country. I hope that the Commerce \nCommittee will consider this legislation very soon and that my \nColleagues will join me in supporting this effort. Now that New York \nserves as an example of success, it is time to establish a national \nstandard to ensure that our Nation's children, elderly and families are \nprotected.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 389\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Cigarette Fire Safety Act of \n     2005''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Cigarette ignited fires are the leading cause of fire \n     deaths in the United States.\n       (2) In 1999 there were 807 deaths from cigarette ignited \n     fires, 2,193 civilian injuries from such fires, and \n     $559,100,000 in property damage caused by such fires.\n       (3) Nearly 100 children are killed each year from cigarette \n     related fires.\n       (4) For over 20 years former Member of Congress Joseph \n     Moakley worked on behalf of burn victims, firefighters, and \n     every individual who has lost a loved one in a fire. By \n     securing enactment of the Cigarette Safety Act of 1984 and \n     the Fire Safe Cigarette Act of 1990, Joseph Moakley completed \n     the necessary technical work for a cigarette fire safety \n     standard and paved the way for a national standard.\n       (5) It is appropriate for the Congress to require by law \n     the establishment of a cigarette fire safety standard for the \n     manufacture and importation of cigarettes.\n       (6) A recent study by the Consumer Product Safety \n     Commission found that the cost of the loss of human life and \n     personal property from not having a cigarette fire safety \n     standard is $4,600,000,000 per year.\n       (7) It is appropriate that the regulatory expertise of the \n     Consumer Product Safety Commission be used to implement a \n     cigarette fire safety standard.\n\n     SEC. 3. CIGARETTE FIRE SAFETY STANDARD.\n\n       (a) In General.--\n       (1) Requirement for standard.--Not later than 18 months \n     after the date of the enactment of this Act, the Commission \n     shall, by rule, prescribe one or more fire safety standards \n     for cigarettes that, except as provided in this Act, are \n     substantively the same as the standards set forth by the \n     State of New York in Part 429 of Title 18 of the Official \n     Compilation of Codes, Rules and Regulations of the State of \n     New York, as promulgated on December 31, 2003 (in this Act \n     referred to as the ``New York standard''), including the \n     Appendix to such Part.\n       (2) Cigarettes with unique characteristics.--In adapting \n     section 4(c) of such Part 429, if the Commission determines \n     that a cigarette, because of its unique or nontraditional \n     characteristics, cannot be tested in accordance with the test \n     method prescribed by the Commission, the manufacturer of such \n     cigarette may propose a test method and performance standard \n     for such cigarette. If the Commission finds the proposed \n     method and standard to be equivalent to the test method and \n     performance standard otherwise established by the Commission, \n     the Commission may approve the method and standard and the \n     manufacturer of such cigarette may employ such test method \n     and performance standard to certify the cigarette pursuant to \n     rules prescribed by this Act.\n       (3) Commission.--In this Act, the term ``Commission'' means \n     the Consumer Product Safety Commission.\n       (b) Procedure.--\n       (1) In general.--The rule under subsection (a), and any \n     modification thereof, shall be prescribed in accordance with \n     section 553 of title 5, United States Code.\n       (2) Modifications.--\n       (A) Modification by sponsor.--If the sponsor of the testing \n     methodology used under subsection (a)(2) modifies the testing \n     methodology in any material respect, the sponsor shall notify \n     the Commission of the modification, and the Commission may \n     incorporate the modification in the rule prescribed under \n     subsection (a) if the Commission determines that the \n     modification will enhance a fire safety standard established \n     under subsection (a)(2).\n       (B) Modification by commission.--The Commission may modify \n     the rule prescribed under subsection (a), including the test \n     requirements specified in subsection (a)(2), in whole or in \n     part, only if the Commission determines that compliance with \n     such modification is technically feasible and will enhance a \n     fire safety standard established under that subsection. Any \n     such modification shall not take effect earlier than 3 years \n     after the date on which the rule is first issued.\n       (3) Inapplicability of certain laws.--\n       (A) In general.--No Federal law or Executive order, \n     including the laws listed in subparagraph (B) but not \n     including chapters 5, 6, 7, and 8 of title 5, United States \n     Code, commonly referred to as the Administrative Procedures \n     Act, may be construed to apply to the promulgation of the \n     rule required by subsection (a), or a modification of the \n     rule under paragraph (2) of this subsection.\n       (B) Included laws.--The Federal laws referred to in \n     subparagraph (A) include the following:\n       (i) The Consumer Product Safety Act (15 U.S.C. 2051 et \n     seq.).\n       (ii) Chapter 6 of title 5, United States Code.\n       (iii) The National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 \n     U.S.C. 4321 et seq.).\n       (iv) The Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act \n     of 1996 (Public Law 104-121), and the amendments made by that \n     Act.\n       (c) Effective Date.--The Commission shall specify in the \n     rule prescribed under subsection (a) the effective date of \n     the rule. The effective date may not be later than 24 months \n     after the date of the enactment of this Act.\n       (d) Treatment of Standard.--\n       (1) In general.--The fire safety standard promulgated under \n     subsection (a) shall be treated as a consumer product safety \n     standard promulgated under the Consumer Product Safety Act \n     (15 U.S.C. 2051 et seq.), except as provided in section 4.\n       (2) Treatment of cigarettes.--A cigarette shall be treated \n     as a consumer product under section 3(a)(1)(B) of the \n     Consumer Product Safety Act (15 U.S.C. 2052(a)(1)(B)) for \n     purposes of this Act and for purposes of sections 17 and 18 \n     of the Consumer Product Safety Act (15 U.S.C. 2066, 2067).\n\n     SEC. 4.

SCOPE OF JURISDICTION OF CONSUMER PRODUCT SAFETY \n                   COMMISSION.\n\n       Except as otherwise provided in this Act, the Commission \n     shall have no jurisdiction over tobacco or tobacco products.\n\n     SEC. 6. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.\n\n       (a) Authorization of Appropriations.--There is authorized \n     to be appropriated to the Consumer Product Safety Commission \n     for fiscal year 2006, $2,000,000 for purposes of carrying out \n     this Act.\n       (b) Availability.--Amounts appropriated pursuant to \n     subsection (a) shall remain available until expended.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DODD (for himself and Mr. Bunning):\n  S. 390. A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nprovide for coverage of ultrasound screening for abdominal aortic \naneurysms under part B of the medicare program; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I come to the floor today, along with my \ncolleague Senator Jim Bunning, to introduce the Screening Abdominal \nAortic Aneurysms Very Efficiently SAAAVE Act of 2005. This important \nlegislation would provide Medicare coverage for screening for a \ndangerous condition known as abdominal aortic aneurysm--or AAA.\n  The SAAAVE Act is designed to save the lives of those suffering from \nabdominal aortic aneurysms, a silent killer that claims the lives of \n15,000 Americans each year. AAAs occur when there is a weakening of the \nwalls of the aorta, the body's largest blood vessel. This artery begins \nto bulge, most often very slowly and without symptoms, and can lead to \nrupture and severe internal bleeding. AAA is a devastating condition \nthat is often fatal without detection, with less than 15 percent of \nthose afflicted with a ruptured aorta surviving. Estimates indicate \nthat 2.7 million Americans suffer from AAA.\n  With introduction of this important legislation, Congress recognizes \nabdominal aortic aneurysm screening as essential to stopping its deadly \neffects. Research indicates that when detected before rupturing, AAAs \nare treatable and curable in 95 percent of the cases. And while most \nAAAs are never diagnosed, nearly all can be detected through an \ninexpensive and painless screening.\n  I am particularly pleased that the U.S. Preventive Services Task \nForce recently recommended AAA screening for all men between the ages \nof 65 and 75 that have ever smoked. This independent panel of experts \nin primary care and prevention concluded that screening for abdominal \naortic aneurysms for this particularly vulnerable population is \nespecially important. The\n\n[[Page S1432]]\n\nrecognition of this screening measure by this respected body makes \nperfectly clear the lifesaving potential offered by AAA screening.\n  For more than four decades the Medicare program has provided a \nliteral lifeline for America's seniors and individuals with \ndisabilities. However, for far too long this valuable program--\noriginally crafted only to provide needed care after an illness--failed \nto cover valuable preventive services. Recently, though, Medicare has \nevolved to include a number of preventive measures, such as mammography \nand colorectal screenings. With today's introduction of the SAAAVE Act, \nwe again move Medicare toward greater inclusion of lifesaving \npreventive measures. This legislation reflects the changing attitudes \ntoward the value of preventive health care services and moves us toward \nmodernizing the Medicare program to better meet the needs of its more \nthan 40 million beneficiaries. With enactment of the SAAAVE Act, \ninstead of waiting to treat a ruptured aorta, Medicare will now help \nhigh-risk seniors avert this often-deadly disease through preventive \nand lifesaving screening.\n  Lastly, I want to thank the legislation's chief sponsors in the House \nof Representatives, Gene Green and John Shimkus. Representatives Green \nand Shimkus have been tireless advocates on behalf of patients \nsuffering from abdominal aortic aneurysms and their devotion to \nmodernizing the Medicare program to include greater preventive services \nis truly admirable. I look forward to continuing working with my \ncolleagues from the House to advance the SAAAVE Act in the 109th \nCongress.\n\n  When Senator Bunning and I first introduced this legislation in the \nlast Congress, we were joined by patients who had suffered a ruptured \naorta as result of an AAA and their families. At this event these \npatients shared with us their harrowing and personal stories of \nbattling this deadly condition. It is because of struggles like theirs \nthat we are here today at the outset of an effort to prevent abdominal \naortic aneurysms from advancing to the point of rupture by providing \ncoverage for a simple yet lifesaving screening. Simply, Mr. President, \nthis legislation is about saving lives. I urge all of my colleagues to \nsupport the SAAAVE Act.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I am pleased to be joining Senator Dodd \nfrom Connecticut today in re-introducing the Screening Abdominal Aortic \nAneurysms Very Efficiently Act of 2005--also known as the SAAAVE Act--\nin the 109th Congress.\n  This is an important bill that could potentially save the lives of \nmany Medicare beneficiaries. Unfortunately, too many Americans die from \nruptured abdominal aortic aneurysms each year without ever knowing they \nhad this condition. In fact, less than 15 percent of people who have a \nruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm survive.\n  That is why our bill is so important. The SAAAVE Act would add a new \nscreening benefit to Medicare so that people at risk for abdominal \naortic aneurysms could be tested. The test is simple. In fact, it's \njust an ultrasound test, which is painless, non-invasive and \ninexpensive.\n  Medicare beneficiaries found to have an abdominal aortic aneurysm \ncould have surgery if needed or could simply be monitored by their \ndoctors.\n  Early detection is the key to preventing ruptures of these aneurysms \nand preventing deaths. In fact, these aneurysms can be successfully \ntreated 95 percent of the time if they are detected before rupturing.\n  The legislation also includes a national educational and information \ncampaign to get the word out about the health risks associated with \nabdominal aortic aneurysms. Too often, those with these aneurysms \nsimply don't know they have one until it ruptures. The educational \ncampaign requires the Department of Health and Human Services to focus \ntheir education efforts not only on the general public, but also among \nhealth care practitioners as well.\n  I am pleased we are introducing this bill today, and I look forward \nto working with my colleague from Connecticut in getting it passed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/02/15/senate-section/article/S1432-1", "month": "02", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1432]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 52--HONORING SHIRLEY CHISHOLM FOR HER SERVICE TO THE \n     NATION AND EXPRESSING CONDOLENCES TO HER FAMILY, FRIENDS, AND \n                        SUPPORTERS ON HER DEATH\n\n  Mrs. CLINTON (for herself and Mr. Levin) submitted the following \nresolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                               S.

and\n       (IV) a service that has an essentially social component.\n       (ii) A service described in clause (i) includes, but is not \n     limited to, a public benefit program, health care, health \n     insurance, public health, child care, education and training, \n     the distribution of a controlled substance or product \n     (including alcohol, tobacco, and firearms), research and \n     development on a natural or social science, a utility \n     (including an energy utility, water, waste disposal, and \n     sanitation), national security, maritime, air, surface, and \n     other transportation services, a postal service, energy \n     extraction and any related service, and a correctional \n     service.\n       (B) The agreement shall permit a country that has made a \n     commitment in an area described in subparagraph (A) to revise \n     that commitment for the purposes of public interest \n     regulation without any financial or other trade-related \n     penalty.\n       (C) The agreement shall ensure that any rule governing a \n     subsidy or government procurement fully protects the ability \n     of a government to support and purchase a service in a way \n     that promotes economic development, social justice and \n     equity, public health, environmental quality, human rights, \n     and the rights of workers.\n       (D) The agreement shall not make a new commitment on the \n     temporary entry of workers because such policies should be \n     determined by the Congress, after consideration by the \n     congressional committees with jurisdiction over immigration \n     to avoid an array of inconsistent policies and any policy \n     that fails to--\n       (i) include labor market tests that ensure that the \n     employment of temporary workers will not adversely affect \n     other similarly employed workers;\n       (ii) involve labor unions in the labor certification \n     process implemented under the immigration program for \n     temporary workers under section 101(a)(15)(H)(i) of the \n     Immigration and Nationality Act, including the filing by an \n     employer of an application under section 212(n)(1) of that \n     Act; and\n       (iii) guarantee the same workplace protections for \n     temporary workers that are available to all workers.\n       (E) The agreement shall guarantee that all governments that \n     are parties to the agreement can regulate foreign investors \n     in services and other service providers in order to protect \n     public health and safety, consumers, the environment, and \n     workers' rights, without requiring the governments to \n     establish their regulations to be the least burdensome option \n     for foreign service providers.\n       (3) Regarding policies to support american workers and \n     small, minority, and women-owned businesses.--Any such \n     agreement shall preserve the right of Federal, State, and \n     local governments to maintain or establish policies to \n     support American workers and small, minority, or women-owned \n     businesses, including, but not limited to, policies with \n     respect to government procurement, loans, and subsidies.\n       (4) Regarding environmental, labor, and other public \n     interest standards.--Any such agreement--\n       (A) may not supersede the rights and obligations of parties \n     under multilateral environmental, labor, and human rights \n     agreements;

Mr. President, I am resubmitting a measure to help \nbegin to address one of the central problems our Nation faces, namely \nthe loss of family-supporting jobs because of our flawed trade \npolicies.\n  Florence, WI is a town in the far northeastern corner of my home \nState. It is just a few miles from the border with the Upper Peninsula \nof Michigan.\n  Like most Americans, the residents of Florence are probably too busy \nwith their own lives to pay close attention to the trade policies of \nour Nation. But a few weeks ago, a hundred families in that small \ncommunity got a sharp introduction to the realities of those policies. \nPride Manufacturing, the world's largest maker of golf tees, announced \nthat it would be closing down its plant in Florence, and moving that \noperation and the hundred or so jobs that go with it to China.\n  That announcement probably wasn't noticed by many people outside of \nmy home State--one company in one small community in the far \nnortheastern corner of Wisconsin leaving for China doesn't raise many \neyebrows in Washington or Wall Street. But it is a serious matter for \nthe families whose livelihood is directly affected by the move. And it \nwill certainly have an impact on the community in which they live. Some \nfamilies may try to stay, but some may be forced to look elsewhere for \njobs. The local school district is already trying to cope with \ndeclining enrollment and the challenges of a largely rural district. \nThe prospect of losing additional families will only make matters \nworse. Local businesses that relied on the custom of those families \nwill be hit. Car dealers, grocery stores, hardware stores, clothing \nstores, everyone will be potentially impacted.\n  All because a local business is closing down as a result of the trade \npolicies of this government.\n  We have seen that story repeated across Wisconsin. Our manufacturing \nsector has been hit particularly hard. And I know Wisconsin is not \nalone in that experience.\n  The record of the major trade agreements into which our Nation has \nentered over the past few years has been dismal. Thanks in great part \nto the flawed fast track rules that govern consideration of legislation \nimplementing trade agreements, the United States has entered into a \nnumber of trade agreements that have contributed to the significant job \nloss we have seen in recent years, and have laid open to assault \nvarious laws and regulations established to protect workers, the \nenvironment, and our health and safety.\n  Indeed, those agreements undermine the very democratic institutions \nthrough which we govern ourselves.\n  The loss of jobs, especially manufacturing jobs, to other countries \nhas been devastating to Wisconsin, and to the entire country. When I \nopposed the North American Free Trade Agreement, the Uruguay round of \nthe General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, Permanent Normal Trade \nRelations for China, and other flawed trade measures, I did so in great \npart because I believed they would lead to a significant loss of jobs. \nBut even as an opponent of those agreements, I don't think I could have \nimagined just how bad things would get in so short a time.\n  The trade policy of this country over the past several years has been \nappalling. The trade agreements into which we have entered have \ncontributed to the loss of key employers, ravaging entire communities. \nBut despite that clear evidence, we continue to see trade agreements \nbeing reached that will only aggravate this problem.\n  This has to stop. We cannot afford to pursue trade policies that gut \nour manufacturing sector and send good jobs overseas. We cannot afford \nto undermine the protections we have established for workers, the \nenvironment, and our public health and safety. And we cannot afford to \nsquander our democratic heritage by entering into trade agreements that \nsupersede our right to govern ourselves through open, democratic \ninstitutions.\n  The legislation I am pleased to reintroduce today addresses this \nproblem, at least in part. It establishes some minimum standards for \nthe trade agreements into which our nation enters. I introduced an \nidentical resolution in the last Congress as a companion to a \nresolution introduced in the other body by my colleague from Ohio, Mr. \nSherrod Brown).\n  This measure sets forth principles for future trade agreements. It is \na break with the so called NAFTA model, and instead advocates the kinds \nof sound trade policies that will spur economic growth and sustainable \ndevelopment.\n  The principles set forth in this resolution are not complex. They are \nstraightforward and achievable. The resolution calls for enforceable \nworker protections, including the core International Labor Organization \nstandards.\n  It preserves the ability of the United States to enact and enforce \nits own trade laws.\n  It protects foreign investors, but states that foreign investors \nshould not be provided with greater rights than those provided under \nU.S. law, and it protects public interest laws from challenge by \nforeign investors in secret tribunals.\n  It ensures that food entering into our country meets domestic food \nsafety standards.\n  It preserves the ability of Federal, State, and local governments to \nmaintain essential public services and to relate private sector \nservices in the public interest.\n  It requires that trade agreements contain environmental provisions \nsubject to the same enforcement as commercial provisions.\n  It preserves the right of Federal, State, and local governments to \nuse procurement as a policy tool, including through Buy American laws, \nenvironmental laws such as recycled content, and purchasing preferences \nfor small, minority, or women-owned businesses.\n  It requires that trade negotiations and the implementation of trade \nagreements be conducted openly.\n  These are sensible policies. They are entirely consistent with the \ngoal of increased international commerce, and in fact they advance that \ngoal.\n  The outgrowth of the major trade agreements I referenced earlier has \nbeen a race to the bottom in labor standards, environmental health and \nsafety standards, in nearly every aspect of our economy. A race to the \nbottom is a race in which even the winners lose.\n  For any who doubt this, I invite you to ask the families in Florence, \nWI who will watch their jobs move to China.\n  We can't let this continue to happen. We need to turn our trade \npolicies around. We need to pursue trade agreements that will promote \nsustainable economic growth for our Nation and for our trading \npartners. The resolution I submit today will begin to put us on that \npath, and I urge my colleagues to support it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/02/15/senate-section/article/S1434-1", "month": "02", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1434-S1435]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 13--CONGRATULATING ASME ON THEIR 125TH \n    ANNIVERSARY, CELEBRATING THE ACHIEVEMENTS OF ASME MEMBERS, AND \n      EXPRESSING THE GRATITUDE OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE FOR ASME'S \n                             CONTRIBUTIONS\n\n  Mr. SUNUNU submitted the following concurrent resolution; which was \nconsidered and agreed to:\n\n                            S.

Mr. President, if the distinguished majority leader would \nyield, I am disappointed but I understand that we are not going to be \nable to move tomorrow to the genetic nondiscrimination matter. It is my \nunderstanding that there is a potential blue-slip problem with the \nHouse. I had hoped we could get that done. That is something that is \nvery important to do. We will be happy to cooperate with the majority \nleader in any way we can to move that along. It passed last time with \n90-some-odd votes. I hope we can get that done. Even with a little bump \nin the road, maybe we can still get that done this week.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. FRIST. In response through the Chair, this bill is a critically \nimportant bill, in my mind, in that we have worked on it for 7 years. \nWe have passed it with an overwhelming majority in this body. It does \ngood things for people who have a whole range of illnesses. It really \nrepresents the great advances in science today, advances in research, \nadvances that come in large part because of what this body did with the \nhuman genome project in funding over a period of about 10 years, the \nunraveling of the genetic code which makes us all human, which is still \nmind-boggling. With that, it introduces all sorts of privacy issues and \na potential for discrimination and this comes back and addresses it \nhead on. It is a bill upon which we generally have all agreed.\n  We are working with the Finance Committee and with the HELP Committee \ninternally as well as with the House. I do not want to be overly \noptimistic, but I think by tomorrow we will work this out and get it to \nthe Senate floor.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, if the distinguished leader would yield \nagain, I am sure others have felt this way in the past, but it is \ninteresting to me that anytime there is anything that the distinguished \nmajority leader talks about that deals with medicine, it is almost as \nif there is a light that comes on. It is just so apparent why he was \nsuch a good physician.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, we will move on.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/02/15/senate-section/article/S1436-3", "month": "02", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1436]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                PROGRAM\n\n  Mr. FRIST.
