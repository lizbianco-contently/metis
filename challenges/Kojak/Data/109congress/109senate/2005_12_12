Mr. President, today we are returning to session in order \nto conclude our work for the first session of the 109th Congress. I \nwant to welcome everybody back after a couple of weeks where people \nhave been with constituents and people have been working very hard to \nbring to conclusion many of the issues that were left unfinished a \ncouple of weeks ago. Real progress has been made over the course of the \nlast 2 weeks. Over the course of this past weekend, a lot of work has \nbeen done. As I mentioned prior to Thanksgiving, we will be working \ntoday and tomorrow on a number of issues. However, the first rollcall \nvote will be on Wednesday morning.\n  Many of our colleagues have asked about the schedule for this week, \nthis weekend, as well as next week. As things unfold and as my \ndiscussions with the Democratic leader continue, we will be forthcoming \nto let people know exactly what we expect. We would like to finish up \nour work as quickly as possible prior to the Christmas holiday. \nHowever, everyone does need to be prepared to stay as long as necessary \nto finish the work that is before us.\n  Today, we expect to reach an agreement on several motions to instruct \nthe conferees on the deficit reduction bill that is at the desk. We \nwould have those motions debated tomorrow, on Tuesday, and on \nWednesday, with votes to occur or begin to occur Wednesday morning.\n  We also expect to debate the Bahrain Free Trade Agreement during \ntomorrow's session under a short time agreement.\n  The PATRIOT Act conference report will arrive in the Senate sometime \nthis week, and we will proceed to that conference report when it is \navailable.\n  Chairman Warner has completed work on the Defense authorization \nconference report, and that may also be around here midweek.\n  We also need to complete the appropriations process by taking up and \ntaking action on the final 2 conference reports. This week we need to \nact on the Labor-HHS appropriations as well as the Defense \nAppropriations Committee reports.\n  I mentioned reconciliation. A lot of work has been done over the \ncourse of the last several weeks among the various committees. I want \nto continue to encourage all chairmen to aggressively work with their \nHouse counterparts on this important reconciliation bill. Clearly, a \nlot of work remains, but with the cooperation and patience of all \nMembers, I believe we can get our work done and adjourn in a timely \nway. It is going to be up to each and every one of us to decide when we \nwill be able to finish our business and adjourn this session. Senators \nwill need to keep their schedules flexible over the course of this week \nand I believe we can finish everything this week. If not, we would have \nto continue into next week--or this week and this weekend, and if not, \nwe would have to continue into the early part of next week, but we \nshould be able to complete everything this week. Again, everybody, \nplease keep your schedules flexible.\n  I do want to thank all Senators in advance for their help as we \nschedule these final days.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/12/12/senate-section/article/S13427-8", "month": "12", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13427-S13435]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             FILIBUSTERING\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, will the distinguished majority leader \nyield?\n  Mr. FRIST. I am happy to.\n  Mr. BYRD. I want to congratulate the majority leader on helping to \nget these appropriations bills all passed. We discussed this, he and I, \nseveral\n\n[[Page S13428]]\n\nmonths ago. It was my hope then that the leader would help to get all \nthe bills passed so that we would not have an omnibus bill. He \nindicated he was going to try to do that, and he has tried and I want \nto congratulate him. I want to thank him for that.\n  I think we ought to always pass these appropriations bills. The \ndistinguished Presiding Officer, when he was chairman, got all the \nbills out of the committee; Senator Stevens got all the appropriations \nbills out of the committee. He was the chairman of the committee, I \nbelieve, at that point, the Appropriations Committee. I was the ranking \nmember. I complimented him then. I compliment the distinguished \nmajority leader and Senator Thad Cochran on getting this done. I \ncompliment him.\n  While I am complimenting the Senator, I want to ask the Senator a \nquestion, and I do it with great respect. I respect the Senator from \nTennessee. He is a great physician. And every night I pray to the Great \nPhysician and the Senator from Tennessee is following in the footsteps \nof that Great Physician.\n  But I have a question. I saw something which concerned me in the \npaper this morning, the Washington Post. The Washington Post had the \ngood judgment to place this in a very visible place in the Post. It is \na great newspaper. Page A5. Here are the headlines that bothered me:\n\n       Frist Cautions Senators Against Stalling Alito Vote.\n\n  And then the subheadline:\n\n       Democrats Don't Plan Filibuster.\n\n  The first paragraph says:\n\n       Senate majority leader Bill Frist, Republican, Tennessee, \n     threatened--\n\n  That is a bad word, ``threatened''--\n\n     yesterday, to strip Democrats of the power to filibuster. . . \n     .\n\n  I am a Democrat, and it has never been my desire to strip Republicans \nof their power to filibuster. I was here--I believe the first election \nI cast a vote in was 1936. I think I was old enough to vote then. I \nwould have been 20 years old in that session of Congress, which met in \nJanuary 1937.\n  I believe there were only 16 Republicans in the Senate at that time. \nThe Senate only had 96 Members then. It didn't have 100 but 96 Members. \nThere were only 16 Republicans and there were 4 independents--former \nand later, et cetera--and there were 76 Democrats. Can you imagine \nthat? Yet there was never any threat on the part of the Democrats in \n1936. I think that was the first time I cast a vote, and I was proud of \nthat Democratic Congress. I don't think there was any threat on the \npart of Republicans to kill the filibuster, to kill the provisions in \nSenate rule XXII that allowed freedom of speech in the Senate. When I \nsaw this a few months back, we had this wave of insaneness, That swept \nover the Senate. We were talking about the nuclear option, so-called \nconstitutional option. There is nothing in the Constitution about it. \nIt is an unconstitutional option.\n  I was sorry to see that my friend, Senator Frist, this fine Senator \nfrom Tennessee, the majority leader of the Senate and a great \nphysician, was threatening--this is what the newspaper said--\n``threatened yesterday to strip Democrats of the power to filibuster if \nthey blocked the vote on Supreme Court nominee Samuel A. Alito, Jr.''\n  That nominee came in to see me a while back. I had a nice talk with \nhim. I was much impressed by Judge Alito. I haven't made up my mind \nyet. But I liked what he said when he was in my office, and I might \nvote for him. I don't know yet.\n  But I have not heard a Democrat use the word ``filibuster'' in \nconnection with this nomination. I haven't heard anybody use that word \n``filibuster.'' It was news to me that the distinguished majority \nleader was talking about a threat of stripping Democrats of the power \nto filibuster if they block the vote on Supreme Court nominee Samuel A. \nAlito, Jr.\n  Just one more minute, and then I will yield to the distinguished \nleader.\n  This is my 47th year in the Senate. I will finish the 47th year this \nmonth. And I never dreamed that during my tenure in the Senate--I \ndidn't know how long the tenure would be at that time--there would be \nany effort to undermine, or to terminate, or to threaten the freedom of \nspeech in the Senate. That is a freedom that goes back to the Magna \nCarta in 1215, and then in the reign of Henry IV. He reigned in England \nduring the years 1399 to 1413. And during his tenure he proclaimed that \nthe members of the House of Commons had a perfect right to speak their \nminds. So there was freedom of speech in the English House of Commons \nunder Henry IV.\n  Then when the Declaration of Rights came along in 1689, before the \nCommons would crown the two sovereigns, William and Mary, as King and \nQueen in England, they exacted from those two individuals a promise \nthat they would honor the rights of Englishmen, the rights of people in \nthe House of Commons, to speak their minds. That was on February 13, \n1689. Then on December 16, 1689, they wrote that into the law. That \nbecame a statute in the Bill of Rights.\n  In the United States, our forefathers drew those provisions from the \nEnglish Bill of Rights into our own Bill of Rights 100 years later, in \n1789.\n  So I am greatly disturbed when any majority leader, a Senator as \npowerful as the distinguished Senator from Tennessee--as I have been \nmajority leader, I know the power of a majority leader--but I would \nnever, I say this with respect to the distinguished Senator--and when \nwe were in power, the Democrats, as I say, when Republicans only had 16 \nMembers here, the Democrats could easily have killed freedom of speech \nin the Senate and not allowed the Republicans to filibuster. But there \nwas never any thought of it.\n  That is not a great idea. It didn't take a fellow to fall off a \nturnip truck to think of that. There is nothing brilliant about saying \nif there is a filibuster, all we need is the might and power of the \nmajority to vote the rules are wrong and interpret them differently. \nAnd it could be done; no doubt about it. We could do that. But the \nDemocrats never--and no party in history, Republicans or Democrats--\nthreatened to deny freedom of speech to members of the minority. I \ndaresay a lot of Members on that side of the aisle, the Republican side \nof the aisle, don't like that idea. I don't think they would agree with \nthat because they have a right to filibuster, too. The Republicans do. \nI respect that right.\n  I am sorry I read that by the Senator. I will read it once more.\n\n       Senate majority leader Bill Frist, Republican of Tennessee, \n     threatened yesterday to strip Democrats of the power to \n     filibuster if they block the vote on Supreme Court nominee \n     Samuel A. Alito, Jr.\n\n  I haven't heard any Democrat talk about that. As a matter of fact, I \nthink we are going to have a vote on him. We will debate it. We \ncertainly have a right to debate. I joined the group of 14 so there \nwouldn't be filibusters against these judgeships, except in extreme \ncases when I might join a filibuster, too. But may I say most \nrespectfully to the distinguished leader, I hope we will quit talk \nabout this so-called ``nuclear option.'' That is a threat to the \nfreedom of speech, freedom of speech, freedom of speech, here in the \nSenate.\n  I yield to the distinguished Senator, the leader whom I do respect.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. FRIST. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Let me take a look at the article. I haven't read the Washington Post \ntoday. But I appreciate my good friend and colleague bringing this to \nmy attention.\n  The Senator is right. It says, ``Frist cautions Senators against \nstalling Alito vote.''\n  It is pretty accurate. And I guess the Senator's followup statement \nis that no Democrat is talking about filibuster, and here you have the \nmajority leader of this body saying if there is a filibuster he is \ngoing to ask for an up-or-down vote consistent with giving advice and \nconsent. There are lots of ways of giving advice and consent. But I \nknow the distinguished colleague from West Virginia has been focused on \nlots of things going on.\n  But let me better inform him about what the other headlines have been \nsaying about what Democrats are thinking and doing--the allegation that \nno Democrats are thinking about filibuster, citing headlines.\n  It is a pretty accurate article, actually, as I glance through it.\n  Associated Press, November 1, 2005.\n  These are just some other headlines that are out there.\n\n       Republicans Enthusiastic About Alito While Democrats Are \n     Wondering Whether To Filibuster.\n\n[[Page S13429]]\n\n  That is November 1.\n  Headline in the Bergen County, New Jersey Record: ``Democrats Mull \nPossible Filibuster,'' November 21.\n  Boston Globe, November 4, 2005: ``Democrats Won't Rule Out \nFilibuster.''\n  The Hill, which we all see several times a week, November 1: ``Dems \nHint At Filibuster.''\n  The Washington Times, November 3: ``Senators to Weigh `Circumstances' \nfor a Filibuster.''\n  And the International Herald Tribune, other headlines: ``Democrats \nDon't Rule Out Filibuster To Block Nominee.''\n  Those are some of the other headlines that at least cause the leader \non this side of the aisle to say--not just this majority leader, not \njust Chris Wallace. He asked the question, if a filibuster is \nconducted, you can see all around the country--whether it is up in New \nJersey, in Boston, MA, or right here on the Hill--there must be some \nDemocrats thinking, at least thinking, contemplating, how we can use a \ntool we use.\n  I would argue, and I know there is a difference of opinion, unfairly, \nagainst not just one nominee or two or three but four, five, six, \nseven, eight, nine, 10 times in the last 3 years Presidential nominees \nwho had gone through committee, come to the Senate, filibustered again \nand again and again--used as a regular tool. That is wrong.\n  Therefore, I believe in the principle of an up-or-down vote. If \nsomeone is nominated by the President and has the highest \nqualifications according to the American Bar Association, with advice \nand consent under the Constitution, they have gone through the \ncommittee, come from the committee and were recommended to this Senate, \nI believe in that principle of an up-or-down vote.\n  Those are the various headlines. The response would be, but those are \nthe headlines and headlines are like these headlines in here, some \nheadline writer writes it. Clearly, Democrats are thinking about it.\n  What about individuals?\n  Senator Reid himself said Democrats would consider all filibusters \nand a filibuster to Alito is possible.\n  From November 1, the Boston Globe:\n\n       Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid pledged that Democrats \n     will consider all options at their disposal if they decide to \n     stop Alito's nomination. Though Reid said Democrats will wait \n     for confirmation hearings before choosing their strategy, he \n     noted that Bush is `near the bottom of his popularity' in \n     opinion polls and that a filibuster to defeat Alito is \n     possible.\n\n  The Democrat leader, talking about a filibuster being possible, so an \naccusation that this leader is the one initiating discussion about \nfilibuster is wrong.\n  I continue with Reid spokesman Jim Manley on Alito:\n\n       All procedural options are on the table.\n\n  Our colleague, Charles Schumer, from New York:\n\n       Nothing is on the table, and nothing is off the table.\n\n  Senator Barbara Boxer from California:\n\n       The filibuster's on the table.\n\n  These are all quotations, from Republicans enthusiastic about Alito \nand Democrats wonder whether to filibuster.\n  The Associated Press, November 1, Senator Boxer:\n\n       The filibuster's on the table.\n\n  Senator Tom Harkin not only believes there will be a filibuster but \nrelishes the prospect--that is not a quotation; this is sort of a point \ntaken from the quotation from an article in the Baltimore Sun November \n2.\n  Senator Tom Harkin, Iowa, Democrat said:\n\n       I believe Democrats will filibuster this nominee on the \n     basis that he's way too ideologically to the right. We need a \n     moderate on the court, not an avowed rightwinger like him \n     that would upset the balance.\n\n  These are from your side of the aisle. I know my distinguished \ncolleague is not aware of these, but that comes to me.\n  Senator Dick Durbin to CBC's Jan Crawford Greenberg:\n\n       Are you refusing to rule that filibuster out now? Do you \n     think that's still likely or is it just highly unlikely?\n\n  Senator Durbin responds:\n\n       Let's complete the hearing in January, then make a decision \n     whether we should go forward with the nomination of Judge \n     Alito.\n\n  That was November 6.\n  Senator Biden on November 17, from the Congress Daily AM:\n\n       As Democrats stepped up questioning of Samuel Alito's \n     Supreme Court nomination, Sen. Joseph Biden, D-Del., warned \n     the nominee Wednesday he might need Biden's vote on a \n     potential filibuster if the judge is not forthright during \n     hearings . . . I told him you probably don't need my vote to \n     get on the bench, Biden continues, but if you are \n     disingenuous in the hearings, you may need my vote relating \n     to a filibuster.\n\n  Senator Russ Feingold--again, to show it is not just one or two or \nthree or four, said it was perfectly fine to use a filibuster. Those \nare Senator Feingold's words on ABC's This Week.\n\n       I think it's perfectly fine to use a filibuster if somebody \n     is clearly unacceptable. That is an option we have. It has \n     almost never been used with regard to a Supreme Court \n     justice, so it takes an extreme case, but I was the one \n     Democrat who was unhappy publicly with the sort of deal that \n     was made earlier in the year that kind of let certain judges \n     go through that shouldn't have gone through. The right to \n     filibuster is part of our role in the Senate, and we should \n     reserve the right but use it only very sparingly.\n\n  After meeting with Judge Alito, Senator Tim Johnson basically refused \nto rule out supporting a filibuster.\n\n       I will leave all those options on the table.\n\n  That is a sampling of what I hear directly from the Senate. As my \ndistinguished colleague from West Virginia knows, all these outside \ngroups complicate matters on both sides. We have the sort of party \nactivist and liberal interest groups. We have the DNC Chairman Howard \nDean saying the following, from Reuters, November 13:\n\n       Despite early signals to the contrary, U.S. Senate \n     Democrats must keep open the option of blocking a \n     confirmation vote on U.S. Supreme Court nominee Samuel Alito, \n     Democratic Party leader Howard Dean said on Sunday . . . \n     Dean, asked if Democrats should keep the possibility of a \n     filibuster on the table, said, `Absolutely. Of course we \n     should.'\n\n  My response in large part is there is a lot of talk about filibuster \nout there. If the filibuster is going to be threatened by Democrats on \na man such as Judge Alito who does have that modest temperament, who \nhas been confirmed by this body two times, who has been involved with \n2,500 cases before, has written 200 opinions, who my distinguished \ncolleagues have had the chance to meet with, I have had the chance to \nmeet with, has the sort of temperament where he will not be legislating \nfrom the bench, he deserves a vote in the Senate. Vote him up, vote him \ndown, if that is the way Members feel, but he deserves a vote in the \nSenate.\n  I don't think it will come to a filibuster. I don't want it to come \nto a filibuster. I haven't even brought the filibuster up except in \nresponse to a question on television on one of the Sunday shows, but I \ndid make it clear at the Republican conference that I strongly believe \na man of the quality of Sam Alito simply deserves the respect, the \ndignity of having a vote in this Senate. Everyone can vote the way they \nwant to. Again, it will be overwhelming by the time we finish this \nprocess. That will be, I believe, before January 20, at some point.\n  I don't want to posture on this. This is not a Democratic or \nRepublican issue. This is an American issue. It is an issue that \nreflects on this Senate because it is our unique responsibility.\n  I am absolutely confident in large part because of the challenges we \nhave gone through for the last 2\\1/2\\ years in talking about filibuster \nand having it not used very rarely. We are not talking about \nfilibustering legislation where you can come in and modify and go to \nconference and have all these procedural tools. We are talking about \nthe dignity of giving up-or-down votes in the Senate. It has been \ntough.\n  As the distinguished former majority leader knows, it has been very \ntough the last 3 years working through this process, where for 214 \nyears, for judicial nominees coming from the executive branch, coming \nfrom the President of the United States, coming here is the tool of a \nfilibuster being used routinely, 10 times--10 times--in the last 3 \nyears, where for the 214 years before that, rare, rare, rare, rare.\n\n  So I feel we are back on course today. I do not think we will see a \nfilibuster. I do not think people really want a filibuster. I think \nthere is a lot of posturing there. But I will do everything I possibly \ncan. If your side chooses, if the Democrat side chooses to filibuster, \nchooses to obstruct, chooses to\n\n[[Page S13430]]\n\nstop this Nation's business, I will use all the tools. If they pull \nthat sheath out, if the other side pulls that sheath out, I will use \nall the tools I have to simply get an up-or-down vote on the floor of \nthe Senate for the President's judicial nominees.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. FRIST. Yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thomas). The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. I am sorry to hear the distinguished majority leader say \nwhat he just said. In the first place, I hear no talk of a filibuster. \nBut who knows? If something should come up that we have not seen \nheretofore or have not heard heretofore about the nominee, which is \nentirely possible--not probable, I don't think--if that should happen, \nI can understand how Senators would say they are not going to give up \nthe right to filibuster in such an event. I do not foresee that. The \nthreat itself is a threat against freedom of speech.\n  Now, the distinguished Senator from Tennessee is a great physician. \nBut this is the Senate. And the Senator talks about our forefathers. \nOur forefathers did not deign to stoop to a King or a President. And \nthis Senate is a forum, probably the only forum that is left in this \ncountry, where freedom of speech reigns. That is the purpose of this \nSenate. That is why we have a Senate. I would hope that the \ndistinguished Senator, who is a distinguished physician, would not have \nit on his escutcheon that he threatened freedom of speech in the Senate \nand threatened the filibuster.\n  The filibuster has been around a long time. It has a bad name in some \ninstances, but filibusters have sometimes been the tool by which free \nmen and women in this Senate have exercised their right to oppose \nsomething. And I detest this mention of a nuclear option, the \nconstitutional option. There is nothing constitutional about it, \nnothing. Nothing constitutional about that.\n  Freedom of speech is underwritten in the Constitution and the Bill of \nRights--freedom of speech--and that also includes the Senate. Freedom \nof speech, we have always had freedom of speech in the Senate. And as I \nsay, any person who fell off a turnip truck could think of the idea: \nWell, if we have enough numbers, if we just go against the rules and \nthrow reason to the winds, we can stop a filibuster. We can take that \naway from the Democrats. How terrible that would be.\n  I hope I will never hear the Senator from Tennessee say this again. \nHe is a Senator, and the right of freedom of speech is his as the \nmajority leader, and he should embrace that right with the intention to \ndie if necessary if anyone sought to take that freedom of speech away \nfrom the Senate.\n  We are here as emissaries of the people who send us here. And the \npeople out there in West Virginia, they cannot speak on this Senate \nfloor. Young people out there in West Virginia or in Tennessee cannot \nspeak on this Senate floor. But their representatives in the Senate--I \nam one of those--have a right to speak as long as I can stand on my \nfeet. And I will do it.\n  Now, I am not threatening a filibuster. But I have filibustered in \nthe past. And I would do so again. I will say to the distinguished \nSenator, I have been in the Senate 47 years. Now, I will guarantee the \nSenate, if we ever have that--I would suggest the Senator not even use \nthe threat again. I do not mean to be lecturing the Senator of what he \ncan and cannot do. He can do that. He has freedom of speech, as I have. \nHe can threaten anything he wants. He is the majority leader. And he \nmay have the power to carry it off. But he might not have.\n  Now, I will guarantee you one thing, I say, Mr. Leader, when somebody \ntries to kill freedom of speech in the Senate, they are going to have \nthe American people to deal with--the American people. That is what our \nConstitution is all about: freedom of speech, freedom of the press, \nfreedom of religion. And freedom of speech obtains here in the Senate, \nalways has for 218 years.\n  And I tell you, my friend, here is one Senator who is not going to be \nthreatened and is not going to be persuaded by any threat against \nfreedom of speech. I will die for that right. Our forefathers died for \nit. Our British forefathers died for it. And they fought for hundreds \nof years against tyrannical monarchs so that the right of freedom of \nspeech, control of the purse, and such things, would be there in the \nHouse of Commons.\n  I am so sorry. I have been here, I have served under several majority \nleaders, Republican and Democrat. Not once did any of them ever \nthreaten to kill freedom of speech in the Senate. And I hope the \nSenator will think twice, three times, before he ever threatens that \nagain. There is not going to be any filibuster against Alito.\n  Mr. FRIST. Good. Good.\n  Mr. BYRD. And I am against any filibuster. That is why I joined the \n14. We stopped it. I thought we were past that. I hope the Senator will \nforgive me. I do not mean disrespect to him, but he is talking about \nfreedom of speech. I respect the Senator. But I respect the Senate \nmore, and I respect the Constitution and I respect freedom of speech \nmore. And that is why I was so interested in knowing why the Senator \nwas talking about killing the filibuster and killing freedom of speech \nand killing a Senate rule. We have ways of changing the rules. If we do \nnot like the rules, there is a way, under the rules, that one can \nchange them. But never has anybody threatened to stop this \nconstitutional right to freedom of speech. I detest it. And I want the \nSenator to know, if he ever really tries to pull that tool--and he can \ndo so; he is the leader, he has a right, if he wants to do that, but I \nwill tell you one thing. This will not make a Senator's name in \nhistory. It will not be etched in stone. Future generations will not \nrise up to bless a Senator who tries to destroy freedom of speech in \nthe Senate.\n  I say this with great respect to the Senator. I will tell you, he is \na physician. I am not. He can do things I cannot do with a knife. He \nhas saved many lives, I am sure. And I praise him for that. I know he \ngoes out and serves the people. Even as a Senator, he goes out there \nand uses that fine brain of his in helping people. But for God's sake, \nthis is the Senate. I have been here 47 years. I did not come here to \nsee freedom of speech curtailed in this Senate. And when there is an \neffort to curtail it, they have Robert C. Byrd and a whole group of \npersons on both sides of the aisle--I would say there are Republicans \nin here who would not stand for that.\n  I have said enough. I do not intend to carry this on. But I am glad \nwe had an opportunity to discuss this because I hope the Senator from \nTennessee fully understands that is not to be talked about in this \nSenate. Republicans do not like it either. And there have been fine \nRepublican leaders. Howard Baker, a former Republican leader, was a \nreal statesman. The Panama Canal treaties would not have been approved \nby this Senate had it not been for Howard Baker. And those Senators--\nBob Dole, others, Everett Dirksen--my goodness, they never threatened \nfreedom of speech in the Senate.\n  Republicans as well as Democrats have seen the wisdom of being able \nto filibuster if they are trying to protect the people of their State \nor the people of the country from some violation of their \nconstitutional rights.\n  I thank the Senator. He has been very respectful toward me. I hope I \nam just as respectful toward him. If he wants to say anything now, he \nhas the floor.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I thank my distinguished colleague from \nWest Virginia. Citing headlines, I guess to score political points, is \nuseful. But I think the headlines you cite, without citing the \nheadlines I cited--I had eight or nine that basically say Democrats are \nthreatening filibuster, at least to our colleagues or to the American \npeople. I think we have clarified that, where Democrats--and I named \nsix Senators on your side of the aisle who are talking about \nfilibuster. So we cleared that up. I appreciate my distinguished \ncolleague saying that while I was on the floor so we can clear that up, \nthe other side of the aisle having used filibusters in the past, having \nin an unprecedented way or at least talking about the filibuster out \nthere.\n  I also appreciate, secondly, the respect my distinguished colleague \nfrom West Virginia has on freedom of speech, which I share. You can \nstart with the Alito nomination, which is the real thrust, the real \ncrux of what\n\n[[Page S13431]]\n\nwe are talking about, this outstanding individual, and you could move \nto talking about the filibuster, which I certainly didn't start talking \nabout but Democrats started talking about. Then you could move to what \nmy response would likely be, and that is saying filibusters--I thought \nwe had been through that. We said unless it is an extraordinary \ncircumstance, filibusters are off the table. Yet you still hear about \nit. Then you move to, Well, if they do filibuster, Senator Frist, what \nare you likely to do? Then you can move off to freedom of speech. I \nthink that was a useful discussion and conversation, but let's come \nback to what we are talking about.\n  We ended pretty much saying that my distinguished colleague from West \nVirginia doesn't expect a filibuster, that he is not going to \nparticipate in a filibuster. I don't expect a filibuster.\n  With the hearings starting on the 9th, with time on the floor, full \nhearings--and we have waited until after the Christmas holidays so \npeople can actually be studying papers and all the 3,000 cases and 300 \nopinions--we are giving plenty of time for the process to work. So we \ndon't expect a filibuster. I think we can hypothetically go across all \nof these potential happenings and occurrences. But all that does come \nback to the fact, and it centers on the Alito nomination, there is no \nreason for a filibuster, I don't believe. I believe my Democratic \ncolleague doesn't believe that.\n  Clearly, there is no reason at this juncture. A lot of the attacks, \nwhich are coming from the political left and the extreme left, are part \nof sort of a spaghetti strategy of throwing spaghetti against the wall \nand hoping something will stick and maybe that will precipitate votes \nagainst Alito for that reason. I don't think they are going to stick. A \nlot of the criticism we are hearing about Judge Alito today, or the \ncritiques, you really just didn't hear over his 15 years on the bench \nor in these 3,500 cases. I think all of the attacks we hear on Alito \nhimself are simply not working. The nomination is right on track. The \nleadership worked together with the Judiciary Committee in terms of \nsetting a time line that we are right on track to fulfill.\n  A lot of people are trying to say Alito is extreme, and those attacks \nsimply are not sticking because he is not extreme. He is not an \nideologue. He did not prejudge cases that came before him. As I was \nreading this weekend, I came across one of Alito's former law clerks \nwho said this week--and he happens to be a registered Democrat; he \nstill has the ``Kerry For President'' bumper sticker on the back of his \ncar--he said: Until I read his 1985 Reagan job application, I could not \ntell you what his politics were. When we worked on cases, we reached \nthe same result about 95 percent of the time. It was my experience that \nJudge Alito was and is capable of setting aside any personal biases he \nmay have when he judges.\n  Mr. BYRD. I believe that.\n  Mr. FRIST. The final words: He is the consummate professional.\n  I think all these attacks that are going on, since that really is the \nissue at hand, we need to put aside all of these partisan attacks, all \nof these unfair attacks by either extremist groups or Senators, and \nlet's look at his qualifications. Let's go through the hearing process. \nLet's come to the floor, let's have an orderly debate, and then let's, \nat the end of all of that, not deny people, not deny our colleagues, \nthe opportunity, the right to be able to vote yes or no after we go \nthrough that process.\n  Mr. BYRD. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. FRIST. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. BYRD. I see nothing in the Constitution that requires an up-or-\ndown vote on any nominee. The Constitution just says that the Senate \nshall have the power, and the Senate uses that power. It is in the \nConstitution.\n  Mr. FRIST. And my response would simply be that the Constitution says \nadvice and consent.\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes.\n  Mr. FRIST. And I think advice and consent for somebody who has gone \nthrough the nomination process, the recommendations, through the \nJudiciary Committee, hearings, recommended to this floor, I would \nargue, not written in the Constitution, but under advice and consent, \nyou can't vote with your hands in your pocket. You can't say yes or no.\n  Mr. BYRD. The Constitution doesn't say that.\n  Mr. FRIST. I would argue that the dignity of this institution has \nworked for 214 years. So why deny it? Especially why deny it with a \nqualified nominee like Alito.\n  Mr. BYRD. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. FRIST. I would be happy to.\n  Mr. BYRD. All this business about us working for 214 years, there \nhave been a lot of misquotations of history when people talk like that. \nI say that a Senator has a right under the Constitution to object for \nwhatever reasons--they may not be plausible reasons--to object to any \nnominee he wishes. The Constitution says the Senate has the power of \nadvice and consent. So it doesn't say how that consent will be \nmeasured. It doesn't say it has to be an up-or-down vote. Nothing in \nthe history, nothing in the Constitution says that. If you can point \nthat out in the Constitution to me, where it says that a nominee shall \nhave the right to an up-or-down vote--can the Senator point that out in \nthe Constitution to me? Can the Senator point that out in the \nConstitution to me?\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, if the distinguished Senator from West \nVirginia would let me answer, I would be happy to.\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes.\n  Mr. FRIST. It is not in the Constitution that a Senator specifically \nhas the right for an up-or-down vote. I am saying the dignity of the \ninstitution to give advice and consent deserves an up-or-down vote on \nthe floor of the Senate. What the Constitution does say--which is why \nit is called the constitutional option, not because it is written in \nthe Constitution--is that this body makes its own rules. The \nconstitutional option is basically just that. You take it to this body \nand you say: Do these Senators deserve an up-or-down vote on the floor \nof the U.S. Senate? Let's vote on that.\n  Mr. BYRD. No.\n  Mr. FRIST. That is what the constitutional option is.\n  Mr. BYRD. He doesn't have a right to an up-or-down vote. A nominee \ndoesn't have a right to an up-or-down vote.\n  Mr. FRIST. That is where we disagree.\n  Mr. BYRD. The Senator can't find that in writing anywhere in the \nConstitution. I can vote against a nominee just because, any Senator \ncan vote against a nominee just because----\n  Mr. FRIST. But you get a vote.\n  Mr. BYRD. The nominee doesn't part his hair on the right or left \nside. The Senator doesn't have to explain why he votes against. That is \nhis right.\n  Mr. FRIST. But he voted, and that is the point.\n  Mr. BYRD. May or may not vote. The Constitution doesn't require that, \nand the Senator can't find it in the Constitution. He can say all he \nwants.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, it doesn't say in the Constitution that you \ncan vote; it says you can give advice and consent and that the Senate \nmakes the rules as to whether you vote or not. We just disagree. \nObviously, this goes back to the whole filibuster argument for judicial \nnominees. I simply believe in the principle that once someone comes to \nthe floor, they deserve, in order to give advice and consent, an up-or-\ndown vote.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Will the majority leader yield?\n  Mr. FRIST. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. BYRD. Will the leader yield to me?\n  Mr. FRIST. Let me yield to my distinguished colleague, and then I \nwill be happy to yield to the Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. I will be glad to take on both Senators in defense of the \nConstitution.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Did the majority leader yield to me?\n  Mr. FRIST. Yes.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I have listened with great interest to \nthe exchange on the television monitor back in my office and thought I \nmight come down and join you both.\n  Let me suggest that it could be argued that you are both right. What \nI believe, I say to my good friend from West Virginia, the majority \nleader is talking about is what is precedent in the Senate. There is a \nlot of discussion about ``stare decisis.'' Lawyers use that term to \nrefer to respect for the precedent.\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes, let the decision stand.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. The precedent in the Senate for 214 years prior to the\n\n[[Page S13432]]\n\nlast Congress was the judges who came to the floor got an up-or-down \nvote.\n  Mr. BYRD. I am not sure about that.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Is that not the case, I ask the majority leader----\n  Mr. BYRD. I am not sure about that history.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. --that when nominees came to the floor who enjoyed \nmajority support in the Senate, they got an up-or-down vote? Has that \nnot been what the leader argues for? And to the substantial credit of \nour friend from West Virginia, this whole controversy was largely \ndefused last summer, was it not?\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. We have not been filibustering judges during this \nfirst session of Congress, and we have been giving judges an up-or-down \nvote as a direct result of the Senate's collective decision to sort of \nstep back from the brink and honor the traditions of the Senate. Has \nthat not been the case, I ask my friend, the majority leader?\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, that is my understanding. This is exactly \nwhere we were about a year ago, after this long period of 214--or 218 \nyears, as my colleague from West Virginia was saying on the side. When \nwe are talking about filibustering--this is important to say for the \npeople watching, not so much for colleagues--it is a very important \ntool for this body to use, for the minority to use, and it has been \nused really all the time for legislative issues.\n  As we design legislation, which can be shaped, manipulated, defeated, \nand approved, these nominees who come from the executive branch, the \nPresident, are different. Ultimately, you cannot cut a person in half. \nYou can operate on them, but you cannot cut them in half. You cannot \nmove them aside. Ultimately, the only way to give that advice and \nconsent--and the way it has been done for those 218 years--is that once \nthey come to the floor, having gone through committee, they get the \ncourtesy, the dignity, consistent with the principles of this body, of \nan up-or-down vote.\n  Mr. BYRD. That is not history. That is not even recent history.\n  Mr. FRIST. And then it changed about 3 years ago, where for all of \nthis period of time, it didn't occur; that is, a nominee who had \nmajority support being denied a vote on the floor of the Senate. Then \nit happened 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 times, all in a period of \nabout 18 months.\n  Then progress was made. We kind of put that all back in its cage. It \nstill can be brought out. That is where some of these threatening \nissues are coming from. We don't think it should be brought out. Let's \ngive the nominee an up-or-down vote after we have had plenty of time to \ndebate and talk about and discuss that process.\n  That is my understanding of the history. I know we will get a \ndifferent version here shortly, but that is the lay of the land in the \npast and where we are today. I want to keep coming back to the Alito \nnomination. That is ultimately where the decision will be made.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the majority leader. I hope my PA system is on \nhere. This country is a great country, but it has never perfected a \ngood PA system. I think this one is working.\n  May I say to the distinguished Senator, on vote No. 37, 106th \nCongress, on the nomination of Richard A. Paez to be U.S. circuit \njudge, vote on cloture on March 8, 2000, the distinguished Senator from \nTennessee, Mr. Frist, voted to filibuster. The question was on a \ncloture motion to end a filibuster. Cloture was agreed to by three-\nfifths vote, but the distinguished Senator from Tennessee chose to \nexercise his right, and he voted against cloture. He voted to \nfilibuster. So the worm turns. The day may come when the Senator may \nwant to filibuster. He will never find me on the side of saying I will \ncut off your right to talk.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I will not reclaim the floor. But what \nhappened to those judges? Not with my principle as an up-or-down vote, \nbut I ask my distinguished colleague what happened. Ultimately, they \ngot an up-or-down vote on the floor of the Senate. That is all this \ndiscussion is about.\n  Mr. BYRD. Some of them did.\n  Mr. FRIST. The Senator cited Paez. He got an up-or-down vote on the \nfloor of the Senate. All I am arguing for is an up-or-down vote. It is \nsimple. Vote for or against them, and they win or they lose, and you \nstart over or not.\n  Mr. BYRD. That has never been the rule here. Senators have a right to \ntalk, to filibuster.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Will the majority leader yield?\n  Mr. FRIST. Yes.\n  Mr. BYRD. The distinguished Senator from Tennessee, may I say, is \nwrong when he cites history. History is not on his side. I tell you \nsomething else. Not all nominees have had up-or-down votes. A lot of \nthem are bottled up in committees. That is one way of killing them. \nThat is one way of denying them their right, as the Senator says, to an \nup-or-down vote. They are killed in committees. The Senator is a member \nof the Republican Party, the Grand Old Party, and I respect that party. \nI am for a two-party system. But I will tell you, the Senator doesn't \ncome into court with clean hands when he talks about the right of an \nindividual to have an up-or-down vote. The Republicans have killed lots \nof nominees in committees, not letting them have an up-or-down vote. At \nleast 61 nominees did not get out of committee. Not all nominees have \nhad up-or-down votes.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I yield to my colleague from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, would the majority leader not agree \nwith the Senator from Kentucky that the Paez and Berzon nominations to \nwhich our good friend from West Virginia refers--in both instances, you \nwere not the leader at the time; you were a Member but not the leader. \nThe majority leader and the leader of the other side jointly filed \ncloture, not for the purpose of defeating the nomination but for the \npurpose of guaranteeing that the nominees got an up-or-down vote.\n  There were one or more Senators, I expect, on our side of the aisle \nwho did not want those nominees to get an up-or-down vote. So in that \nparticular instance, Senator Daschle and Senator Lott used the device \nof cloture, not to kill the nomination but to advance the nomination, \nmove it to final passage.\n  I say to my friend, the majority leader, it is largely irrelevant how \nhe may have voted on cloture as a rank-and-file member of the \nRepublican Conference on that particular day. The leader of our party \nat the time and the other party at the time were honoring the principle \nto which the leader has been speaking, guaranteeing that those nominees \ngot an up-or-down vote by the only device they could, by filing cloture \nand moving forward.\n  So that is entirely consistent with the point my good friend, the \nmajority leader, has been making here on floor, and the end result was \nthat those two nominees--very controversial on this side--ended up \ngetting an up-or-down vote and being confirmed by the Senate, and they \nare now called Judge Paez and Judge Berzon.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I am going to close by saying I very much \nappreciate the colloquy, the back and forth we have had over the last \nhour. These are important issues when you are talking about nominations \nfor the Supreme Court, which will far outlast, once confirmed, many of \nus in this body, and the importance of this process. I believe what is \nimportant for the American people to understand, even in this back and \nforth now, is we are committed to a fair process and a process that \nshould be dignified; that we need to have civil debate, and we will \nhave that on this particular nomination, which is where the focus is, \nwhere I want to rest so we are not talking about what we will do from \nthat side or this side, but focus on the fact that among all the \nresponsibilities that we have, that we are given in the Constitution, \nthis nomination process is one that is important, that should be \ndignified, especially if we want people to continue putting themselves \nforward as potential nominees. We should not be in the business of \ncharacter assassination, and we should not be in the business of not \ngiving people the opportunity to fulfill a process and have it unfairly \nblocked as we go forward.\n  I think it is important--again, not as Democrats or Republicans or \nparty or partisan issues--to not allow the debate to get so hot, high, \nand heated that we interrupt the process. We are about midway through \nthe time Judge Alito has been nominated. I am very\n\n[[Page S13433]]\n\npleased by our leadership at the Judiciary level, with Senator Leahy, \nSenator Specter, and the committee, in terms of their approach. They \nhave a tremendous working relationship, which is very important as we \ngo through these hearings which will begin on the 9th.\n  Those hearings will be several days. They will be thorough; they will \nbe exhaustive. It is important to this body to have the information to \nknow how to vote--not whether to vote but how to vote, and questions, I \nam sure, will arise from the hearings--and that we be able to have both \nthe appropriate amount of time for discussion and then come to the \nfloor and have a full debate, and then approve or disapprove of that \nnomination.\n  Again, I appreciate the chance to have this discussion. I know the \ndistinguished Senator from Massachusetts has been waiting an hour to \nspeak. We will continue the dialog. I very much respect the comments of \nmy distinguished colleague from West Virginia. He teaches me all the \ntime. I listen, and he knows I listen as we go through. We disagree on \ncertain principles. I know one is not freedom of speech, or respect for \nthe Constitution, or respect for this institution.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the Senator has yielded the floor. Let me \nsay, as the Chair recognizes me, to the distinguished Senator, I say \nagain, I respect him, but I hope he will never leave as part of his \nlegacy the destruction of freedom of speech in the U.S. Senate. And may \nI say to him once finally, that if he ever tries to exercise that so-\ncalled constitutional option, which is an unconstitutional option, he \nflies in the face of history, he flies in the face of our forefathers, \nhe flies in the face of the Constitution, the right to freedom of \nspeech. If he ever tries that, he is going to see a real filibuster if \nI am living and able to stand on my feet or sit in my seat.\n  I respect him as a Senator, but I respect the Senate even more. I \nrespect freedom of speech even more. And if the Senator wants a fight, \nlet him try it. I am 88 years old, but I can still fight, and fight I \nwill for freedom of speech, for the constitutional right of freedom of \nspeech. I haven't been here 47 years to see that freedom of speech \nwhittled away and undermined. I haven't been here that long, I haven't \nbeen here 47 years to see that.\n  I hope the Senator will take what I say as being in the spirit of \nfriendship. But with something so important--and it was here a long \ntime before I came here. It is the Constitution of the United States \nand freedom of speech, and we are going to have freedom of speech here.\n  If I elect to filibuster against a nominee, it will be for good \nreason. I don't intend to join a filibuster. That is why I joined the \ngroup of 13, and I made the 14th. I think we avoided a filibuster. I \ndon't expect to filibuster on this.\n  I tell you one thing, I am tired of hearing this threat thrown in our \nfaces that this so-called nuclear option will be used if we decide we \nwant to filibuster. If there is good reason to filibuster an \nindividual, why, let a Senator filibuster him. There are some of the \nnames around, and I hope the President will not send one of them up, \nbut there are some around on which there will be a filibuster. I \ncompliment the President on avoiding that. We don't need that kind of \ndisruption here. We don't need that kind of divisiveness. We need \ntogetherness. I hope we will have togetherness.\n  I thank the Senator for his courtesies. I respect him. I respect him, \nbut I tell you, I expect, if the Lord lets me live, to continue to \nfight for this Constitution and for this institution and for freedom of \nspeech against all comers on either side of the aisle--either side. I \nwould not stand still a minute if a Democratic leader over here \nthreatened to kill freedom of speech in the Senate. I wouldn't stand \nstill for that. No, no, I wouldn't do that, Democrat or Republican.\n  I thank the Senator. I respect him. When I meet him in the corridors, \nI will meet him with a smile.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, once again I thank my distinguished \ncolleague from West Virginia for his insightful comments. I do want to \nkeep the focus at this point--I have a feeling he is going to want to \nsay something after I close, but I think it is time to put partisanship \naside.\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes. Amen.\n  Mr. FRIST. To put threats of filibuster aside before we have even had \nthe hearings. I am not bringing up filibuster.\n  Mr. BYRD. That is freedom of speech.\n  Mr. FRIST. I didn't bring it up yesterday. I responded to a question, \nand then I did cite what six Democratic Senators have said and what \neight newspapers have said about what is coming from the other side. \nBut I think it is time to put it aside and to focus on the nomination. \nFreedom of speech, which is important, which I love, I cherish, that is \nwhy I am here, we can debate that. I am not sure what we are debating. \nWe can debate that. I thought we finished that. We talked about \nfilibusters 6 months ago. It is time to focus on this nomination, which \nis what the American people want us to do.\n  We are talking about one of the most fundamental responsibilities in \nthis body, and that is looking at an individual--and I would argue a \nvery qualified individual--having a process that is fair, that is \ndignified, that is respectful and gives people the opportunity to give \nadvice and consent. That is my goal, and that is what I am going to do \nmy best to achieve.\n  I think that is going to be the last thing I say. But I thank the \nSenator very much. I appreciate the comments from the distinguished \nSenator.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, may I say to the majority leader, there are \nthose who filibuster sometimes, but they, too, can be dignified. I have \nseen filibusterers who were dignified. The late Senator Richard Russell \nand some of my friends on that side of the aisle when I came here \nfilibustered with dignity. Talking about dignity, you can be against \nsomething and filibuster and still do it with dignity. I thank the \nSenator. I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I know not many of our colleagues are \nhere at this time, but I certainly hope a number of Americans have been \nlistening to a very important history lesson and a real lesson about \nthe rules and some fundamental issues and rights that have been debated \nover the last hour in the Senate. I think it has been enormously \nhelpful and very informative.\n  I am a member of the Judiciary Committee. I have attended some 22 of \nthese nominations. I have spent a good deal of time since the Senate \nwent into recess in preparation for these hearings and will continue to \ndo so. But I join with my friend and colleague from West Virginia in \nsaying that I do not know a single member, certainly of the Judiciary \nCommittee, who has said they are going to filibuster this nominee. Nor \ndo I know a single member of this side of the aisle who has stated they \nwere going to go ahead with a filibuster.\n  A number of our colleagues, including myself, have been asked, Does \nthis mean under any circumstances you will not? The appropriate answer \nis, as the Senator from West Virginia stated so clearly and \ncompellingly, we are not going to give up any of our rights prior to \nconsideration of a nominee until there has been a completion of the \nhearings and until we make a balanced and informed judgment.\n  That is the responsibility we have because the Constitution has \nstated so. During the debates at the Constitutional Convention, our \nFounding Fathers considered on four different occasions who would have \nthe right to nominate judges to the Supreme Court.\n  On three of the four they gave the complete power and authority to \nthe Senate. It was only in the last 10 days of the Constitutional \nConvention they decided that it would be a shared power: One, the \nPresident would nominate and, second, we had a constitutional \nresponsibility to give our judgment whether we believed that nominee \nwas committed to constitutional rights and liberties. That is the \nresponsibility we have, which is an enormously important one.\n  I do not think anyone could have listened to the debate in the last \nhour or so and not understood the strong feelings that not only the \nSenator from West Virginia but all of us have on this particular \njudgment. I do not think there is a decision outside of the issues\n\n[[Page S13434]]\n\nof war and peace that is more important than the votes we cast for a \nnominee to the Supreme Court of the United States.\n  The debate is closed, but as a member of the committee I do want to \ncorrect a few items. We can go back through, but the record is very \nclear that Republicans have filibustered Democratic nominees. I was \nhere at the time of Judge Fortas. So they have filibustered Democratic \nnominees in the past and denied them the right of a vote.\n  As Senator Byrd has pointed out, I have been a member of the \nJudiciary Committee where President Clinton's nominees were effectively \nkilled by denying them the opportunity to have a hearing. I have been \nin the Senate when we have had what they call secret holds and that is \nwhen Republicans put a hold on a nominee so that we do not even get a \nchance to consider the nominee.\n  All of that is history and we should not be bothering about debating \nit. We can go back and debate whether it is history or it is not, but \nas a member of the Judiciary Committee and one who has been \nparticipating in these various debates and discussions, the record is \nvery clear. It has been exhibited on the floor of the Senate in recent \ntimes in the discussions of it.\n  So I want to join my colleague and friend from West Virginia. The \nlast thing we need now is threats about the process and the procedure. \nWhat we need to have is an informed hearing on this nominee. As nice, \ndecent, and fine a nominee as we might have, that in and of itself is \nnot enough to promote this individual to the Supreme Court of the \nUnited States. Any nominee has to demonstrate his or her core \ncommitment to constitutional values. Those are the most precious rights \nand liberties we have. The essence of the terms of the Constitution is \nto protect the rights and liberties of individuals, as has been pointed \nout by the Senator from West Virginia, from tyrannical governments, \nkings and monarchies. This is enormously important. We take our \nresponsibilities extremely seriously.\n  Reference was made during the consideration of the 1985 memorandum \nthat Judge Alito had written, and I am not going to spend a great deal \nof time this afternoon going through it, but there are troublesome \naspects of statements he made when he was applying for a job in the \nJustice Department. He has pointed out that it was just applying for a \njob in the Justice Department. So when he said he was so critical of \nthe Warren Court that made judgments and decisions that guaranteed the \nrights of counsel in the Gideon v. Wainwright case, also the one-man, \none-vote case which has been so fundamental against the background and \nhistory of gerrymandering of voters in this country which has excluded \nthe rights of people, on those two important decisions--or the rights \nof a defendant in Miranda--when these decisions now are bedrock in \nterms of jurisprudence, we have to ask what was so troublesome to him \nin 1985 about those particular judgments and decisions?\n  He says he was just applying for a job. Well, he was 35 years old. \nNow he is applying for another job. So there are important issues and \nquestions which we have every right to go into. As to the Vanguard \ncase, Judge Alito mentioned he would recuse himself from any decisions \non the Vanguard case. Then the case comes for a decision in his court \nand he does not recuse himself. Then he writes to the Judiciary \nCommittee some time later--after he had been to the Judiciary Committee \nand gave the Judiciary Committee the assurance he would recuse himself, \nhe decided himself he would no longer recuse himself. Is that not \ninteresting? Who did he notify? Did he notify the Judiciary Committee \nhe changed his mind? Did he notify the circuit court? The White House \nsays the reason he did it was because of a computer glitch.\n  Then he says to the members of the Judiciary Committee that he did it \nbecause it was a pro se case, so it did not make much difference. Yet a \npro se case is probably the most important. Those are cases which \ninvolve such individuals where they do not involve a whole battery of \nlawyers or law firms.\n  When he gives his word to the Senate Judiciary Committee and then \nchanges his mind, is it not worth finding out something about this \nnominee?\n  So we are looking forward to this hearing. These hearings are \nenormously important. As one who has gone through the cases in which he \nhas dissented--a good part of the cases he has been a part of the \nmajority, a good part of the cases have not been published, they are \nnonpublished cases--I am certainly concerned about certain patterns \nthat indicate a greater proclivity toward the powerful and less \ninterest in protecting the smaller person, the little guy, on many of \nthese cases. I am not prepared to make a judgment or decision on this.\n  This is an enormously important consideration, and I could not agree \nmore with the Senator from West Virginia. Why do we need to divert \nfocus and attention on the process and the procedure when there is not \na single member in the Senate who has said they were going to \nfilibuster? Why attempt to chill debate and discussion? The only effect \nof this kind of comment is basically to threaten or to chill debate and \ndiscussion about a nominee.\n  The Senator from West Virginia is not going to be intimidated, nor \nmyself, but I do not think that serves the process well. It was \nentirely appropriate for the Senator from West Virginia to point out \nthese comments that were on the front section of a newspaper, the New \nYork Times, but wherever it was, wherever it was said, it was being \nsaid by the majority leader and the message was very clear. I certainly \nreceived the message, although I did not accept it. I do not think I \nwould have been as clear and as eloquent as the Senator from West \nVirginia, but the message was very clear, do not you dare take too much \ntime in consideration of this nominee or I am going to change the rules \nof the Senate in ways that are going to deny free speech. That is not \nwhere we should be in terms of giving fairness to this nominee and to \ngive him the kind of thoughtful hearing which the Judiciary Committee \nis capable of doing and which it did under Chairman Specter during the \nRoberts hearing.\n\n  I think Americans who followed that would feel the nominee was \ntreated with respect and dignity and that members of the Judiciary \nCommittee had opportunities to inquire and also to hear from other \noutside witnesses. That is the way it should go. I am confident that is \nthe way it will go.\n  I agree with my friend and colleague from West Virginia, the less \ntalk about the threats about changing the rules of the Senate and \nparticularly by the leadership, the better off we are going to be.\n  Mr. BYRD. Would the distinguished Senator yield?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I would be glad to yield.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, first, I apologize to the distinguished \nSenator for imposing on his patience. He sat back in that chair and he \nwas in the Senate Chamber before I was today. He sat patiently through \nthat long, drawn-out discussion, and I apologize to him for my part in \nimposing on his time and patience.\n  Secondly, let me thank him for his clear, lucid, reasonable, and \nthoughtful comments concerning the subject matter that has been \ndiscussed. He has always taken advantage of the opportunity to serve \nthe people of the country, to serve the country, and to serve the \nSenate. If something seemed right or seemed wrong, he was willing to \nspeak out. I will always admire him for those things. I thank him for \nwhat he has said today. I think, again, it reflects great dignity upon \nthe Senator and his thoughtfulness. He is a Senator sui generis, in the \nfact that he speaks his mind--he is never backward about that. He can \ndo that with me, too. And he has done that with me in the past. I \nrespect him for it.\n\n  I thank the Senator for his comments. He certainly has engaged in a \ndiscussion today that I think makes a great contribution, not only to \nthis discussion and this subject matter, but he continues as he has for \nyears, so many years during my tenure here, to contribute greatly as a \nstatesman who has been worthy of a seat in the Constitutional \nConvention or a seat in the first Senate calling that Congress. He \ncould have been in any of those debates at any time in the history of \nthis country.\n  I respect him for it. He is an outstanding Senator and one upon whose\n\n[[Page S13435]]\n\nservices history will certainly report with great support. I thank him \nso much. I thank Senator Kennedy very much.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thank my friend from West Virginia. That is what that \nprevious hour was about, and why it was so important, because it was \nabout preserving this institution. I know I speak for all of us, I \nthink pretty generally across both sides of the aisle, in saying that \nthere is no individual who is more dedicated to the preservation of \nthis institution and the magnificent framework in which our Founding \nFathers had conceived of it. It was really that issue that was talked \nabout in that previous hour.\n  It is important, as all of us go through the process of pressing our \nown views and our own vision about the future of this country, that we \nhear the clear and persuasive and knowledgeable voice, the voice of \nhistory, that speaks about the institution and its importance to the \nAmerican people. That is what we just heard with the exchange of the \nSenator from West Virginia. That is why I was so pleased to have an \nopportunity to listen. I just wish the other 98 Senators had that \nopportunity to be so informed as well. I thank the Senator for his kind \nwords.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Senator again. I feel pretty well today. I have \nhad the flu over the weekend, but I am glad I came to the Senate today.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I think you got your message across pretty well.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Senator and I thank all Senators.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thank Senator Byrd.\n  Mr. President, I know we are in the morning hour of business; am I \ncorrect? I would like to be able to speak continuously. Do we have a \ntime limit? I would like to be able to speak until I conclude.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is no limitation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/12/12/senate-section/article/S13435-1", "month": "12", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13435-S13437]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             PENSIONS, RECONCILIATION AND EDUCATION FUNDING\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, as Congress meets for a final session \nbefore we adjourn for the holidays, we should be focused on the true \nmeaning of Christmas and the special thoughts that Americans of many \nfaiths have at this time of year regarding their families, their \nfriends and neighbors, and the rest of humanity.\n  Christmas is a season of great hope--a time of goodwill and special \ncaring for others. That's what we should remember as we celebrate the \nbirth of Christ, and the glad tidings of great joy that came to us that \nday.\n  There are those in America who urge the return of the word \n``Christmas'' to this holiday season. I believe that Christmas is more \nthan a word. It is a belief in a power far greater than ourselves. It \nis a belief in the possibility of lives full of hope and fulfillment. \nIt is a belief that each of us has a sacred obligation to care for one \nanother and to help those in need--to lend a hand to the least of those \nin our midst.\n  But I am sad to report, that is not what we are seeing in Congress \nthis week.\n  As families across America struggle to make ends meet with higher \nhealth costs, higher college costs, higher gas prices, higher heating \ncosts, and higher housing costs, Congress is about to make things worse \nfor them.\n  Millionaires will be given tens of thousands of dollars in new tax \nbreaks, but Medicaid cuts could mean that 22 million poor Americans \nwill face a reduction in help from that lifesaving program and two \nmillion others may lose their health care entirely.\n  Proposed budget cuts would mean that 750,000 poor preschoolers who \nare eligible for Head Start won't be able to get into the program.\n  More than a quarter of a million poor Americans could lose their food \nstamps, and could face hunger. These cuts are proposed just as the \nDepartment of Agriculture reports that 38 million Americans face \nhunger, an increase of 5 million in 5 years.\n  Hundreds of thousands of children could lose their child support \nbecause of Republican proposals to cut enforcement against delinquent \nfathers.\n  Three million poor children could be left behind in school. They \nwon't get the quality teachers and after-school help and supplemental \nservices they need to catch up and succeed.\n  Hundreds of thousands of airline workers--the ones who are helping us \nget home for the holidays--could see their pensions hanging in the \nbalance, and millions of other Americans could lose their pensions, \ntoo.\n  That is what is at stake in Congress this Christmas. Are these \nactions consistent with the spirit of this holiday season? Rather than \ndebate whether the word ``Christmas'' should appear in our stores and \non our greeting cards, shouldn't we be living out the hope that came \nfrom the first Christmas and do more for our fellow citizens than \ngreater tax breaks for the rich and greater hardship for the poor and \nstruggling middle class?\n  As Christian leader Reverend Jim Wallis said last week:\n\n       The Bible does not condemn prosperity. It just insists that \n     it be shared.\n\n  So I would hope that those in Congress who seek to lavish more tax \nbreaks on the privileged few at the expense of the rest of America will \nreconsider--not only at Christmas, but throughout the year.\n  Otherwise, what we face this week is a Republican plan in which \nbillions of dollars will go from programs that assist low income \nfamilies and senior citizens into the pockets of the already wealthy.\n  The provisions in the House bill that would cut the tax rate on \ncapital gains and dividend income are particularly unfair, because more \nthan 86 percent of the tax benefits will go to taxpayers with incomes \nabove $100,000 a year. Nearly half the benefits--45 percent--will go to \ntaxpayers with incomes over $1 million a year. The average millionaire \nwill save $32,000 a year from these tax breaks for capital gains and \ndividends. In stark contrast, families with incomes less than $100,000 \nwould receive an average tax cut of only $29.\n  This is by no means the only outrageous provision in the Republican \nplan--just the most costly. There are others. Republicans in the House \npropose a $5 billion tax break for financial services companies doing \nbusiness in foreign countries. This provision actually creates a tax \nincentive for these huge corporations to invest abroad instead of in \nthe United States.\n  The spirit of Christmas should compel us to take another path. We \nshould start investing in the health and well-being of all families. \nThe average family is being squeezed unmercifully by stagnant wages and \never-increasing costs for the basic necessities of life. The cost of \nhealth insurance has risen 59 percent in the last five years. Gasoline \nis up 74 percent. College tuition is up 46 percent. Housing is up 44 \npercent. The list goes on and on, up and up--and paychecks are buying \nless each year.\n  The economic trends are very disturbing for any who are willing to \nlook at them objectively. The gap between rich and poor has been \nwidening in recent years. Mr. President, 37 million Americans now live \nin poverty, up 19 percent during the Bush Administration. One in six \nAmerican children lives in poverty and 14 million children go to bed \nhungry each night. Long-term unemployment is at historic highs.\n  The silent slavery of poverty is not so silent anymore. Katrina \nfocused the Nation's attention on the immense hardships that low-income \nAmericans face each day, and presented us with an historic and \nchallenging opportunity to find better ways to lift up the most \nvulnerable among us.\n  This is Christmas. Surely, the American people deserve better.\n  In the Senate, we did our best to respond to the needs of average \nAmericans by helping to expand access to a college education. We cut \nthe fat out of bank profits and put it back where it belongs--helping \nstudents afford the cost of college. Our bill included a virtually \nunprecedented increase in need-based aid--over $8.25 billion over 5 \nyears.\n  All together, it provides $12 billion in new aid and additional \nbenefits for needy children who have the ability to go to schools and \ncolleges all across this country--bipartisan, unanimous, out of our \ncommittee and on the floor of the Senate, all in jeopardy this \nafternoon. Hopefully, our good chairman, Chairman Enzi, will be able to \nfight for those provisions. But that is now in jeopardy from those who \nbelieve that tax breaks are more important than our children's future. \nAmericans know that education is the great equalizer. When young people \nwork hard,\n\n[[Page S13436]]\n\nstudy, play by the rules to be well qualified academically, they should \nbe able to attend college. The cost of public college tuition fees has \nskyrocketed 46 percent since 2001. That leaves the lowest income \nstudents at 4-year public colleges with an average of $5,800 in unmet \nneed.\n  Too many qualified students, 400,000 each year, do not go to a 4-year \ncollege. They can't afford it. They have the academic ability to \nsucceed in those schools and colleges. They will not do that, and they \ncannot do that because of the finances. Almost 200,000 do not attend \neven a community college.\n  This is not acceptable, and we should be able to do better.\n  In addition, the Republican plan, as we found in the bill funding \neducation and health care, will cut funds for public schools for the \nfirst time in a decade, leaving 3 million children behind. It provides \nno new funds for afterschool programs. It strips funding for technology \nin our schools.\n  The bill covers even less of the cost of meeting the educational \nneeds of students with disabilities. Instead of meeting our promise to \nparents and communities to do more, we are doing less.\n  Remember when we passed the IDEA program, we said we would establish \nthat the Federal Government would get 40 percent to pay for disabled \nchildren and that we expect the States and local communities to pick up \nthe difference. Now we are retreating.\n  We have attempted, under the leadership of Senator Harkin, to be able \nto meet that responsibility. And now we are finding that 18 percent is \nslipping and going in the wrong direction rather than helping States, \nlocal communities and parents, particularly the parents that have \ndisabled children.\n  It leaves Pell grants frozen in place for the fourth year in a row, \neven as college costs are soaring.\n  That is in the Republican proposal.\n  The Republican proposal cuts job training, even as the number of good \njobs is shrinking, and fails to provide adequate increases for programs \nto ensure worker safety.\n  We have 161,100 unemployed workers in my State of Massachusetts. Yet \nfunds for unemployment insurance offices and to help unemployed workers \nwith job-seeking are being cut.\n  The proposal cuts job training, even as the number of good jobs is \nshrinking. We have 73,000 jobs that are going, that are vacant by \nemployers all over our State. But we are missing is the linkage between \ntraining these workers so they can get these jobs and so they will be \ntaxpayers contributing to their community and making a difference. We \nare cutting back on that program.\n  The House bill cuts the child support enforcement program by $5 \nbillion over 5 years, resulting in a $24 billion reduction in child \nsupport collections over the next ten years. The House bill will reduce \nchild support collections in Massachusetts by $140 million over the \nnext five years. This is an enforcement program to make those who have \nan obligation to children take personal responsibility and help their \nchildren grow and learn. The House bill cuts this necessary and \nsuccessful support program.\n  There are currently over 13,500 children in Massachusetts waiting for \nchild care. Do you know what? We are cutting back the number of Child \ncare subsidies for low income families. Who knows how many more \nthousands of people will not work because they cannot provide and look \nafter their children any longer.\n  Does that particularly make sense with regard to the child and the \nparent in terms of the family? Clearly, it does not.\n  Funding for unemployment insurance has been cut by $141 million, and \nfunds for programs to help unemployed workers with job seeking have \nbeen cut by $89 million, even in the wake of Hurricane Katrina, with 8 \nmillion Americans unemployed.\n  We know those within the administration would like to pretend Katrina \nnever existed and the devastation that took place in Mississippi and \nNew Orleans never happened. Those people should disappear, deny that \nthose States are part of the United States of America. We are one \ncountry. We do have one history. We are one Nation. And now we \npretending, evidently, that disaster never took place.\n  Finally, I want to go into the area of health care. We live in an era \nof medical miracles. This is the life science century. We have had the \nmapping of the human genome, the DNA, the sequencing of the gene. These \nbreakthroughs which were unheard of 10, 15, 20, 30 years ago, bringing \ntogether the latest new technologies in engineering, with the latest in \nterms of the possibility of research--and the possibilities are \nvirtually unlimited in our lifetime--to see major breakthroughs for new \ncures for multiple sclerosis, cancer, diabetes, Parkinson's disease, \nand Alzheimer's disease.\n  What do we do after the Congress and Senate doubled the NIH budget? \nWe see the possibilities, but we are basically cutting back on those \npossibilities and cutting back for giving help and assistance to our \nfellow citizens.\n  Finally, I am deeply concerned about what is happening to the \nmillions of our fellow citizens who are looking to retirement and \nlooking to pensions. We know there is effectively a three-legged stool \nfor retirees. If you look at what has happened to their savings, they \nhave been effectively eviscerated, wiped out because of the sudden \nincreased costs that working families have been affected by. If they \nhad been in the 401(k)s, they have had virtual stability and very \nlittle growth in recent years.\n  The last major part is the pensions, and 700 companies have dropped \ntheir pension plans, and an estimated $8 billion in future benefits has \nbeen lost to American workers in the period of the last 5 years--$8 \nbillion that has been paid in by American workers who sacrifice; who \nsay: No, we will not take more wages to provide for our family now, we \nwant to put something aside for when we require. No, we will not take \nthat extra money so we can have a little vacation. We will put it \naside. We need those resources. We will put it aside for another day. \nNo, we will sacrifice in terms of additional time. We will work \novertime, and we will contribute into the pensions, $8 billion in the \nlast 5 years--and those numbers are going to continue unless we pass a \npension bill.\n  We can't get in conference with the House of Representatives. Do you \nwant to know why? Because House Leadership is holding a bill \neffectively hostage in the House of Representatives.\n  What are you going to tell those airline workers? You talk about \nabuse of power and abuse of authority. It is absolutely outrageous.\n  The Senate moved toward a pension bill last month. We passed that \nwith two dissenting votes--not everything that Senator Enzi would have \nwanted, not everything that I would have wanted, certainly not what a \nlot of others would have wanted. Our leaders in this, Senators \nMikulski, Tom Harkin, Jeff Bingaman, and many others, bipartisan in \nnature, Republican and Democrats alike, got together and passed that \nlegislation under the leadership of Senator Enzi, and we are being \neffectively stonewalled.\n  The House could have engaged in a bi-partisan process. But instead \nthey chose to forge ahead with a bill that has no Democratic support \nand that threatens our manufacturing companies, cutting off benefits \nfor workers whose plants close; leaves older workers without \nprotections when their companies switch to new plans; and leaves \nworkers at the mercy of conflicted investment advice. That is why they \nare unable to pass legislation this year.\n  I urge members of the House to take a page from the Senate's book. It \nis not too late to reach a consensus on a bill that can be passed \nquickly with Democratic support.\n  We are talking about the holiday season. We are talking about the \nChristmas time. Hundreds of thousands of workers, retirees of airline \ncompanies, see their retirement on the line.\n  That includes the retired mechanic, Randy Daly, of Apple Valley, MN, \nwho spent 40 years as a mechanic at Northwest Airlines. At 61, he \nthought his best years were ahead of him. But now he has learned, if \nhis company's pension plan fails, he stands to lose over 40 percent of \nhis retirement benefits. Most of his fellow retirees fear a similar \nfate.\n  Our airline companies are under tremendous financial pressure from \nterrorism, the recent catastrophes of Hurricane Rita and Hurricane \nKatrina, and increased jet fuel costs. Some of these\n\n[[Page S13437]]\n\ncompanies have filed for bankruptcy. The list goes on, as the Senator \nfrom West Virginia knows.\n\n  The whole challenge is for many manufacturers, the hundreds of \nthousands of workers in companies such as Bethlehem Steel, LTV, many of \nthe coal and other companies where workers have paid the price and lost \ntheir pensions. We should not be waiting more time for the brink of \nfailure before we act. This legislation helps nearly millions of \nworkers and retirees. We should not at this time turn them down.\n  In the pension bill we also included the key reforms to respond to \nthe Enron, the WorldComs, and other corporate scandals where employees \nwere forced to invest in company stock at a huge risk and then lost it \nall while the employers walked away with huge pension security \npackages.\n  Finally, we address the women's retirement security with provisions \nfrom the Women's Pension Protection Act, which was bipartisan. The \nSenator from Maine, Senator Snowe, myself, and many others, recognized \nthe particular challenges women have in terms of the pension issue.\n  American workers and their families expect Congress to protect their \nhard-earned pensions. Americans expect Congress to help them send their \nchildren to college, not make it more expensive at a time when workers \nneed more and more skills. Americans expect Congress to increase, not \ncut, education and job training. Americans expect Congress to help \nsecure health care, not cut health care assistance. Americans expect \nmore from us. Americans deserve better, especially at this \nChristmastime.\n  Mr. BYRD. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for the speech he made. \nI am glad I stayed and listened to his speech. It is one of his finest \nspeeches. It is a speech made in the true spirit of Christmas, too. The \nSenator, once again, stands for the poor, the downtrodden, those who \ncannot be here to speak for themselves.\n  I thank the Senator for this speech. He is truly in my book one of \nthe great Senators for all time. We have not always agreed. We have not \neven liked each other in long ages ago, times past. But that is in the \npast. I think so highly of this Senator. I am glad I stayed here to \nhear this speech. It was certainly thoughtful. It was needed at this \ntime. I congratulate the Senator. Tomorrow, I may speak a little bit on \nthe same subject--not as eloquently as he has but certainly along the \nsame line.\n  I hope I can do that.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the Senator for his kind words and for his \ntypical graciousness. I am so glad we had an opportunity to have a \nbrief celebration at your recent birthday. It is good to see the \nSenator up, as always, in fighting trim and fighting form.\n  I am grateful for the Senator's comments.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I have a few issues to discuss in morning \nbusiness. First, I desire to be more positive than what we have been \nhearing. It makes one depressed to hear the negative discussions. There \nare quite a number of positive things happening in this country. \nPerhaps we ought to talk about them.\n  We have had the extraordinary growth in gross domestic production, \ngrowth in the economy over the last number of months, particularly in \nthe last month, 3.5 percent growth. We have had more jobs than we have \nhad for a very long time. We have more people working than we have had \nfor a very long time. Certainly there are always issues we can talk \nabout. The fact is we are moving forward on these issues. We are doing \nthe things that need to be done. Indeed, we should.\n  I am sometimes a little distressed that we seem to think the Federal \nGovernment is in charge of everything that affects our lives. That \nprobably is not the case. We are also dealing with a great deficit. Yet \nwe want to talk constantly about how we need more money for this and \nmore money for that, more money for all these things. We are in a \ncountry where we have several levels of government. There ought to be \nsome division of responsibility. That is our system. We should have \nsomewhat of a limited Federal Government, we are not into every issue. \nIt is disappointing to hear that everything occurring to everyone is a \nresponsibility of the Federal Government.\n  We also ought to understand when we have some sort of effort to \nreduce taxes, that helps increase the economy. We have seen more \nrevenues when we have less taxes. The economy grows. There is more \ninvestment and we create jobs. Those are good things. Occasionally we \nought to talk about that.\n  I understand a person opposed to the administration wants to talk \nabout the bad stuff. I will primarily talk a little bit more about Iraq \nand the situation we are in there. It has been an issue for all of us, \nand tends to be something we are all very much concerned about. \nHowever, the discussions lately have changed somewhat. That is a good \nthing.\n  Almost no one is suggesting that U.S. troops ought to remain in Iraq \nforever. We hear all the views, people talking about this point of \nview, that point of view. But since the beginning, there was the notion \nthat we have a job to do, and as soon as that job is finished we need \nto get out. That is not a new topic.\n  I have to admit completing the job can be defined differently by \ndifferent people. However, the fact is almost everyone at the same time \nsuggests that the troops need to remain in their current numbers until \nthe insurgency is suppressed. Most everyone agrees with that.\n  In the beginning, some of the folks in the House of Representatives \nwere making the point to get them out of there now, get them out in 6 \nmonths, but they have moderated that and are saying, yes, we need to \nchange what we are doing; we need to complete our job. We see more and \nmore people wanting to do that. The administration has been talking for \nsome time, of course, about reducing the number of troops in the \nprocess of doing that but not setting a date.\n  My point is it is interesting, and the media has something to do with \nthis, to try to show the differences, but the fact is there is quite a \nbit of similarity among the things that people are saying with regard \nto Iraq.\n  Few people agree with the idea of increasing the number of troops. \nThere is some talk about that. But that is not generally agreed to. Of \ncourse, almost no one agrees the troops ought to be pulled out \nimmediately at a certain time.\n  My point is there seems to be great differences between the critics \nand the administration. But when they look at it, everyone is pretty \nmuch on the same side. We need to finish our job, reduce our troops \nthere, turn it over to the Iraqis as soon as possible. The time to do \nthat, the way you do that, there is an area for difference, but that is \na common argument.\n  I am trying to say, finger-pointing aside, regarding the debate over \nwhether we should begin to gradually have a withdrawal of troops, there \nis no debate over that. How you do it, of course, there are different \nviews. There is no disagreement as to bringing the news into the \npolitical process. I think it is exciting that this week there will be \nan election and we will see what kind of bringing there is into that \nprocess.\n\n  So I guess I am kind of pleased that even though we have differences \nof view--and that is perfectly legitimate--I am finding there is less \ndifference in the policy between the people who have disagreement than \nthere might have been in the past.\n  Obviously, the war on terrorism is being fought overseas in \nAfghanistan and Iraq. Of course, fundamentally, it has changed the \nenvironment that has given rise to the Islamic extremism that brought \nabout the attacks, and so on. In a broad sense, that is exactly why we \nare there. It is one to bring justice back to the perpetrators, but \nalso to change the conditions in the Middle East. I think that \nbasically is beginning to happen: the introduction of a stable \ndemocracy and freedom, a democracy that is shaped on the basis of what \nIraqis want. We are not imposing on them the same kind of system we \nhave here necessarily; for instance, that there has to be endless \ndiscussion on the floor. We are not saying that. There are great steps \nbeing made in deliberation there.\n\n[[Page S13438]]\n\n  I guess it has been a year and a half since I have been in Iraq, but \ncertainly I think some real progress has been made. I felt as if there \nhad been great progress when I was there. And as to the polls, in the \npreliminary election, ABC News shows that three-fourths of the Iraqi \npeople express confidence in these elections. That is good and 70 \npercent approve of the new Iraqi constitution. In a country that has \nnever done those kinds of things before, that is an excellent movement.\n  We are talking about positive things, which does not mean everything \nis great, of course. But it does mean we are moving forward, and there \nis an unmistakable shift from tyranny to democracy that is taking \nplace.\n  As to the Iraqi forces, we all want them to shoulder a greater share \nof security efforts. In fact, that is happening. Now, I am also one who \nbelieves the system we have used, the military system, has to change as \nthe situation changes. It was one kind of a military opportunity to be \nmoving into Iraq to get rid of Saddam, and having troop movements, \nroutine, normal military activities. Now the time has changed.\n  I was very impressed with the conversation I had with a police \nofficer from Cheyenne, WY, who was there on a contract to help train \npolice who said: That has all changed now. Instead of having platoons \nand companies moving around, we are having two or three insurgents over \nhere, and we need more of a police kind of a system rather than a \nlarger military system. I think certainly that is true.\n  And the Iraqis are moving forward. There are now 97 Iraqi army \nbattalions conducting operations. Thirty-three Iraqi army battalions \nhave assumed their own areas of responsibility. This is a good thing. \nThe Iraqi navy is guarding its coastline and protecting offshore oil \nplatforms. The Iraqi air force is moving supplies throughout the \ncountry. Iraqi border police are manning 170 border forts and 22 ports \nof entry.\n  Certainly, there is a lot to do yet, probably more in the support--\nthe supply support, the management from the background--as there is in \nbeing on the front lines as far as the military of the United States is \nconcerned. I hope and think that movement and that change of role is \nindeed taking place. There are some 68,000 police who are there. So we \nare making some progress.\n  Again, some time ago, when I was there, I was real pleased. We would \ngo down the road in a military vehicle and all the little kids would be \nwaving their arms. We went to some schools. We went to some hospitals.\n  Now we are getting a report that 762 out of 834 schools are back in \nplace. That is a good move--not complete, of course, not perfect. It is \nalso reported that 12 out of 29 hospitals are back in place; 5 out of \n12 major airports are functioning. So there is a great deal going on. \nIt is reported that 144 out of 222 water treatment stations are \nfunctioning. There is still work to do, but, nevertheless, a \nsubstantial amount of work has been done.\n  So the fact is, of course, the road from tyranny to freedom is not an \neasy process. It is a process that we have not always experienced in \nthe past. So as we see new challenges, then we have to face them in \ndifferent ways. Having been in the military, I know sometimes it is \ndifficult to sort of change the methods the military is accustomed and \ntrained to do. But these are different sorts of challenges. I am very \nproud of the military in doing what they have done.\n  The al-Qaida terrorist leader has indicated that Iraq is a central \nbattlefield for this war, certainly in terms of terrorism. And our \npeople continue, of course, to do well in spite of the deadly \ninsurgency. That is a tough thing. The insurgency is just people coming \nout of nowhere with bombs, roadside bombs in cars.\n  So I guess really what I am trying to say is there is good evidence \nthat things are going well--not as well as you would like, obviously. \nThere are improvements being made. We are moving towards our goal. The \ngoal is to be able to turn this back over to the Iraqis, to return our \nfolks home as soon as possible. Everyone agrees with that: as soon as \npossible. There is always room for disagreement as to what is \nnecessary, of course, to be able to do that.\n  But despite the naysayers we hear here, the Iraqis are generally \noptimistic. A recent ABC News poll showed that 70 percent of Iraqis \nsampled said life in Iraq was ``good.'' So in addition to that, of \ncourse, the actions that are being taken are being felt in Egypt, \nLibya, Lebanon, Kuwait, and Saudi Arabia. So we are having some sort of \nan impact in that whole Middle East area, which is, of course, what we \nhad hoped to be able to do.\n  So these are some of the things that are happening there. I think \nthere is a surprising amount of optimism about the living conditions \nimproving. Time magazine and others did some analysis and showed living \nconditions were rated positively for 7 out of 10 Iraqis. I presume that \nis a legitimate sort of sample. At any rate, it certainly sounds so. \nAverage household income has soared some 60 percent in the last 20 \nmonths. It is only $263, but nevertheless that is substantially more \nthan they had.\n  So in any event, we have a challenge yet before us. I think there is \nincreasing recognition that we are there until our job is finished; \nthat our job is to turn it over to the Iraqis; that we ought to indeed \nmove and continue to move towards doing that as soon as we can; that \nthe reduction of our troops, as soon as possible, is the goal of all of \nus. I think the change in the role certainly is a goal as well. And \nthat, too, is happening.\n  So I guess the bottom line of what I have read here and what I am \nsaying is that even though, for various reasons, it seems as if there \nis a great difference, I think you can see, as you hear about the \ndifference in the parties here, and so on, that there is not that kind \nof a spread. Sure, there is room for discussion. But the fact is, the \nmajority of people here want to stay until the job is done. The \nmajority wants to turn it over to the Iraqis. The majority wants to \nremove our folks as soon as we can. And that includes the \nadministration and the folks in opposition.\n  So that is a good sign that we are moving forward. And I hope \ncertainly we can continue to do that, we can continue to support our \ngoal there and, maybe more importantly, support our men and women who \nare there committed to carrying out this goal and to helping provide \nfreedom around the world and to protect freedom in our country.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I have sought recognition to describe the \nconference report on the PATRIOT Act, which was agreed to by conferees \nin the House of Representatives and the Senate last Thursday. This is \nthe first time the Senate has been in session since that time, and the \nfirst opportunity for me to make a floor statement outlining the \nprovisions of the conference report.\n  I begin by thanking the distinguished chairman of the House Judiciary \nCommittee, Congressman James Sensenbrenner, for his cooperation and \ncordiality in working through many very difficult issues to come to \nagreement between the House and Senate conferees.\n  There has been general agreement that reauthorization of the PATRIOT \nAct is necessary as an important tool in the fight against terrorism. \nOne item which the PATRIOT Act accomplished, which was enacted shortly \nafter 3,000 Americans were killed and many wounded on 9/11, was \nelimination of the so-called wall, so that evidence gathered under the \nForeign Intelligence Surveillance Act could be used in a criminal \nprosecution. Prior to the enactment of that provision, if there was \nevidence obtained under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, \nwhich has a slightly lesser standard than probable cause used for a \ncriminal search warrant, it could not be used for a criminal case. \nThere is no disagreement, to my knowledge, with the proposition that \nthis provision is very important and ought to be retained.\n\n[[Page S13439]]\n\n  Similarly, other provisions of the PATRIOT Act have been conceded to \nbe important: the provisions on obtaining records, the provisions on \nwiretaps--although subject to some limitations, and I voted against \nthat provision when the bill was up shortly after the 9/11 attacks in \n2001--and provisions on delayed notice warrants. And there are many \nprovisions which there has been general agreement ought to be retained.\n  There have been questions raised, and appropriately so, about the \nsweep of the PATRIOT Act and whether it could accomplish its designed \npurposes while providing more protection for civil rights and civil \nliberties. A good bit of the public debate--most of the public debate--\nhas been focused on those provisions. The conference report makes vast \nimprovements on existing law on items such as obtaining business \nrecords, the so-called library record provision; on the delayed notice \nprovisions; and on roving wiretaps. There are limitations now imposed \non national security letters, which have been in effect for decades. \nThey were not created by the PATRIOT Act, but the reauthorization of \nthe PATRIOT Act has provided a forum for reconsideration of the way \nnational security letters are used and to provide safeguards for civil \nliberties.\n  The principal concern expressed publicly about the PATRIOT Act is the \nability of law enforcement to obtain business records--it has been \ncommonly referred to as the ``library records provision.'' There is \ngreat concern about obtaining somebody's library records by an agent \nunilaterally, who makes the certification that the records are sought \nfor an investigation, and the agent on his or her own goes and obtains \nthe records. The conference report is a vast improvement on existing \nlaw because the conference report imposes judicial review, not quite up \nto the standard of probable cause for a search and seizure warrant or \nprobable cause for an arrest warrant but cause shown.\n  The statute provides that the court may issue an order for records \nonly on ``a statement of facts showing that there are reasonable \ngrounds to believe that the tangible things sought are relevant to an \nauthorized investigation to protect against international terrorism.''\n  Having judicial intervention between the assertions of the law \nenforcement officer and the invasion of privacy to get these records is \nthe common law standard; that is, the American way of protecting civil \nliberties. So the impartial magistrate is interposed between the police \nand law enforcement official and the citizen.\n  The Senate bill provided that relevance would be established only on \na showing one of three things:\n  No. 1, that the records pertain to ``a foreign power or an agent of a \nforeign power; two, the activities of a suspected agent of a foreign \npower who is the subject of an authorized investigation; or three, an \nindividual in contact with or known to a suspected agent of a foreign \npower.''\n  The conference report makes an important change to the standard from \nthe Senate bill. This change was made after a closed-door briefing with \nthe Department of Justice was able to show strong reasons to allow the \njudge to authorize obtaining records where one of those three \nconditions had not been met, where there was a terrorism investigation \nunderway, and those records were crucial to moving ahead with that \nterrorism investigation.\n  I believe, while it would be preferable to have the Senate version, \nthat this provision is reasonable and realistic and is certainly not a \nsubstantial basis, not really any basis at all, for rejecting the \nconference report.\n  The next most highly publicized concern has been on the so-called \nnational security letter. I repeat, the national security letter was \nnot created by the PATRIOT Act passed shortly after 9/11 but has been \nan investigative tool for decades. Under current law, there is no \nexplicit right on the part of someone who has been served with a \nnational security letter to do anything about it except to comply. The \nconclusion has been reached that the recipient may not make a \ndisclosure of that national security letter.\n  The conference report is a vast improvement. I have used the word \n``vast'' repeatedly because it makes a very extensive improvement by \nenabling the recipient to go to a lawyer. It explicitly says you can go \nto your lawyer and you can challenge the national security letter and \nyou can go to court. You can have the national security letter quashed \nif it is unreasonable, oppressive, or otherwise contrary to law. When \nyou go to court, you can get permission to tell the target of the \nnational security letter about the national security letter, if the \njudge finds that doing so would not harm national security, interfere \nwith an investigation or diplomatic relations, or risk death or bodily \ninjury to another person.\n  The judicial review is somewhat limited in that there is a \npresumption that the certification by high-ranking officials of the \nDepartment of Justice or the FBI or the requesting agency will be \nconclusive on whether the disclosure will be harmful to national \nsecurity or diplomatic relations.\n  What was not understood, really misunderstood, during the course of \nthe deliberation in the conference, was that the Senate bill, which was \nwidely heralded as being a remarkably good bill, agreed to by all 18 \nmembers of the Judiciary Committee--and it is very unusual to have the \nJudiciary Committee agree unanimously on anything, let alone on a \nmatter of civil rights, but that was done. Then, when the bill was \nforwarded to the floor, it went on our so-called unanimous consent \ncalendar, which means it was passed by unanimous consent without any \nfloor debate. It is highly unusual and perhaps unprecedented on a bill \nof this magnitude to be on the unanimous consent calendar because \npeople all thought it was fine. That requires the absence of an \nobjection. Any one Senator can prevent it going on to the unanimous \nconsent calendar. That means 100 Senators have to in effect have \nacquiesced.\n  The provision in the Senate bill was that ``in reviewing a \nnondisclosure requirement, a certification by the government that the \ndisclosure may endanger the national security of the United States or \ninterfere with diplomatic relations will be treated as conclusive \nunless the court finds that the certification was made in bad faith.''\n  As I said before, it was misunderstood and not noted by the conferees \nas to that provision in the Senate bill which drew only praise, not an \nobjection. But there was an objection raised to a provision in the \nconference report which is more protective of civil liberties than that \nwhich was in the Senate report.\n  The conference report specifies ``if at the time of the petition, the \nAttorney General, the Deputy Attorney General, an Assistant Attorney \nGeneral, or the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, or in \nthe case of a request by a department agency, or instrumentality of the \nFederal Government other than the Department of Justice, the head or \ndeputy head of such department, agency, or instrumentality''--here \ncomes the critical language--``certifies that disclosure may endanger \nthe national security of the United States or interfere with diplomatic \nrelations, such certification shall be treated as conclusive unless the \ncourt finds that the certification was made in bad faith.''\n  So the conference report is more protective of civil rights than was \nthe Senate bill, which was so widely praised, because in the Senate \nbill you had to have a certification by the Government, which means any \nagent of the Government. But in the conference report, it was ratcheted \nup to require certification by these high-ranking officials, such as \nthe Attorney General or the head of the FBI or the department heads or \nAssistant Attorneys General, all of whom are subject to Senate \nconfirmation.\n  I think, had the misconception not prevailed about the presence of \nthat provision in the Senate bill, our conference would have been a lot \nshorter, and I think it fair to say, not with absolute certainty but \nfair to say, it would have had more signatures on the conference \nreport.\n  But in any event, the conference report gives much more by way of \nprotection of civil liberties than is present under existing law.\n  The third issue which was taken up to enhance the protection of civil \nliberties is the delayed notice provision, or the so-called ``sneak and \npeek provision.'' This involves a situation where\n\n[[Page S13440]]\n\nthere would be a warrant to search someone's house or apartment \nsurreptitiously; that is, without giving notice to the individual.\n  Under existing law, under the PATRIOT Act, the Government must notify \nthe individual within a reasonable period of time. Reasonable has no \ndefinitive limit, is vague and indefinite; it is open to very wide \ninterpretation as to what constitutes reasonable. The conference report \nimposes a maximum time limit of 30 days, which can be extended on cause \nshown if certain specific criteria were met.\n  The Senate bill had a 7-day notice requirement. The House bill had a \n180-day requirement, and the compromise was 30 days. So most of the \nprovisions of the Senate bill or most of the substance of the Senate \nbill was agreed to. Now you have a set time limit, unless cause is \nshown to extend it; again, what I would characterize fairly as a vast \nimprovement. Then there are provisions under the roving wiretap laws. I \nhave always been concerned about the intrusion of privacy under \nwiretaps. In my days as district attorney, I was the sole district \nattorney among the 67 Pennsylvania counties to oppose legislation on \nwiretaps. When the PATRIOT bill came to the Senate shortly after \nSeptember 11, I was one of the few Senators who voted against the \nwiretap provision.\n\n  Law enforcement has made a case in support of a roving wiretap and \nthe PATRIOT Act conference report protects civil liberties additionally \nby requiring that there be an identification of the individual, a \ndescription, and that there be a showing that the individual will seek \nto try to evade detection of the wiretap so that on that provision, as \nwell, there is an enhancement of civil liberties.\n  Perhaps the most contentious issue that was taken up by the \nconference was the issue of the sunset. The House of Representatives \nasked for a sunset of 10 years in their bill. The Senate bill has a \nsunset of 4 years. The House proposed, in a very forceful way, a \ncompromise at 7 years, splitting the difference. The sunset provision \nis very important because all of the provisions of the PATRIOT Act \nexpire at the end of the sunset unless there is a renewal. This puts \nlaw enforcement on notice that there will be oversight by the Judiciary \nCommittees of both Houses, and the Senate Judiciary Committee has been \nvery diligent on oversight and is committed to extensive oversight on \nthis bill however it comes out.\n  There were very long, detailed, extensive negotiations. I thank the \nWhite House. I thank the President, who was personally acquainted with \nthis issue. I had the opportunity to travel with him to Philadelphia \nearlier today where he made a speech about Iraq. He said to me, it was \nmy expectation if we fulfilled your request for assistance on getting a \n4-year sunset, there would be a little more receptivity for the bill. I \nam paraphrasing what was involved. This issue went to the highest level \nof the Federal Government. We had tremendous assistance from the White \nHouse on the sunset provision. Not only was the President conversant \nwith it, as I have stated, but the Vice President was involved in the \nnegotiations, the Chief of Staff, Andrew Card, whom I talked to on a \nnumber of occasions, and others in the White House. This 4-year sunset \nis a major, major, major improvement for civil liberties interests in \nthat these provisions will be in existence not for 10 years, 7 years, \n6, 5, but only for 4 years.\n  In essence, we have a bill which is not perfect. I don't know that we \ndeal in perfection in the legislative process. The whole art of \npolitics and legislation is the art of accommodation, conciliation, and \ncompromise, which is a worthwhile concept. That is the way we work in a \ndemocracy. No one gets their way entirely.\n  If I had my preference, we would have taken the Senate bill lock, \nstock, and barrel, and that would have been it. But we have a bicameral \nlegislature and considerations and issues raised by the House of \nRepresentatives, I think again, are fairly raised and fairly stated. I \nexplicitly compliment Chairman Sensenbrenner for his cooperation and \nhis good work on this bill.\n  That is, believe it or not, a somewhat abbreviated version of this \nlegislation, this complex legislation.\n  We had a letter from six of our colleagues--Senator Craig, Senator \nSununu, Senator Murkowski, Senator Durbin, Senator Feingold, Senator \nSalazar--and I ask unanimous consent that a copy of their letter to me \nand a copy of my letter to them be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                                   Committee on the Judiciary,\n\n                                Washington, DC, November 17, 2005.\n     Hon. Arlen Specter,\n     Chairman, U.S. Senate Committee on the Judiciary, Dirksen \n         Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Patrick Leahy,\n     Ranking Member, U.S. Senate Committee on the Judiciary, \n         Dirksen Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Pat Roberts,\n     Chairman, U.S. Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, Hart \n         Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. John D. Rockefeller IV,\n     Ranking Member, U.S. Senate Select Committee on Intel1igence, \n         Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Specter, Chairman Roberts, Ranking Member \n     Leahy, and Ranking Member Rockefeller: We write to express \n     our deep concern about the draft Patriot Act reauthorization \n     conference report made available to us early this afternoon. \n     As you know, the Senate version of the bill, passed by \n     unanimous consent in July, was itself a compromise that \n     resulted from intense negotiations by Senators from all sides \n     of the partisan and ideological divides. Unfortunately, the \n     conference committee draft retreats significantly from the \n     bipartisan consensus we reached in the Senate. It does not \n     accomplish what we and many of our colleagues in the Senate \n     believe is necessary--a reauthorization bill that continues \n     to provide law enforcement with the tools to investigate \n     possible terrorist activity while making reasonable changes \n     to the original law to protect innocent people from \n     unnecessary and intrusive government surveillance.\n       To support this bill, we would need to see significant \n     movement back toward the Senate position in the following \n     areas:\n\n\n                             1. Section 215\n\n       The draft conference report would allow the government to \n     obtain sensitive personal information on a mere showing of \n     relevance. This would allow government fishing expeditions. \n     As business groups like the U.S. Chamber of Commerce have \n     argued, the government should be required to convince a judge \n     that the records they are seeking have some connection to a \n     suspected terrorist or spy.\n       The draft conference report does not permit the recipient \n     of a Section 215 order to challenge its automatic, permanent \n     gag order. Courts have held that similar restrictions violate \n     the First Amendment. The recipient of a Section 215 order is \n     entitled to meaningful judicial review of the gag order.\n\n\n                      2. National Security Letters\n\n       The draft conference report does not provide meaningful \n     judicial review of an NSL's gag order. It requires the court \n     to accept as conclusive the government's assertion that a gag \n     order should not be lifted, unless the court determines the \n     government is acting in bad faith. The recipients of NSLs are \n     entitled to meaningful judicial review of a gag order.\n       The draft conference report makes it a crime, punishable by \n     up to one year in prison, for individuals to disclose that \n     they have received an NSL, even if they believe their rights \n     have been violated. Violating an NSL gag order should only be \n     a crime if the NSL recipient intends to obstruct justice.\n\n\n                               3. Sunsets\n\n       The draft conference report includes seven-year sunsets, \n     which are too long. Congress should have the opportunity to \n     again review the controversial provisions of the Patriot Act \n     before the final year of the next presidential term. Four-\n     year sunsets would ensure accountability and effective \n     oversight.\n       The draft conference report does not sunset the NSL \n     authority. In light of recent revelations about possible \n     abuses of NSLs, the NSL provision should sunset in no more \n     than four years so that Congress will have an opportunity to \n     review the use of this power.\n\n\n                       4. Sneak and Peek Warrants\n\n       The draft conference report requires the government to \n     notify the target of a ``sneak and peek'' search no earlier \n     than 30 days after the search, rather than within seven days, \n     as the Senate bill provides and as pre-Patriot Act judicial \n     decisions required. The conference report should include a \n     presumption that notice will be provided within a \n     significantly shorter period in order to better protect \n     Fourth Amendment rights. The availability of additional 90-\n     day extensions means that a shorter initial time frame should \n     not be a hardship on the government.\n       For the past several years, our bipartisan coalition has \n     been working together to highlight and fix the civil \n     liberties problems posed by the Patriot Act. We introduced \n     the SAFE Act to address those problems, while still \n     maintaining important law enforcement powers needed to combat \n     terrorism. We cannot support a conference report that would \n     eliminate the modest protections for civil liberties that \n     were agreed to unanimously in the Senate.\n\n[[Page S13441]]\n\n       The conference report, in its current form, is \n     unacceptable. We hope that you, as members of the conference \n     committee, will consider making the changes set forth above. \n     If further changes are not made; we will work to stop this \n     bill from becoming law. Thank you for your consideration.\n           Sincerely,\n     Larry E. Craig.\n     John E.

Larry E. Craig.\n     Hon. John E. Sununu.\n     Hon. Lisa Murkowski.\n     Hon. Richard J. Durbin.\n     Hon. Russell D. Feingold.\n     Hon. Ken Salazar.\n       Dear Colleagues: I am in receipt of your November 17 letter \n     outlining your concerns about the draft Conference Report \n     reauthorizing the USA PATRIOT Act. My purpose in writing is \n     to explain how the final Conference Report addresses the \n     issues you have identified; or, where the issues are not \n     addressed, to explain why I am nonetheless comfortable with \n     the bill. Ultimately, my aim is to demonstrate to you that \n     the bill is one civil libertarians can, and should, embrace.\n       Addressing each of your concerns in turn:\n\n\n                             1. section 215\n\n       The draft Conference Report would allow the government to \n     obtain sensitive personal information on a mere showing of \n     relevance. This would allow government fishing expeditions. \n     As business groups like the U.S. Chamber of Commerce have \n     argued, the government should be required to convince a judge \n     that the records they are seeking have some connection to a \n     suspected terrorist or spy.\n       Although the Conference Report does authorize the FISA \n     court in certain narrow circumstances to issue an order under \n     Section 215 upon a showing of relevance, I respectfully \n     disagree that the result is a provision more open to abuse. \n     In fact, the additional protections we have obtained in the \n     Conference Report make Section 215 unquestionably more \n     protective of civil liberties and privacy rights than current \n     law, and likely even more protective of those rights than the \n     Senate bill.\n       First, it is important not to overstate the significance of \n     the fact that the FISA court, in extraordinary circumstances \n     only, will allow a 215 order upon a showing of relevance to a \n     terrorism investigation. The relevance standard will apply \n     only in extraordinary circumstances because the Conference \n     Report channels all applications for Section 215 orders into \n     the three categories delineated in the Senate bill. By \n     providing a presumption of relevance when the government can \n     demonstrate a connection to a suspected terrorist or spy, the \n     bill ensures that requests falling outside the three \n     categories will be the exception and not the rule. Indeed, \n     the presumption ensures that law enforcement will face an \n     uphill battle in any effort to obtain a 215 order that does \n     not fall into one of the three categories and thereby \n     provides an incentive for the FBI to use the tool only when \n     it can show a connection to a suspected terrorist or spy. \n     Some flexibility was necessary because the Justice Department \n     was able to demonstrate, in a classified setting, that \n     circumstances arise in which it is necessary to obtain an \n     individual's records in an authorized investigation in which \n     it is not possible to demonstrate that the individual is \n     working on behalf of a foreign power or a known terrorist \n     organization.\n       In addition, the Conference Report includes a number of \n     safeguards against abuse of Section 215 that neither the \n     Senate bill nor the House bill contained. First, the \n     Conference Report would require a comprehensive audit by the \n     Justice Department's famously independent Inspector General \n     of law enforcement's use of Section 215. The Inspector \n     General's reports will examine the use of Section 215 both \n     before and after reauthorization of the PATRIOT Act. Second, \n     the Conference Report would permit, for the first time, \n     public reporting of the total number of 215 orders sought and \n     granted. A third safeguard against the possibility of fishing \n     expeditions is the Conference Report's provision that Section \n     215 orders may not be used for the purpose of conducting \n     threat assessments. This requirement ensures that Section 215 \n     will be used only during those authorized investigations that \n     have progressed beyond the initial stages. A fourth new \n     safeguard is that every order under Section 215 will require \n     minimization procedures that sharply curtail the retention \n     and dissemination of information concerning United States \n     citizens. These minimization procedures will prevent the \n     government from stockpiling information on American citizens \n     or from maintaining records on citizens who are only \n     incidental to the investigation.\n       Finally, it is important to point out that the conferees \n     obtained all of these additional protections without \n     sacrificing the critical improvements over the current \n     Section 215 that made the Senate's PATRIOT bill attractive to \n     so many: (1) the requirement of a statement of facts to \n     accompany an application for an order under Section 215; (2) \n     the express vesting of discretion in the FISA judge to \n     review, and to reject, the FBI's application for a 215 order; \n     (3) the express right of recipients to consult legal counsel \n     and seek judicial review of 215 orders; (4) the requirement \n     of approval by senior FBI officials before the government can \n     seek library records, medical records, educational records, \n     gun records, and other sensitive documents; (5) the enhanced \n     reporting to Congress on the use of Section 215, including \n     specific information concerning requests for the most \n     sensitive documents; (6) the requirement that 215 orders can \n     compel the production only of those tangible things that \n     could be obtained under a grand jury subpoena or other orders \n     issued by federal courts; and (7) the inclusion of a four-\n     year sunset provision to guarantee that Congress will revisit \n     Section 215 at a later time.\n       The draft Conference Report does not permit the recipient \n     of a Section 215 order to challenge its automatic, permanent \n     gag order. Courts have held that similar restrictions violate \n     the First Amendment. The recipient of a Section 215 order is \n     entitled to meaningful judicial review of the gag order.\n       After extensive discussion of this issue by the conferees, \n     I was able to conclude that the statutory scheme that the \n     Conference Report establishes would permit adequate judicial \n     review of the nondisclosure requirement.\n       Primarily, this review occurs because an order under \n     Section 215 cannot issue without advance approval by the FISA \n     court. This review is not only important as a practical \n     matter, in that it guarantees judicial scrutiny of the \n     confidentiality provision in each 215 order; but it could \n     well prove dispositive in any First Amendment challenge. In \n     fact, one federal court that invalidated the nondisclosure \n     requirement of an NSL on First Amendment grounds specifically \n     singled out the absence of explicit judicial review in the \n     present law as the principal reason the regime governing \n     nondisclosure of orders under Section 215 was preferable. Doe \n     v. Ashcroft, 334 F. Supp. 2d 471, 515 (S.D.N.Y. 2004) \n     (``Furthermore, these provisions are not quite as severe as \n     those contained in the NSL statutes because, with one narrow \n     exception for certain FISA surveillance orders [that is not \n     relevant here], they apply in contexts in which a court \n     authorizes the investigative method in the first place.''); \n     cf Doe v. Gonzales, 386 F. Supp. 2d 66, 80 (D. Conn. 2005) \n     (criticizing the law governing NSLs on First Amendment \n     grounds because it ``provides no judicial review of the NSL \n     or the need for its non-disclosure provision'').\n\n\n                      2. national security letters\n\n       The draft Conference Report does not provide meaningful \n     judicial review of an NSL's gag order. It requires the court \n     to accept as conclusive the government's assertion that a gag \n     order should not be lifted, unless the court determines the \n     government is acting in bad faith. The recipients of NSLs are \n     entitled to meaningful judicial review of a gag order.\n       As an initial matter, the ability to challenge the issuance \n     of an NSL remains the same as that necessary for challenging \n     a grand jury subpoena. A party challenging an NSL may be \n     successful if it is shown that compliance with the NSL would \n     be unreasonable, oppressive, or otherwise in violation of the \n     law. The provision at issue relates only to the question of \n     whether the recipient of the NSL may disclose that fact. In \n     that situation, the deference a court must show to the \n     government is not nearly as broad as stated. Specifically, \n     the court is required to treat a government certification \n     with deference only when the government asserts that removing \n     the nondisclosure requirement would endanger the national \n     security of the United States or interfere with diplomatic \n     relations. Even so, the court is able to invalidate the \n     nondisclosure requirement in the event the government acts in \n     ``bad faith.'' In all other circumstances, the Conference \n     Report makes no provision for any special deference to the \n     government.\n       Furthermore, it is important to note that substantively \n     identical language was included in the Senate bill, which \n     passed this body by unanimous consent. See S. 1389 \n     Sec. 8(b)(2) (``In reviewing a nondisclosure requirement, the \n     certification by the Government that the disclosure may \n     endanger the national security of the United States or \n     interfere with diplomatic relations shall be treated as \n     conclusive unless the court finds that the certification was \n     made in bad faith.''); see also H.R. 3199 Sec. 16.\n       The conference adopted an important additional safeguard \n     ensuring that the presumption will be used only sparingly. \n     Under the Conference Report, the Attorney General, the Deputy \n     Attorney General, an Assistant Attorney General, the Director \n     of the FBI, or an official of similar stature in another \n     agency must personally make the requisite certification in \n     order to obtain the conclusive presumption. This is in \n     contrast to the House bill, which allowed this certification \n     to be made by the Special Agent in Charge of any one of the \n     FBI's 56 field offices, and the Senate bill, which provided \n     for certification by ``the Government,'' generally. In light \n     of this additional safeguard over and above what was in \n     either bill, as well as additional public reporting and \n     Inspector General reports concerning NSLs, my hope is that \n     this provision will not prevent you from supporting the \n     Conference Report.\n       The draft Conference Report makes it a crime, punishable by \n     up to one year in prison, for individuals to disclose that \n     they have received an NSL, even if they believe their rights \n     have been violated. Violating an NSL gag order should only be \n     a crime if the NSL recipient intends to obstruct justice.\n\n[[Page S13442]]\n\n       The final Conference Report addresses this concern in full. \n     After intense negotiations involving various Senators and \n     House Members and the Senate and House leadership, the one-\n     year misdemeanor for knowing and disclosure of an NSL was \n     struck from the bill. Consistent with your request, violation \n     of the NSL nondisclosure provision is only a crime if the NSL \n     recipient intends to obstruct justice.\n       At the same time, I did want to take the opportunity to \n     clarify some facts about the NSL nondisclosure requirement, \n     which will not have the onerous impact on individual rights \n     that is implied. First, in contrast to current law, NSLs will \n     not automatically carry an injunction against disclosure; it \n     is only when the government certifies that disclosure may \n     result in a danger to national security or to the physical \n     safety of an individual, or in interference with an \n     investigation or diplomatic relations, that confidentiality \n     is even on the table. Second, the Conference Report \n     explicitly provides that individuals can disclose the \n     existence of the NSL both to those to whom such disclosure is \n     necessary to comply with the request and, critically, to an \n     attorney ``to obtain legal advice or legal assistance with \n     respect to the request.'' Thus, an individual who believes \n     her rights have been violated will be able to consult counsel \n     to explore her options for redressing any grievance. Third, \n     and also in contrast to current law, the Conference Report \n     includes a detailed mechanism for judicial review of the \n     nondisclosure requirement. The end result is that any \n     individual whose rights may have in fact been violated \n     will have a forum in which to petition for relief.\n\n\n                               3. sunsets\n\n       The draft Conference Report includes seven-year sunsets, \n     which are too long. Congress should have the opportunity to \n     again review the controversial provisions of the Patriot Act \n     before the final year of the next presidential term. Four-\n     year sunsets would ensure accountability and effective \n     oversight.\n       The final Conference Report addresses this concern in full. \n     After intense negotiations involving various Senators and \n     House Members, the Senate and House leadership, and the \n     Administration, the seven-year sunsets were reduced to four \n     years.\n       In addition, Section 106A of the Conference Report, which \n     does not have an analogue in either bill and was generated \n     during the conference, provides that the Inspector General of \n     the Department of Justice will conduct two comprehensive \n     audits of the use of Section 215. Together with the sunsets, \n     these provisions go farther than even the Senate bill did in \n     ensuring that the Justice Department is fully accountable for \n     its use of Section 215. The Inspector General is known, \n     justifiably, for his thorough, independent-minded, and hard-\n     hitting reports, so there is every reason to think that these \n     inquiries will be an effective check on the Justice \n     Department. Moreover, the release of each report will be \n     occasion for front-page news stories, Congressional \n     briefings, and public hearings--all of which will generate \n     fresh political will and opportunity to rectify any \n     problematic aspects of Section 215.\n       The draft Conference Report does not sunset the NSL \n     authority. In light of recent revelations about possible \n     abuses of NSLs, the NSL provision should sunset in no more \n     than four years so that Congress will have an opportunity to \n     review the use of this power.\n       NSLs have been used since at least the 1970s. No evidence \n     exists suggesting their use has ever been abused, nor until \n     now has anyone requested NSLs be subject to a sunset. Neither \n     the House nor the unanimously passed Senate bill contained a \n     sunset provision for NSLs. Nevertheless, the Conference \n     Report contains new accountability provisions and creates \n     additional opportunities for oversight. As with Section 215, \n     the Conference Report requires audits by the Inspector \n     General of law enforcement's use of NSLs. Section 119 of the \n     Conference Report, which was generated during the conference, \n     requires two such comprehensive audits. These audits should \n     have much the same effect as a sunset.\n       Despite recent press reports, there is no evidence that \n     NSLs have been abused. Much of the relevant information about \n     NSLs is classified, so any individual news story will \n     understandably omit critical information that is available to \n     lawmakers. Thus, I strongly encourage you or your staff to \n     contact the Intelligence Committee if you are interested in \n     the complete picture concerning the use of NSLs. I think you \n     will be satisfied, as I was, that the media coverage vastly \n     overstates any such ``problems.''\n\n\n                       4. sneak and peek warrants\n\n       The draft Conference Report requires the government to \n     notify the target of a ``sneak and peek'' search no earlier \n     than 30 days after the search, rather than within seven days, \n     as the Senate bill provides and as pre-Patriot Act judicial \n     decisions required. The Conference Report should include a \n     presumption that notice will be provided within a \n     significantly shorter period in order to better protect \n     Fourth Amendment rights. The availability of additional 90-\n     day extensions means that a shorter initial time frame should \n     not be a hardship on the government.\n       As you know, I was able to include in the Senate bill a 7-\n     day limit on the period in which notice can be delayed in \n     delayed-notice search warrants. The House bill, of course, \n     adopted a limit of 180 days, and the House was insistent on \n     not going any lower than 90 days--a period that, it was \n     argued, is consistent with the analogous limit for Title III \n     wiretaps. Moreover, while it is true that the Second Circuit \n     indicated that 7 days was a presumptively reasonable period \n     of delay, the Fourth Circuit countenanced an initial delay of \n     45 days. Still, my twin objectives in conference were to \n     retain a shortened delay period and to mitigate the \n     significant problem of courts permitting open-ended \n     notification delays.\n       The Conference Report provides that the maximum period for \n     which notice can initially be delayed is 30 days. Although \n     this period is a few weeks longer than the 7-day time limit \n     from the Senate bill, it is considerably shorter than the 180 \n     days permitted in the House bill and is a significant \n     improvement over the original PATRIOT Act, which included no \n     limits on the period of delay other than what was \n     ``reasonable.'' We were also able to eliminate the \n     possibility of open-ended delays by mandating that \n     notification occur on a date certain. In addition, the \n     Conference Report preserves from the Senate bill both public \n     reporting provisions and the requirement that extensions of \n     the delay period be granted only upon an updated showing of \n     the need for further delay.\n       Finally, it is important to be mindful of the very limited \n     scope of this issue. Even in the national emergency following \n     September 11, 2001, delayed-notice searches were exceedingly \n     rare. Indeed, the Justice Department has estimated that \n     delayed-notice warrants constituted less than one-fifth of \n     one percent of all search warrants executed by Department \n     components between enactment of the PATRIOT Act and January \n     31, 2005.\n       I appreciate the opportunity to explain my views regarding \n     the Conference Report, and I remain grateful for your \n     insights on these important issues. The Conference Report \n     goes far in achieving the aims of the original Senate bill; \n     namely, it permits law enforcement the necessary tools to \n     protect the country against terrorist acts while at the same \n     time safeguarding the civil liberties we all cherish. In \n     particular, what sets the Conference Report apart from even \n     the Senate bill is its detailed reporting requirements to \n     Congress and the public and its interposition of judicial \n     review on some of the more controversial provisions. \n     Requiring both detailed reporting and Inspector General \n     audits will enable the Congress, as well as the public, to \n     guard vigilantly against any possible governmental incursions \n     upon civil liberties.\n           Very truly yours,\n                                                    Arlen Specter.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. I ask unanimous consent that a copy of a ``Dear \nColleague'' letter circulated generally to all the Senators dated \nDecember 9, 2005, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                             United States Senate,\n\n\n                                   Committee on the Judiciary,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, December 9, 2005.\n       Dear Colleague: Upon the Senate's return during the week of \n     December 12th, we will be voting on the conference report \n     reauthorizing the USA PATRIOT Act. I write to seek your \n     support and to explain how the provisions of the conference \n     report retain the most important civil liberties and privacy \n     protections from the bill that passed the Senate and include \n     additional safeguards that emerged from the negotiations \n     between the House and Senate conferees. The conference report \n     retains the tools essential to law enforcement in fighting \n     international terrorism while significantly expanding \n     protections for civil liberties from the Act currently in \n     force.\n       Although the conference report contains many valuable \n     provisions, such as important protections for the nation's \n     seaports and mass transportation systems, as well as new \n     penalties to combat the growing problem with methamphetamine \n     abuse, I would like to focus on several of the more \n     contentious provisions of the PATRIOT Act itself.\n\n\n                     section 215: business records\n\n       The most controversial provision of the PATRIOT Act has \n     been Section 215, the so-called ``library records'' \n     provision. The conference report adds several safeguards to \n     prevent abuse of Section 215 that neither the Senate bill nor \n     the House bill contained. First, the conference report \n     requires a comprehensive audit by the Justice Department's \n     independent Inspector General of law enforcement use of \n     Section 215. Second, the conference report will permit, for \n     the first time, public reporting of the total number of 215 \n     orders sought and granted. A third safeguard is the \n     conference report's provision that Section 215 orders may not \n     be used merely for threat assessments. This requirement \n     ensures that Section 215 will be used only during those \n     authorized investigations that have progressed somewhat \n     beyond the initial stages. A fourth new safeguard is that \n     every order under Section 215 will require minimization \n     procedures that curtail the retention and dissemination of \n     information concerning United States citizens.\n       The conference report also retains key provisions from the \n     Senate bill: (1) the requirement of a statement of facts to \n     accompany an application for an order under Section 215; (2) \n     the express vesting of discretion in the FISA judge to \n     review, and to reject, the FBI's application for a 215 order; \n     (3) the express right of recipients to consult legal counsel \n     and seek judicial review of 215 orders; (4) the requirement \n     of approval by the\n\n[[Page S13443]]\n\n     FBI Director, Deputy Director, or Executive Assistant \n     Director for National Security before the government can seek \n     library records, medical records, or other sensitive \n     documents; (5) the enhanced reporting to Congress on the use \n     of Section 215, including specific information concerning \n     requests for the most sensitive documents; (6) \n     the requirement that 215 orders can compel the production \n     only of those tangible things that could be obtained under \n     a grand jury subpoena or other orders issued by federal \n     courts; and (7) the inclusion of a four-year sunset \n     provision to guarantee that Congress will revisit Section \n     215 at a later time.\n       The major difference between the Senate bill and the \n     conference report with respect to Section 215 is that the \n     conference report authorizes the FISA court in certain narrow \n     circumstances to issue a Section 215 order upon a showing of \n     relevance to an already authorized terrorism investigation \n     without a demonstration that the person's records being \n     requested is a known terrorist or acting on behalf of a \n     foreign power. The relevance standard will apply only in \n     extraordinary circumstances because the conference report is \n     set up so as to channel all applications for orders under \n     Section 215 into the three categories the Senate established \n     in its reauthorization bill. By establishing three \n     circumstances to demonstrate relevance when the government \n     shows a connection to a suspected terrorist or spy, the bill \n     ensures that requests falling outside the three categories \n     will be the exception and not the rule. Thus, the Senate \n     bill's three-part test remains a substantial safeguard in the \n     conference report.\n       Law enforcement will face an uphill battle in any effort to \n     obtain a 215 order that does not fall into one of the three \n     categories and thereby provides an incentive for the FBI to \n     use the tool only when it can show a connection to a \n     suspected terrorist or spy. This provision was deemed \n     necessary because the Department of Justice was able, in a \n     classified setting, to demonstrate that circumstances may \n     exist in which an individual may not be known to a foreign \n     power or be a recognized terrorist but may nevertheless be \n     crucial to an authorized terrorism investigation.\n\n\n                       national security letters\n\n       The conference report also makes important changes to the \n     laws governing National Security Letters (NSLs), which the \n     FBI has used for several decades to request communications \n     records and financial information from third parties in \n     intelligence and terrorism cases. First and foremost, the \n     conference report makes explicit the right of NSL recipients \n     to ask a court to set aside the requirement to turn over \n     information as well as the requirement to keep the request \n     for information confidential. This is in stark contrast to \n     current law, which affords no such explicit right. Second, in \n     a protection analogous to one provided for Section 215, the \n     conference report requires the Justice Department's Inspector \n     General to audit the FBI's use of NSLs. Finally, the \n     conference report significantly enhances reporting to \n     Congress and requires an annual public report on the FBI's \n     use of NSLs. These reporting requirements enable both \n     Congress, and the public, to ensure that NSLs are not being \n     abused.\n\n\n                  section 213: delayed-notice warrants\n\n       The conference report has retained the important \n     protections from the Senate bill's amendments to Section 213 \n     of the PATRIOT Act, which authorizes warrants allowing the \n     government to wait a number of days after the search before \n     notifying the target. The conference report requires that a \n     target be notified within 30 days of the search, unless the \n     facts of the case justify a later date. Although this period \n     is longer than the 7-day time limit from the Senate bill, it \n     is considerably shorter than the 180 days permitted in the \n     House bill and is a significant improvement over the original \n     PATRIOT Act, which imposes no limits on the period of delay \n     beyond what is ``reasonable.'' And, like the Senate bill, the \n     conference report permits extensions of the delay period only \n     upon an updated showing of the need for further delay. As in \n     the Senate bill, these extensions are limited to 90 days, \n     unless the facts justify a longer delay. Finally, and again \n     like the Senate bill, the conference report requires public \n     reporting of all delayed notice warrants.\n\n\n                 section 206: multipoint wiretap orders\n\n       Many, including myself, have discussed the need for changes \n     to Section 206 of the PATRIOT Act, which authorizes \n     multipoint or ``roving'' wiretap orders. I think the \n     conference report successfully meets that need. The ability \n     of the Justice Department to obtain multipoint wiretaps is in \n     part a result of changes in communications technology that \n     have made the use of cell phones ubiquitous. Terrorists have \n     taken advantage of those changes to cover their tracks by \n     using multiple phones.\n       Borrowing elements from both the House and Senate bills, \n     the conference report limits the use of roving wiretaps to \n     those cases in which the FBI includes in its application a \n     ``specific'' description of the target and ``specific facts \n     in the application'' that show the target's actions may \n     thwart surveillance efforts. Further, the conference report \n     adopts the Senate bill's requirement that the FBI notify the \n     court within 10 days of moving its surveillance of a target \n     from one telephone number to another. As an additional \n     safeguard, the conference report requires that the FBI report \n     periodically to Congress on its use of the roving wiretap \n     authority. Finally, like the Senate bill, the conference \n     report includes a four-year sunset for Section 206 so that \n     Congress will revisit this provision in the near future. I \n     believe these important modifications will go far in \n     preventing abuse of this provision.\n       Much of the criticism has really involved complaints about \n     the current PATRIOT Act without understanding the \n     improvements in the conference report. Numerous hearings have \n     determined that the PATRIOT Act has not been subject to \n     abuse. But in order to promote public confidence, the \n     conference report includes significant changes that will \n     enhance oversight by the Congress, the judiciary and the \n     public at large. The conference report represents a balanced \n     compromise designed to maintain our ability to investigate--\n     and hopefully preempt--terrorist attacks, while ensuring that \n     the rights enshrined in our Constitution are not violated.\n           Very truly yours,\n                                                    Arlen Specter.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. The schedule which is currently anticipated is that the \nHouse of Representatives will take up this bill and vote on Wednesday \nand the Senate will take up a motion to proceed to vote on Wednesday. \nThere is talk of a filibuster. Whatever Senators choose to exercise \nwhatever rights they have, we will see, but I thought it would be \nuseful in talking to a number of colleagues today, the request was made \nto see something in the Congressional Record which goes into some \ndetail in hitting the hot spots, but I add to my colleagues who may be \nlistening or staffers of my colleagues who may be listening or who may \nread this in the Congressional Record which will be in print today, my \nstaff and I are ready, willing, and able to elaborate further on the \nsubstance of the conference report. This report has been the subject of \nnegotiations between the House and Senate for weeks and has consumed \nall of last week.\n  I thank the staffs on both the House and the Senate for \nextraordinarily diligent work, working around the clock. This was a \nfull-time venture for me, personally, and other Members for the past \nmany days. We have moved ahead because this bill expires on December \n31. For those who want to reargue it and relitigate it and reconsider \nit, it will not get any better. If we go back to conference, were that \ncourse to be followed, there are a lot of limitations in the wings that \ncould be added. With only that one provision about the conclusive \npresumption having been an issue, and it having been in the Senate bill \nwhich, again I repeat, we were misinformed about and the vast \nimprovements on the issues we have mentioned, it is a bill that ought \nto be accepted so we can move on.\n  We have a very heavy schedule in the Judiciary Committee. When we \nreturn in early January before the Senate goes into session, we have \nthe confirmation hearings of Judge Alito for the Supreme Court \nscheduled on the 9th of January. We then have scheduled as the first \nitem of legislative business asbestos reform when we go back into \nsession on the 23rd. The first item of legislative business will be \navailable on January 24. Then we have the issue of immigration reform, \nwhich is very high on the agenda. We have backing up the matter of \nreporters' privilege or reporters' shield and a long list of items of \nother confirmation proceedings to take up the time of the Judiciary \nCommittee.\n  I invite my colleagues' careful consideration, and I repeat the \navailability of staff and myself personally to answer any questions or \nmake any elaborations.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/12/12/senate-section/article/S13443-1", "month": "12", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13443-S13444]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            HUMAN RIGHTS DAY\n\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, in recognition of Human Rights Day on \nDecember 10, I rise to pay tribute to some of the bravest human rights \nadvocates in this hemisphere Cubans who have dared to raise their \nvoices to protest a regime they rightfully see as antidemocratic and \nharshly repressive.\n  Cuba is the only country in the Western Hemisphere that has not held \ndemocratic elections in recent decades. Fidel Castro has served as \ndictator for\n\n[[Page S13444]]\n\nover four decades, and his regime does not permit free speech or free \nenterprise. What is particularly reprehensible is the treatment Castro \ndoles out to those who desire freedom on the island.\n  This week, the EU will present its Sakharov Prize for Freedom of \nThought to the Ladies in White, the mothers and wives of Cuban \npolitical prisoners who hold peaceful demonstrations each Sunday to \nprotest the imprisonment of their husbands and sons, some for more than \n20 years, for political reasons. I extend my congratulations to these \nworthy award recipients and to the Sakharov Prize selection committee \nfor their continuing attention to Cuba.\n  Three years ago, the same prize was awarded to Oswaldo Paya, \norganizer of the Varela Project, which seeks a referendum on open \nelections, freedom of speech, freedom for political prisoners, and free \nenterprise. Despite the imprisonment of more than 50 organizers and \ncontinuous government harassment, the Varela Project continues to \ngather more signatures. To date, more than 35,000 ordinary Cubans have \nsigned the petition at great personal risk and joined a historic \nnational grassroots movement. Mr. Paya also continues to work with \nother dissidents to plan for Cuba's transition to democracy. I have met \nwith Mr. Paya and found him to be an extraordinary individual.\n  All this is happening in a context of increasing demands for freedom \nby the Cuban people. This year's edition of the report entitled ``Steps \nto Freedom'' by the Miami-based Directorio chronicled 1,805 acts of \nnonviolent civil protest and 1,371 vigils for the freedom of political \nprisoners throughout Cuba, including one major conference on May 20. \nThis represents a significant increase since the first such report in \n1997, which found only 44 acts of civil protest, all of which were \nlimited to Havana only. The increasing courage of the Cuban people to \nstand up for their human rights is all the more remarkable since it is \nhappening in the midst of continuing arrests and ``actos de repudio'' \norganized by the Castro government.\n  In 2003, I traveled to Cuba with an open mind about U.S. trade and \ntravel policy. During my trip I was touched by the stories I heard of \npeople imprisoned for such ``crimes'' as opening a library, belonging \nto an independent trade union, or being members of Doctors Without \nBorders. Since that trip, I have come to believe that supporting those \nwho are working for freedom is the single most important policy we can \nespouse toward Cuba.\n  Democracy in Cuba is not something the United States can or should \nimpose. What we can do is support the efforts of the Cuban people to \nachieve their God-given right to live in a free society. On this Human \nRights Day, I salute the Ladies in White, Mr. Paya, and all the other \nCubans working for human rights and freedom in their country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/12/12/senate-section/article/S13444-1", "month": "12", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13444-S13445]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             WORLD AIDS DAY\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today, on World AIDS Day, to \nremember the 20 million people who have died as a result of the largest \npandemic in human history and with the hope that the 40 million people \nworldwide who are currently living in the shadow of this devastating \nillness will not be added to the list of lives lost.\n  The human immunodeficiency virus, HIV, is a certain and silent \nkiller, decimating entire generations, crippling continents, and \norphaning as many children as the populations of Los Angeles, Chicago, \nand New York City combined.\n  While scientific advances promise new hope for so many, we are still \nfar from winning the war on this deadly virus much more must be done.\n  AIDS was first identified in the United States in Los Angeles in \n1981.\n  In that year, as mayor of San Francisco, I allocated $180,000 for the \ntreatment of this disease. By the time I left the mayor's office in \n1988, funds allocated for AIDS programs in San Francisco had grown to \nover $20 million, more than that of the Federal Government. At that \ntime, the crisis had exploded. AIDS cases reported in the United States \nhad ballooned exponentially from 189 in 1981 to a staggering 32,311.\n  Today, there are over 1 million Americans living with HIV, and the \ndamage this disease continues to inflict across the globe is shocking.\n  Worldwide, some 40 million people are living with HIV; 95 percent of \nthose 40 million reside in developing nations. Tragically, only 12 \npercent of those infected are able to access the antiretroviral drugs \nneeded to significantly extend and improve the quality of their lives.\n  It costs an estimated $300 per person per year to purchase the drugs \nto treat someone with HIV in the developing world, which is less than \none dollar per day. As Americans, it is imperative that we acknowledge \nthe AIDS crisis and its causes both globally and locally but our \ncurrent efforts are simply not enough.\n  Sub-Saharan Africa, for example, accounts for only 10 percent of the \nglobal population but is home to 60 to 70 percent of the worlds \nreported cases of HIV. Those infected in the region comprise some 25 \nmillion of the 40 million people worldwide stricken with the disease.\n  In Botswana, a staggering 39 percent of the entire population is HIV \npositive, and the average life expectancy for a baby born in 2010 will \nbe 27 years a figure not seen since the end of the 19th century.\n  Although some countries have been remarkably proactive in preventing \nthe spread of the virus, HIV remains rampant in others. In most \ncountries, women are disproportionately affected by HIV, in some \nAfrican nations outnumbering men by more than a 3 to 1 margin.\n  Sadly, our plight in America continues as well. New advances in \nantiretroviral drugs show promise in helping many, but AIDS remains an \nincurable, fatal disease. Especially disconcerting in this country are \nthe disproportionate numbers of minorities and gay men contracting HIV.\n  African-American women comprise some 72 percent all women diagnosed \nwith HIV in the United States. While African Americans make up only 12 \npercent of the American population, they account for about 40 percent \nof AIDS cases diagnosed since the pandemic began.\n  Perhaps most disturbing, a recent study revealed that 46 percent of \nBlack gay men tested were HIV positive, and of those tested, two-thirds \nwere unaware of their status.\n  In my home State of California, 45 percent of Los Angeles nursing \nhomes reported that they would not provide treatment for an HIV-\npositive patient, and one-third of the city's OBGYNs would refuse to \ntreat a mother with HIV.\n  As a Senator representing the State with the second-highest \ncumulative number of persons living with AIDS in the United States, I \nhave taken a proactive approach to securing funding for those who so \ndesperately need help battling this disease by consistently supporting \nincreased funding and reauthorization of the Ryan White CARE Act.\n  I have been a cosponsor of the Early Treatment for HIV Act since the \n107th Congress, legislation that would ensure low-income HIV patients \nreceive access to antiretroviral drugs from Medicaid before their \nimmune systems are crippled by the disease.\n  Additionally, I have been a cosponsor of the Microbicide Development \nAct since the 107th Congress, a bill to expand, intensify, and \ncoordinate research and development of microbicides to prevent the \ntransmission of HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases. Today's \nprevention options such as condoms and mutual monogamy are not feasible \nfor millions of people around the world, especially women. Many women \nlack the social or economic power to insist their partners use condoms. \nMicrobicides are user-controlled products in the form of gels, creams, \nor films that kill or inactivate the bacteria and viruses that cause \nHIV/AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases and their use empowers \nwomen to protect themselves from contracting this disease.\n  To combat AIDS in the developing world, I cosponsored the Kennedy-\nFeinstein-Feingold Amendment to Help Fight HIV/AIDS, urging developing \ncountries to use compulsory licensing to greatly increase the amount of \nsafe, generic drugs made available to HIV/AIDS patients.\n  I also authored an amendment to strike language requiring that one-\nthird of funding from the President's Global HIV/AIDs initiative go to \n``abstinence until marriage'' programs to\n\n[[Page S13445]]\n\nensure that our prevention dollars use the comprehensive ``ABC'' \napproach, Abstinence, Be Faithful, use Condoms to prevent the spread of \nHIV.\n  In the 24 years since AIDS was first diagnosed, America and the world \nhave made tremendous strides in battling HIV. The average life \nexpectancy of someone infected with HIV has risen dramatically since \nthe disease was first identified. Despite our best efforts, the war on \nAIDS is still not won. Even the most optimistic estimates predict a \nvaccine may be another 10 years away. As Americans, we must do \neverything in our power to expedite the defeat of this disease.\n  I urge my fellow senators and the Bush administration to do \neverything in their power to find a cure for the AIDS pandemic and \nadequately fund research and treatment of HIV/AIDS. While our efforts \nhave been great, the toll AIDS has taken on the world has been far \ngreater.\n  It is my hope that our unwavering dedication to helping the countless \nvictims of HIV/AIDS will continue well beyond World AIDS Day. It should \nbe our goal to band together to work to find the cure for this deadly \nillness which transcends gender, race, and nationality.\n  On this day, I encourage people around the world to take time to \nponder the vast scope of the AIDS pandemic, and remember those we have \nlost. But let us not remember them in sorrow but, rather, let their \nmemory inspire our efforts to prevent any further devastation from this \nvirus. Amidst our many domestic and international problems, let us \nremember that AIDS has cruelly cut short tens of millions of lives, \nmore than that of any warlord, dictator, or natural disaster in human \nhistory. This disease has ravaged a continent, orphaned innumerable \nchildren, and torn apart entire communities. Millions more will die of \nAIDS this year, and millions more, including newborn infants, will \nbecome infected. Until the day when this virus no longer threatens the \nlives of millions of innocent people, we all must pledge to keep this \nfight alive.\n  It is our responsibility as representatives of the people to take \naction now to eradicate this deadly disease. Each day we wait is \nanother day when someone's loved one will fall victim to this virus. \nSilence is approval, and it is our duty to raise our voices for those \nwhose voices have been silenced. It is our duty to further the strides \ntaken since the first case was diagnosed in 1981, so our generation can \ncelebrate the day when the last case is cured. As I have said before, \n``I was there in the beginning, and I plan to be there in the end.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/12/12/senate-section/article/S13445-1", "month": "12", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13445]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n     HONORING THE COMMUNITY HARVEST FOOD BANK OF NORTHEAST INDIANA\n\n Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a \nremarkable organization in my home State, the Community Harvest Food \nBank of Northeast Indiana. Each night, nearly 600,000 Hoosiers go to \nbed hungry, including 190,000 children. The numbers are heartbreaking, \nparticularly during the holiday season, but thanks to the Community \nHarvest Food Bank of Northeast Indiana, our State is making strides to \nend this terrible tragedy.\n  The Community Harvest Food Bank of Northeast Indiana has been a \nleader in the efforts to eliminate hunger across Indiana. Each year, \nCommunity Harvest collects and distributes more than 7 million pounds \nof donated surplus food through a network of more than 550 social \nservice agencies. Each of these agencies offers invaluable assistance \nto hungry children, the working poor, and the elderly and helps ensure \nthat every Hoosier has access to a healthy meal. Recently, the \norganization was named the 2005 Food Bank of the Year by America's \nSecond Harvest--an honor never before awarded to an Indiana food bank. \nThis award recognizes the hard work, dedication, energy, and efficiency \nof the organization, as well as its inspired leadership under Jane \nAvery.\n  With Jane at the helm, Community Harvest has achieved organizational \nexcellence, while continuing to do God's work, making sure that all our \nneighbors are cared for and fed. One of the lessons I learned from my \nparents was that life is not about what you take out of it, but what \nyou put back in. Jane lives that sentiment to the fullest every day. \nHer work has made Indiana a better place to live for all of us.\n  This year has been particularly hard on many Hoosier families and \ncommunities, making the work of Community Harvest especially critical. \nBusinesses across the State have suffered layoffs, and families have \nlost their homes in recent tornados and storms, all while gas and \nheating prices have continued to increase. The Community Harvest Food \nBank allows families to stretch their budget further, so they don't \nhave to face the impossible decision of choosing between paying bills \nand putting food on the table. Each week, between 50,000 and 54,000 \nchildren and adults in 9 counties in Indiana are able to sit down to a \nhot meal because of Community Harvest's work.\n  It is part of the fabric of life in Indiana that we all look out for \nour neighbors, aiding them through tough times and celebrating in good \ntimes. The Community Harvest Food Bank of Northeast Indiana is the kind \nof organization that keeps the Hoosier tradition of compassion alive \nand makes me proud to be a Hoosier.\n  It is my great honor to recognize Jane Avery and the Community \nHarvest Food Bank of Northeast Indiana for their service to the State \nof Indiana.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/12/12/senate-section/article/S13445-2", "month": "12", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13445]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             CONGRATULATING MASON CORINTH ELEMENTARY SCHOOL\n\n Mr. BUNNING.

And this \nepidemic is not only hurting our waistlines, but also our pocketbooks. \nIn 2003, over $1.1 billion was spent by Kentuckians on health problems \ncaused by obesity. That is why programs which promote healthy living, \nsuch as FFLAG, are so important for the future of our Commonwealth.\n  Performance Pipe Manufacturing is a shining example of how our \nKentucky businesses can help Kentuckians lead better, healthier lives.\n  I congratulate Performance Pipe Manufacturing on this achievement. \nThe employees of Performance Pipe Manufacturing are an inspiration to \nall of Kentucky.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/12/12/senate-section/article/S13446-2", "month": "12", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13446]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   IN MEMORY OF DR. JOHN V. WEHAUSEN\n\n Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to honor a \npioneering scientist and mathematician--Dr. John V. Wehausen. \nConsidered one of the world's leading researchers in the field of \nhydrodynamics, Professor Wehausen passed away on October 6 of this \nyear. I wish to send my sincerest condolences to his family, friends, \nand colleagues.\n  A professor emeritus of engineering science at the University of \nCalifornia, Berkeley, Dr. Wehausen left behind a monumental body of \nwork and vast pioneering contributions to a number of academic fields. \nSome of his work, now decades old, still remains an important resource \nfor scholars and students.\n  Professor Wehausen was born in Duluth, MN, and grew up in the suburbs \nof Chicago. He matriculated at the University of Michigan where he \nearned B.S. and Ph.D. degrees in mathematics as well as an M.S. in \nphysics.\n  He left Ann Arbor for Brown University in Rhode Island where he not \nonly began a long and prestigious teaching career, but also met his \nwife, Mary Katherine Wertime. Ms. Wehausen preceded her husband in \ndeath in 2001 after 62 years of marriage.\n  After Brown, Professor Wehausen spent teaching stints at Columbia \nUniversity and the University of Missouri before working for the U.S. \nNavy during World War II in operations analysis and research and \ndevelopment.\n  In 1956, Professor Wehausen accepted a position at the University of \nCalifornia, Berkeley, where he taught until 1984 and where he remained \nan active researcher thereafter. Shortly after arriving at UC-Berkeley, \nProfessor Wehausen helped form the Department of Naval Architecture, \none of the first programs of its kind in the Nation.\n  During the decades he spent at UC-Berkeley, Professor Wehausen not \nonly produced volumes of influential scholarship but also garnered a \nreputation as a faculty member who respected and cared for his \nstudents. A respect reciprocated by his many students.\n  More than a prodigious researcher and instructor, Professor Wehausen \nheld a great love for languages, music, and literature. He gained \nproficiency in a number of languages and also was an accomplished \nmusician.\n  Professor Wehausen has left behind a great legacy of scholarship. His \nmany awards testify to his abilities and his determination. Among his \nmany honors were the Davidson Medal from the Society of Naval \nArchitects and Marine Engineers, an honorary doctorate degree from the \nJoseph Fourier University in France, and the International Lifetime \nAchievement Award from the American Society of Mechanical Engineers.\n  His four children all live in my home State of California, and I send \nthem my deepest condolences at the passing of their father. Professor \nWehausen made monumental contributions to the fields of math and \nscience, and the influence of his life's work will surely live on for \nmany generations to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/12/12/senate-section/article/S13446-3", "month": "12", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13446]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF NORMAN SCARBOROUGH\n\n Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize Mr. \nNorman Scarborough of Clinton, SC, who has been named the South \nCarolina Professor of the Year by the Council for Advancement and \nSupport of Education, CASE. The Professor of the Year awards are the \nonly national awards that recognize college and university professors \nfor excellence in undergraduate teaching and mentoring. Professor \nScarborough is to be commended for this exceptional honor, and I wish \nto extend my personal congratulations.\n  Professor Scarborough is currently a member of the Department of \nEconomics and Business Administration at Presbyterian College in \nClinton, where he has served since 1979. He teaches classes on business \nlaw, small business management, management information systems, and \nbusiness statistics. Professor Scarborough has numerous publications \nhaving either authored or coauthored 7 books and 6 papers on everything \nfrom economic development to the Internet. His professional and \nscholarly affiliations include Phi Kappa Phi, the American Management \nAcademy, the United States Association of Small Business \nEntrepreneurship, and the Society for the Advancement of Management. \nProfessor Scarborough also founded the student business club at \nPresbyterian College.\n  In the classroom, Professor Scarborough is known for his preparation \nand enthusiasm. He prides himself on encouraging his students to think \ncritically about his lessons instead of simply memorizing them. \nProfessor Scarborough also emphasizes the practical application of the \nsubjects he teaches, preaching to his students about how his lessons \ncan be used in life.\n  Professor Scarborough has garnered the personal and professional \nrespect of his students, colleagues, and neighbors. He is well-\ndeserving of recognition for his efforts and work. I commend Professor \nScarborough, the South Carolina Professor of the Year, for his award \nand wish him great success in his future.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/12/12/senate-section/article/S13447-1", "month": "12", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13447]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S13447]]\n                          HONORING HUGH SIDEY\n\n Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, on November 21, America lost a great \njournalist and a wonderful human being when Hugh Sidey passed away at \nthe age of 78. Hugh Sidey was a man I admired and read for many, many \nyears. He was an observer of the world and a preeminent chronicler of \nour times. It was one of the great joys of my life that since coming to \nthe Senate 9 years ago, I had the opportunity, from time to time, to \nsit-down with Hugh Sidey and get his sense of the world. He understood \nthe intricacies of politics and policy but, more than that, he \nunderstood the human dynamic of our business. He understood people.\n  Hugh Sidey approached the world with a Midwestern sensibility and a \nsimple decency. Raised in a newspaper family in Greenfield, IA, he \nlearned his craft at the Omaha World-Herald among other stops early in \nhis career. At Time Magazine he covered every American President from \nDwight Eisenhower to George W. Bush. He understood politics and the \npresidency because he understood America. In a 1979 Time Magazine \nPresidency column, Hugh Sidey said this about our political system:\n\n       Politics, when all is said and done, is a business of \n     belief and enthusiasm. Hope energizes, doubt destroys. \n     Hopelessness is not our heritage.\n\n  That observation hangs on the wall of my Senate office. In three \nsimple sentences, Hugh Sidey summed up what is good about our country \nand what American politics can be at its best.\n  President Gerald Ford paid an eloquent tribute to the life and legacy \nof Hugh Sidey in a November 26th Washington Post op-ed. Mr. President, \nI submit President Ford's tribute to this great American for the \nCongressional Record. America will miss Hugh Sidey.\n  The tribute follows.\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Nov. 26, 2005]\n\n              The Friendship, and Toughness, of Hugh Sidey\n\n                          (By Gerald R. Ford)\n\n       It wasn't supposed to be this way. Like most men my age, I \n     have given a thought or two to my funeral. As a former \n     president, I'm almost required to, since the military \n     periodically updates its plans, and each presidential family \n     is solicited for personal touches. Among these is a choice of \n     eulogists. Thus it was, a few months ago, that I called Hugh \n     Sidey.\n       We'd known each other forever, Hugh coming to Washington \n     just a few years after the voters of Michigan's 5th \n     Congressional District sent me there. Maybe it was our shared \n     Midwestern background, his transparent decency or the tough \n     but fair coverage he accorded me and nine other American \n     presidents; in any event, I had always regarded Hugh as a \n     friend. So I asked him if he would do me the honor of \n     speaking at Washington's National Cathedral when the time \n     came.\n       I did so in part for symbolic reasons. I like reporters, \n     even if I haven't always liked what some wrote about me. I \n     figure that's a pretty minor price to pay for a free press in \n     a free society. But I also hoped to remind people in our \n     often overheated era that it is possible for a politician and \n     a journalist to enjoy mutual respect, admiration and, yes, \n     friendship, all the while understanding the necessarily \n     adversarial relationship that often exists between those in \n     power and those who report on their activities.\n       Hugh Sidey died this week at the age of 78. Anyone who read \n     him knew America's presidents. Anyone who knew him knew \n     America. In a very real sense, he never left Greenfield, \n     Iowa, where four generations of Sideys practiced journalism \n     with integrity and the perspective that laughter uniquely \n     supplies. ``A sense of humor . . . is needed armor,'' he once \n     wrote of the presidency. ``Joy in one's heart and some \n     laughter on one's lips is a sign that the person down deep \n     has a pretty good grasp on life.''\n       Hugh had a sure grasp of life. An insider who never forgot \n     those on the outside, he was warm and wise about Washington \n     and its rituals. He appreciated Woodrow Wilson's observation \n     that men who arrive in our nation's capital--presidents \n     included--have a tendency to either grow or swell. But he was \n     incapable of cynicism. Hugh scored more than, his share of \n     scoops, but along with the ability to pierce official secrecy \n     went an empathy that enabled him to see the White House and \n     its occupants first and always as very human beings.\n       Whether reporting of the U-2 crisis, the Missiles of \n     October or the 22nd of November; Vietnam or Watergate; \n     Richard Nixon's opening to China, or Jimmy Carter's high-risk \n     diplomacy at Camp David; Ronald Reagan's years of renewal; \n     the tumult of the '90s followed by the shattering events of \n     Sept. 11--Hugh put readers at the center of events. At the \n     same time, he made it possible for millions who might never \n     visit the White House to experience it, in good and not so \n     good times, through a President's eyes and ears.\n       Over the years he became something of a Washington \n     institution himself, seemingly as much a part of the \n     presidency as Air Force One or Camp David. Yet he never \n     behaved like an institution, and I suspect he never stopped \n     pinching himself over his extraordinary good fortune.\n       For his friends, and they are legion, the good fortune was \n     to know and learn from and simply enjoy Hugh's company. Now \n     he is forever part of the old house whose history he brought \n     to life. Hugh not only explained Washington to the rest of \n     America; by being the kind of person, he was, no less than by \n     setting the highest of journalistic standards, Hugh Sidey \n     also embodied the best of America in Washington.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/12/12/senate-section/article/S13447-2", "month": "12", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13447]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      CONGRATULATING THE MASSACHUSETTS LATINO CHAMBER OF COMMERCE\n\n Mr. KERRY.

A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nprohibit physicians and other health care practitioners from charging a \nmembership or other incidental fee (or requiring purchase of other \nitems or services) as a prerequisite for the provision of an item or \nservice to a medicare beneficiary; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the \nEqual Access to Medicare Act of 2005 to combat the growing practice of \nhealth care often called ``concierge'' medicine. As my colleagues may \nrecall I introduced similar legislation in the past two sessions of \nCongress to deal with the growing problem of doctors shutting down \ntheir practices and opening new ones, only accepting those patients \nwilling to pay a membership fee. These fees range from $60 to $15,000 \nannually. By charging these extraneous and unwarranted dues or \nrequiring patients to purchase non-Medicare covered services, doctors \ncan shrink their practices, maintain a high profit margin, and continue \nbilling Medicare, all on the backs of low and middle-income \nbeneficiaries.\n  This is a dangerous model that causes significant disparities in the \ncare available to Medicare beneficiaries. A doctor receiving Medicare \nreimbursement should not be allowed to turn away Medicare beneficiaries \nwho cannot or choose not to pay membership fees or fees for other non-\nMedicare covered services. My bill simply prevents Medicare from \nproviding payments to doctors who charge their patients membership fees \nor any other incidental or extraneous fees, or who require the purchase \nof non-Medicare covered services as a condition for the provision of \nMedicare covered services.\n  Since the introduction of this bill in 2001, the practice has been \nexpanding with versions in many States. According to a recent GAO \nreport, the number of physicians practicing concierge medicine has \nincreased by more than 10 times in the past 5 years. As an increasing \nnumber of Medicare beneficiaries voice their concerns, it is time for \nCongress to act. Should this practice proliferate, a doctor shortage \nfor low and middle-income Medicare beneficiaries is likely, \nexacerbating an already ailing health care marketplace.\n  I must emphasize that this bill does not interfere with the ability \nof doctors to limit the size of their practices or to be adequately \ncompensated; it simply applies the same standard private insurance \ncompanies apply to their providers--that doctors may not select \npatients based upon willingness or ability to pay an entrance fee.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me in helping Medicare keep its \npromise of accessibility to seniors who have paid a lifetime of \n``premiums.''\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2080\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the USA PATRIOT Act to extend the sunset of \ncertain provisions of that Act and the lone wolf provision of the \nIntelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 to March 31, \n2006; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, On a September morning 4 years ago nearly \n3,000 lives were lost on American soil, and our lives as Americans \nchanged in an instant. In the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks, Congress \nmoved swiftly to pass anti-terrorism legislation. The fires were still \nsmoldering at Ground Zero in New York City when the USA PATRIOT Act \nbecame law on October 30, 2001, just 6 weeks after the attacks.\n  Many of us here in the Senate today worked together in a spirit of \nbipartisan unity and resolve to craft a bill that we had hoped would \nmake us safer as a nation. Freedom and security are always in tension \nin our society, and especially so in those somber weeks after the \nattacks, and we tried our best to strike the right balance.\n  One of the fruits of that bipartisanship was the PATRIOT Act's sunset \nprovisions. These key provisions set an expiration date of December 31, \n2005, on certain government powers that had great potential to affect \nthe civil liberties of the American people. Republican House Majority \nLeader Dick Armey and I insisted on these sunsets to ensure that \nCongress would revisit the PATRIOT Act within a few years and consider \nrefinements to protect the rights and liberties of all Americans more \neffectively, and we prevailed.\n  Sadly, the Bush administration and the Republican congressional \nleadership have squandered key opportunities to improve the PATRIOT \nAct. The House-Senate conference report filed last week by Republican \nlawmakers falls short of what the American people expect and deserve \nfrom us. The bipartisan Senate bill, which the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee and then the Senate adopted unanimously, struck a far better \nbalance.\n  The reauthorization of the PATRIOT Act must have the confidence of \nthe American people. The Congress should not rush ahead to enact flawed \nlegislation to meet a deadline that is within our power to extend. We \nowe it to the American people to get this right.\n  The way forward to a sensible and workable bipartisan bill is clear. \nToday I am pleased to join with Senator Sununu and others to introduce \na bill to extend the sunsets on the expiring PATRIOT Act powers until \nMarch 31, 2006. Our bill also extends for three\n\n[[Page S13454]]\n\nmonths the so-called ``lone wolf'' FISA surveillance authority, which \nCongress enacted last year as part the Intelligence Reform and \nTerrorism Prevention Act.\n  The deadline that Congress imposed to ensure oversight and \naccountability should not now become a barrier to achieving bipartisan \ncompromise and the best bill we can forge together. This is a vital \ndebate, and these are vital issues to all Americans. If a brief \nextension is needed to produce a better bill that will better serve all \nof our citizens, then by all means, let us give ourselves that time. I \nask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2082\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I, along with Senator Talent, \nproudly submit a resolution recognizing May 20, 2006 as, ``Negro \nLeaguers Recognition Day.''\n  Since 1885, long before Major League Baseball was integrated in 1947, \nAfrican Americans were organizing their own professional leagues. These \nleagues did not succeed because of racial prejudice and lack of \nadequate financial backing. However, this changed dramatically with the \ninception of the first successful Negro league. On May 20, 1920, the \nNegro National League played its first game. Its creation was the \nresult of the efforts of an African American player and manager named \nAndrew ``Rube'' Foster. Mr. Foster's success inspired the formation of \nother leagues.\n  As a result, on October 3, 1924, the first Negro League World Series \ngame was played between the Kansas City Monarchs of the Negro National \nLeague and Hilldale of Philadelphia of the Eastern Colored League. This \nhistoric and exhaustive first series lasted ten games, covered a span \nof almost three weeks, and was played in four different cities. In the \nend, Kansas City claimed the championship.\n  But the lasting legacy of the Negro leagues, as the six separate \nleagues between 1920 and 1960 are collectively known, are the \ntremendous baseball players they produced. Some of the names we know \nand some we don't. Among them is Jackie Robinson, the first African \nAmerican to break the\n\n[[Page S13455]]\n\nbaseball color barrier; Leroy ``Satchel'' Paige, who was considered one \nof the greatest pitchers of all time; Josh Gibson, who was a prolific \nhome-run hitter; Larry Doby, the first African American to play in the \nAmerican League in July 1947; and John Jordan ``Buck'' O'Neil, who was \nthe first African American coach in the Major Leagues and who is now \nhead of the Negro Leagues Baseball Museum.\n  It is important that we remember and honor these players. In breaking \ndown the baseball color barrier, these pioneers dealt a blow to hatred \nand prejudice across America. Today, we can honor them by declaring May \n20, 2006 as, ``Negro Leaguers Recognition Day.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/12/12/senate-section/article/S13455-1", "month": "12", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13455]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AUTHORITIES FOR COMMITTEES TO MEET\n\n\n           Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation\n\n  Mr. THOMAS.
